XBT Provider AB released a statement outlining its plans ahead of what could be a split in the bitcoin blockchain on August 1, one pursued by the proponents of an alternative implementation called Bitcoin Cash. The first of two ETNs launched by XBT Provider went live in mid-2015 following approval by the Swedish government.  The firm said that, as the ETN holders don't actually possess any bitcoin, they won't be directly affected. But XBT Provider said it is moving proactively to protect the bitcoin holdings that the ETN tracks, steps which include safeguarding the assets themselves in the event of a chain split.  ""The Guarantor's group companies have moved as much of their bitcoins held on account as is practicable in the circumstances to custodian infrastructure that will support both coins should a new coin result from the anticipated fork,"" the company stated.  Ultimately, the firm said it will align with whichever chain the market deems to be ""bitcoin"", explaining:  ""The Issuer wishes to further clarify that its Certificates are designed to track ""bitcoin"" and not any alternative coin which results from a forking event and which shared a common transaction history prior to the fork. Therefore, the Issuer's Certificates will, after a fork, be referenced to the coin which the bitcoin community and exchanges define, and consider to be, 'bitcoin'.""  This approach isn't set in stone, however, as XBT Provider will undertake a three-month observation period, during which it will wait and see which chain comes to attract the most support.

42379648,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KNzl,1501274708,$25 Million: Blockchain Startup Tierion Completes ICO for TNT Token,"Blockchain startup Tierion has completed its previously announced token sale, raising $25 million.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, Tierion launched its ethereum-based Tierion Network Token (TNT) as part of a bid to support the network effects of its Chainpoint protocol. The sale was launched yesterday with an initial closing date of August 10.  According to its website, the TNT sale raised a total of $25,032,609, slightly surpassing its stated goal.  In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this month, Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan explained that the token is aimed at offsetting the costs of running the server clusters associated with the network that then anchor data to either the bitcoin or ethereum blockchains.  Ultimately, according to Vaughan, the process of anchoring data through the network will require payment in the TNT tokens (though these costs are being deferred for the time being).  The sale's launch and subsequent closure comes just days after a major release from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  On Tuesday, the agency published the results of an investigation into The DAO, the smart contract-based funding vehicle that collapsed last summer following a debilitating code exploit. The project sold more than $100m worth of tokens at then-current ether prices – digital assets that the SEC ultimately deemed a security.

CoinMarketCap's Bitcoin Dominance Index has climbed as high as 51.62% today, the site reports. The last time this metric was above the 50% mark was on May 27.  Back in early March, the dominance index was above 80%, though it began to decline over the following months as prices increased in other cryptocurrency markets, falling below 40% last month. At press time, the index is at 51%.  Market data suggests that the index shift is being spurred by a rise in the price of bitcoin and declines for some of the world's other major cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is up more than 3% since the day's open, trading at about $2,791 after markets hit a high of $2,833.24, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). By comparison, ether prices are down nearly 5% on the day, trading at around $194.

42379651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KO3X,1501250707,Why Are Miners Involved in Bitcoin Code Changes Anyway?,"Developers, startups, miners ... all have played a role in bitcoin's technical debates. But if you've been following, you may have noticed the attention being paid to whether miners are ""signaling"" for various proposals.  Before we dive into what that means, it helps to understand that the term ""miners"" actually relates to a diverse group of people.  First, all miners develop, build or deploy the specialized computers designed to compete (or help others compete) for network rewards, and in the process, help move bitcoins from person to person. The role may sound mundane, but there are concerns that miners have, or may one day have, too much power over network decision-making.  Since some argue that it was originally envisioned that every bitcoin user would help secure the network – as opposed to massive companies – miners have long been the subject of the less-than-trusting imaginations of the network's users and security-conscious developers.  With just about 20 mining pools out there, some controlling large chunks of the underlying computer power, there are long-held fears that they could potentially conspire to attack the network and, as a result, reduce confidence in bitcoin as a secure and stable online currency.  Complicating matters is that, over time, miners have also developed a secondary role: helping bitcoin add new technical features. And, similarly, users have grown to worry that this position could be abused.  Indeed, you could argue that the group contributed to recent uncertainty about bitcoin's future. With several competing proposals on the table, there were many different ways this summer's code changes could have unfolded, and miners were integral to each.  At points, it even felt like their approval of the change was the sole thing keeping bitcoin from splitting into two competing blockchains. (It's worth noting that some miners might even end up doing just that).  This game was on full display last week when mining pools began signaling support for an upgrade earlier than expected. One mining pool began embedding information in blocks indicating it would follow through on an action, then a flood of others joined. It wasn't long before all miners were on board.  Users cheered on social media while keeping track of the blocks left to upgrade by refreshing tracker pages – at least, until the page stopped loading due to overwhelming traffic.  It was a relief. It looked like a split had been all but avoided following a long period of uncertainty.  Explaining upgrades  Like all software, bitcoin needs to make upgrades to fix problems or to add new features. However, in bitcoin's case, the entire distributed network needs to stay in sync.  One way to upgrade the software is what's known as a ""soft fork,"" one way to change the rules that keep all the nodes in the network in agreement.  Soft forks are backwards-compatible changes that don't require all nodes to upgrade. As such, users can ""opt-in"" to the new rules. Node versions from years ago can be used to send money to upgraded nodes, even though they don't follow these new rules.  Now, nodes might not need to upgrade, but at least some mining pools do.  Think of it this way: Mining pools are the ones who mine new blocks of transactions, so they need to accept and follow the new rules in order that the new types of blocks and transactions can actually be added to the blockchain.  Supporting the change  Here, there are a couple of points to keep in mind:  For the soft fork to avoid splitting bitcoin into two assets, at least 51 percent of bitcoin's mining hashrate needs to support the change. Otherwise it will be the ""shortest"" chain with less computing power and its blocks will be rejected by the rest of the mining pools.  It’s hard to know how many mining pools have upgraded to support the change, since it’s not information.  The more miners that support the soft fork, the better. This diminishes the likelihood of certain attacks and network disruption as mining pools shift to the new rules.    In some cases, such as the code change P2SH, this shift to the new soft fork rules occurred via a ""flag day,"" also known as a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF).    A UASF works like this: Developers, nodes and businesses, set a ""day"" (actually a block number) that's, say, six months or a year into the future. At that time, upgraded nodes will enforce the new rules and reject blocks that don't support them.  In theory, mining pools will generally opt to upgrade for fear of losing the block rewards that come with enforcing the rules and adding blocks (worth about $33,000 today).  However, this process hasn't been trouble-free. Some miners haven't been properly prepared in the past, and have lost block rewards in the process.  Because of this, developers developed a system that requires 95 percent of bitcoin's miners to ""signal"" that they are prepared for the change. (The second iteration of this idea, which allows for multiple soft forks to be deployed at once, is Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 9.)  That's why bitcoin mining pools have signaled for soft fork upgrades for the past several years.  Clash of code  A few recent competing scaling proposals have involved mining pools.  Most take the form of what's called a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), and there are many that have been in a state of flux of late. Some even rely on each other in order to bring about changes.  BIP 141, created by developers for users and miners seeks to introduce Segregated Witness (SegWit), uses BIP 9. BIP 141's rules require 95 percent of mining pools to signal support for SegWit before activating the change.  But, unlike older changes, most mining pools didn’t signal support for BIP 141. It stalled at 30 percent of miner support for a while. Some mining pools indicated they did so to negotiate for a 2MB block size parameter increase. Others suggested that some mining pools had an incentive to ""block"" the change to make more money.  (Interestingly, this ""veto power"" is a possibility that some developers raised much earlier.)  Some in the community were not happy that SegWit stalled, believing that BIP 141 would improve bitcoin and that mining pools were overstepping their job description. So, in the hopes of pushing SegWit through, many users and developers rallied around the older ""flag day"" concept, since it doesn't require the ""approval"" of mining pools.  The proposal, BIP 148, is slated for August 1. A majority of mining pools would need to support the change, for the reasons described above.  BIP 91 was ultimately perceived as a sort of compromise between those two changes, one that kept miners in the driver's seat.  The BIP 9 dilemma  While BIP 9 is a recently-introduced mechanism for making upgrades to bitcoin, some developers already want to get rid of it.  Some claim it was intended as a way of protecting miners – so they wouldn't lose their block rewards if a soft fork went through and their blocks were rejected by the rest of miners.  Like some users, some developers don't like that mining pools used the signaling mechanism as a way to stop code changes that otherwise had broad agreement from bitcoin users.  Blockstream developer Rusty Russell, a former Linux kernel developer and one of the creators of BIP 9, went as far as to publicly apologize for his role in creating this possibility.  ""I hadn't expected that this checkpoint would be used as a chokepoint to ransom the network,"" he added before advocating for a UASF.  Future outlook  Given this controversy, what role will miners play in upgrading bitcoin down the road?  It's unclear. BIP 9 had wide support from developers before it prompted political disagreements.  Some developers still seem to favor so-called ""miner-activated soft forks"" as a less disruptive option, but now some developers, such as Russell, seem more inclined to advocate for UASFs.  So, perhaps both options will be on the table for future upgrades.  Whatever the case, miners are important players who will continue to have some influence in future bitcoin code changes.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra handed down the order in the long-running class action lawsuit against the Florida-based cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed in January 2016 after months of growing complaints from customers. The class-action lawsuit was filed shortly afterwards, with the court ultimately moving to place Cryptsy into receivership the following April.  According to Marra's July 27 court order, Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon – who has denied stealing user funds – ""is liable to the Plaintiff Class in the principal sum of $8,200,000, for which let execution issue forthwith.""  Vernon, who is believed to be currently residing somewhere in Asia, did not respond to the allegations in court, a circumstance which led to this week's default judgment.  The order notably states that the more than 11,000 bitcoins taken from the exchange by Vernon are owed to the customers.  ""The Court further declares that the 11,325.0961 [bitcoin] which were stolen from Cryptsy customers on July 29, 2014 and which, as of the date of this final judgment ... are property of the Plaintiff Class and subject to and encompassed within this Final Judgment,"" Marra wrote.

Still, the fluctuations come ahead of what could emerge as a turbulent time for the price.  While bitcoin's long-raging scaling debate may soon reach a conclusion of sorts (with the integration of the Segregated Witness now scheduled for early August), it's not going to be without twists.  For one, the cryptocurrency is about to see the first large-scale fork of its live blockchain, with some miners and businesses vowing to create a separate project called Bitcoin Cash.  Already trading at $300 (though it hasn't been released), it's hard to say exactly how the move may impact prices.  Still, if the project does come to pass, those on either side of the debate may now be able to more easily move the market in their preferred direction, potentially leaving the door open for volatility ahead.

42379662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KOEr,1501234222,Overstock's TØ Has Already Built a Platform for Trading Regulated ICOs,"US retail giant Overstock.com has been waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to tell the world exactly when a crypto token is a security.  Since 2014, the company has been building a regulated, blockchain-powered stock exchange to sell tokenized, compliant securities, and it even sold the first SEC regulated crypto-securities last December.  It was a historic moment, but one that was perhaps just a bit ahead of its time. Since raising $1.9m in a sale of its own shares on the platform, not a peep has been heard on the potential for others to follow suit.  What the tØ founders had hoped would be the dawn of a new era of blockchain securities was cut short by a burgeoning new concept called an initial coin offering (ICO).  Instead of companies raising funds under the watchful gaze of the SEC, ICOs initially promised to cut out platform providers like tØ and regulators altogether. In short, a potential disruption was itself disrupted by an unforeseen technological leap.  TØ president Joseph Cammarata told CoinDesk:  ""We were kind of annoyed when these ICOs started taking off. They weren't getting approval, it was the Wild West. We thought long and hard about doing our own ICO ... But we held off, going down the regulatory road.""  Then, earlier this week, tØ got the news it had been waiting for when the SEC finally published the results of a landmark report in which it clearly laid out its rationale for why some tokens are still securities.  Moreover, the report clarified that, once a token issued in an ICO has been deemed a security, only national securities exchanges like Nasdaq and some alternative trading systems (ATSs) are permitted to be involved in the trading.  It's at this point in the report that Cammarata said tØ expects to find the opportunity it has been waiting for.  From the SEC report:  ""Any entity or person engaging in the activities of an exchange ... must register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration.""  A blockchain ATS  Unveiled at Nasdaq in August 2015, tØ is Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne's concerted effort to get even with Wall Street.  Long a detractor of a practice called ""naked short selling"" – where traders methodically bid down the price of stock by selling shares they haven’t first procured, Byrne set about using blockchain to cut out everyone who stood in the way of buyers and sellers.  But as a subsidiary of the publicly traded Overstock.com, which was itself the victim of an allegedhttps://www.law360.com/topnews/articles/752448/merrill-pays-20m-to-settle-overstock-s-short-selling-suit naked short selling scheme, Byrne would have to beat the system from within.  Following on a series of acquisitions by Overstock, tØ had obtained a coveted ATS license along with a number of potentially valuable connections with national securities exchanges, sell-side management systems, and more.  So it was, that way back in December 2015, the same regulatory body that published its guidance earlier this week approved Byrne's plan to issue legally compliant blockchain securities.  ""We're uniquely positioned in that we're already approved for the ATS,"" said Cammarata, who joined the company after his equity order routing company, SpeedRoute, was acquired by Overstock.  He continued:  ""We're also integrated in every single US equities exchange. So if they want to trade on a national exchange we’re already interconnected.""  Regulated ICOs  Since Overstock sold the first ever SEC-regulated blockchain shares, the idea of removing middlemen from within the existing financial paradigm has gained momentum, even if slowly.  In March 2017, Blockchain Capital announced its own compliant ICO built using the same JOBS Act exemptions mentioned in the SEC report, eventually raising $10 million of a $50 million fund selling its tokenized securities.  One possible explanation for the relatively few compliant blockchain capital raises is uncertainty about the legality of recording stock ownership on a distributed ledger, according to Andrea Tinianow, founder and director of the state-run Delaware Blockchain Initiative.  Using technology that tØ's parent company invested in last week, made by New York-based Symbiont, Delaware has just signed into law a series of amendments that Tinianow has said will remove much of that uncertainly for firms incorporated in her state.  ""We've got the regulatory framework for blockchain shares,"" said Tinianow. ""Now the SEC is coming in with federal guidance and it’s a natural fit.""  Multiple sources have confirmed there are ""dozens"" of ICOs in the works looking to run compliant projects, but that the time to market with such an investment is between six months and one year.  For companies looking to host such capital raises, Cammarata said tØ is ready with its own ICO technology, so long as they’re willing to put in the leg work.  ""We are prepared to take them on today,"" he said, concluding:  ""If they’ve gone through the proper regulatory channels.""
