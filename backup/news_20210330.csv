42386301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSStZ,1617145463,Rep. Gaetz of Blockchain Caucus Faces Investigation for Sexual Misconduct: Report,"U.S. lawmaker Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus who has put his name to a handful of pro-blockchain bills and letters, is under investigation by the Department of Justice, which is looking into whether he had a sexual relationship with a minor, the New York Times reported Tuesday.      According to the report, which cited ""three people briefed on the matter,"" Gaetz is also being investigated over whether or not he violated federal sex trafficking laws. He allegedly may have paid for a 17-year-old to travel with him.      The investigation is part of an ongoing case against former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, who became the first Florida official to announce he would accept bitcoin for tax payments in 2018. Greenberg was arrested last June on sex trafficking and privacy violation charges.      Gaetz said on Twitter the allegations are not true, and that he and his family were ""victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former U.S. Department of Justice official.      ""I demand the DOJ immediately release the tapes, made at their direction, which implicate their former colleague in crimes against me based on false allegations,"" he tweeted.      The investigation into the congressman was opened during the final months of the administration of former President Donald Trump by Attorney General William P. Barr.      See also: State of Crypto: Unpacking the Trump Presidency’s Crypto Legacy      A representative for Gaetz did not immediately return a request for comment. Gaetz told the Times he was aware of an investigation, but he indicated he wasn't aware of any wrongdoing.      “I only know that it has to do with women. I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward,"" he told the Times.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION,"Sebastian Sinclair, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/30/rep-gaetz-of-blockchain-caucus-faces-investigation-for-sexual-misconduct-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf70bce010c3e32c231dd939d804c014d7d66eb8-1400x1400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Climbing 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $57,069-$59,380 (CoinDesk 20)    Bitcoin has climbed on four of the past five days, and the price is now pushing back toward $60,000 for the first time in a couple weeks.      ""It wasn't with the fanfare and fireworks, but instead just a standard grind higher, helped in part by the continued positive adoption news flow,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading with the digital-asset firm Equos, wrote Tuesday in an email.      Several stories reinforced the theme of growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, echoing the takeaway from Visa's announcement on Monday.    PayPal on Tuesday announced a Checkout service that will allow bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) to be seamlessly converted into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies when making purchases, the same as a credit card or a debit card would work inside a PayPal wallet.  Blockstream, the bitcoin development company, is launching a token tied to the company's bitcoin-mining production, redeemable in bitcoin.  Derivatives exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will launch smaller-sized bitcoin ""micro"" futures contracts in May, potentially expanding the number of people who bet on the future price of the leading cryptocurrency.  Tether, the company behind the biggest dollar-linked stablecoin, USDT, published an attestation verifying that it had $35 billion in assets backing a similar amount of its USDT token last month. Some analysts had warned that an unraveling of trust in tether could rattle the bitcoin market.    ""Bitcoin has tentative resistance at the $60,000 level, but momentum from yesterday’s Visa news should be enough to keep the bullish trend going strong,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Tuesday in an email.    Bitcoin Funding Rates Climb, Suggesting Optimism Over Fresh Rally    Bitcoin traders appear to be ratcheting up bets on a fresh rally, and they’re taking on more leverage – and risk – in cryptocurrency derivatives markets.      In the past few days, the cost to fund a long position in the market for bitcoin (BTC) perpetual swaps, a type of derivatives in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, has broken above neutral levels for the first time since mid-March, according to Arcane Research, a Norwegian analysis firm.      The average cost is now pushing toward 0.08%. That’s still well below a level close to 0.12% witnessed earlier this month, when bitcoin surged to an all-time high price above $61,000, or earlier in the year, when the funding cost was roughly twice as high.      But the recent rise appears to show traders finding a renewed appetite for risk-taking following a market shakeout over the past couple weeks. Bitcoin’s price fell to just above $50,000 as recently as March 25.      “The funding rate spikes coincide with strong optimism and high leverage from short-term traders,” according to the Arcane report.

42386314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBST3d,1617134934,NFL Player Taylor Rapp Is Launching an NFT to Fight Anti-Asian Hate,"A young defensive back with the Los Angeles Rams is the latest pro athlete launching a non-fungible token (NFT), hoping to use the sale to raise money, and awareness, to combat the wave of anti-Asian hate crimes this year.      Taylor Rapp, the free safety entering his third season in the National Football League, completely lacks the star power of a Rob Gronkowski or a Patrick Mahomes, marquee players who leveraged their splashy brands into multimillion-dollar NFT sales earlier this month.      But the backfield starter, who said he’s been hustling with his co-creators for three weeks on their slapdash NFTs, told CoinDesk he hopes to make up the difference by focusing his sale on its anti-racist cause. He’s the only Chinese-American active in the NFL at a time when reports of hate crimes against Asians are surging.      “The whole reason behind making the collection was to raise money to donate to the AAPI community and, you know, my Asian community, because we’ve seen all the crazy horrific attacks every single day,” he told CoinDesk Tuesday, hours after New York City police began investigating the latest apparent anti-Asian assault in a year full of them.      Rapp hasn’t yet “locked in” what portion of the NFT sale he will donate to community organizations through GoFundMe’s $5 million #StopAsianHate campaign. But he said it will represent “a substantial amount” of the total.      The NFTs themselves, which do not feature team iconography and are not being released through a deal with the league, might shake the gargantuan NFL machine into addressing the attacks against Asians more forcefully, Rapp said.      He noted league officials issued a statement condemning the attacks under the hashtag #StopAsianHate in late February, “just like all the other big corporations” that he said are finally waking up to a problem that began with COVID-19 nearly one year earlier after the reports of the disease originating in Wuhan, China.      “I really hope the NFL sees this and the important message that is behind it in why I'm actually doing it,” Rapp said. “Hopefully, the Rams will be able to see that as well.”    NFTs for a cause    The NFTs lean heavily on Rapp’s Chinese identity. He’s calling them the “Year of the Ox” collection (a reference to this year’s Chinese zodiac sign) and said each carries a Chinese proverb his mother picked out as well as the Chinese character for “Ox” that he said his grandfather hand-painted.      Digital artists Elena Provolovich, Ryan Darwent, and David Bircham collaborated with Rapp on designing his six NFTs, only one of which is 1-of-1. The other images run as high as 24 copies and the total supply is 90. Darwent told CoinDesk his contribution takes after photography, though others in the collection more closely resemble a museum piece.      Many also come paired with real-world memorabilia, Rapp said, a concession for the “boomers” who, like his father, don’t buy into intangible digital collectibles. For his part, Rapp thinks NFTs have staying power.      He said the auction begins Thursday night on NFT marketplace OpenSea.      Rapp is hopeful the NFT buzz can serve as a vehicle for spreading awareness of Asian athletes, especially in the NFL where aspiring players face an uphill battle due to their underrepresentation in the league, he said.      “Going through the ranks of high school and college and NFL, you begin to see fewer and fewer people who look like you,” Rapp said, noting he had no such “role model” in the NFL while growing up.      “For me, it's all about representation and being able to be that figure for” young players, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/30/nfl-player-taylor-rapp-is-launching-an-nft-to-fight-anti-asian-hate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3d8e68b7903fa7e082e54017fd74a32d7dfeddb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Redfearn, who previously ran the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets and left public service late last year, will oversee exchange operations, brokerage and custody services at Coinbase, according to the Wall Street Journal.      In a blog post welcoming the new hire, Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee wrote that Redfearn ""will be responsible for defining and driving a vision and strategy to set the global standard for crypto capital markets, including digital asset securities and our crypto trading platform.""      Redfearn noted in the blog post that much of his initial exposure to the crypto industry came via enforcement actions against initial coin offerings.      ""Nonetheless, through it all, I appreciated the significant potential in this space if issuers, markets, and market participants could appropriately navigate the regulatory landscape. And that is something I can help make happen,"" he said in the blog post.      Recent regulatory developments at the SEC as well as at other U.S. regulators such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ""are paving the way for greater opportunities for the crypto economy,"" he said.      The hire comes as Coinbase prepares to go public through a direct listing on Nasdaq in the coming weeks. The exchange's Form S-1 and amended versions were published earlier this year, showing the company generated a net income of over $300 million in 2020, up from a $30 million loss in 2019.

In the past few days, the cost to fund a long position in the market for bitcoin (BTC) perpetual swaps, a type of derivatives in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, has broken above neutral levels for the first time since mid-March, according to Arcane Research, a Norwegian analysis firm.      The average cost is now pushing toward 0.08%. That's still well below a level close to 0.12% witnessed earlier this month when bitcoin surged to an all-time high price above $61,000, or earlier in the year, when the funding cost was roughly twice as high.      But the recent rise appears to show traders finding a renewed appetite for risk taking following a market shakeout over the past couple of weeks. Bitcoin's price fell to just above $50,000 as recently as March 25.      “The funding rate spikes coincide with strong optimism and high leverage from short-term traders,” according to the Arcane report.    “The funding rates have once again started to move upwards after two weeks in the neutral territory,” similar to the final weeks of January and February, according to Arcane.  “After the initial breakouts from the neutral territory, bitcoin began moving upwards towards new price highs, but not without volatility.""  A positive funding rate in cryptocurrency derivatives markets means traders with long positions pay those with short positions.  Eventually, rising payouts from long traders to short traders could make downward price bets more attractive using bitcoin perpetual swaps.

42434098,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7nLh,1617121231,Indians Want Bitcoin Despite Government Stance,"You can’t keep bitcoin down.      That’s true in a lot of places around the world, from Belarus to Nigeria, where crypto is a workaround for dissidents and a substitute for unreliable monetary systems.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But it’s especially true in India, a market that has lots of cryptocurrency activity (and masses of potential) despite a decade of government confusion, inconsistency and delay.      Just recently, India’s Parliament was rumored to be about to pass a bill banning crypto outright, only for that body to postpone the measure and go on a three-month holiday.      In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India sought to ban banks from dealing in crypto. Then last year, the Supreme Court overturned that ban, raising hopes of a boom.      Nobody – even the so-called experts – knows what will happen now. The official government stance has been overwhelmingly negative over the years. But some factions are more supportive than others, and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently left some wiggle room. “We will allow certain windows for people to do experiments on the blockchain, bitcoins or cryptocurrency,” he said.      The consensus speculation is that the government may eventually ban payments in crypto but preserve the ability of people to hold crypto as an investment (as long as they pay taxes). India wants to retain power over its money and plans to issue a digital rupee in due course.      But, in some fundamental sense, the exact government position may not matter. India’s crypto industry is building, whatever the formulation of policy, and that’s because demand among India’s bulging demographics appears enormous.      As CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova reported yesterday, powerhouses like Coinbase and Binance both have footholds in the market. And tech-savvy Indians with international connections don’t want to miss out on the bitcoin boom.      “India is one of the youngest countries in the world, and these 28- to 29-year-olds are people who want to be a part of the revolution,” Indian crypto advocate and YouTube influencer Kashif Raza told Baydakova. (28 to 29 years old is India’s median age).      Younger Indians see bitcoin as an alternative to gold, which traditionally has held special allure. “Gold would be the investment of choice for the older generation. The young generation sees the advantage … to buy bitcoin, because gold became more stable and bitcoin is so fast-moving,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, an exchange with 1.8 million users.      Bitcoin has a tendency to show up the weakness of governments in the face of technology. It is something they can deflect and make harder to use. But it has cultural strength that’s hard to budge. It is a brand and a movement that’s unstoppable.      And in fact, all the back-and-forth from Indian officials over the ban only seems to be burnishing BTC’s image.      “The rumored ban is stimulating a lot of conversation among the population about cryptocurrency,” Shetty said.      While governments vacillate, younger internet users just want to get on with the future.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/30/indians-want-bitcoin-despite-government-stance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6d09e4986825281d155771be1f59355eb555c91-2400x1514.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The group – including Unocoin, WazirX, CoinDCX, Paxful, Pocketbits, ZebPay and Coinswitch – compiled a package of documents explaining the current state of the crypto industry in India and possible ways to regulate it.

The presentation, reviewed by CoinDesk, says India currently has more than 10 million crypto users, over half-a-million day traders and more than 3,000 people employed in the crypto industry. The presentation mentions the money-laundering and environmental concerns related to cryptocurrencies and suggests a package of policy proposals.      The exchanges suggested research on potential consequences if India bans crypto, proposals on the upcoming regulation, a draft code of conduct for crypto exchanges to adopt and an overview of crypto regulation practices around the world.

The bank announced Monday it has converted Japan’s first certificates of ownership backed by securities into security tokens, and is conducting a trial on the digital asset issuance platform Securitize Japan, a unit of Securitize Inc., according to CoinDesk Japan.      The method of raising funds through the issuance of security tokens is called a security token offering (STO). Investors are issued a digital token that represents a physical investment to be stored on a blockchain.      Security tokens became famous in 2018, following the initial coin offering (ICO) boom. Unlike ICOs, STOs were meant to represent a security regulated and traded in accordance with securities regulation. Despite the hype, STOs failed to take off for the most part, particularly in parts of Asia. In fact, in 2018, Beijing’s financial authority warned that STOs were illegal.      The security tokens issued in Japan’s effort have a short-term rating of ""a-1"" given by the Japan’s leading credit rating service, Rating and Investment Information, and will be launched within the month, according to the announcement. The security tokens are also compliant with Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), according to a statement from Securitize Japan.      For the pilot, the bank created beneficiary certificates representing the asset-backed securities and tokenized them on the Securitize platform, the statement said.      Another influential Japanese financial institution, SBI Holdings, announced three days ago it had also completed registration requirements to handle STOs. Additionally, Nomura Holdings, Mizuho Financial, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial and others have been researching and developing digital securities backed by assets such as bonds, stocks and real estate, according to CoinDesk Japan.      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust will continue to research the issuance and management of security tokens for the STO market, according to the announcement.

42434099,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7nRh,1617111000,State of Crypto: FATF's New Guidance Takes Aim at DeFi,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has published new draft guidance that, if implemented, could require even decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to find a way to implement know-your-customer (KYC) rules.    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  FATF's new rules  The narrative    The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the inter-governmental watchdog that establishes standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, has published new draft guidance for decentralized platforms.    Why it matters    FATF made headlines two years ago when it proposed – and then finalized – guidance urging nations to implement KYC requirements for all crypto exchanges. The so-called Travel Rule defined virtual asset service providers (VASPs) as businesses that transfer funds in the form of cryptocurrency (i.e., crypto exchanges, among others) and mandated that the businesses should have KYC information for both the sender and the recipient of these transactions.      Countries are beginning to implement these recommendations – South Korea recently brought new anti-money laundering (AML) rules into effect, resulting in at least one major exchange shuttering its operations in the country.      This month’s updated draft guidance massively expands the types of entities that might fall under FATF’s umbrella.    Breaking it down    FATF’s new draft guidance, published on March 19, now draws a distinction between fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), adds descriptors for decentralized exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) and specifies who might be held liable for enforcing KYC requirements for DeFi platforms, according to my colleague Ian Allison:    “NFTs and DeFi present additional challenges to the FATF, which is already struggling to graft money-laundering rules onto pseudonymous-by-design transactions in the flourishing cryptocurrency industry.”    In other words, FATF moved quickly in response to the rapid growth of NFTs and DeFi over the past year. The updated guidance, if finalized, would ask countries to ensure that even DeFi platforms have some form of KYC rules, even if there’s technically no single party responsible for a live network.      “It’s called ‘updated guidance’ but really it is a sweeping expansion of the way FATF thinks about and defines virtual asset service providers in particular. It really is a move by FATF to react in almost real time to some of the technical advances that are really sweeping crypto right now,” said Ari Redbord, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who’s now head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs.      The expanded VASP definition would include “individual people and groups of people” in the crypto sector who don’t have a traditional financial sector counterpart, said Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith, who described the current form of the guidance as “problematic.”      In particular, developers who create some sort of decentralized platform and do not maintain any form of control may still be liable for KYC rules, even if they don’t have a role in the platform post-launch, she said.      “They would still have to be accountable for implementing AML/CFT (countering the financing of terrorism) on something they no longer are a part of necessarily,” Smith said. “What the regulators are trying to do is have a centralized entity that is accountable for an anti-money laundering program that doesn’t sit well on top of decentralized networks.”      Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer for the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said much of the new guidance applies to regulations that have existed for years, but the explanations in the document lead to some odd interpretations.      Some of the DeFi tools are still evolving, she said.      In her view, “sticking with a principles-based, risk-based approach might serve better for a longer-term solution.”      Still, the fact that FATF published draft guidance so soon after the summer of DeFi and the NFT boom shows that it is paying attention to what’s going on with the digital asset world, Redbord said.      Siân Jones, a senior partner at XReg Consulting, believes crypto may bifurcate into regulated and unregulated factions as this regulatory push continues. While the regulated space will shell out the money to comply with regulations and engage with regulated institutions, others would prefer privacy-focused digital currencies, according to a webinar last week.      “There are a whole host of people who are not necessarily doing bad things, but for whom privacy stands as a fundamental in their lives, they will move … together with money launderers. There’s no way of separating them, and this will move to an ever more anonymous crypto,” Jones said.      This may even be more in line with the original Bitcoin envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.      Industry participants have until April 20 to file comments if they wish to provide feedback on the draft guidance. FATF will vote to adopt (or not) the recommendations in its June plenary.    Europe’s evolving regulatory framework    The European Commission proposed some amendments to its Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) last month.      Many of these changes won’t really impact the crypto space one way or another – for example, stablecoins will be regulated as e-money, which has its own regulatory regime in the European Union unrelated to MiCA. However, some of the proposals could force crypto businesses to rethink their strategies.      Cristina Carrascosa, a founder and partner at legal boutique ATH21, told CoinDesk that a proposed ban on interest-bearing crypto assets might be the most significant amendment as far as the crypto sector is concerned.      “This means every single staking token will have to be modified, as interest bearing from crypto asset services providers or token issuers will not be allowed. Some of the liquidity provider pools will also have to re-think their business models, and major ‘decentralized’ insurance providers as well,” she told CoinDesk via email.      Interest-bearing crypto products have taken off recently, she noted, and the European Central Bank (ECB) has said a ban may be “critical.”      Jackson Mueller, director of policy and government relationsat Securrency, said the proposed changes “really puts [the ECB] at the center of development of the digital asset space in Europe.”      The amendments also appear to insert the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) into the approval process for digital ledger technology (DLT) market infrastructure.      “The only other thing that particularly caught my attention is that in the amendments to the pilot proposal it also includes a definition of ‘settlement coin’ and this is a whole new proposal,” he said.    FinCEN's proposed rule    The comment period for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)’s proposed counterparty rule closed yesterday, with some 7,400 comments, according to a public government portal (up from a little over, uh, 7,000 in January). The U.S. government still has to sort through these comments before it can or will make a decision on how it wants to proceed.      As a reminder: This is the proposed rule that would a) require crypto exchanges to file currency transaction reports (CTRs) for aggregate transactions worth more than $10,000 per day, and b) collect counterparty data for unhosted or private wallets. While the first part would bring crypto reporting rules roughly in line with regulations that banks have to follow for fiat transactions, the second was far more controversial.      I don’t really have any insight on how Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will fall on this. In written responses to the Senate Finance Committee during her confirmation, she said she intends “to ensure a full and substantive review of the proposals, which will include an assessment of how to ensure proper input from stakeholders.”      It’s also worth noting that Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo was confirmed to his position last week. He’ll be playing a role in the department’s fintech work from what I hear, and I’m interested to see if he expresses any view on this.    Biden’s rule    A lot has happened. First off, we’re finally seeing some progress on Gary Gensler’s nomination. To recap: He’s President Joe Biden’s nominee to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he’ll oversee like a half-dozen bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and the agency’s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple. On March 10, his nomination was advanced to the Senate out of the Banking Committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on his nomination last week, and a vote could happen as soon as the week of April 12 (after the Senate returns from a recess).      The situation with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a bit murky at the moment. Last week, American Banker reported that former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are all being considered to run the OCC. Still, University of California law professor Mehrsa Baradaran has support from members of Congress – over 30 Representatives with the Congressional Black Caucus wrote a letter to Biden endorsing her nomination, touting her postal banking and Homestead Act proposals.      Meanwhile, it’s been pointed out to me that Georgetown University law professor Chris Brummer, who was rumored to be Biden’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission pick, has accepted a role on the Board of Directors at Fannie Mae, meaning he may no longer be in the running.    Changing of the guard  Elsewhere:  Crypto Is Banned in Morocco, but Bitcoin Purchases Are Soaring: LocalBitcoins saw its “best month ever” in February 2021, with just under $1 million in bitcoin being traded. This is despite cryptocurrency transactions being barred in the country. It’s a bit of a trend.  Tether Takes Step Toward Transparency With First Accounting Firm Report Card: Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has published an attestation produced by auditing firm Moore Cayman asserting the company had a little over $35 billion in total assets at the end of February, matching the amount of USDT issued. The company says it intends to continue producing these on a regular basis.  Outside CoinDesk:  (USA Today) Individuals accused of participating in the riot on Capitol Hill in January are increasingly turning to digital payment platforms to fundraise their legal defenses. You may recall Congress actually holding a hearing on how those accused of domestic terror might be fundraising online, and it’s worth paying attention to this story to see how this issue shakes out.  (Vice) Ben Munster, one of the most descriptive writers in crypto, dug into the question of how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) might disappear. The problem is users buy NFTs with the not-unreasonable expectation that they’re buying the media attached to the token. In reality, on some platforms they’re just buying a token that references the media. If the referenced media disappears, the buyer might be out of luck and the ether they used to buy it. See also: It’s an NFT Boom. Do You Know Where Your Digital Art Lives?  (New York State) New York’s new vaccine pass uses blockchain apparently, though it’s a little vague on how: “Secure technologies, like blockchain and encryption, are woven throughout Excelsior Pass to help protect the data, making it verifiable and trusted. No private health data is stored or tracked within the apps.” More to come.

Mark Cuban, Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Benioff (CEO of Salesforce.com) and other well-heeled tech backers also participated in SuperRare’s Series A, the three-year-old startup told CoinDesk.      The round comes as crypto worth millions pours into blockchain-linked digital collectibles. While huge sales by relatively established artists such as Beeple catch headlines in mainstream media, an army of lesser-known NFT creators are also selling for six-figures on marketplaces such as SuperRare.      Artists are now generating over $25 million in total sales per month on SuperRare, the startup said. When it launched three years ago, a given month might have seen just $8,000 total.      But the crowd driving SuperRare’s boon remains surprisingly small.      Just 727 wallet addresses combined for $5.47 million in SuperRare trading volume in the past week, according to on-chain data site DappRadar.

One Blockstream Mining Note (BMN) represents 2,000 terahashes per second of hashrate from one of Blockstream’s mining facilities. The first tranche of 62.5 BMN will go on sale next week, April 7, and can be redeemed after three years for the bitcoin equivalent to the total hashrate the note represents.    Read more: Blockstream Buys $25M Worth of Bitcoin Mining Machines From MicroBT    (Hashrate is the total estimated number of hashes or ""guesses"" being used to mine bitcoin at any given time and is generally a good gauge for measuring how much power Bitcoin consumes at a give time; currently, Bitcoin's hashrate is roughly 164 exahashes per second).      Blockstream is issuing the token on its Liquid sidechain, a semi-privatized, trusted blockchain that runs in parallel with Bitcoin, and will sell it initially through a private token sale on STOKR. The first batch of tokens will go for £200,000 ($275,836) each, and there's a purchase minimum of 1 BMN (payable in bitcoin, or BTC and USDT on the Liquid network).      The sale is open to all non-U.S. qualified investors, and the tokens can be split and transferred in amounts down to 0.1 BMN and traded over the counter (OTC) after the sale.      “The BMN leverages our extensive experience in the Bitcoin mining space and offers investors up-front, fixed rates with improved tradability,"" explained Blockstream CEO Adam Back in a statement.    Hashrate tokens    Hashrate tokens are a recent development in the Bitcoin derivatives market, lead by Bitcoin miner Poolin and the Binance exchange.      These contracts exist as a way for high-caliber investors to gain exposure to bitcoin and bitcoin mining without owning the bitcoin outright or fumbling with mining hardware. Typically, they are traded OTC before being integrated on exchanges.      ""In an ASIC and colocation market that is prohibitive for retail investment, hashrate tokens and contracts are a great way for investors to get exposure to the mining sector. Given the ease of purchase, exchange-grade liquidity, and low barriers to entry, hashrate tokens trade at a premium to physical ASICs,"" Ethan Vera of Luxor Mining told CoinDesk.

42434102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7nVh,1617105600,Tether Takes Step Toward Transparency With First Accounting Firm Report Card,"Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, published an attestation on Tuesday verifying that it had $35 billion in assets backing a similar amount of its USDT token last month.      Produced by Cayman Islands-based accounting firm Moore Cayman, the document examines Tether’s holdings as of Feb. 28, 2021, at 23:59 UTC, finding the company had at least $35.28 billion in total assets against total liabilities of $35.15 million.      Tuesday’s attestation is the first third-party verification Tether has produced indicating its reserves match the amount of USDT in circulation since 2018, the first from an actual accounting firm since September 2017, and by far the least equivocal of the bunch. As such, it may help resolve some long-standing questions about the stablecoin’s backing.      Moore Cayman has a small team, according to its ""People"" page, and the firm says it specializes in working with financial-services firms.      To be clear, an attestation is not the same thing as an audit. The latter is designed to look for potential risks, while an attestation only evaluates whether the data being examined by the auditor is accurate. However, no stablecoin issuer has been able to secure an audit, including companies regulated by U.S. entities like the New York Department of Financial Services. In other words, the attestation puts Tether on par with stablecoin issuers such as USDC’s Centre, GUSD’s Gemini or PAX’s Paxos, at least when it comes to financial clarity.      As the largest stablecoin – with over $40 billion worth issued as of press time, according to Tether's transparency page — USDT plays an important role in the $1.8 trillion global cryptocurrency market. Because it usually trades at or near $1, USDT allows traders to move fiat currency (or a serviceable substitute) between exchanges quickly to capture arbitrage opportunities.      Tether plans to issue another attestation for March after it ends, followed by quarterly attestations thereafter.      These attestations are separate from the disclosures Tether intends to produce for the New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG).      ""We are doing this on our own initiative to honor Tether’s commitment to further transparency. And although it is unrelated to our release of this assurance opinion, the settlement is another example of our commitment to transparency,"" said Stuart Hoegner, general counsel at Tether and its sister firm, Bitfinex.      Tether, Bitfinex and the NYAG settled a nearly two-year investigation into whether Bitfinex covered up the loss of nearly $1 billion in customer funds using Tether’s reserves last month. Part of the settlement entails Tether filing quarterly reports detailing its reserve composition for the next two years.      Tuesday’s attestation does not describe this composition, only noting that Tether’s “consolidated total assets amount to” over $35 billion.    Read more: NY AG’s $850M Probe of Bitfinex, Tether Ends in an $18.5M Settlement    While the attestation uses similar language to reports produced by Grant Thornton for the USDC stablecoin or Withum for the Paxos dollar, Moore Cayman notes that its attestation was conducted in accordance with a trio of international standards.

This marks the first time HMRC has released guidance specifically describing how staking is treated for taxation purposes. It has been assumed previously that staking comes under the umbrella of mining, thus the same guidance has applied.      The guidance issued today on staking is indeed almost identical in its wording to that on mining. However, the introduction of separate guidance for the two opens the door to divergence in the future.      This guidance released Tuesday has been issued as part of a new internal HMRC manual on the tax treatment of crypto assets, which consolidates its previously separate guidance applicable to businesses and individuals into one manual.      A HMRC spokesperson said in a statement shared with CoinDesk: “The guidance manual demonstrates our commitment to providing clarity to our customers and will help individuals and businesses understand the tax consequences of different types of transactions in crypto assets.      “This builds on the previously published policy papers and will provide a more flexible approach to updating customers in this fast-moving sector.”      New staking guidance    According to the new guidance, the taxation of staking activity by businesses will depend on whether the activity “amounts to a taxable trade.” This depends on a range of factors, such as the degree of activity, nature of the organisation, risk involved and the commerciality of the activity.      If staking activity does not amount to trade, the pound sterling value of crypto assets awarded will be taxable as miscellaneous income.      If a business’ activity does amount to trade, however, profits “must be calculated according to the relevant tax rules.”      See also: ‘Thrill’ and ‘Status’ Driving Young People to Crypto Investment, Says UK Financial Watchdog      With regard to individuals, HMRC deems that “only in exceptional circumstances” would it expect “individuals to buy and sell exchange tokens with such frequency, level of organisation and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade in itself.”      Any crypto assets that are kept by individuals or businesses would be subject to Capital Gains Tax and Corporation Tax on Chargeable Gains if they are later sold.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/30/uk-tax-authority-updates-treatment-of-crypto-assets-to-incorporate-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa4837bfd140cef068f7473b5e1a115cb2fbe674-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report by ABC News on Sunday, French national Alexandre Raffin, 28, has brought a compensation claim against crypto company Modern Assets Australia for an alleged breach in duty of care.      Raffin claims Modern Assets and its directors, Jonathan Allison and Carlo Sciubba, failed in their obligation to him as an intermediary in facilitating an exchange of cash for a South Korean cryptocurrency called Klaytn.      It is alleged Modern Assets was meant to provide Raffin with the cryptocurrency but when the deal fell through the crypto company put Raffin in touch with a seller directly. Sometime later, the seller made off with Raffin's cash and disappeared.      Under the terms of the deal, the seller was to provide 937,500 units of the cryptocurrency for around A$93,000 (US$71,000), which in today's valuation places it at roughly $3.7 million (US$2.8 million), according to the report.      See also: Australian Man Arrested for Trying to Launder $4.3M With Bitcoin      The French national is accusing Modern Assets of failing to perform the necessary research required before connecting him with the mysterious seller.

42434089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7n5h,1617098400,Nayms Brings Blue-Chips and Disruption to Crypto Insurance,"The cryptocurrency sector is cursed by its dangerous image. British regulators recently warned potential investors they “should be prepared to lose all of their money.” But one obvious thing that might soothe the fear – insurance – is conspicuously scarce.      Currently, the market is not supplying nearly enough coverage to meet the demand. Even the biggest brokers in the world are having to tell clients they cannot get insurance for more than $10 million of crypto risk.      “Commercial insurers are still very cautious when it comes to providing insurance capacity for companies working with digital assets,” says Sarah Downey, co-head of the digital asset team at insurance brokerage giant Marsh & McLennan. “The commercial market’s supply is not keeping up.”      With crypto now worth more than $1 trillion, there is a huge untapped opportunity for insurance business, and a new online insurance marketplace called Nayms is hoping to find a niche.      See also: Insurance Giant Aon Is Testing the Waters of DeFi      It is proposing to facilitate insurance that pays out crypto, which would be a world first, according to Downey. This March it launched a pilot. Another giant brokerage, Aon, used the Nayms platform to place the world’s first-ever tokenized insurance contract underwritten by a regulated insurer. The test was with Teller Finance, a decentralized lending protocol.      The current disconnect of market size and insurance availability “doesn’t make sense,” says British entrepreneur Dan Roberts, CEO of Nayms. Many crypto firms struggle to get any insurance against hacks or for personal indemnity.    What it does    On the Nayms platform, regulated brokers and underwriters can find crypto capital providers to share in the premiums and the liability entailed in covering crypto risk. It is similar to Lloyd's, the historic London marketplace that since 1688 has brought together investment capital, brokers and clients looking to get risks covered. Nayms is a play on Lloyd's “Names,” the individuals and corporations who underwrite the risks.      Nayms does three main things, says Joseph Ziolkowski, CEO of Relm, a Bermuda-based pioneer of crypto-denominated insurance that is participating in the pilot.      First, it connects brokers and underwriters with crypto capital providers. They can “utilize Nayms to source alternative capital … in the form of native crypto assets to match the risk” of their clients.      Second, Nayms trims administrative costs – what Roberts calls “passing bits of paper around” – by tokenizing the insurance contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and wrapping them in smart contracts.      Finally, it answers to traditional regulators, unlike “pure"" decentralized finance (DeFi) approaches that were previously attempted. Submitting to regulatory oversight stimulates confidence in the platform, which helps get established insurers like Relm on board, Roberts says.      Finally, crypto is starting to get the insurance infrastructure that any emerging industry needs to grow.    Odd couple    Roberts’ project germinated four years ago, when he met Ted Georgas at a wedding in Yorkshire, in England’s north.      Roberts co-founded a startup that put ad screens and pollution sensors on bicycles to gather data about cities. Georgas had been an IT consultant for PepsiCo, Saudi Arabia’s air force and several other groups. There was a gulf of experience between the two men but, a few years later, Roberts and Georgas were building a business together.    Commercial insurers are still very cautious when it comes to providing insurance capacity for companies working with digital assets.    Roberts became preoccupied with the problem of scarce crypto insurance and growing numbers of private investors are holding crypto as a hedge against traditional markets. Might they want to invest it in return for steady insurance yields, which are decoupled from traditional markets, and therefore double down on the hedge?      After Roberts brought in Georgas, he recruited a couple of young front-end developers. On the commercial side, they hired well-connected investor Lawrence Tilli, who would go on to make their biggest introduction yet. Coinbase and the Maker Foundation invested in the seed round.    Bermuda days    The job of reaching out to the biggest players in the global insurance business fell mainly to Tilli as the commercial lead. It was in that capacity, early last year, that he met with a man called Ben Peach in a bar.      Peach had only joined multinational insurance broker Aon that Spring, when the coronavirus pandemic was already shutting down Europe. Peach had no background in insurance. He had work experience with the West Midlands police and spent a couple of years advising startups with TokenMarket, a tokenized finance firm, a period he now refers to as the “wild west.” That Aon hired him shows the company’s openness to crypto.      Even so, putting together the partnership with Nayms was a long, drawn-out process. “You wouldn’t believe how difficult this has been,” Peach says.      He was accustomed to the rapid decision-making of startups, where an idea can be hashed out and a press release drafted within 24 hours. At London-based Aon, a $26 billion giant, everything took much longer. Only in March 2021 were the two companies finally ready to announce their work together.    Custodians of crypto    Mark Robinson, head of the U.K. tech team at Verlingue, an insurance broker, says it’s getting easier for firms to find hack insurance but harder to get professional indemnity insurance.      Hack insurance is a signal of the insurer’s confidence in the firm. Insurers make sure a firm is unlikely to get hacked before promising to pay out in that event.      But it’s not easy to get. Even crypto custodians that claim a high degree of cover often only have insurance for assets in cold storage, meaning those not connected to the internet, according to Alexandre Kech, the boss of Onchain Custodian.

There’s “a massive lack of knowledge in the broking sector,” Robinson says. He’s unusual in focusing on crypto cover. The scarcity of clued-up brokers naturally deters insurers, he adds.      Another obstacle: The insurance system is denominated in dollars or another fiat currency, introducing exchange rate risk. That’s when two currencies will shift in relative value between the agreement of the contract and the time of the claim, and even again before the actual payout. For insurers, covering crypto is like insuring Turkish lira with U.S. dollars.      “Insurance regulators perceive crypto to be volatile and illiquid and as such not an acceptable way to meet capital requirements,” says Ziolkowski, from Bermuda. If the capital and payout are all in crypto, that helps drive down costs.      “That would be ideal and I believe it is the future of crypto insurance,” says Kech, speaking of direct crypto payouts.      On that score, the decision of the Bermuda Monetary Authority to give Ziolkowski’s Relm the first Innovative Insurer General Business license in December marked a quiet breakthrough for the space. The license means it can now charge crypto premiums, pay out in crypto, hold crypto on its balance sheet and transact insurance contracts on blockchains. It cleared the way for the company’s participation in the Nayms pilot. (More-established insurers are not ready to move to crypto-denominated business.)      Tokenizing insurance and administering it with smart contracts could bring efficiency gains in the wider insurance industry beyond crypto, according to Peach. The army of suits who work on resolving claims would be made obsolete overnight as algorithms would do it automatically.      Robinson, a veteran of the industry, says smart contracts could eliminate brokers entirely. Clients could agree to deals directly with insurers, with self-executing code doing the rest.      That all makes for a titanic potential reward for bridging the gap between crypto and insurance.      Aon’s Peach cracks a smile at the thought. If Roberts could build a program that generated smart contracts for the biggest insurance applications, then his company “would be a unicorn within a week.”      Cracking open crypto insurance is a captivating prize, with $1 trillion of crypto out there. But the global insurance industry generates more than $6 trillion a year in premiums. If Nayms’ smart-contract-driven crypto marketplace takes off, that’s where it will be heading next.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/30/nayms-brings-blue-chips-and-disruption-to-crypto-insurance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce7c48d6857e4c252379a790b84cfcfb1e7b1986-1400x935.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434091,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7n7h,1617098268,PayPal Pushes Crypto Further Mainstream With Planned Checkout Service for 29M Merchants,"PayPal, which last year added the ability to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency, is pushing it as a payment method across the 29 million or so online merchants connected to the fintech giant.      Announced Tuesday, PayPal’s Checkout will allow bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) to be seamlessly converted into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies when making purchases, the same as credit card or a debit card would work inside a PayPal wallet, said PayPal – meaning merchants will not actually be the recipients of cryptocurrencies.      Though the payments giant had said last year it was working on this feature, the news was enough to drive up the currencies involved, particularly BTC, which rose more than $1,000.      Calling it “a new way for businesses to get paid,” the checkout service is all about driving mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, said PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.      “Enabling cryptocurrencies to make purchases at businesses around the world is the next chapter in driving the ubiquity and mass acceptance of digital currencies,” Schulman said in a statement.      The company said in a blog post the product is ""rolling out to PayPal customers in the U.S. from today and will be available broadly to customers in the U.S. in the coming weeks.""    Hyped rollout    Cryptocurrencies are going mainstream, with banks and institutional investors taking an interest, but the utility of bitcoin and other crypto tokens when it comes to buying goods has always been limited due to their volatility.      PayPal, which made a huge splash when it officially entered the crypto space in October, wants to smooth those wrinkles out and get its wide network of merchants on board.      Since introducing the crypto service, PayPal has increased weekly purchase limits two times from $10,000 to $15,000 and then $20,000.      Visa announced this week that it was testing out payments functionality using USDC stablecoin, a cryptocurrency held at parity with the U.S. dollar, on the Ethereum blockchain, via crypto-backed Visa cards.    Read more: Visa Settles USDC Transaction on Ethereum, Plans Rollout to Partners    PayPal said its merchants will not incur any additional integrations or fees, and fiat conversions will take place at the standard PayPal conversion rates, according to a press release.      Still, the terms and conditions for ""Checkout with Crypto"" include a number of important caveats. Chief among them is the tax liability: ""Sales of Crypto Assets via Checkout with Crypto are taxable just like all other sales of Crypto Assets.""      PayPal will provide the consumer with a 1099 tax form and report to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as necessary, but ""it is your responsibility to determine what taxes, if any, apply to transactions you make.""      The T&C also warns the Checkout with Crypto service ""may not be available as a funding option for all merchants, customers or purchases.""

42386291,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNR9,1617098126,"Bitcoin, in Switch From February, Keeps Bullish Tone as US Treasury Yields Rise","Bitcoin is charting gains amid rising bond yields, contrary to the last week of February when firmer yields knocked the wind out of the cryptocurrency's bull market.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $59,325 at press time, representing a 3% gain on the day. Prices have risen about $8,000 since Thursday, based on CoinDesk 20 data.      The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is seen at 1.77%, the highest since Jan. 23, 2020. The benchmark yield has gained six basis points today and nearly 20 basis points since March 25.      Bitcoin's resilience is noteworthy and implies a bullish mood in the market. ""BTC remains extremely strong, particularly in the face of an appreciating USD and rising treasury yields,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""Despite historical correlations, bitcoin is bucking the trend even as gold sinks to below $1,700.""      Rising yields dilute the appeal of perceived inflation hedges such as bitcoin and gold. The cryptocurrency has become sensitive to macro factors and, more recently, bond yields, with the influx of institutional money in the wake of the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020. Prices fell by 20% in the last week of February after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply to the then 12-month high of 1.5%.      This time, however, rising yields are struggling to cast a pall on bitcoin's bullish mood. The ever-increasing institutional adoption of bitcoin looks to be overshadowing rising yields, helping the cryptocurrency stay bid.      Stack Funds is ""extremely bullish"" on bitcoin and expecting a move to new record highs above $62,000 over the coming weeks, Dibbs said.      The bearish channel breakout seen in the above chart has shifted the focus to highs above $61,000 registered on March 14. The latest bullish pattern looks similar to the one see at the end of January, following prices rose from roughly $30,000 to $58,000.      Bitcoin may face some selling pressure if yields rise at a faster pace, destabilizing stock markets, as discussed earlier this month. However, Goldman Sachs expects equity markets to digest a 10-year yield of roughly 2% without much difficulty, according to ForexLive.      In the past, bitcoin has performed well in a rising yield environment.      ""87% of bitcoin's performance was delivered while the U.S. 10-year bond yield has been rising,"" ByteTree CIO Charlie Morris noted in a blog post. Readers should note that institutional participation in bitcoin was quite low and the cryptocurrency was largely an uncorrelated asset during the previous episodes of yield spikes.

Announced Tuesday, a group of former RBS bankers, now known as LAB577, is bridging the way for eXchange inFinite (XinFin), a blockchain focused on the trade finance space. Its native token, the Ethereum-compatible XDC, will be used as a settlement coin inside Corda.      (In case you’re having déjà vu, DASL previously introduced a prototype token on Corda called XDC but later agreed to change the ticker to avoid confusion with the aforementioned trade finance token – and now DASL is acting as a handmaiden for XDC and its community.)    Read more: R3 Corda Network Set to Go DeFi With XDC Digital Currency    “The first currency across is XDC, but this lays the groundwork to connect Corda to ERC-20s and other cryptocurrency networks,” said LAB577 director Richard Crook. “What you should see here is the age-old challenge of interoperability being solved.”      Launched in 2015, R3 was a first mover in promising the benefits of blockchain, the shared database underlying bitcoin, to banks, which obediently joined the enterprise software consortium in droves. It quickly became apparent that no bank was going to allow competitors insights into its private data, even encrypted. With this in mind, Corda was born: a system that lets transacting counterparties see they are on the same page, without tipping their hands to anyone else.      Recent years have seen an open-source version of Corda released and cautious moves toward the public space, including a payment engine said to be interoperable with Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency and talk of a so-called “Corda coin” that emerged at R3’s annual gathering in 2019.    Read more: R3’s New Corda App Supports Payments in XRP Cryptocurrency    The XinFin and XDC community is based out of Singapore, having graduated from the Abu Dhabi regulatory fintech sandbox.      XinFin co-founder Atul Khekade explained that XDC is a public network but one that should appease regulatory concerns among banks and financial institutions eyeing the potential of more open blockchains.      “The validators have to lock 10 million XDC tokens [about $300,000] to be a validator and must attach their own KYC to the node,” said XinFin co-founder Atul Khekade. “It’s a public network, since we don't really control who is going to join the network, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum where anyone can be a validator, there's an extra [know your customer] step.”      A number of trade finance applications are being built on Corda such as the TradeIX-backed Marco Polo project. So will these existing trade finance players be getting around the campfire with XDC and singing ""Kumbaya""?      “I think it’s more a case of a rising tide lifts all boats,” Crook said. “This is continuing to make Corda the go-to place for financial services and, in this case, trade finance.”",POSITIVE,XDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | XDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/30/r3-corda-now-has-a-bridge-to-public-blockchains-with-arrival-of-ethereum-based-xdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ba1b49a742a99375ede4092118f5f780235e580-1500x978.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a press release on Monday, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) said the department is engaging in an ""unconstitutional power grab"" that could lead to a ""massive collection"" of individuals' personal information.      In December, a bureau operating inside Treasury known as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed a rule requiring crypto exchanges to collect counterparty information from transactions sent to ""unhosted wallets"" dubbed ""Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital Assets.""      Under the rule, cryptocurrency exchanges would need to maintain personal data on transactions above $3,000. In the event a transaction is over $10,000, the exchange would need to gather, store and report it to FinCEN.      The nonprofit filed comments on Monday objecting to the rule, claiming it ""represents a radical extension of FinCEN’s financial surveillance of innocent Americans."" March 29 marks the last day the regulator is taking public comments on its proposed rule.      NCLA said the move could widen the scope of the Bank Secrecy Act as digital assets would fall into the monetary instruments category of regulated currencies, according to the release.      Further, the nonprofit is arguing the proposed rule goes beyond appropriate constitutional limits by bolstering FinCEN's to ""exercise Congress' exclusive legislative power.""      See also: FinCEN’s Wallet Rule Aims to Close Crypto-Cash Reporting Gap, Official Says      “FinCEN’s proposed rule unlawfully attempts to transform the agency’s limited authority to regulate banks into permission to engage in the mass financial surveillance of innocent individuals who merely use digital assets,"" said NCLA Litigation Counsel Caleb Kruckenberg.

42386279,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNH5,1617068062,US Government Sues Decentralized Content Platform LBRY Over $11M in Token Sales,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pursuing yet another case of a blockchain company allegedly selling unregistered securities.      According to court documents filed Monday, peer-to-peer content distribution network LBRY is being accused of selling ""millions of dollars worth of unregistered securities to investors"" beginning in 2016.      The securities regulator is seeking a permanent injunction against LBRY from selling further tokens in addition to a disgorgement of ""ill-gotten gains"" plus prejudgement interest.      The SEC says the securities were sold in the form of LBRY Credits (LBC), which were communicated to investors as being used to fund LBRY's business and build its product, according to the document.      LBRY is an open-sourced protocol allowing participants to post content without fear of retribution. The SEC says LBC tokens were sold as investment contracts in exchange for U.S. dollars and other non-monetary contributions.      The network has solicited help from the cryptocurrency community, claiming the industry is at risk while simultaneously saying its credits are not securities.      ""The SEC complaint against LBRY reflects an outdated view of the economy that stifles innovation, accessibility, and creativity,"" LBRY's CEO Jeremy Kauffman told CoinDesk via email. ""Under the overreaching standard set by the SEC complaint, most blockchain tokens would be deemed securities, leaving uncertainty and confusion in the industry.""      Kauffman added the SEC's complaint fails to acknowledge steps taken by his company to comply with the law and its efforts to conduct its business in a ""forthcoming and transparent way.""      Of particular note in the SEC document and brought to attention in a tweet by crypto lawyer Grant Gulovsen are allegations LBRY enlisted a vendor to use 40 million LBC from its institutional fund to act as a market maker (MM).      The MM operated as a middleman to buy and sell LBC on a ""regular and continuous"" basis at prevailing market prices. The SEC alleges this activity provided an air of credibility that the platform was capable of generating a profit.      LBRY and Altonomy announced a market-making partnership as recently as June 2020. Polychain Capital led a $7 million funding round in Altonomy in July 2019.      Stemming from the initial coin offering (ICO) craze in 2017, the SEC has been clamping down on cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses it claims are operating outside of U.S. securities law by selling unregistered products to vulnerable investors.      Among these, the most notable cases include Ripple, Block.one and Telegram.
