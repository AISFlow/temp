42402990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde281,1559851227,Margin Lenders Lost $13.5 Million in May to Poloniex Crypto Crash,"Crypto exchange Poloniex revealed in a post Thursday that lenders in its bitcoin margin lending pool suffered a loss of 1800 BTC -- roughly $13.5 million at current market prices -- due to a flash crash in the Clams (CLAM) market on May 26.  Poloniex’s peer-to-peer margin system includes both lenders and borrowers, the lenders of which are pooled together and rewarded in interest for lending out their funds. In order for a user to borrow the margin funds being lent, he or she must hold a certain amount of collateral to provide a level of certainty that the debt will be able to be repaid at a later date.  On May 26, the margin-tradable Clams (CLAM) market dropped by nearly 77 percent in value in just 45 minutes on Poloniex, causing a flurry of liquidations designed to cut losses in order to repay the lender.  However, the speed and magnitude of the crash were too severe for Poloniex’s automatic liquidation system to function properly in the illiquid market. This resulted in the 1,800 BTC loss that has yet to be repaid to the lenders.  In the post, Poloniex stated:  “The velocity of the crash and the lack of liquidity in the CLAM market made it impossible for all of the automatic liquidations of CLAM margin positions to process as they normally would in a liquid market.”  In total, this erased 16.202 percent of the entire margin lending pool and affected 0.4 percent of all Poloniex users, the post revealed.  Unfortunately for both lenders and borrowers in this case, much of the collateral provided by the borrowers was in the CLAM cryptocurrency itself. Since CLAM is now trading at $4.96, a value 80 percent less than moments before the crash, it's unlikely the borrowers are capable of repaying said debt.  ""Lenders impacted will see the reduction in their accounts when they next log in,"" the post added.  Further, Poloniex said that it is seeking to contact those that defaulted on the loans in question.  ""We’re pursuing the defaulted borrowers to get them to repay the BTC they owe to lenders. As we recover funds, we will return them to affected lenders. We’re also exploring other ways to help defray margin lender losses,"" the exchange said. ""We will continue to communicate with impacted lenders on the status of these efforts.""  To combat another situation like this going forward, Poloniex is taking steps to protect its margin users including removing illiquid markets such as BTS, CLAM, FCT, and MAID, add adding layers of processes and protections to monitor the risk in its margin markets.

Following a report Wednesday by The Information claiming the social media giant's ""GlobalCoin"" could debut as early as this month, CNBC reported on 10 Facebook executives linked to the effort.  Additionally, as first reported by CoinDesk in May, The Information says MIT’s Christian Catalini is the Facebook crypto project's chief economist.  Sunita Parasuraman is the manager of the Switzerland-based foundation leading the token project, according to The Information. Meanwhile, some of the 10 executives working under Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus are based in Israel, CNBC reports.  None of the 10 listed in the article come from cryptocurrency backgrounds, though some have past experience in financial technology. Prior to joining Facebook, Marcus was the president of PayPal.  Nearly 30 open blockchain roles are listed on the Facebook careers page. That number has grown steadily since late last year.  As noted by The Information Wednesday, a February acquisition of the blockchain startup Chainspace also added to Facebook's crypto team – though the startup's CEO only stayed on for a month.  “Here’s a privacy project, that’s what I like,” Chainspace founder Dave Hrycyszyn told CoinDesk in May in a story about his new company.  Corresponding with previous reports from as early as December 2018, The Information, citing unnamed sources, says the Facebook cryptocurrency will be ""designed to function as a borderless currency without transaction fees and will be aggressively marketed in developing nations where government-backed currencies are more volatile.""

The club, the most popular in Portugal, will now allow fans to purchase its merchandise with cryptocurrency, paying with the UTRUST token (UTK) in addition to bitcoin and ethereum.  According to Benfica, the decision to accept cryptocurrency payments is based on a need to upgrade its e-commerce strategy and expand its global audience. Currently, the Portuguese team has a fan base of 14 million and stands as the most decorated club in Portugal.  The team hopes to broaden its audience by improving the user experience and appealing to cryptocurrency holders.

On the other hand, it would allow funds to be deposited to Benfica’s bank account in fiat money the same day of each purchase done in its online store.  “We look forward to accepting our first cryptocurrency payment,” the club’s CEO said.

42402985,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde245,1559844008,Congressman Budd Defends Blockchain in Testimony to House Ways and Means Committee,"North Carolina Congressperson Ted Budd highlighted two bills he hopes will receive bipartisan support, The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act and the Virtual Value Tax Fix of 2018, while speaking at the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee on June 4.  During his testimony, Budd called the development and protection of the domestic blockchain industry an issue of national security. Threats to this nascent industry come in the form of undue tax burdens, which can be eased through legislation.  Of specific interest? The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act, a bipartisan effort from last congress, which Budd co-sponsored and is now reintroducing, will “extend the de minimis exemption for personal transactions in foreign currency to cover transactions and Blockchain tokens as well.”  The republican congressman also announced he will provide an updated version of his own legislation, The Virtual Value Tax Fix, to ensure that digital assets are recognized as property eligible for the like-kind exchange tax deferral under Section 10(31) of the Income-Tax Act.  Budd said that without like-kind exchange, the crypto industry is subject to the effective double taxation of blockchain-based transactions, be it a purchase or sale. He also called out the disproportionate record keeping burdens on taxpayers, as well as the cumulative deterrent impact on all blockchain-based activity from the foregoing consumer impacts.  “An effective sales tax of nearly 40% penalizes the use of digital units of commerce,” said Budd. “The use of digital assets is already treated as a sale of the asset, even though the economic reality of the transaction is a purchase of a simple consumer good.”  This is not first time Budd called upon Congress or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for a bipartisan effort to better regulate the cryptocurrency industry. In his most recent speech, he also asked the government to work with trade groups like the Coin Center, the Blockchain Association, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce to further the interests of individuals and businesses.

42430596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw61h,1559840413,"Bitcoin and Gold Prices Diverge Again, Extending 5-Month Correlation","Bitcoin is again feeling the pull of gravity amid a rally in gold – a classic safe haven asset.  The premiere cryptocurrency topped out at highs near $9,100 on May 30 to hit a 2.5-week low of $7,432 on June 4.  The pullback was expected as technical charts were reporting bullish exhaustion. After all, the cryptocurrency decoupled from equity markets and rallied by nearly $4,000 in May.  Even so, the correction is noteworthy as it is accompanied by a sharp rally in gold prices. The yellow metal picked up a bid at $1,275 per Oz on May 30 and climbed to $1,344 per Oz on Wednesday – the highest level since Feb. 20.  Bitcoin and Gold comparison  As seen above, the inverse relationship has been in place since the final quarter of 2018.  On Nov. 14, BTC dived below the long-held support of $6,000, reviving the bear market which had come to a halt near that psychological support in five months to October. By mid-December, BTC was trading at 15-month lows near $3,100.  During the same time frame, gold went from $1,200 to $1,300 and further extended the rally to $1,346 (Feb. 20 high).  However, by early May, gold was roughly down 6 percent from February highs, while BTC was trading at $5,500, representing a 76 percent rise on December lows near $3,100.  The inverse correlation weakened somewhat in May with gold trading the range of $1,300-$1,270 amid BTC’s sharp rise to $9,000.  The two assets, however, are again moving in opposite directions, as mentioned earlier. It is worth noting that correlation doesn't imply causation.  Gold’s recent rally is likely associated with markets aggressively pulling forward Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut expectations.  For instance, the probability that the Fed would cut rates in July rose to 72 percent earlier this week – up significantly from 30 percent seen in early May. Further, the Fed funds futures market is now pricing three rate cuts for this year.  It is worth noting that correlation does not imply causation. While gold – a zero-yielding asset – is cheering increased prospects of a drop in US borrowing costs, bitcoin is taking a hit, possibly due to chart-driven factors.  That said, the inverse relationship warrants attention and potential toppy price action in gold could be considered an advance warning of a bullish reversal in bitcoin.

The company has previously conducted equity buybacks in order to resell those shares to new investors that it sees as helpful to its business, the source explained.  The source declined to provide further details about who would be joining Block.one’s list of backers.  Still, it's helpful to revisit a previous instance of Block.one repurchasing equity from prior investors in order to bring on new ones. A recent report from Bloomberg – which cited a March 19 email to the startup's shareholders – noted that some investors had received a 6,567 percent return on their Block.one holdings.  However, the Bloomberg report may have been unclear about which investors stood to gain so much.  ""The buyback was designed for seed investors, who had been in for a long time, and it made room for potential future strategic shareholders in a way that didn't unnecessarily inflate our balance sheet,"" Brendan Blumer, Block.one's CEO and one of the largest shareholders in the company, told CoinDesk.  ""I did not participate,"" he added.  Citing an email sent to shareholders on March 19, the Bloomberg report emphasizes the involvement of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, along with noted investors Alan Howard and Louis Bacon.  The source told CoinDesk that Thiel, Bacon and Howard are strategic investors that came on in July 2018, much later than the seed investors. As such, the source said, Thiel, Bacon and Howard saw a 30 percent gain on their investments – a healthy return but nowhere near the 6,567 percent trumpeted in Bloomberg's headline.  Block.one declined to share with CoinDesk the investor email that Bloomberg reviewed. It also declined to give CoinDesk a timeline for its seed investments. Still, the source said Block.one actually goes back several years.  The company’s balance sheet is ""stronger than ever,"" the source told CoinDesk.  Bloomberg reported that the company had $2.2 billion, mostly in U.S. government bonds. The investor letter said it also held 140,000 BTC. If Block.one still holds that much, it would be worth over $1 billion at face value.  On Saturday, the company announced a new social media platform called Voice. The company plans to use its reserves to market the service aggressively to the public.

Christopher Giancarlo. The announcement was made yesterday during a Senate confirmation hearing.  The CFTC is tasked with regulating derivatives, digital assets, and over-the-counter trades. The regulatory authority has taken a light-handed approach towards the cryptocurrency industry under outgoing chair Giancarlo.  “During my time of service, it has been a priority to transform the CFTC into a 21st Century regulator for today’s digital markets. With Dr. Tarbert’s confirmation, I know the agency is in safe hands to continue this transition,” said Giancarlo in a statement regarding the succession.  Prior to this designation, Tarbert served a short stint as Acting Under Secretary for International Affairs, beginning April 16, 2019. Before that Tarbert served as Assistant Secretary for International Markets for two years, to which he was confirmed by a vote of 87-8, showing a high degree of bipartisan support.  Politico  previously reported Tarbert would likely succeed Giancarlo as chief derivatives regulator.  Tarbert is a member of the Financial Stability Board, the international body established after the financial crisis to monitor global markets, and serves on its steering committee, according to his Treasury Department biography.  Giancarlo has committed to stay on as chairman until July 15, 2019, as Tarbert completes his current Treasury obligations.  J.

Announcing the move Thursday, Keys said he will drive product strategy and global business development at the firm. He joins John and James Slazas, the latter of whom was the former head of capital markets at ConsenSys.  DARMA (Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors) Capital is a CFTC-regulated firm, as well as a member of the National Futures Association, with $100 million in assets under management for its Ether Optimized Long fund, Keys said in a blog post. The idea behind the ether long fund is it will accumulate more ether as time goes on, thereby generating a return for the fund's investors.  Keys told CoinDesk that his goal is to accumulate 1 percent of the fund's total per month, minus fees.  ""So if you gave me 100 ether, my goal would be to produce 1 ether a month,"" he said.  This isn't the same as ""hodling,"" the popularly misspelled term for holding crypto over a long period of time, according to Keys, who said many investors in crypto who held through the recent bear market ""probably [don't] want to hodl.""  Rather, he said, the point is to ""create alpha,"" or an active return on an investment.  While DARMA is starting with an ether long fund, the firm plans to launch a bitcoin long fund in the coming months, with a third fund based on filecoin sometime next year. Said Keys:  ""We believe [those tokens] will be the components of the next-generation internet and essentially there is a new asset class in what I would call crypto commodities. So we’re not interested at the application layer, we’re interested in the protocols that many different applications will use.""  Not a departure  While Keys has transitioned to working full-time at DARMA, he will remain an advisor to ConsenSys, he said. Likewise, DARMA will be utilizing ConsenSys software, and working closely with the ethereum startup incubator.  ConsensSys will remain an investor with DARMA as well.  Still, the shift matches Keys' personal interests, he noted.  ""My core competency has been in finance and my secondary competency has been in technology,"" he explained.  ConsenSys is focused more on the technology side of the crypto world than the financial side, but Keys said it is important to build some regulated funds in the space.  ""There’s a void in the market, and this is a simple solution and I think a necessary missing piece of the market,"" he said.  ""I think the investment stage, if you look at the PwC blockchain hedge fund report, over 70 percent of them have less than $10 million assets under management, half of them don’t use a custodian and it’s very immature. We have $100 [million] AUM, we have one of the best custodians in Opus, we have KPMG as an auditor.""  At present, only accredited investors, family offices and institutions can participate in the fund.  Keys said he intends to reach out to potential investors.  ""I spent the last four years explaining blockchain to large institutions and central banks and almost anyone who’d listen,"" he said, adding:  ""And now we’re going to dial it in specifically to eligible participants, family offices, institutions who are recognizing the next generation of the internet who don’t understand where the investment opportunities are.""

42430589,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw5vh,1559828728,Aion Network Launches First Blockchain Virtual Machine on Java,"Aion  Network, a non-profit aiming to “rebuild an internet that puts users first” through broadening the use of blockchain, announced a new virtual machine built on top of the popular Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  This marks the first blockchain virtual machine available to Java developers.  The Aion Virtual Machine (AVM) is not a modification or rewrite of the underlying JVM, but a supplementary software layer that can interact with the JVM as developers build decentralized applications and smart contracts above it.  Java provides a secure, transparent, scalable, and easily-deployed environment for those unacclimated to the crypto-landscape. This is fits Aion’s mission statement to promote more extensive use of blockchain.  By employing a commonly used language like Java, Aion CEO Matthew Spoke hopes to surmount one of the largest barriers to widespread blockchain adoption: terra incognita.  ""We made the strategic decision to leave the JVM intact so we could fully leverage the mature ecosystem around it,"" said a company representative in a blog. ""Leaning on a hardened language like Java was crucial since a major obstacle for a business interested in Blockchain is the cost and time needed to train their teams on unfamiliar frameworks, languages, and tools.""  To this end, Aion also provides blockchain education and onboarding through Aion Learn and Aion University. Billed as a collection of engineers, academics, designers, and entrepreneurs – aligned with a singular, altruistic mandate – the network provides a catalog of developer tools and application templates, as well as mobile API’s and software development kits.  ""We have a unique opportunity to build a foundation for the future economy. Aion is our contribution to that future; and we need the best and brightest to work alongside us to make it real,” said Spoke, on the network’s website.  The Aion blockchain utilizes multiple tools already popular on the mainnet, which provide accessibility and redundancy in the public network.  “Aion aims to become the common protocol used for these blockchains, enabling more efficient and decentralized systems to be built. The Aion protocol enables the development of a federated blockchain network, making it possible to seamlessly integrate dissimilar blockchain systems in a multi-tier hub-and-spoke model, similar to the internet.”  The native currency, AION, facilitates transaction fees for miners of the network. It has a current market cap of $60,495,358 USD, according to CoinMarketCap.

Urban Innovation Fund and Oakhouse Partners also participated in the funding, according to an announcement provided to CoinDesk Thursday.  Voatz said it will use the investment to develop the accessibility and usability of its platform, as well as to boost security as it launches new pilots in partnership with states, cities and ""select international jurisdictions.""  The startup's app uses blockchain tech to allow voting in different types of elections using a ""secured"" smart device.  Most recently, Voatz conducted a pilot effort with the city and county of Denver, Colorado, to provide an alternative to post-based absentee voting for deployed military personnel and overseas US citizens during the 2019 municipal elections. The firm said the pilot was concluded successfully earlier this week.  Last year, it also held a similar pilot with 24 counties in West Virginia for the 2018 midterm elections – the first time that blockchain-based mobile voting had ever been used in a U.S. federal election, according to Voatz.  Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures, said:  ""Voting is a great application of blockchain technology. What Voatz is doing to allow more registered voters to participate remotely in elections in a safe and secure way is important. It bodes well for more widespread adoption of the Voatz application. That's one reason we've increased our investment in the company by leading this Series A round.""  Voatz's app uses biometrics, encryption and blockchain tech to enable secure and auditable voting, according to the announcement. The firm has also previously assisted voting events held by political parties, universities, labor unions and nonprofits.  ""Voatz has the potential to revolutionize the way we vote. By providing access through a mobile device, Voatz can dramatically increase citizen participation, and the company is committed to ensuring everyone votes safely and securely,"" said Julie Lein, managing partner at Urban Innovation Fund.

42430594,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw5zh,1559826056,Kadena Releases Updated Smart Contract Language for 'Hybrid Blockchains',"""Pact 3.0 generally makes available the features that makes hybrid blockchains a reality. ... We now have the smart contract language for hybrid blockchains.""    That's Stuart Popejoy, the former blockchain team lead at investment banking giant J.P. Morgan and founder of a multi-million dollar enterprise blockchain startup called Kadena.  Today, Popejoy and the Kadena team released a new version of their native computer programming language, called Pact, designed to enable safe and simple smart contract development on the blockchain. The third major release of the code, Popejoy argues that the expanded feature set of Pact 3.0 finally supports cross-blockchain smart contract execution between private and public networks.  At present, Kadena has already built a private blockchain platform called ScalableBFT and will be launching in October of this year a public blockchain platform called Chainweb.  ""A programmer is [now] able to write a very simple smart contract that is able to exchange data back and forth between the public and private parts of a hybrid blockchain application without ever leaving the comfort of the Pact smart contract,"" Popejoy told CoinDesk.  More specifically, today's release of Pact 3.0 has three key feature sets.  First, Pact 3.0 offers simple payment verification (SPV) support. This means that developers can deploy smart contract environments on a Kadena blockchain that independently verifies transactions happening off-chain on other blockchain networks.  Some of the immediate implications of this tooling as outlined by Popejoy include ""proving that something happened on a public blockchain in a private blockchain, proving that something happened on a private blockchain in a public blockchain, [and] proving that something happened on some other [proof-of-work] blockchain (i.e. bitcoin, ethereum).""  Secondly, Pact 3.0 introduces a functionality called ""capabilities"" that help ensure secure, rights-based computing on the blockchain.  ""In the most general sense a capability can be seen as a right to do something that exists in data,"" explained Popejoy.  An example of a capability that already exists on traditional blockchain networks like bitcoin is the use of private and public keys to transfer tokens. By possessing a specific representation of data, users are able to access other resources and functions such as atomic swaps in a smart contract application.  Immutability vs upgrades  Finally, Pact 3.0 also introduces modular governance diversifying how developers can credibly change or update smart contract code. Unlike most other smart contract languages such as Solidity on the ethereum blockchain, Pact is not a Turing-complete language and does not boast immutable decentralized applications (dapps).  Since its inception, any dapp built using Pact can be changed and upgraded after execution through the approval of one or more designated stakeholders.  ""We had upgradeable smart contracts right from the start but it wasn't full governance because a single or multi-signature model is basically a centralized model,"" Popejoy highlighted. ""Now, you can have governance controlled by whatever logic you can think of and an obvious example would be some kind of [token holder] based governance like we see in any kind of staking system.""  The lack of immutability when it comes to Pact-coded applications may butt up against what some consider to be a defining characteristic of smart contracts in general, noted Popejoy.  ""It's really easy to conflate the two, [immutability and smart contracts.]"" Nevertheless, Popejoy maintains that smart contracts aren't actually about immutable, self-executing applications. They're about enabling business models to run safely on a blockchain platform.  Popejoy emphasized:  ""Smart contracts start off as this idea that you can move more business models onto a blockchain but the immediate problem there is that they need to be really safe and not just safe but they to be simple...We think you need to have smart contracts that are simple, that a non-technical user can understand and even code.""

42430582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw5jh,1559822455,DARPA-Funded Study Looks at How Crypto Chats Spread on Reddit,"A U.S. Department of Energy science lab has been studying studying how well three popular cryptos performed in Reddit chats.  According to a press release provided exclusively to CoinDesk, data analysts at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) measured the speed and scale of discussions related to three cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, ethereum, and monero, on Reddit. For the study, they crunched data covering a three-year span from January 2015 to January 2018.  Of the three cryptos, they found bitcoin was the most discussed, with 3,600 comments posted each day. That's far ahead of ethereum and monero, which had an average of 500 and 380 comments per day, respectively.  The PNNL study, which was notably funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), also showed that people responded more quickly to bitcoin posts, taking an average of 11 minutes to start gathering comments.  Posts about monero and ethereum, meanwhile, took on average 20 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, for the discussion to kick off. Discussions on bitcoin were also the fastest to grow, followed by ethereum, then monero.  All this is perhaps to be expected with bitcoin being the top cryptocurrency in terms of market cap and media exposure. However, there were more surprising findings.  In terms of how long a post gets discussed, it was monero that came top with the largest median lifetime. Ethereum posts, on the other hand, had the largest possible lifetimes, while bitcoin discussions had the lowest median lifetime of the three coins.  Bitcoin and ethereum also produced five times more ineffective posts – those that fail to garner any comments – than monero.  The PNNL study, led by Dr. Svitlana Volkova, was launched to better understand online communication patterns and develop a quantitative framework for how such information propagates, according to the press release.  Volkova said:  “Cryptocurrencies are quite unique observable units of information in the way discussions about them spread across social platforms. ... These social signals are quite useful, and by incorporating them with machine and deep learning, we intend to build predictive models that hit on causal relationships between different variables so we can explain model decision-making processes.”  PNNL further said that the analysis presented in its study could be used to inform a variety of financial market analytics. The lab intends to expand its research on the spread of cryptocurrency discussions with other viral trends, such as the spread of computer vulnerabilities and misinformation.  The PNNL study was presented at the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco, California on May 17 and can be found online here.

42430599,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw67h,1559818855,Bitcoin Struggles to Build Momentum After Defense of $7.4K Price Support,"View  Bitcoin is struggling to produce a stronger price bounce, despite the defense of the 4-hour chart's 200-candle moving average – a sign of buyer exhaustion.  A bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart, if confirmed, would open the doors to levels below $7,000. The daily chart continues to call a move lower to the 50-day price average, currently at $6,861.  A minor rally to the $8,200–$8,300 range could be seen if the 4-hour 200-candle average at $7,568 again restricts downside.  A UTC close above the downward sloping (bearish) 10-day MA at $8,284 would invalidate the short-term bearish setup.  A key technical line applied the brakes to bitcoin's (BTC) price sell-off earlier this week, but so far the bounce has been shallow, with upside capped around $7,900.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value began the week on a negative note with prices dropping 7 percent on Monday. The sell-off was extended Tuesday with prices hitting a 2.5-week low of $7,432.  The drop below the widely followed 4-hour chart's 200-candle moving average (MA), then located at $7,970, was short-lived, with prices recovering to $7,900 by the early European trading hours on Wednesday.  The bounce, however, has stalled near $7,900 over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency's inability to produce a stronger corrective rally despite the defense of crucial support validates buyer exhaustion signaled by last week's doji candle.  Further, the price recovery seems to have taken the shape of a bearish continuation pattern on short duration technical charts. So, prices may end up falling back to the 200 candle MA support, currently at $7,568.  At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,810, representing a 0.20 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart  BTC has created a bear flag on the 4-hour chart. Acceptance below the lower edge of that pattern, currently at $7,700, would confirm a flag breakdown – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bearish move.  This type of breakdown is usually followed by a move downwards of roughly the length of the flag's “pole” (the height of the preceding bear move) – in this case from $8,834 to $7,432, a drop of over $1,000.  So, a flag breakdown below $7,700, if confirmed, would theoretically create room for a drop toward $6,800.  The probability of BTC breaking the flag to the lower side is high, as the 50-candle MA is now trending south, indicating a bearish setup, and looks set to cross below the 100-candle MA (bearish crossover).  Daily chart  The daily chart is biased bearish, with the 5- and 10-day MAs sloping downwards, the relative strength index (RSI) reporting a bearish divergence and a violation of the ascending trendline representing the rally from December lows.  What's more, prices closed below the crucial 30-day MA on Tuesday, confirming a bearish reversal and have struggled to post big gains above the former support-turned-resistance ever since.  So risks are skewed to the downside with scope for a drop to the 50-day MA support, currently at $6,861, in the short-term.  The drop to toward the 50-day MA, however, could be preceded by a rally to the $8,200–$8,300 range – that's if the 4-hour chart 200-candle MA at $7,568 again holds ground and fuels a price bounce above $8,000.

Additional consumer offerings will include digital payments from overseas and integrated loyalty programs.  Visa's merchant customers may likewise benefit from the integration, as the firms aim to work together on ways for merchants to interact with the LINE Pay service and its digital wallet.Further, LINE Pay users will be able to use services at Visa’s 54 million merchant locations.

42430593,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw5xh,1559813413,Marshall Islands Sets Up Non-Profit to Oversee National Digital Currency,"The Marshall Islands has set up a not-for-profit organization to oversee the Pacific nation's digital legal tender, the ""Sovereign"" (SOV).  Called the SOV Development Fund, the entity will develop, implement and maintain the infrastructure for the SOV, including the digital currency's management and upgrade, according to a press release published Tuesday.  The government said it expects the fund to promote the use of SOV both domestically and internationally, and to establish an environment in the Marshall Islands that is conducive to the growth of crypto-based industries.  Dr. Peter Dittus, chief economist for SOV and former secretary general of the Bank for International Settlements, said:  “The SOV Development Fund’s mandate is to maintain the SOV infrastructure long term; to seed the ecosystem around the SOV; to promote the SOV and its uses, both domestically and internationally; [and] to smooth the volatility of the SOV by selling and buying SOV against USD.”  The fund will be governed by a board of directors with seven members. Two will be nominated by the government and another two by SFB Technologies – the company hired by the government to develop SOV’s blockchain infrastructure. These four directors will then appoint three more from a list of nominees from ""internationally recognized luminaries in the fields of blockchain, banking, and monetary management.""  The non-profit will also be endowed with 30 percent of the circulating SOB to fund its operations, according to another document from Dr. Dittus. The SOV is planned to be used as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.  Early last year, the Marshall Islands announced its plan to establish the SOV as a national cryptocurrency, making it the first country in the world to move to adopt a digital legal tender.  According to the release, Minister In Assistance to the President, David Paul, said at a recent U.N. blockchain summit:  “We are designing SOV in a way that will not place any burden on the government’s finances. The currency funds itself.”  Intriguingly, the release also added that, after the SOV is launched, the aim is ""to transition to an alternative governance model based on blockchain. Specific technological solutions are still being investigated.""  The launch of the SOV is proceeding in spite of a warning issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last September, in which it raised concerns over the ""significant risks"" the digital currency poses to the country's macroeconomic and financial stability. The IMF further warned that the SOV can be misused for criminal purposes, and the issuance would worsen the country's money laundering and financing terrorism risk profile.

42430587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw5nh,1559808059,Ethereum Startups Team to Offer 'Banking-Grade' Wallet Security,"Two ethereum startups have teamed up to help bring bank account-like protection to users of the second-largest blockchain.  Insurance cooperative Nexus Mutual and wallet provider Argent plan to offer a combination of smart contracts and insurance to keep Argent users’ funds safe from hackers. First, the smart contract is designed to prevent thieves from draining a wallet by temporarily freezing transfers above a daily spending limit to addresses that aren’t on the user’s white list.  The user has 24 hours to cancel the frozen transfer – much like a bank might step in and prevent card fraud or similar suspicious activities on an account. By contrast, the default state for crypto is closer to cash: once it’s gone, it’s gone.  “We are thinking about not just crypto users but also new users – and so the end goal is to repeat what they get from their bank,” said Argent co-founder Itamar Lesuisse.  But in case the smart contract fails to do its job, Nexus and Argent are forming a fund that would insure its members against losses. To participate, users would have to stake Nexus’ NXM tokens, for which they would receive rewards. This is similar to what happens when policyholders of a mutual insurance company receive dividends on their capital.  Of course, when claims are paid, it comes out of the staked tokens.  “In general, what we are trying to do is provide cover to the crypto community when it can't access it via the normal means,” said Nexus founder Hugh Karp.  Back to the future  To be sure, this isn’t quite the same level of protection as FDIC insurance, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. But Nexus is leveraging traditional ideas of customer-centric and community-focused mutualism which has all but vanished from the profit-driven world of insurance today – and doing it using cutting-edge technology.  The product went live last week. Proud to be promoting belt-and-braces protection for users of the wallet, Lesuisse said Argent would also be first in line to eat his own dog food and stake NXM against the wallet’s own smart contracts.  “We want to show people that's how confident we are; we are staking ourselves,” he said.

According to a report from The Information on Wednesday, Facebook is poised to unveil the token – reportedly called GlobalCoin – to the world later in June.  GlobalCoin is apparently aimed to allow users to make transactions via the social media platform, and might also be offered to Facebook employees who want to be paid in the cryptocurrency. Facebook may further set up physical portals for users to purchase the cryptocurrency, the report said.  In addition, Facebook is reportedly inviting external parties to participate in supporting the network as nodes – though it might charge a fee as high as $10 million for the privilege.  The news comes after recent reports that Facebook has begun conversations with global payments providers, crypto industry players, as well as global regulators regarding the opportunity and regulatory issues for its crypto project.  It was reported last month that Facebook will formally launch GlobalCoin in 2020 and is planning to start trials by the end of this year.  Facebook's venture into financial services has long been anticipated since it hired former PayPal president David Marcus to oversee its Messenger app in 2014.

42430595,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMw63h,1559793650,"Bitcoin's 2019 Price Run Driven By Real Transaction Growth, Analysis Shows","An experimental metric used to gauge the quantity and quality of activity on bitcoin’s network clocked a 28-week high last Saturday, signaling the cryptocurrency’s latest price rally may be more fundamentally driven than many expect.  The Transaction Amount to Active Addresses Ratio (TAAR), first proposed by CoinDesk Contributor and Valiendero Digital Assets Founder Chris Brookins, divides bitcoin’s 24-hour adjusted transaction volume (USD) by the number of its active addresses to identify how much each active address spends in transactions per day on average.  If TAAR is high, then it means each user (active address) is transacting in high notional values, in other words, the network ""quantity"" (how much is being spent i.e. transaction volume) is high per the ""quality"" (how many users are spending the funds i.e. active addresses).  When the quantity and quality of bitcoin’s network are high, then one would expect a positive reaction in bitcoin’s market and vice versa when the ratio is low.  Since April of 2013, the oldest data point available via Coinmetrics, this has proven to be the case as it has been made clear bitcoin’s price only enters sustainable trends when it is accompanied by a TAAR trend in the same direction.  Bitcoin's TAAR and Price  As is shown above, bitcoin was only able to escape its bear market in 2015 once its network activity picked up pace, made evident by the TAAR finally failing to set new lows along with bitcoin’s price and beginning to trend upwards (highlighted in the red square).  This, in a sense, added fundamental validation to bitcoin’s price growth at the time, which often falls victim to pure speculation.  Interestingly, bitcoin’s TAAR is once again clearly rising along with its price in a similar fashion to that seen at the end of the previous bear market, potentially suggesting bitcoin’s latest price growth may be sustainable as long as the network activity continues to rise. Corrections in price should be expected, but according to this model, bulls should only be concerned when TAAR loses significant altitude.  Now, the sample size is small spanning just six years, so combining this metric in analysis with other metrics would be fruitful in order to avoid outlier signals, but nonetheless, the TAAR does show an increase in bitcoin’s network activity not seen in several months regardless of its connection to prices.
