However, despite all of the faith that remains in the digital asset, the price continues to tank and has fallen below multiple important support levels. Analyst Goes Deep On Cardano In an interview hosted by Altcoin Daily, crypto analyst Hashoshi shares very bullish views on the Cardano network. He starts out by explaining that the design decisions being made by the Cardano network have been some of the better ones in the space. Going further, Hashoshi lauds the development rate of protocols on the blockchain as projects continue to build. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Send $486 Million To Coinbase, Time To Exit? “Cardano’s done things almost completely different from the start,” the analyst said. “They’re in a good position right now, despite what people might believe, to make a resurgence if the conditions are correct,” he further added. For the price of ADA, the analyst explains that with liquidity coming back into the crypto space, the price of the digital asset could reach above its previous all-time high of $3.10. “The community is still strong… and I think then you see them outstrip that previous all-time high.” Hashoshi is not the only analyst bullish on the price of ADA going forward. Another analyst Kara Szabo has predicted that the price of the digital asset could climb to $5. Szabo also bought $20,000 worth of ADA at the start of September, signaling the analyst’s conviction on the altcoin’s bullish performance going forward. “My conservative price estimate for the next bull run is $5,” Szabo said on X. “I know some people will think this is low, but this is a 20x from the current price!! For a large market cap alt, this very well may be one of the best plays in crypto at the current price point.” Here is my in-depth #Cardano $ada price prediction for the upcoming bull market.

Despite the bullish sentiment that has enveloped the digital asset, the ADA price has continued to struggle in the market. The reason for this decline can be attributed to a significant amount of ADA being unstaked from smart contracts, causing the total staked ADA to slide downward. Data from DeFi tracker DeFiLlama shows that the total tokens staked on the Cardano network dropped from above 777 million on September 2 to 733 million on September 11. This meant that over 43 million ADA were unstaked and likely made their way to the open market as these holders sold their stash. Staked tokens nosedive in September | Source: DeFiLlama Such a large amount being dumped into the market in a period of low liquidity could see the altcoin continue to drop, especially if more ADA is unstaked to be sold in the open market.

As developers flock to the network, investors are expected to follow. At the time of writing, ADA is struggling at $0.24, down 2.33% in the last day and 5.10% in the last week.

From the daily chart, BTC is trading at $25,135, a marginal improvement after dropping to H2 2023 lows of $24,951 minutes earlier following an unexpected dump in the early trading hours of the New York trading session. The Bitcoin Sell-Off Takes Form The crash on September 11 saw the coin drop below the consolidation of the past few trading days with the bearish breakdown, looking at price action, canceling bulls of August 31, and setting an increased selling pressure on August 17. The September 11 sell-off has seen a wide-ranging bear candlestick form. Even though it continues to print, it has relatively high trading volume, indicating high participation levels. Since the bar has above-average volumes, BTC will likely edge lower in the direction defined by the conspicuous bear bar of August 17, when the coin fell 12%, forcing BTC to trend below the $28,700 support level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Future In Question: What’s Next After Today’s Price Drop? Looking at price action, Bitcoin bears are in control and are actively reversing gains posted between June and July 2023. Then, Bitcoin prices rose from around the $20,000 level to as high as $31,800 by the end of July 2023. Afterward, the coin peaked and began falling as talks of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) faded following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to put off their decision. At spot rates, Bitcoin is down 20% from July 2023 lows but trading at critical Fibonacci retracement levels of the June to July 2023 resistance levels. Even though BTC and crypto prices tend to post deep retracements, the coin may find support at around $25,000. However, further losses from spot rates in continuation of the August 17 bear bar may see sellers press on rewind gains and force BTC towards June 2023 lows at around $20,000. The Death Cross On The Bitcoin Chart Based on technical candlestick arrangements, one analyst notes that the coin closed below the $25,600 mark after the close of last week’s bar. With this dip, the Ichimoku Cloud indicator has printed a “Death Cross.” Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Reveals The Countries Topping The 75,000 Holder List Technical analysts note that Bitcoin prices tend to dump when this pattern forms before eventually rebounding over several weeks. Previous instances of the “Death Cross” occurred in June 2021 and January 2022, which saw BTC drop 19% and 23%, respectively. Based on this, if a “Death Cross” prints, BTC may dump by 21%, forcing the coin back to the $20,000 level or June 2023 lows. Before then, BTC has to breach strong support levels at $25,600, $24,000, and $23,200 before retesting the $20,300 zone.

Asset manager Abraxas Capital transferred 14,130 ETH – worth roughly $22.5 million – to Bitfinex in two transactions, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence noted in an X post. Major market maker Jump Trading sent nearly 236 BTC – worth $5.9 million – to Binance in one installment, Arkham added.  Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain noted that Wintermute, another large market maker, deposited more than $3.3 million in ARB to Binance over the past 8 hours.  Smaller traders follow the on-chain maneuvers of large institutional traders as they are considered well-informed and have significant sway over the market. Sending tokens to exchanges may signal intention to sell, but it can also be part of market makers shuffling funds between different exchanges to provide liquidity.  Today’s transfers happened as crypto markets turned down sharply on concerns about crypto exchange FTX potentially shedding its $3.4 billion digital asset stash. September is a historically turbulent month for digital assets, with BTC scoring negative returns every year since 2016, Coinglass data shows.

42419651,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFD25,1694466503,Defiant Gensler Returns to Crypto Grievances Ahead of Senate Testimony,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is doubling down on his crypto objections in his first remarks following the second recent court setback in his agency’s sweeping legal fight with the industry.  After decisions in the Ripple case that energized crypto advocates and the even more pronounced failure of the SEC’s Grayscale bitcoin ETF dispute, Gensler is holding the line on warning about the sector flaunting securities laws, according to written testimony set for delivery to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.  “Given this industry’s wide-ranging noncompliance with the securities laws, it’s not surprising that we’ve seen many problems in these markets,” Gensler said in the remarks released Monday, on the eve of the routine SEC oversight hearing.  Gensler will return to a frequent talking point at the hearing:  “The vast majority of crypto tokens likely meet the investment contract test,” according to his testimony. “Given that most crypto tokens are subject to the securities laws, it follows that most crypto intermediaries have to comply with securities laws as well.”  The court judgment in the case involving Ripple and its sales of XRP argued that the way Ripple sold the tokens to retail consumers did not violate securities law. Though the SEC is pursuing an appeal, a number of other crypto companies facing suits from the regulator are likely to quote it in their own motions to dismiss. However, at least one other judge in the same court discarded the Ripple judgment in a recent ruling against Terraform Labs.  While Gensler will be highlighting recent enforcement actions and two of the agency’s rule proposals that effect crypto firms – a proposal on custody and one on redefining the exchange definitions to formally incorporate crypto platforms – he’ll also advise the lawmakers he won’t be able to talk about any “active, ongoing litigation,” which potentially sets aside the topics the industry is most eagerly watching, like the SEC’s high-profile cases against Coinbase and Binance.

The news sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, with SOL and BTC experiencing negative price movements. Related Reading: Lost In Transaction: Bitcoin User Overpaid By $500,000 For A $200 Deal SOL And BTC Experience Declines As FTX Prepares For Liquidation Solana (SOL), trading around the $20 level on Sunday, witnessed a significant decline in response to the news. Its price plummeted to its current level of $17.83. Bitcoin (BTC) also retraced by over 2.7% in the past hours, reaching as low as $24,9000. In addition to SOL and BTC, the court filing revealed other significant holdings of the FTX estate. These include Ethereum (ETH), valued at $192 million, Aptos (APT) at $137 million, Tether’s stablecoin (USDT) at $120 million, and XRP at $119 million, among others such as wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and wrapped Ethereum (WETH), Bit (BIT), and Stargate Finance (STG). The court filing further highlighted that the FTX estate had secured cash throughout the Chapter 11 process, employing a post-petition cash management system. The Debtors “successfully” navigated the Q1 2023 financial banking turmoil and obtained fiat from more than 30 banking institutions worldwide. Cash has been consolidated and safeguarded within a Master account, with unrestricted cash increasing primarily through venture investment monetization and stablecoin conversions. This Wednesday, the FTX estate is expected to seek approval to liquidate approximately $3.4 billion of cryptocurrencies. This step marks a significant milestone in the bankruptcy proceedings. Options For Relaunch? On September 11, Fortune Magazine reported that the FTX estate had approached over 75 potential bidders, evaluating the possibility of relaunching the bankrupt crypto exchange. The stakeholders were given a deadline of September 24 to submit their proposals for “FTX 2.0.” The process considers various potential structures, including acquisition, merger, recapitalization, or other transactions to relaunch FTX.com and/or FTX US exchanges. While the specific identities of the bidders remain undisclosed, blockchain technology company Figure and venture capital firm Tribe Capital have been previously mentioned as potential suitors for the relaunch. The exploration of FTX’s relaunch represents a key development in the effort to sell off, rebrand, or restart the exchange, which has been at the center of a high-profile white-collar criminal case. FTX’s native token, FTT, has experienced positive price movement on news of the potential launch of FTX 2.0. On Monday, it traded nearly 17% higher than at the beginning of the year, reflecting market optimism surrounding the prospect of a relaunch. As the bankruptcy proceedings unfold and the FTX estate moves towards liquidation, the crypto industry will closely monitor the impact on the market and the resolution of outstanding debts. The search for bidders to revive the exchange introduces an additional layer of complexity to this evolving situation, with potential implications for the future of FTX and its stakeholders. Related Reading: Remember That Guy That Lost A Flashdrive With 8,000 BTC? Here’s What He’s Up To Now Overall, the bankruptcy of the failed crypto exchange has revealed substantial asset holdings of $7 billion, including significant amounts of Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC).

The outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings and the relaunch efforts will shape the future trajectory of FTX and its position within the industry.

Crypto CEO Sentenced To 11,196 Years Prison Sentence On Thursday, September 7, 2023, the former CEO of Thodex, which was one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Turkey, was reportedly sentenced to 11,196 years, 10 months, and 15 days in prison for several criminal charges including fraud, leading a criminal organization, and money laundering by the Anatolian 9th Heavy Penal Court. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Sounds Warning Alarm As Scammers Siege Shibarium The former CEO reportedly defrauded over 400,000 Turkish customers of more than $2 billion in deposits when the exchange went offline in April 2021, and Özer fled the country immediately after the exchange went offline. The prosecutors had initially requested a 40,562-year prison sentence for the former crypto exchange CEO. However, the final verdict saw the sentence reduced to 11,196 years, the longest sentence so far for a crypto crime. Furthermore, a judicial fine of 135 million Liras was also imposed on the former CEO, according to local media. Faruk Fatih Özer was not the only one involved in the alleged crime. Following the investigation, 83 people were arrested and detained, and four other senior employees were jailed. When the case was thoroughly investigated, Özer‘s sister Serap Özer, and brother Guven Özer, were also found guilty of the same charges and were given the same prison sentence respectively. Although these jail terms may seem outrageous and unfamiliar to many, they are very common in Turkey due to the country’s death sentence eradication since 2004. In 2022, TV cult preacher Adnan Oktar was convicted of fraud and sexual assault and was sentenced to 8,658 years in prison along with 10 of his followers. Total market cap collapses to $1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Former Thodex Boss Denies Criminal Claims The 29-year-old former crypto boss was arrested in Albania in August 2022 where he was serving jail terms after fleeing Turkey in April 2021 when his crypto exchange first collapsed. Before his arrest, Özer denied claims against him fleeing the country intentionally when the Thodex exchange went dark. His response to the allegations was that he was out of the country because of business meetings. Özer was arrested after Interpol issued a red notice against him, and was extradited back to Turkey in April 2023 to face the charges against him. He was then detained by the police upon arrival and held on seven charges. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Bull Case For XRP Price To Hit $130, Here’s When Some of the charges included establishing and managing an organization with the purpose of committing a crime, fraud by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, being a member of an organization, fraud of merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and laundering the value of assets resulting from crime, among others. The court believed that Özer had fraudulent intentions right from the beginning and that the crypto exchange Thodex was a criminal organization from the start. However, Özer denied these claims against him and said Thodex was just a crypto company that went bankrupt in 2021 and had no fraudulent intention. He also told the court that he was very smart and he would not have acted so amateurish if he was looking to be a criminal.

17494320,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550819,1694458828,"Bitcoin Dips Below $25,000 As Former Paypal President Hails It As Universal Internet Currency","In an interview with CNBC on Monday, David Marcus, former President of Paypal and Head of Facebook Payments, expressed his belief that Bitcoin (BTC) is the universal protocol for money on the internet. He emphasized Bitcoin’s significance as the flagship cryptocurrency and its core value as a payment solution while discussing its potential as a global payment network. Bitcoin As The Universal Protocol For Internet Money Despite enduring a challenging period and navigating various headwinds in recent months, Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market. According to Marcus, Bitcoin’s prominence is not solely due to its market position but is also driven by its ability to serve as a universal protocol for internet money. Related Reading: Lost In Transaction: Bitcoin User Overpaid By $500,000 For A $200 Deal Marcus highlighted the absence of a universal protocol for value transfer on the internet, stating, “There’s no universal protocol for money on the internet that enables value to be transported.” He explained that the vision is to transform Bitcoin into a global payment network, providing a seamless and efficient means of transferring value across borders. One of the advantages Marcus cited for Bitcoin is its availability and accessibility. Unlike traditional financial systems, where individuals may face fees and the need to visit a branch during limited hours, Bitcoin operates 24/7. This inherent characteristic of Bitcoin allows for greater convenience and flexibility, enabling users to transact at any time, including weekends. While acknowledging Bitcoin’s potential as a payment network, Marcus noted that its primary function may not be as a currency for everyday purchases. He stated, “Our view is that BTC is not the currency people will use to buy things.” However, he emphasized Bitcoin’s role as the universal protocol for money on the Internet, enabling secure and efficient value transfer across various digital platforms. As Bitcoin continues to gain attention and recognition, Marcus’s endorsement further solidifies its position as the flagship cryptocurrency and reinforces its potential as the universal protocol for internet money. BTC Trading Volume Hits Lowest Level Since 2019 According to Satoshi Club data, Bitcoin is experiencing a significant slump in its daily trading volume, reaching its lowest point since February 2019 at just $5.4 billion. This decline has been attributed to a lack of market enthusiasm following the collapse of FTX. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price dipped to $24,900 on Monday, the lowest level since June, exacerbating concerns about a potential extended decline shortly. The dwindling daily trading volume of Bitcoin indicates a prevailing apathy among traders, with reduced participation and a lack of significant buy or sell activity. This trend is reminiscent of the market sentiment observed after the collapse of FTX, which has had a lingering impact on investor confidence. Of particular concern is that Bitcoin’s price dropped to $24,900 on Monday, reflecting a downward trend that has persisted since BTC reached its annual high of $31,800 on July 14. This decline has intensified worries among market participants about the possibility of a prolonged downward trajectory for Bitcoin in the coming weeks.

These changes will come into effect by Oct. 6, two days before the U.K.’s new crypto promotion rules are set to come into force. CoinDesk and Luno are both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group.  “The FCA has implemented new rules for crypto firms. As a result, all compliant crypto firms with U.K. customers are making a number of changes to their platforms in order to comply with the new regulations,” Taylor said. “For Luno, this includes pausing the ability to invest through the platform for some customers for the time being.”  An email shown to CoinDesk from a Luno client said that they would be unable to buy or trade crypto as of Oct. 6.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s new promotion rules will treat crypto like “restricted mass market investments” and require any advertisements or promotions to contain clear warnings and ban incentives. Though the new rules were set to take effect on Oct. 8, firms can now apply for an extra three months to apply the rules.  Luno is not the only one pausing parts of its U.K. business temporarily. In response to these rules, PayPal also said it would halt crypto purchases in October till 2024.  Affected Luno customers can still sell and withdraw their funds, Taylor added. “We are taking a phased approach to reintroducing investment opportunities to our customers,” he said.

42419641,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFCsn,1694456363,Will the CFTC Blot Out DeFi in the U.S.?,"Is DeFi done for in the U.S.? Last week, in one fell swoop, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued three separate companies building some of the most respectable decentralized finance protocols. Deridex, Opyn and ZeroEx were all accused of illegally offering financial products to U.S. persons without the proper registration.  What’s not clear is whether those financial products would have been otherwise legal, had the protocols’ developers played by the rules and registered.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Is there actually a path forward for DeFi in the U.S.?  In its press release, the CFTC was specific about the labels it would have applied to the DeFi apps. Opyn, for instance, a type of decentralized insurance provider, should have had licenses for a “swap execution facility” (SEF) and “designated contract market” (DCM) as well as a “futures commission merchant” (FCM), the agency wrote.  If Opyn had had those certifications, and added a standard know-your-customer (KYC) setup to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) would things be different? Or, is there something fundamental about the way DeFi operates that will always cut against U.S. law?  Some industry experts like lawyer Gabriel Shapiro have been saying for months that DeFi is a dead-end in the U.S. Ever since the CFTC sued Ooki DAO, Shapiro has been recommending DeFi protocols find ways to block U.S. users.  As it turns out, Opyn was trying to geo-fence U.S. users from the front-end website that interacts with the protocol’s underlying smart contract. It wasn’t enough – at least for the CFTC, which noted: “those steps were not sufficient to actually block U.S. users from accessing the Opyn Protocol.”  That’s at least because DeFi itself can’t be ring-fenced, only the gangways and apps used to access its protocols. By nature blockchain-based tools are global and incapable of discriminating against any potential use – as long as you can pay the gas fees, you can transact (that’s the beauty of blockchain).  And yet, despite the fact that DeFi was built expressly to gut the world’s financial regulation and surveillance, there are still a number of regulators who think regulating DeFi could work. On the same day as the CFTC’s triple whammy enforcement, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham proposed a regulatory sandbox for the sector.  “Staying ahead of the curve requires being ready to look to the future and preparing to embrace change,” said Pham, who also runs the agency’s Global Markets Advisory Committee.  Pham’s comments aren’t far off from what CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger said in her dissenting opinion to the crackdown on Deridex, Opyn and ZeroEx. Apart from the usual line about the CFTC regulating through enforcement, Mersinger also raised the point that the CFTC failed to demonstrate what the protocols actually did wrong.  See also: Is the CFTC as Crypto's Regulatory Savior? | Opinion  “The Commission’s Orders in these cases give no indication that customer funds have been misappropriated or that any market participants have been victimized by the DeFi protocols on which the Commission has unleashed its enforcement powers,” she wrote. In other words, where is the liability or the justification for sanctioning them?  This to me seems like the nut of the issue. Although the CFTC hasn’t been expressly tasked with overseeing decentralized service providers, it can still shut them down simply for not filing the right paperwork. Forget whether DeFi is provably more transparent than traditional financial operators, or that it levels the playing field and forces everyone to play by the same rules.  This isn’t to say DeFi doesn’t have its issues. Applications are routinely hacked, token allocations are deeply inequitable and DAOs have proven harder to govern than expected.  As CFTC Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley put it: “Somewhere along the way, DeFi operators got the idea that unlawful transactions become lawful when facilitated by smart contracts. They do not.”  The law being broken? Say it with me now: They failed to register.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/11/will-the-cftc-blot-out-defi-in-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0dc1e8b4cca5037925d0ee312f42162a65fcbb7-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recent sweep of lows has resulted in a perfected TD9 buy setup according to the weekly TD Sequential indicator. Although this sounds positive for crypto, if the signal fails, there is risk of an extreme drop ahead. Here is a closer look at why. Is The TD Sequential Telling Us To Buy The Dip In Bitcoin? Things are improving for Bitcoin price action, but the situation surrounding altcoins and the increasingly negative macro environment has kept upside momentum at bay. The result over the last several weeks has been another BTCUSD downtrend. This series of down weeks has satisfied a specific sequence required to trigger a TD9 buy setup. A perfected TD9 buy setup has appeared | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Even more important, the signal has been “perfected” now that price has made a lower low on weekly timeframes.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Most “Oversold” Record Since 2020: What This Means Former TDST resistance was located at $25,250, which is potentially being retested now.

However the dust settles could determine the future trend for the remainder of the year. Will this TD buy setup lead to a reversal, or further failure for bulls to establish a new bull market?

42419646,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFCxx,1694454681,Bitcoin Drops Below $25K With Altcoins Bracing for Deeper Crash from FTX Crypto Sale,"Crypto markets tumbled Monday as traders got spooked by the potential selling pressure from bankrupt exchange FTX. Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 2% and briefly dipped to as low as $24,963 during U.S. morning hours, its first time below the $25,000 level since mid-June. It has pared some of those losses since, now trading at around $25,140, 2.6% lower in the last 24 hours.  Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization, was down 3.2% on the day, changing hands at $1,560.  The broad market proxy CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) fell by 3%.  Altcoins hit hardest on FTX worry  Alternative cryptocurrencies – altcoins – are underperforming, led by Solana’s SOL with a more than 8% decline. Toncoin’s TON and layer 2 Arbitrum’s ARB tumbled similar amounts and Ripple’s XRP suffered a 5% loss.  The downward action happened as market participants were digesting the possibility of FTX securing approval from bankruptcy court to sell assets from its $3.4 billion of cryptocurrency holdings.  Singapore-based digital asset services provider Matrixport noted in a Monday market report that “an altcoin crash is coming” as FTX might start selling tokens as early as this week.  SOL is facing the most significant pressure, as FTX holds $1.16 billion worth of that token, CoinDesk reported earlier Monday. That’s nearly 16% of its outstanding supply, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  The bankrupt exchange also holds $560 million in BTC and hundreds of millions in lesser known illiquid micro-cap tokens. The firm has already tapped digital asset investment firm Galaxy to assist with the sales.  Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) price outlook  Matrixport said that FTX’s crypto sales could weigh on altcoin prices for the rest of the year.  SOL broke down from the $19 level with increasing volume, Matrixport noted, calling the move “concerning” and potentially opening the way for further declines to next support levels at $15 and then $10.  ETH also could drop further as the protocol’s “revenue growth disappoints,” according to the firm.  “Technically, the break of $1,650 makes us extremely cautious about ETH here, and we could even envision a scenario where prices materially drop lower into year-end,” said Matrixport. “A decline below $1,500 could bring back the idea that ETH could decline to $1,000.”  “The altcoins of the previous bull markets appear tainted due to poor tokenomics and might never come back while we need a new theme for the next generation of altcoins to gain traction,” Markus Thielen, Matrixport’s head of research and strategy, said in a LinkedIn post. “In the meantime, keeping exposure to bitcoin makes the most sense.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/11/bitcoin-drops-below-25k-with-altcoins-bracing-for-deeper-crash-from-ftx-crypto-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb766f3cd839f51708e38ecc50143c9c67f0c554-2606x1464.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin New Addresses Metric Shot Up During This Past Weekend According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC has just observed its highest number of new addresses since 2017. The relevant metric here is the “new addresses,” which simply keeps track of the total number of new addresses appearing on the Bitcoin network every day. Generally, new users coming into the network aren’t the only ones generating new addresses as existing holders of the asset may also create new addresses for better privacy of their transactions and other purposes like dividing funds into multiple wallets. Regardless of this, a good chunk of the new addresses being created on any given day are indeed signs that new investors are coming into the market, so the indicator can provide us with hints about how the adoption of the cryptocurrency is coming along. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Sell 1.02 Billion ADA, More Pain Ahead? When this metric has a high value, it naturally means that a large number of addresses are coming online for the first time on the blockchain, which could suggest that new traffic is being attracted to the blockchain currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin new addresses over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, the metric’s value shot up during the weekend that has just passed by, suggesting a significant amount of address creation has occurred. At the peak of this spike, the daily value of the metric had been about 719,000 addresses, which is the highest that the indicator has been since 2017. The spike in 2017 is an all-time high for the daily new addresses, which means that this latest value is the second-highest spike that the asset has ever seen. This extraordinary influx of new addresses on the network would imply a large amount of investors have decided to enter into the market. Historically, adoption has been a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency, as a large user base provides for a more solid foundation for sustainable growth in the future. Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks Another Record: HODLers On Network Now Exceed 5 Million Any positives arising from adoption, however, typically don’t appear in the short-term periods, as the effect only plays a role for the asset in the longer timespans. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to struggle recently as the asset has been devoid of any sort of real volatility. At present, the asset’s price is floating around the $25,600 mark. These recent prices may be what has pushed new users toward the network, as they may have found the current lows to be a viable entry point into the market. However, as mentioned before, this adoption is unlikely to be of any help to the cryptocurrency right now, unless the users coming in are the likes of the whales.

42419649,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFD13,1694448267,The G20’s Crypto Hand-Wringing Is Not Significant,"This weekend kicked off the G20 summit in India, which will apparently deliver a group agreement on the need for stricter global regulation on crypto assets, according to a report Sept. 6 in The Hindu.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Why this matters  On the one hand, this is a big deal in that key global regulators are working at constructing a coordinated framework for crypto regulation. This acknowledges an acceptance of three key features of crypto assets:  1 – they are global: a bitcoin in Bengaluru is exactly the same as a bitcoin in Seattle.  2 – they can cross borders without detection: the impact on capital flows understandably triggers a desire to monitor this, hence the drive for cooperation.  3 – they are here to stay: banning them is no longer an option, so, from the authorities’ point of view, control is the next best thing.  On the other hand, the parties behind the initiative highlight some fractures underlying the apparent cohesion, as well as the shifting allegiances of global politics. This makes the fuss and the focus more noise than substance.  India  Let’s start with India, which has long been calling for global coordination on crypto regulation. When it assumed the presidency of the G20 in December of last year, it made crypto coordination one of the key goals of its mandate and statements made throughout the year have reiterated this focus.  But India is not exactly crypto-friendly.  As crypto markets developed, trading became such a popular activity that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank and financial regulator, felt compelled to issue regular warnings about the risks of crypto asset trading (one from 2013 even mentions dogecoins).  Read more: India Will Decide on Its Crypto Stance in Coming Months  In 2018, the RBI went further and issued a circular prohibiting banks from offering services to “any individual or business entities dealing with or settling virtual currencies.” In 2020, India’s Supreme Court overturned this circular, and in 2021, the RBI issued a statement stressing that banks could service virtual currency companies as long as they carry out the required due diligence.  Banks have nevertheless been reluctant to engage with crypto services, presumably out of fear of attracting the attention of their regulator which they know disapproves of the activity. This is similar to the situation in the U.S.: servicing crypto companies is not illegal, but the powers-that-be don’t like it, and the corresponding revenue is not enough to compensate for the risk of additional scrutiny. Banks generally do not want to get on the wrong side of their regulators – that often turns out to be expensive.  What’s more, in early 2022, India imposed a 30% tax on all crypto income and trading profits, double that of the standard capital gains tax. This is even more punitive than it may seem, as the income is not considered on a net basis. Losses in one asset cannot offset gains in another. Nevertheless, it conferred a certain legitimacy on crypto activities – if the government is taxing it, it can’t be illegal, right?  The country’s banking regulator still did not seem to agree, however. In the same month, it reiterated its conviction that crypto assets should be banned, with the deputy governor calling them “worse than Ponzi schemes,” and the governor saying that they were “not even a tulip” (ouch).  The central bank is just one arm of the government and does not speak for the Finance Ministry, but the tone is obviously not supportive, which imbues the calls for global regulation with a hint of reluctance.  G20  Moving on to the G20 itself, its pronouncements and agreements are significant but not binding. It has no regulatory authority, and its legitimacy is conferred by the standing of its members. This is shifting.  First, many assume that the group represents the world’s 20 largest economies. This is not so. Most members are in the top 20, but not all, and some economies that are in the top 20 have been left out.  Spain, for instance, is the world’s 15th largest economy in terms of GDP. It’s not a member. It has representation via the EU, but so do France and Germany which also have individual membership. Spain is a “permanent guest,” but that’s not the same. Netherlands (17th) is also not a member. Nor is Switzerland (20th), even though its economy has a higher GDP than Argentina’s, which is. South Africa (39th) is a member, but Nigeria and Egypt, both of which are larger in terms of GDP, are not.  Apparently, the membership list was decided back in 2008 by deputies from Germany and the U.S., who added countries beyond the original G8 according to whose development they wanted to help “guide.” Membership has not changed since then, even though economic weight has.  Read more: G20 Set to Crystalize Global Crypto Rules as India Wraps Up Presidency  Last Thursday, it was announced that the African Union will become an official member as of 2024, in theory giving voice to its 55 states. While it made no sense for such a key economic region to be represented by only one country (South Africa), the African Union doesn’t exactly speak with one voice, so it’s not clear how beneficial this will be.  As for internal support, all member nations are sending representatives to attend what looks like a packed agenda, but China’s premier Xi Jinping is giving it a miss, even though he wouldn’t have far to travel. He did find it worth his time to cross a couple of continents to attend the recent BRICS summit in South Africa. Putin is also not attending, for obvious reasons.  Externally, some have called the G20 “multilateralism of the big.” And an article in the New York Times last week highlights the futility of many recent G20 initiatives. In the 2021 Rome summit, for example, a pact was reached to limit global warming with, among other measures, a pledge to end the financing of coal power plants overseas. Glossing over how “colonial” this sounds (what does “overseas” mean?), last year coal-fired power generation reached an all-time high according to the International Energy Agency, a record that looks set to be beat this year.  So, let’s assume that we get some firm statements from the group in support of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB’s) latest policy recommendations, published in July. That’s very likely, since the recommendations don’t actually say anything interesting. There’s a smattering of “authorities should have the appropriate powers,” apply regulation, cooperate with each other and require crypto asset service providers to manage their risk carefully, and not much else. I mean, all that sounds fair, but to this interested observer, there seems to be a lot of noise about nothing.  True, the recommendations do urge tighter regulation than many regimes (such as the U.S.) have in place at the moment. Let’s assume that this is taken as an imperative: will China conform? Will Argentina? Will all African Union member states? Will the EU be willing to adapt its hard-won MiCA framework to conform with a direction guided by a very different political and economic system (that of India)? And beyond the G20 (or is it now the G21?), does Barbados care? Tuvalu?  The theory is that they all will if they want to maintain their seat at the table, and/or friendship with those who have one. But who decides if a nation should be kicked out? Russia is still a member, and it can be argued that invading another country is more cause for censure than not adopting certain financial regulations.  And, there are now alternatives. The BRICS alliance has just more than doubled its membership. Other blocs are also busy.  What’s more, the G20 focus is about to change, and with it, perhaps the pressure for that elusive global coordination. There are less than three months left in India’s G20 presidency.  Brazil takes over in December, and its regime has so far been much more supportive of crypto markets. The country already has a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, a crypto exchange is participating in CBDC trials with the central bank, banks connect with crypto platforms, spot crypto ETFs have been trading on stock exchanges for over two years, and the country’s largest public bank allows the payment of taxes in cryptocurrency. In many, many ways, Brazil is not India, and it is likely to steer the G20’s focus in another direction.  So, we will probably see a lot of hand-wringing over the restrictive nature of whatever agreement emerges, but none of it will matter much.  There is upside to this. Discussions are important, if only to clarify situations and priorities. And we now have pretty close to a global consensus that attempting to ban crypto is futile. So, we can let the G20 do what it wants on the crypto regulations front. It’s not a threat to the ecosystem, even if it does recommend stricter disclosure rules than many would like. Rather, it takes steps to further legitimize crypto assets and their markets, and subliminally acknowledges that its influence in this field is limited.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/11/the-g20s-crypto-hand-wringing-is-not-significant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/837a6525d65c0ae291d7fc3732921630d95b58c7-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Howells Threatens Legal Action Against NCC After 10 years of searching for the elusive flash drive carrying a fortune of 8,000 BTC, Howells has taken an aggressive approach to his hunt and threatened the NCC with proper legal action that may see the council firmly bankrupt if the court rules in favor of Howells. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Sounds Warning Alarm As Scammers Siege Shibarium The NCC is a single-tier unitary authority that oversees the administration of all areas in Newport, one of the principal areas in Wales. Howells has been in contact with the council over the years, requesting permission to undergo a landfill excavation in the area that supposedly harbors the flash drive. Howells claims that he has raised sufficient funds to propel the excavation work and only needed the council to give the go-ahead. However, the NCC has been adamant about its rejection despite Howells’ funding claims. The council has consistently declined Howells’ requests for a landfill excavation, with reasons of environmental concerns and prioritizing working officers’ time who ensure the safety and well-being of Newport residents. “In the current environment, we cannot justify wasting officers’ valuable time providing services to the residents of Newport,” a council spokesperson stated. In response to the multiple rejections, Howells has stated that he would sue the council for damages worth $557 million. He has submitted a letter to the council, demanding a concession to perform a landfill excavation on Monday, September 18. Following a failure to adhere to the ultimatum, Howells has requested a judicial review to evaluate the legitimacy of the council’s judgment to reject his Bitcoin recovery efforts.

But today, even the most promising startups have a hard time gaining the attention of top VCs.  According to Crunchbase, “Global venture funding in Q2 2023 fell … 49% compared to the second quarter of 2022 when startup investors spent $127 billion.”  The overall deal volume has also decreased significantly by 37%.  “More than 6,000 startups raised funding this past quarter, compared to more than 9,500 for the same time period a year ago.”  Read more: Blockchain and AI Are Set to Transform Financial Markets: Moody's  The primary cause of this shakiness is the radical increase in interest rates from near zero to 5.5% – a high number for investors making risky decisions. Investors are also not happy with the IPO drought and the lack of exit opportunities in the market.  Kevin Colleran, co-founder at early-stage firm Slow Ventures, an investor in crypto companies, told VCCircle, “I haven't written any checks in the past 18 months. I have 30 portfolio companies that I need to help figure out how to survive. There is no point for me to add to the misery.”  For crypto, the situation is worse.  The entire crypto industry made 382 deals in Q2 2023 for a net total of just $2.34 billion. Compared to Q1 2022’s $12.14 billion, these are meager numbers.  Crypto and Web3 startups specializing in various spaces raised a total of $29B and $33B in two consecutive years ‘21 and ‘22.  However, since Q1 2022, we have seen five consecutive months in the red.     What caused this collapse?  After a hype-fueled bull run starting in 2020, a slew of disastrous events discouraged even the most pro-crypto VCs.  The failure of Celsius, Voyager, 3AC, Luna/UST, and, of course, FTX made 2022 a crypto investing nightmare.  The latter caused the most damage as the FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was revered by all the prestigious VC funds and was the primary representative of the new asset class to regulators in Washington.  The FTX fiasco destroyed whatever investor confidence was left in the crypto industry, resulting in major investors moving away to greener pastures. Big VCs like Sequoia, an investor in FTX, are slashing their crypto funds.  Enter AI.  The AI dominance started the same month FTX collapsed, filling the vacuum created in the market. Since then, AI has been unstoppable.  AI projects have been commanding huge VC rounds with valuations that are difficult to justify. Generative AI startups raised $1.6-plus billion in Q1 2023. Companies like Anthropic raised $450 million; Adept AI raised $350 million.  That number nearly doubled when Inflection AI alone raised $1.3 billion in June at a $4 billion valuation.  While AI is one of the most promising spaces in tech, these numbers are mind boggling, to say the least. And with the recent GPU shortage, most of this money will be spent on securing computation tools rather than actual innovation.  VCs chase the hot trends — it’s not a disputed fact. And the hot AI trend, however unsustainable, is working to the detriment of crypto.  I’ve been seeing this trend up close. In November 2022, a metaverse startup in my network had almost confirmed pre-seed funding from one of the big four VCs. A week after, FTX crashed and the firm rescinded the term sheet.  AI dominance started the same month FTX collapsed, filling the vacuum created in the market  This is just one of many incidents that have been taking place since last year. AI has received almost $28 billion so far in 2023 — almost 20% of global VC funding.  Companies like Meta, which changed its name to signal its metaverse ambitions, have cut down considerably on its vision.  To work around the general crypto phobia, a lot of crypto projects are adding AI components to the core product. Projects like Jada are much more likely to gain mainstream VC interest today than pure crypto projects.  In my experience running Transcend Labs, I have seen this work out in two ways. Some projects actually find a way to innovate and integrate AI functionalities, strengthening the core product.  But the majority is just banking on the AI trend to gain traction. The AI part doesn’t play any crucial role in the core crypto product. And, sometimes the AI component impacts the shift to decentralization.  So is there a way out for crypto founders? Of course, there is!  Unlike mainstream AI which isn’t even a year old, crypto has been present for more than a decade. Thanks to the cyclical movement of the crypto economy, we can confidently predict more innovation and investor interest as the bear market ends. Lower interest rates, globalized crypto regulation, Bitcoin ETF approvals, and more TradFi involvement in crypto could all reignite VC flows.  In the meantime, founders should focus on building in stealth mode with a small community. Consequential projects like Ethereum or Aave have faced several bear markets and managed to get out of it with a better product and user experience. Other projects can do the same.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Chris Coll-Beswick,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/11/ai-is-killing-crypto-venture-capital-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b694fa96b9461823c45ae8ff1612fc2ac3592659-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These fees can reach hundreds of dollars depending on the transaction size, but a user might have broken the record. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Reveals The Countries Topping The 75,000 Holder List 20 Bitcoin To Move $200, What Happened? Data from the analytics platform mempool.space, a user paid over $500,000 or 20 Bitcoin to transfer around $200. The chart below shows that the transaction fee has almost reached 200 million satoshis (sats). Jameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO at CASA speculated about the transaction and why a single entity would pay such a high fee to send a small amount of money. Lopp stated: The transaction that paid nearly 20 BTC ($500,000) fee a few hours ago looks like an exchange or payment processor with buggy software. They’ve received 60,000+ txns and sent 60,000+ txns from the same address (bad practice) and likely calculated their change output incorrectly. In addition, CASA’S CTO stated that the transaction came from a “hot wallet,” a Bitcoin address connected to the internet, with the characteristics of those used by crypto exchanges and other enterprises. Lopp added: It looks like it only receives deposits from one address to top up its balance every now and then. Spending pattern is one long peel chain! As of this writing, the crypto exchange or company that owns this Bitcoin wallet seems unaware of its bug. The entity still holds over $10 million or 421 BTC on the hot wallet. Moreover, the entity that paid $500,000 to move $200 seems active. The hot wallet records over 61,000 transactions, many occurring in the past hour alone, since its inception in late June 2023. As Lopp noted, the address operates solely as a withdrawal hot wallet. The executive concluded that the transactions recorded by the wallet seem automated and probably the result of software created by a new entity in the crypto space. Lopp said: “Looks like they haven’t noticed; they still have a ton of funds in the wallet and it’s still sending transactions.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confirms Double Top, How Low Can BTC Drop?

The presentation details billions in payments the company – previously one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges – made to senior executives including founder Sam Bankman-Fried, before it filed for bankruptcy in November.  The company collapsed after CoinDesk published revelations concerning the state of its balance sheet last year. New CEO John J. Ray III has berated financial controls at the company, while Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to multiple fraud charges, with a trial due to start next month.  The company has secured $1.5 billion in cash in addition to the $1.1 billion it held on Nov. 11, and also holds $3.4 billion in crypto as valued at Aug. 31, the document said. That’s in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of over 1,300 lesser known and potentially less liquid tokens such as MAPS and serum (SRM).  The presentation also details $2.2 billion in cash, crypto, equity and real estate received by Bankman-Fried and other executives, including Nishad Singh, Zixiao “Gary” Wang and Caroline Ellison, in the months leading up to the bankruptcy. That may be significant because U.S. law allows such payments to be clawed back and added to the stock of assets that can be distributed to creditors.

42419650,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFD37,1694441277,"Maple Finance Nearly Imploded, but Sid Powell Wants to Bring Back Its Billion Dollar-Plus Glory","KOREA BLOCKCHAIN WEEK, SEOUL – At the height of the bull market in late 2021, Maple Finance, a crypto lending protocol, thought it had the hottest product on the market: a way for token-skeptical institutions to capture yield from Alameda Research’s trading activities.  Alameda, at the time, was the center of attention in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, and fund managers in traditional finance were jealous of the spectacular yields the crypto fund was able to generate. Maple Finance’s syndicated loan product launched as the market hit its top in November 2021 while crypto became a $3 trillion asset class.  “The focus was on maximizing returns rather than capping downside risks,"" Maple co-founder and CEO Sid Powell said in an interview from the sidelines of Korea Blockchain Week, where he highlighted the need for a shift in perspective. “Risk consciousness was a secondary thought. Everyone was chasing the high returns, not thinking about the potential pitfalls.”  The fall of Alameda and the subsequent crypto crash of 2022 served as a wake-up call for Maple Finance. With borrowers defaulting and lenders fleeing, the company's Total Value Locked (TVL) was wiped out.  While Alameda was “off our balance sheet” by the time of its implosion, Powell and Maple weren’t so lucky with Orthogonal, which defaulted on $36 million in loans in the aftermath of FTX. The fallout with Orthogonal underscored the vulnerabilities in the DeFi space and the need for more stringent risk management practices.  Powell emphasized the lessons learned from these defaults, saying, ""Diversity was the biggest one. We wanted more delegates, more borrowers, and very strict reporting requirements.""  He further highlighted the importance of branching out into uncorrelated sectors, ensuring that Maple Finance would not be solely reliant on the volatile crypto market.  Part of this includes Real World Assets (RWAs). In January, Maple launched a $100 million liquidity pool for trade receivables, marking a shift from uncollateralized crypto lending to traditional financial investments.  ""Lending to a portfolio of small businesses, such as successful software companies, is not impacted by Bitcoin's price fluctuations, introducing uncorrelated sources of credit into the DeFi space, which is beneficial,” he said.  Maple has also recently introduced tokenized treasury bills as an investment option, joining a slew of crypto startups chasing this TradFi yield that sometimes now surpasses DeFi yield.  Still After that TradFi-DeFi Connection  As institutionalized as digital assets have become, there are many investors and fund managers who are simply put off by the idea simply because they don’t understand the technical intricacies of it.  Maple’s mission has always been to bridge this gap – its Alameda loan product was the first example – and this hasn’t changed despite the shakeups. Now, though, Maple is banked thanks to crypto-friendly regulations in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC).  “We want to abstract away as much of the complexity of crypto as possible,"" Powell said. “My vision for the future is we could pitch a family office and say we have a credit and lending product that has lower fees than your average Ares or Apollo credit fund.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/11/maple-finance-nearly-imploded-but-sid-powell-wants-to-bring-back-its-billion-dollar-plus-glory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aba72e0cd7bb2ff2891420a299173a62128c9a2c-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the latest price analysis, DOGE recorded a 6% dip, pushing its value below the pivotal support trendline. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.061346 according to CoinGecko, reflecting a 0.9% decline in the past 24 hours and a 3.6% slump over the past week.

DOGE Bearish Territory Looms Typically, such a break below a crucial support level grants sellers an enhanced edge in the market, potentially pushing DOGE further into bearish territory. However, amidst the price decline, the daily candle revealed an intriguing twist. Dogecoin experienced a stark rejection near the $0.06 threshold, signifying that buyers were jumping in at these lower price points. The broader altcoin market also experienced a decline on Sunday, partially fueled by anticipation over crucial regulatory developments. Regulatory concerns have been weighing heavily on the cryptocurrency space, leading to increased volatility and uncertainty. DOGE market cap currently at $8.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Furthermore, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) made headlines as it saw its discount to net asset value narrow to the lowest point in a year. This development, alongside the broader market sentiment, has raised questions about the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. What Lies Ahead For Dogecoin? As Dogecoin grapples with this significant breakdown of its support trendline, many in the cryptocurrency community are left wondering about its immediate future. Will the rejection near the $0.06 mark be enough to spark a reversal, or is DOGE headed for an extended correction? DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Keeping An Eye On DOGE Price Movement In the world of cryptocurrencies, sentiment can shift rapidly, and a single piece of news or a notable price move can alter the course of a coin’s trajectory. As such, traders and enthusiasts alike will be closely monitoring Dogecoin’s price action in the coming days to determine whether this beloved meme coin can bounce back from this setback or if it will continue to tread in bearish territory. Dogecoin’s recent bearish breakdown below its support trendline has raised concerns among its holders and the wider cryptocurrency community. While the rejection near the $0.06 threshold provides a glimmer of hope, the altcoin market remains highly sensitive to regulatory developments and external factors.

However, Deaton explained that Australia’s lead over Canada in the fourth place only comes down to a difference of around 11 holders.

While Ripple Labs battled the SEC in the courtrooms, Deaton was the attorney of choice for XRP investors who wanted to make their voices heard in the case. Support for Ripple had grown rapidly as many referred to the regulator’s actions as an overreach. Meanwhile, the number of XRP investors throwing their hats in the ring grew to over 75,000 on Deaton’s list. Related Reading: Can Ripple Control The XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In According to the attorney, being on this ’75K List’ meant that XRP investors could potentially be able to seek reimbursement if the price of XRP were to suffer as a result of the regulator’s actions. The legal battle that began in 2020 is currently still ongoing with the SEC filing an interlocutory appeal in response to Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling back in July.

42419648,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFCyz,1694437200,Crypto Safekeeping Specialist Fireblocks Introduces Non-Custodial Wallet Service,"Cryptocurrency custody firm Fireblocks is offering its long list of fintech and corporate clients a non-custodial wallet service, so that the end consumers using firms like Revolut and Nubank can entirely control their own assets – something of a market requirement following the blow-ups of various crypto firms last year.  The move frees up fintechs from inherently acting as custodians, and makes it easier for their end users to access exotic crypto offerings such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and other Web3 applications, according to Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov.  In the wake of high-profile collapses of crypto firms like Celsius, BlockFi and FTX, the market has shifted, driven by a general mistrust when it comes to third party custodians being able to hold a user’s cryptographic keys.  Fireblocks’ multi-party computation (MPC) technology works well in a non-custodial setting, shifting counterparty risk away from a corporate entity, while allowing wallets to be recovered in the event of mishap, Shaulov explained in an interview with CoinDesk.  “This non-custodial release allows a fintech, web3 company or corporate to create a wallet, where one of the key shares is sitting with the user – either in their web browser or mobile app, with iOS and Android – and the other key share is held with Fireblocks or with the service provider,” Shaulov said. “Basically, that other key share is responsible for security and the ability to recover the overall wallet if the client loses his phone, for example.”  Shifting custodial responsibilities away from big companies and onto the end user has the added advantage of opening the door to more in the way of DeFi, web3 and NFT-related offerings, Shaulov said.  “A fully non-custodial setup where the customer is hosting the key, allows access to DeFi and other web3 services that are currently outside of a well-defined regulatory scope,” Shaulov said. “What was previously hard for large licenced institutions or big corporates, can be built onto the wallet experience when firms don’t have all those regulatory, custodial limitations.”  Fireblocks currently secures over 130 million wallets for big companies including the likes of BNY Mellon, BNP Paribas, Flipkart, eToro, Revolut, NuBank and Wisdom Tree.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/crypto-safekeeping-specialist-fireblocks-introduces-non-custodial-wallet-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edfcdaee6690185171cbcfdaff1e29aba3d92285-2470x1389.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419655,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFD8H,1694434226,First Mover Americas: Altcoins Start the Week in the Red,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ripple’s XRP token has dropped over 5% in the past 24 hours, falling below $0.50 for the first time since July 13. In Ripple’s legal fight with the SEC, the U.S. regulator said Friday it needed to appeal a judge’s decision in July that the blockchain firm had not violated securities law in making XRP available to retail investors. Altcoins across the board are in the red to start the week, with XRP among the worst affected. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is at its lowest point since mid-June. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues the sideways movement it has experienced since the start of the month, down around 0.5% at $25,670 at the time of writing.  Decentralized exchange Sushi has expanded to layer-1 blockchain Aptos, making it accessible on a network that is not compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for the first time. Given that Sushi has more than seven times the amount of value locked as the entire Aptos blockchain, the expansion gives the network potential to attract fresh capital inflows and rival other non-EVM chains like Solana, Mixin and Osmosis. ""This expansion to Aptos not only unlocks a new level of deep liquidity across major blockchain networks but also significantly elevates the cross-chain trading experience,"" Sushi said in a statement.  India will analyze and decide its own position on crypto in the coming months after considering global leaders' stance on an acceptable crypto rule framework, according to Ajay Seth, secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs. India's position on crypto has been under scrutiny for years as a nation that had a burgeoning industry before crippling it with a series of blows in the form of harsh taxes, anti-money laundering rules and enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges. Seth's comments on Sunday indicate a shift towards the possibility that India may frame its own legislation, a first since India suspended plans for comprehensively legislating crypto through a bill in early 2022.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's daily volume total on Saturday sank to its lowest level since February, 2019.  Just $5.4 billion worth of bitcoin traded hands within a 24-hour period, extending a drop in volume experienced since the collapse of FTX.  Volatility is resting at December 2022 lows as the lack of trading appetite and positive sentiment has spurred a sense of market apathy across the crypto market.  The last time bitcoin approached this low level of volatility, it surged to $29,200 from $19,600 on the back of spot ETF optimism.

17480251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550728,1694433658,"Bitcoin Price Confirms Double Top, How Low Can BTC Drop?","Yesterday’s weekly close of the Bitcoin price below the $26,000 mark has raised concerns among analysts and traders. This move could potentially signal a further decline for the leading cryptocurrency, as it appears to be the first step to confirming a double top formation on the weekly chart. Rekt Capital, a prominent figure in the crypto analysis sphere, took to Twitter to share his insights, stating, “BTC has officially Weekly Closed below the ~$26,000 support. Technically, BTC has begun the first step in the process of validating this Double Top formation. Turn $26,000 into new resistance and the breakdown will likely be confirmed.” How Low Can The Bitcoin Price Drop? Remarkably, this isn’t the first time Rekt Capital has voiced concerns about this price level. Already on August 7, the analyst warned, “If BTC drops to $26,000 by mid-September then a Double Top may be forming. A breakdown from $26,000 would validate the Double Top.” Related Reading: Charting The Course: This Indicator Sparks Confidence In Bitcoin Rise To $27,000 Diving deeper into potential price movements, Rekt Capital has speculated that a breach of the $26,000 base could see Bitcoin tumble towards the $22,000 region. The analyst emphasized the importance of observing the price action this week, noting, “if we see a weekly close below $26,000, followed by a rejection from $26,000, then we probably see a confirmed breakdown from this double top.” However, it’s not all gloom and doom. Rekt Capital also highlighted the dangers of getting overly bearish, advising traders, “So it’s really important not to get caught in these downside wicks (below $26,000).” On a brighter note, the analyst pointed to the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin’s weekly chart which played out in mid-March this year, suggesting that a retest of its neckline, around $24,000, might indicate the bottom of Bitcoin’s upcoming move. Decentrader, a crypto intelligence platform, weighed in on the current market conditions, tweeting, “The market is currently experiencing the most sustained period of #bitcoin on-chain losses since the bear market lows. Is this a buy the dip opportunity or the start of a deeper pullback?” They further highlighted potential price movements, stating, “Bitcoin Liquidity Map: There is a significant amount of 3x, 5x, 10x liquidity from $23,500 down to $21,600. IF price did get down to $23,500 we could see a fairly swift liquidity escalation event that could move price down fast.” Final Correction? Michaël van de Poppe, another esteemed analyst, provided a comprehensive historical perspective. He emphasized the significance of September as a historically challenging month for Bitcoin, stating, “There’s a level which #Bitcoin must hold in order to avoid a significant crash. Bitcoin is currently holding onto a significant level of support. It’s around the $25,500 barrier.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Research Firm Predicts Inflows Over 70,000 BTC, This Price Target Van de Poppe delved into the historical and cyclical aspects of Bitcoin’s price movements. He highlights that the months of August and September, especially in a pre-halving year, have traditionally been tough for Bitcoin. In August 2015, Bitcoin experienced a substantial correction towards the 200-EMA but managed to stay above it. A similar pattern was observed in August 2019, with a significant correction followed by a smaller one in November 2019. Drawing parallels between the current market cycle and that of 2015, van de Poppe suggested that given the influx of new institutional participants, the current market could be mirroring the 2015 cycle. If this correlation holds, the current downturn could be the final correction before a potential rebound. At press time, BTC traded at $25,692.

In a recent report, Stellar dominated all layer-1 networks in tokenized treasuries by market cap, surpassing Ethereum and Polygon. The August 23 tweet shows that Stellar recorded a tokenized treasury market cap of $304 million. Ethereum, on the other hand, recorded a Treasury market cap of $291 million, while Polygon followed with $24 million. This report presents Stellar as a leading real-world asset tokenization network, a plausible reason behind XLM’s price increase. Price Outlook: XLM Slips Off $0.13. Will It Rebound? Over the past 30 days, Stellar’s XLM embodied the resilience lacking in the broader crypto market. While most coins surrendered all past gains, XLM held on, bucking negative market sentiments and soaring new highs. However, the rally has stalled, and the token currently holds over 3% price decline in the last 24 hours. But it still retains 1.78% gains in the last seven days. Stellar has slipped off the newfound support at $0.134 and now trades at $0.1272. This downslide suggests two things. Firstly, the hype around the mysterious announcement must have dwindled. Secondly, XLM could have succumbed to the bearish pressure present in the broader crypto market. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Takes Hit and Could Dive To $15 Nonetheless, XLM is in a critical conjecture, as the outcome of the next 24 hours will determine its price trajectory. If the announcement is bullish enough, XLM could witness a positive momentum shift with a massive upswing above the $1.3 price.

17475982,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550714,1694426454,Shiba Inu Community Sounds  Warning Alarm As Scammers Siege Shibarium,"In a recent development, the Shiba Inu community has warned of a “scam” project that may be responsible for some of the FUD attacks that have plagued the Shibarium network since it launched on August 16. Shibarium Admin Warns Of Scam Project In a tweet on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, a member of the Shibarium tech team (known as Digarch) shared a screenshot of the admin warning of a scam project set to be deployed on the layer-2 network. According to the Shibarium tech admin named DaVinci, “Pawswap” is the scam project responsible for funding attacks on Shibarium. Related Reading: New Shibarium Update Sets The Stage For Shiba Inu To Reach All-Time High Besides funding these attacks, Pawswap allegedly uses its community to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the network. DaVinci said the project and its team had infiltrated the Shibarmy by passing off as Pawzone, a credible project set to launch on the Shibarium network. Community member warns community of scam making the rounds | Source: X As a result of this, he urged the Shib community to stay safe from Pawswap, which he called a “Scam or Shitcoin,” and that they defend the ecosystem from such projects. Meanwhile, Digarch, who shared the screenshot, clarified that Pawzone was different from Pawswap, which DaVinci had mentioned, and stated that Pawzone was the team behind the NFT marketplace Pawzaar, which will be one of the NFT marketplaces that will be launching on Shibarium soon. Pawswap Legit Or Not? Following Digarch’s tweet, another user on the X platform said that Pawswap wasn’t a scam and pointed out that the project was certified by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm, and certification always inspires confidence in the minds of the public about a particular project. Upon further investigation, this user’s assertion is correct, as Certik awarded a silver KYC badge to the project on September 3, according to data from their website. As part of the verification process, Certik also verified 8 of the project’s core team members and reviewed its token contract. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Begin Accumulation As Shibarium Grows It is also worth mentioning that the project plans to launch its decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Shibarium network. As such, one might wonder why the Pawswap team would be looking to cause Shibarium to fail when it does not benefit the team. The project also seems to have a significant following, with over 13,000 followers on its X platform. While there are no assurances that Pawswap is legit or a scam like DaVinci has asserted, it is important for the community to always do their research. This is something that Shibarium’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has always emphasized in the network’s updates as he mentioned the influx of tokens and projects into the Shibarium ecosystem.

42392604,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8vLX,1694425792,"Coinbase Exchange Remains Inactive in India, While Other Operations Are Still Active","Coinbase clarified that while its exchange remains inactive in India, its wallet services and tech hub remain active.  There was some confusion around the status of Coinbase's India operations after the exchange sent emails to some customers asking them to withdraw funds by Sept. 25.  Is Coinbase operating in India or not?  The exchange has clarified that its exchange operations were suspended many months ago, as CoinDesk reported at the time, but its other products like the Coinbase Wallet continue to be available as a service for Indian customers, and its tech hub remains active.  The question was triggered after the exchange sent an email to some customers on Sept. 9 as a ""friendly reminder"" to an email from June 26. CoinDesk has seen copies of both emails after a user shared them. Most of them were friendly reminders but fresh emails to some customers may have also been sent out.  The June 26 and Sept. 9 emails were sent to some Indian users using its exchange product in non-Indian jurisdictions. It was also sent to some non-Indian users. It asked customers to withdraw their funds by Sept. 25, 2023.  The emails said ""we will be discontinuing all services"" to the account because they ""no longer meet our updated standards for these services."" It further said, ""your funds remain secure with us, and you are able to send funds to other crypto wallets or services (subject to standard network and transaction fees), including Coinbase Wallet.""  A Coinbase spokesperson said that ""during the course of a recent routine review of our systems, some accounts may have been identified that no longer meet our updated standards"" but that they will ""allow customers to update their information at a later date.""  Coinbase had suspended trading operations within three days of its India launch in April 2022. It had touted India's local digital payment service, Unified Payments Services or UPI, as central to its operations. Within hours of the launch, the authority behind the UPI service said it was ""not aware of any crypto exchange"" using UPI. Shortly after, Coinbase's app said UPI services were ""temporarily unavailable."" Several days later some payment processors cut off local crypto exchanges. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong later took note of ""informal pressure"" from India's central bank as the reason.  ""We stopped allowing new user sign-ups on our exchange product in India back in June of this year,"" a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We maintain a robust tech hub in the country and offer live products, including our Coinbase Wallet. We are committed to India over the long term and continue to explore ways to strengthen our presence in this important market.""  Some of the Coinbase senior leadership in India has left the organization in the last few months, including Arnab Kumar who was Director, India Market Expansion.  Coinbase's plans in India are centered around its Wallet services and its tech hub which builds for the APAC region and the world. On April 4, 2022, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company planned to add 1,000 people to the existing 300 staff at its Indian tech hub. But after Coinbase's trading launch in India hit a snag on April 7, and then cryptocurrency prices crashed, the exchange cut 8% of its 400 employees in India in June.

Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July last year as the crypto crash started to take effect, and creditors are currently voting on whether to sell the company to Fahrenheit Holdings, a move that could see the partial return of their holdings.  Kokinos left his position at Algorand, a staking-based blockchain, in July 2022. He is a co-owner of Fahrenheit, alongside mining company US Bitcoin and hedge fund Arrington Capital, whose respective executives Asher Genoot and Michael Arrington will also sit on the board.  “Steve has been a serial entrepreneur and investor for over 25 years, founding and operating companies ranging from internet infrastructure, cloud software, communications, and crypto,” according to a brief resumé included in the court documents, which described him as the proposed CEO of the Delaware corporation, as yet unnamed but referred to in the filings as NewCo.  The NewCo board also includes Scott Duffy and Thomas DiFiore, the two co-chairs of Celsius’ creditor committee, which was consulted at major stages of the sale process to represent the interests of those owed money, and which got to appoint six of the nine board members.  Duffy and DiFiore did not deliberate on their own appointment, and the procedure took place “after lengthy discussions with the Committee’s legal and financial advisors,” the filing said.  Other board members include Frederick Arnold, chairman of the holding company that is operating the estate of bankrupt Lehman Brothers; Elizabeth LaPuma, who heads the audit committee at commercial real estate company WeWork; and Emmanuel Aidoo, an investment banker from Perella Weinberg who had previously worked on the deal.

Analyst Ryan Holloway has shed light on the remarkable impact of Optimism’s incentive program. The availability of OP trading rewards and incentives on various platforms, including Polynomial, played a pivotal role in this surge in usage metrics. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Tallies 77% Accumulation By Major Investors – Good For SHIB Price? The incentivization strategy employed by Optimism has proven wildly successful, resulting in an astounding 23-fold increase in trading volume for the protocol. This achievement, however, comes with a caveat, as it raises questions about the composition of this newfound trading activity. Just dropped an analysis with @t__norm on the impact of @PolynomialFi‘s OP incentive program that ultimately led to the protocol’s cumulative trading volume surpassing $3.8B 🧵 👇 pic.twitter.com/UahucTcVJ0 — Ryan Holloway (@raholloway) September 9, 2023 Rise In Trading Volume Masks Optimism’s Growth In Daily Traders While the surge in trading volume is undoubtedly impressive, a deep analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. The growth in daily traders has been relatively modest, suggesting the possibility of a significant rise in power users or, in a less favorable scenario, potential wash trading activities. But what exactly is wash trading? Wash trading involves artificially inflating trading volumes by executing simultaneous buy and sell orders for the same asset, giving the illusion of increased demand and activity. This practice is illegal in traditional financial markets and is viewed negatively in the cryptocurrency space due to its potential to mislead investors. Optimism market cap currently at $1 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Optimism Faces DeFi Sector Headwinds Optimism has faced its fair share of challenges in gaining a foothold in the competitive DeFi sector. Recent reports indicate a notable decrease in total value locked and decentralized exchange volumes on the network in recent weeks. This decline in activity is reflected in the network’s financials, with revenue plummeting by 37.5% in the last month, accompanied by an overall activity decrease of 19.7% over the same period. Despite these setbacks, Optimism’s native token, OP, currently holds a price of $1.26 according to CoinGecko, with a 0.9% gain in the last 24 hours. However, it has seen a 6.2% decline over the past week. Related Reading: Massive PEPE Token Dump: Whale Unloads 762 Billion At Loss As Price Wobbles Sustainability And Challenges In Optimism’s Post-Incentive Era The sustainability of Polynomial’s retention rates after the conclusion of the incentive program will be a crucial factor in determining its long-term impact on Optimism. As the network navigates the challenges posed by wash trading concerns and its struggles to establish a firm presence in DeFi, the cryptocurrency community will be closely watching for signs of resilience and adaptability. While Optimism’s incentive program has undeniably driven an astonishing surge in trading volume, the sustainability of this growth and the resolution of its challenges will determine the protocol’s long-term success in the highly competitive world of cryptocurrency.

17470930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550695,1694418323,"Solana (SOL) Price Plunges On FTX Rumors, Buy Or Sell Now?","Amid the bankruptcy proceedings of crypto exchange FTX, the market is in a state of heightened anxiety, and Solana (SOL) in particular saw a 7% drop in price yesterday following the spread of rumors. FTX is scheduled to appear in Delaware Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, September 13, to seek approval for the liquidation of $3.4 billion in SOL, FTT, BTC, ETH and other crypto assets. The event has led to widespread concerns among market analysts and participants, who speculate that the liquidation could exert significant selling pressure on an already fragile market. As of January 17, FTX’s crypto holdings were estimated to include $685 million in Solana (SOL) tokens, $529 million in FTT tokens, $268 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $90 million in Ethereum (ETH), and various other assets such as Aptos, Dogecoin, Polygon, XRP, and stablecoins. The Solana Situation Solana, which represents FTX’s largest holding, experienced a sharp decline in its price yesterday. This can be largely attributed to the rumors circulating on crypto Twitter (X) suggesting a massive dump of SOL by FTX. But, as it turns out, this rumor lacks substance. A screenshot that surfaced on Twitter, detailing the assets held by FTX debtors as of January 17, 2023, confirms that FTX is in possession of approximately 47.51 million SOL. Related Reading: Crypto Alert: Solana, Aptos, APE And More Token Unlocks Coming This September However, there’s a crucial detail that many seem to have overlooked. The SOL tokens held by FTX debtors are not readily available for sale. Contrary to the narrative presented in the visual data shared, these SOL tokens are under a lockup agreement. FTX, in collaboration with Alameda, had previously acquired 16% of the SOL supply directly from the Solana Foundation. This acquisition came with strings attached, namely a lockup schedule. The current stash of 47.51 million SOL, which represents 8.82% of Solana’s total eventual supply, is bound by this agreement. Thus, the misconception that this SOL reserve is liquid and primed for a market dump is fundamentally flawed. The reality is that these tokens are locked and will undergo a linear vesting process spanning from 2025 to 2028. Accessing these funds prematurely is not an option. Related Reading: VISA’s Stablecoin Payments On Solana Propel SOL To 5% Gain, Bulls Eye Price Breakout As per the terms of the agreement, the SOL tokens will undergo linear monthly unlocks until January 2028. Furthermore, specific tranches, such as the 7.5 million SOL acquired from Solana Labs by Alameda Research, will only become available on March 1, 2025. Another tranche of 61,853 SOL is slated for unlocking on May 17, 2025. In light of these facts, any fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) suggesting an imminent SOL dump by FTX can be confidently labeled as misinformation. SOL/USD 1-Day Yesterday’s 7% drop in the Solana price may have been an overreaction by the market, which believed the rumors of an upcoming dump and sold en masse out of panic. However, not much has changed in the technical chart picture for SOL in the 1-day chart. Already on August 31, SOL fell below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $20.26. The attempts to regain it failed in the second half of the week last week. Yesterday’s slide has now left SOL vulnerable to a correction lower to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $17.39. A price recovery can be expected at this level. A rise above the 20-day EMA, below which Solana fell in mid-August, would be an important step for the bulls on the road to recovery. As then, a recapture of the 50% Fibonacci would be crucial. In a bearish scenario, which currently looks less likely, SOL also loses the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. A drop to $13.30 would then be the bears’ next target.

Speaking to a scrum of journalists on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit, Ajay Seth, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, said ""India's position will be decided in the coming months."" He added that since ""the framework for assessing risk has been put together by the G20"" we will analyse ""what globally the leaders have agreed to"" and then decide on ""what will be a sound policy for India.""  India's position on crypto has been under scrutiny for years as a nation which had a burgeoning industry before the industry suffered a series of blows in the form of harsh taxes, a crypto winter, a ""shadow ban,"" anti-money laundering rules and enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges. The scrutiny increased after India made framing global crypto rules a priority for its G20 presidency, a goal it achieved in the form of a ""synthesis paper"" from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Financial Stability Board (FSB).  Seth's comments on Sunday indicate a shift towards the possibility that India may frame its own legislation, a first since India suspended plans for comprehensively legislating crypto through a bill in early 2022.  Indian officials have told CoinDesk previously that the nation doesn't need to necessarily frame its own crypto regulations in the form of a bill.  While the FSB requires a review of the status of implementation of its recommendations, by end-2025, India has already brought in anti-money laundering rules and a tax structure for crypto and that may be enough, an official told CoinDesk in August. While the nation's central bank has advocated for a ban on crypto, the government has not indicated any such position and, for the moment, the government is unlikely to go down that path. The synthesis paper has also said a blanket ban won't work.  Prior to the G20 Leaders' Summit last weekend, India had released its presidency note on crypto, an official document relating its position on crypto as recommendations before the synthesis paper was finalized.

42392611,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8vvR,1694415600,Digital Euro Conspiracy Theories and Privacy Concerns Put EU Central Bankers in the Hot Seat,"Proponents of a digital euro are facing political opposition to their plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) – and technocratic central bankers aren’t sure how to respond.  In the European Union (EU), officials have advanced multiple arguments in favor of issuing a digital euro – assuring that it will be usable across the bloc, offer privacy unmatched by other kinds of digital payment, and safeguard Europe’s independence from foreign payment providers.  But now, the EU's central banks, normally used to deploying technical or economic arguments, are facing a different kind of opposition that’s much more political. That opposition can start with legitimate concerns over privacy and the limits of government power – but can also venture into conspiracy theories that paint CBDCs as part of a much wider, orchestrated program of state control.  Anti-CBDC politics is seen across the Atlantic. U.S. presidential hopefuls Robert F. Kennedy Junior and Ron DeSantis have both painted state-backed digital currencies as a tool of surveillance and social control. EU lawmakers such as the Netherlands’ Marcel de Graaff have also suggested a digital euro could allow the government to limit purchases, coerce citizens or introduce a social credit system.  Sweeping attacks  Responding to such sweeping attacks makes defending the CBDC that much harder, and central bankers are now figuring out how to respond.  For some of those opposed to the idea, “the creation of a digital currency in euro area or any other part of the world is becoming part of this huge plot – together with wokeism, together with the green agenda, and so on, to control the world and the lives of citizens,” Belgian Central Bank Governor Pierre Wunsch told attendees at an event on Thursday.  “It's quite clear that it's not only a purely rational debate,” he added. “We need to make sure that our people understand that it's not about control of their lives – which should be obvious, but apparently some people don't see it as obvious.”  For his Austrian counterpart, Robert Holzmann, the problem is the lack of positive narrative for the CBDC.  “What is still missing is a convincing storyline for the digital euro, something which we can put in front of people,” said Holzmann said Thursday, adding that proponents of the CBDC needed to emphasize the role of money as a public good, and the need for the European bloc to maintain monetary sovereignty in the face of threats from private operators or other countries.  The job might be easier if people realized there’s no parallel plot to get rid of cash, Holzmann said. But officials are also trying to engage with technical features of the proposed digital euro that would alleviate people’s fears.  Credibility problem  “Of course we are concerned” about CBDC becoming part of the culture war, Evelien Witlox, programme manager for the digital euro at the European Central Bank (ECB) told the same event. “These are people of our society, we would like to take their concerns away – the problem is how we can do that.”  Witlox stressed features of the system that would mean the ECB can’t track data to private individuals, or program the currency to stop people spending their money as they wish. But there’s a further issue of credibility, she added.  “The next step is how can we convince people that we are telling the truth,” Witlox said. “We need to have a continuous dialogue, and I hope that we are able to convince people that the statements that we make are also the truth.”  Ultimately central bank officials are usually economists, not marketing experts, and technical answers may only go so far. As Erik Luts, chief innovation officer at Belgian bank KBC, said, for CBDCs to work, people need to trust them, and that requires its proponents not just to argue over details, but to convince them of honest motives.  “We can assure people you are not traced and we can prove it with audits and whatever, but if outside of the system people start talking about this and convincing each other on social media … then that is a big blow,” Luts said, adding that skeptics of big government are “not a bunch of people who believe that the world is governed by snake people – this is a mainstream movement.”  Go-slow  De Graaff’s concerns may represent an extreme, but plenty of other EU lawmakers have negative views, ranging from opposition to apathy. In a Monday debate at the European Parliament, Markus Ferber and Joachim Schuster, representatives from the parliament’s two biggest parties, both again asked what the point of the CBDC would be.  It’s perhaps that skepticism which has led officials to call for a go-slow over the laws that will determine privacy controls for the CBDC, which will need to be in place before the ECB takes any decision to issue.  “There's no pressure on parliament or council to finish this piece of legislation… I think slowing down is a very healthy thing,” Mairead McGuinness said of the bill on Wednesday, referring to the groupings of lawmakers and governments who now need to agree to the plans she put forward in July.  McGuinness suggested the law shouldn’t be finished until there’s a new parliament and a new commission in place, implying it will have to wait until at least November 2024.  That may be a pragmatic view as EU laws typically take years to deliberate and finalize. It may also be a political realization – that the best hope for her digital euro plans is if they are considered soberly and technocratically, rather than as a political plaything bandied about ahead of the June 2024 EU elections.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/11/digital-euro-conspiracy-theories-privacy-concerns-put-eu-central-bankers-in-the-hot-seat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a232d4903a3231c67d09c1a304ad30c47e6a67ef-2197x1236.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SOL price is struggling and could drop further toward $16.50 or even $15.00. SOL price is showing bearish signs below $20.00 and $20.50 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $20 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $19.20 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to down if there is a close below the $17.80 support. Solana Price Drops Further In the past few days, Solana’s price made a couple of attempts to clear the $22.00 resistance. However, SOL failed to gain strength for a move above the $22.00 level. As a result, there was a fresh bearish reaction below the $21.20 support, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. More importantly, FTX’s news of a possible selling of SOL is also putting a lot of pressure on the bulls. The price gained bearish momentum and traded below the $20.00 support. Finally, it found support near $17.80. A low is formed near $17.78 and the price is now consolidating losses. SOL is now trading below $20 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $19.20 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $18.50 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $20.59 swing high to the $17.78 low. Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is near the $19.20 level or the trend line. The next key resistance is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $20.59 swing high to the $17.78 low at $20.00. A clear move above the $20.00 resistance might send the price toward the $21.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $22 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to clear the $19.20 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $17.80 level. The first major support is near the $17.20 level. If there is a close below the $17.20 support, the price could decline toward the $16.50 support. In the stated case, there is a risk of more downsides toward the $15.00 support in the near term. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level.
