42377462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A0H,1405638019,Bitcoin Industry Leaders Sound Off on New York BitLicense Proposal,"The release of the New York Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) proposed regulatory framework for bitcoin companies operating in New York has brought mixed reaction within the digital currency industry.  With varying viewpoints dominating Twitter and reddit throughout the day, CoinDesk reached out to a number of bitcoin and digital currency leaders to get their perspective on the proposed regulations.  Throughout the discussions, pillar topics regarding the proposal emerged, largely centering around the document's clarity, its potential effect on other US states and the question of exactly what the proposed BitLicense means for an industry in the midst of a surge in innovative development.  While largely positive, reactions differed as to the full ramifications the proposed rules would have if put into effect, with lawyers, investors and startups all weighing in on the day's biggest story.  Proposal provides clarity  Many in the cryptocurrency industry are applauding NYDFS Superintendent Ben Lawsky for taking on what is broadly considered to be a difficult subject. Business leaders, in particular, largely agreed regulatory clarity is something they have been seeking, and a burden they have been prepared to shoulder.  Charles Cascarilla, CEO of bitcoin exchange itBit, told CoinDesk:  ""The guidelines we saw today were no real surprise to us. We expect to achieve full compliance as the necessary requirements are largely in place due to our careful attention to consumer protection.""  Cascarilla said that itBit already verifies account holders and has a compliance officer, as well as a cybersecurity program. Further, he acknowledged that established rules are needed to ensure a functioning business ecosystem:  ""[These] guidelines are actually helpful as they outline exactly what needs to be implemented by a bitcoin company to operate.""  For some observers, there's something deeper about the nature of the new regulations: the fact that bitcoin is achieving greater recognition in the eyes of the law. James P. Jalil, chair of the cybercurrency practice at law firm Thompson Hine, said the BitLicense proposal represents a major step for bitcoin's legitimacy.  ""The [framework addresses] safeguarding client funds, anti-money laundering, books and records, compliance requirements and procedures,"" said Jalil. ""These things are very common in the regulation of the banking and financial services industries.""  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of bitcoin trading exchange Coinsetter, agreed that the existence of a digital currency business licensure is a positive step overall:  ""As a New York City-based company, the BitLicense is an important asset that will allow us to provide US banking and regulatory protection to our target customer group. I’m happy to see the New York DFS making tangible progress towards offering the first achievable regulatory bitcoin license in the country.""  Evan Greebel, an attorney working with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on their bitcoin-related ventures, remarked that one distinctive clarification that emerged today was the focus on keeping consumers safe. Rules on advertising, terms of service and customer asset management represent a push for legitimacy on the part of businesses themselves.  He noted:  ""DFS has designed the BitLicense with an intent to protect US consumers by ensuring that only reputable businesses are participating in the identified parts of the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Concerns about innovation  One of the questions that remains to be answered is whether or not the rules - and future ones that may mirror the agency's proposals - will hold back innovation in the bitcoin sector.  Some observers reacted to the NYDFS proposals by saying they will dampen innovation in the state's bitcoin space. Others argued that the clarity provided actually makes New York a more fertile ground for digital currency businesses.  If improved financial privacy is considered a bitcoin innovation, then yes government choke points do stifle innovation. #bitlicense — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) July 17, 2014  ItBit's Cascarilla noted that in the realm of problem-solving, knowing which rules to play by can actually assist innovators as they develop new ideas. He said:  ""It may mean the industry has to in fact get more innovative in finding solutions to how we work within these guidelines, but overall it's a step in the right direction to building a compliant and trustworthy Bitcoin ecosystem for the general consumer.""  BitPay  chief compliance office Tim Byun pointed specifically to a few issues he had with the framework. This included the reporting of purchases over $10,000 completed in a single day, which he said could be problematic as ""purchases via credit or debit cards over $10,000 are not reported"".  Byun said that the BitLicense proposal needs to have a bit more appetite for risk-taking since many companies in the virtual currency space are, at heart, entrepreneurial firms:  ""The framework may benefit from a more risk based program or establishing nominal thresholds that would enable innovation while ensuring controls or transparency to protect consumers.""    Global competition questioned  There is some concern that because of the possible regulatory rules in New York, cryptocurrency development could simply leave the US for friendly jurisdictions, driving the industry to places with less friction.  Gil Luria, partner at Wedbush Securities who has written extensively on the topic of bitcoin for his firm, believes that in creating a framework the NYDFS is building a blueprint that other US states will end up using.  ""I wouldn’t be surprised if other states were to adopt a similar standard, a similar framework,"" he said.  Greebel, the legal counsel for the Winklevoss twins, commented that it would be ideal if other states were to adopt the same principles of the proposed BitLicense:  ""From a standpoint of providing legal and regulatory advice to bitcoin businesses, it would be easiest if other states adopted the New York BitLicense to create a uniform regulatory environment.""  However, not everyone sees future regulation making things easier. Others agree the issue of state regulation in particular could influence bitcoin firms to move elsewhere.  ""In the US, state-to-state reciprocity is an open issue. Will other states compete with New York, or will they adopt NYDFS guidelines largely as-is?"" bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik questioned.  Garzik added:  ""Bitcoin businesses must deal with 51x legal jurisdictions, with associated licensing and surety bond costs. Today's regulatory model is what I call the '51x cost' model, which remains a killer for small business and jobs.""  Some say the regulations may keep businesses out of the country entirely. This includes digital currency exchanges, which don't have a large domestic presence in the US and may be enticed not to open their doors owing to the regulatory environment.  As noted by financial journalist and pundit Max Keiser:  New York's BTC BitLicense scheme seems like it will empower regions like Isle of Man to dominate Bitcoin, IMO. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) July 17, 2014  Still, Luria believes the idea that exchanges won't want to operate in the US could change in the near future should the BitLicense proposal come into effect. That might help build a strong bitcoin economy in the US, and help to make it a leader in the industry over the long haul.  Luria said:  ""If you look at the exchanges, the reason we don’t have a robust US-based exchange is just because an exchange can’t really operate in the US without broadly violating money transfer rules. So having an avenue and an outlet for bitcoin exchanges and wallet services will encourage more and more companies to participate.""

42377473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71ABb,1405633384,BitPay Launches Facebook App for Easy Bitcoin Sharing,"Georgia-based bitcoin merchant processing specialist BitPay has announced a new tool aimed at spreading bitcoin adoption through popular social network Facebook.  Called Get Bits, the Facebook application allows users an easy way to trade bitcoin in-person by helping to arrange meetings between friends on the network.  Notably, Get Bits does not allow users to transact through the app. Rather, it serves as a way for independent buyers and sellers to connect via a commonly used platform.  BitPay  framed the launch as one that sought to use the power of social networking to boost bitcoin, while leveraging Facebook's utility as a social login to preserve security in the process.  The company said:  ""Because bitcoin is one of the only forms of payment which cannot be fraudulently reversed, selling bitcoin usually requires some level of trust in the buyer. To deal with this, Get Bits currently leverages the world’s largest 'web of trust', Facebook.""  Users can sign into Facebook to view a list of friends that are using the program. From there, Get Bits allows users to gift and trade bitcoin or invite others to the program.  BitPay further advised that users should exercise caution during in-person exchanges, adding:  ""If a friend is interested in buying a significant amount of bitcoin from you, please consider exchanging in a physically secure environment.""  The launch comes amid a boom in the number of bitcoin companies seeking to leverage social media to spread digital currency adoption. In May, San Francisco-based QuickCoin launched a social wallet, while Uruguay-based Moneero launched with a social focus in July.

42377470,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A95,1405630843,South African E-Commerce Giant Takealot Launches Bitcoin Support,"Takealot, one of South Africa's largest e-commerce companies, has announced that it is now leveraging online payment processor PayFast's service to accept bitcoin payments.  Launched in 2011, Takealot is a prominent company in South Africa's growing e-commerce space, having ranked fourth in a July poll conducted by South African online marketing firm research Columinate. Further, Takealot has raised $100m in funding to date to expand its operations.  The company revealed the move to the bitcoin community on Twitter, citing customer feedback in its decision to implement digital currency support soon after it was offered by PayFast.  As Takealot noted on its official Twitter account:    We heard your feedback! As always we delivered with speed! Super excited to announce we now accept Bitcoin as a payment method #GreatService      — takealot (@TAKEALOT) July 17, 2014      Given the company's wide selection of goods, the addition of Takealot to the bitcoin ecosystem is likely to be greeted with enthusiasm by the local bitcoin community. Takealot's platform is used to sell everything from Calvin Klein perfumes to Purina premium pet food.  Hidden bitcoin payment option  Though it proclaimed the announcement on Twitter, Takealot's site does not make it obvious that it now accepts bitcoin. The bitcoin logo, for example, is not displayed on the site. In fact, customers must select another payment mode in order to gain access to the bitcoin checkout option.  In order to make a bitcoin payment at Takealot, customers have to select the 'Instant EFT' payment option at checkout.  This will bring customers to a screen where they can choose between paying in bitcoin and paying using the Instant EFT payment mode.  Selecting 'bitcoin' as the payment mode brings the customer to a screen displaying a wallet address as text and as a QR code.  The checkout process converts the price denominated in the South African rand to bitcoin based on BitX exchange rates, displaying the converted price before payment is sent. The user is then given five minutes to send payment.  Partnerships enable integration  With the move, Takealot is taking advantage of services offered by BitX, a South African exchange and wallet service, to facilitate bitcoin payments.  BitX is in the midst of carrying out an expansion plan that will bring its services to 12 new markets, ranging from Brazil to Turkey, and including several African states like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. The firm was acquired by Switchless, a software development firm that produces software for financial institutions, last October.  Takelot is also customer of PayFast, which announced today that it would make bitcoin payments available to its customers. The payment processor has a customer base of 30,000 merchants.

42377454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719sj,1405627508,"Low-Cost Cell Service RingPlus Accepts Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin","A low-cost US mobile cell service provider is partnering with digital currency merchant gateway GoCoin to provide support for bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.  RingPlus  , headquartered in Los Angeles, boasts that it is the first wireless carrier based in the US to accept payments in digital currencies. Users can elect to use either of the three digital currencies currently offered to purchase service time, and according to the initial announcement customers will see expanded integration in the future.  GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard told CoinDesk that enabling consumer choice was at the heart of the new partnership, saying:  ""This gives a new level of control and privacy to consumers that want to pay as they go instead of being boxed into a monthly service agreement with penalties for early termination.""  In announcing the integration, RingPlus cited the desire to appeal to a broader audience of digital currency users by accepting bitcoin as well as litecoin and dogecoin.  RingPlus customers need to first purchase an approved Sprint phonehttps://my.ringplus.net/device_validation_requests/new, and then register with the company to begin service. The company's most expensive plan offers unlimited calling, global SMS and 2.5GB of data for $33, and four plans are available for under $10.  Credit card required  Those who want to use digital currency to pay into their cell accounts will have to register normally through RingPlus, a process that requires credit card information. After that, however, users can elect to top up their balances in bitcoin, litecoin or dogecoin.  This initial integration is expected to be expanded. RingPlus customers will be able to use an SMS billing service developed by GoCoin to receive payment notifications and elect to authorize transactions from their account wallets when topping up.  In a 16th July post on the company’s official forums, RingPlus CTO Evan McGee clarified that support for new account payments is not yet active but that the feature is being developed, saying:  ""Just to restate what might not be obvious - for now, this is just to top-up individual accounts. We're going to allow registering with virtual currencies soon, but that requires a much larger change to how we process information upfront. It'll be along shortly.""  Grassroots support  RingPlus CEO Karl Seelig remarked that the decision to integrate digital currency acceptance came from enthusiasm and support within the user base, stating:  ""We listened to our members who are asking for alternative ways to pay their bill, and are extremely satisfied to be leading the charge - so to speak.”  Beauregard echoed Seelig’s sentiments, suggesting that the partnership is the first - but probably not the last - usage of digital currency within a major telecom market.  He added: ""This deal breaks new ground in the hotly contested wireless services market"".

42377455,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719tz,1405622429,Dutch Legal Service Given Authority to Confiscate Bitcoins,"A criminal justice service based in the Netherlands has been granted the power to confiscate digital currency holdings.  As originally reported by Dutch newspaper Trouw, the Openbaar Ministerie, a national public prosecution service within the judiciary, now has the legal ability to seize the contents of bitcoin wallets from suspected or convicted criminals. It can also sell acquired bitcoins for fiat currencies soon after they are confiscated.  According to DutchNews, citing original reports, the Openbaar Ministerie has already used this power to sell several hundred thousand euros worth of bitcoin.  This authority stems from recent court opinions that have deemed bitcoin a kind of asset that can be seized. Previous arguments that digital currency falls outside of that definition owing to its inherent digital nature were deemed invalid, opening the door for the Dutch government to legally confiscate bitcoin during investigations.  Roy Appels, a senior official with the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD), was quoted as saying of the new bitcoin confiscation authority:  ""If you want to confiscate something, it has to be an actual object.""  The recent US government auction of roughy 30,000 BTC also suggests that the view that bitcoin should be treated as a tangible asset is growing in popularity globally, as the coins were sold in a similar manner as traditional confiscated goods.  Dutch community reacts  The development suggests that the Dutch judiciary – as well as the broader national government – continues to maintain a cautious stance on bitcoin. But, according to members of the bitcoin community in the Netherlands, this move isn’t necessary a bad one. The decision to deem bitcoin a seizable asset may in fact be a sign that governments and legal authorities are beginning to take a more nuanced view on digital currencies.  Carl Kuntz, a board member for Stichting Bitcoin Nederland, one of the latest approved Bitcoin Foundation affiliate programshttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/05/20/willkommen-germany-welkom-netherlands/, echoed this sentiment, saying:    ""We are glad that the Dutch government is taking bitcoin [seriously].""            Paul Buitink  , owner and operator of bitcoin information site deBitcoin.org, told CoinDesk that the confiscation authority means regulators are waking up the bitcoin’s growing role in the Dutch economy. What we’re seeing now, he said, is a policy alignment to recognize digital currency as a tangible, governable asset.  Buitink said:  ""In a way, it's positive because it's further legitimizing bitcoin as something that has value and is taken seriously.”  Buitink added that despite the new powers, law enforcement officials may have a hard time actually acquiring confiscated bitcoins. He suggested that multisig wallets and other means of restricting the movement of owned bitcoins could be tapped in the future.  Dutch bitcoin law evolves  The Netherlands is home to a diverse ecosystem of digital currency companies, and even hosted this year’s Bitcoin2014 conference. However, its government has not always been as openly welcoming of bitcoin, echoing concerns raised by regulators and lawmakers around the globe.  Government regulators continue to be wary of digital currency, advising financial institutions and investors about the risks involved. Last month, the country’s central bank issued a warning on digital currencies to banks based in the Netherlands.  Yet, recent developments suggest that Dutch banks are still evaluating bitcoin.  A new report published via eZonomics by ING, an information resource produced by multinational banking company ING, posits that bitcoin’s underlying technology could one day serve critical functions within the global financial infrastructure.

42377459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719z1,1405618599,Pittsburgh: Bitcoin Too Unstable for Local Tax Payments,"Earlier this week a report surfaced suggesting that Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was considering accepting bitcoin as part of a bid to improve the ability of residents to pay local taxes, fines and fees.  The move, as suggested by Let's Talk Bitcoin, would have made the 300,000-person city ""the first municipality to accept bitcoin"", a decision that could have had a potentially wide-ranging impact on other local governments in the US.  However, in new statements to CoinDesk, city officials have confirmed that while ""digital currency was indeed mentioned in one of the transition reports written before [current Mayor William Peduto] took office,"" the city has ""no current plans to take the currency"".  Speaking to CoinDesk, the city's finance director Paul Leger further elaborated on Pittsburgh's stance on bitcoin and other emerging firms of digital payment, stating:  ""The city is not currently considering using digital currency because our first concern is to use credit, debit and other forms of payment which are more widely available to taxpayers.""  The original subcommittee report mentioning bitcoin was seemingly published toward the end of 2013, as suggested by the dating on the document, and addressed the possible use of bitcoin for revenue collection. However, it has only recently drawn larger notice from the bitcoin and wider digital currency community.  Long-term stability needed  Perhaps most notably, Leger hinted at some of the underlying discussions that may have taken place at the time of the original proposal.  For example, Leger suggested that Pittsburgh, which has struggled in recent years to avoid a high-profile bankruptcy, isn't ruling out accepting bitcoin eventually. However, he stressed that the digital currency needs to establish some longevity in the financial world before anything can happen.  Leger added:  ""We would need to see a longer term proof of stability for digital currency to be good stewards of the public's funds.""  Pittsburgh officials also suggested that the city's consideration of bitcoin as a payment method could have been generated by residents, stating that they ""took public input from more than 1,000 local residents on changes they would like to see to city government"" to create the document.  Payments overhaul  A core reason for delay, city officials suggest, is that the suggestion was merely part of a larger plan to diversify the municipality's payment offerings.  ""Currently residents cannot even regularly use credit or debit cards for all payments,"" a city spokesperson said.  Though no municipalities are yet accepting bitcoin, there have been localized movements to generate bitcoin enthusiasm in other certain locations.  For example, residents of Arnhem, a city in The Netherlands, declared the area ""bitcoin city"" earlier this year as part of a promotional bid that was not affiliated with any government officials.

Sandman  claims the move makes it the first Canadian hospitality company to accept bitcoin. The group operates 44 hotels across Canada, and says guests can now make bitcoin reservations at every one of them.  Customer requests  Salim Kassam, Vice President of Marketing for Sandman Hotel Group, pointed out that Vancouver hosted the TED talk summit earlier this year, which brought in a diverse, tech-savvy group of travellers.  “Our hotels had a number of enquiries regarding payment through alternative payments including bitcoin. As a customer-focused company with an eye on technology, we decided to incorporate this emerging technology as a payment option,” said Kassam.  Kassam said Sandman opted to eliminate risks associated with price volatility by choosing to convert all bitcoin payments to Canadian dollars instantly.  Coinbase partnership  To make instantaneous exchange a reality, Sandman decided to tap Coinbase, one of the leading providers of bitcoin wallets and payments services.  To make a booking, the customer simply selects bitcoin as a payment option, receives a digital invoice and then transfers the bitcoins to Sandman’s account on Coinbase. As soon as the payment is confirmed, so is the reservation.  “We feel that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may be here to stay. We can tell you without question that more and more of our customers are seeking to pay with this currency, and our job as hoteliers is to be accommodating to the changing needs and requests of our guests,” said Kassam.  Expanding sector  Although Sandman claims to be the first Canadian hotel chain to accept bitcoin, there are a number of ways people can use bitcoin in the hospitality industry. Expedia recently announced that it plans to accept bitcoin for hotel reservations. The company said bitcoin would simply be integrated into the payment options alongside credit/debit cards and PayPal.  Additionally, back in February, California-based travel agency CheapAir said it is expanding its bitcoin service to allow users to book hotels with bitcoin.

42377477,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71AE7,1405610422,The Bitcoin Mining Arms Race: GHash.io and the 51% Issue,"Tensions over bitcoin's long-term security have eased following a hastily-arranged roundtable of mining participants on 9th July in London.  With representatives from all areas of bitcoin mining and ASIC hardware manufacturing in attendance, the most significant thing about the meeting was that it even occurred at all.  A forum for discussing these issues is critical to maintaining the integrity of the bitcoin network, as its overall health depends on smooth mining operations with a minimum amount of orphaned blocks, hard forks and dominant players capable of executing a 51% attack.  Last month, Jeffrey Smith (CIO of bitcoin's biggest mining pool, GHash.io) announced a new focus on openness, reiterating the company's willingness to ""address the decentralization of mining as an industry"". Thus, it was natural for Smith and GHash to convene the first forum on bitcoin mining.  According  to Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer from Hacking, Distributed:  ""[GHash] got brazen at 55% from 2014-06-12 11:53:05 until 2014-06-13 09:45:24 GMT, for almost 24 hours. And prior to that, it seems to have tested the waters over a period of 10 days or so, perhaps gauging the public's reaction.""  With GHash, the pool operators are known and they willingly initiated this important step. Conversely, stealth mining operators such as Discus Fish do not take steps to make themselves known, although it is claimed that they operate as China-based f2pool.    Then they got brazen at 55% from 2014-06-12 11:53:05 until 2014-06-13 09:45:24 GMT, for almost 24 hours. - See more at: http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/#id1    The consolidated hash rate from GHash has backed off significantly, with its network statistics from 13th July displaying approximately 34.6% of bitcoin's total.  As the foundation's representative present at the meeting, I agree with BitGo’s Will O'Brien, who said ""we cannot and should not rely on one or more trade organizations to set the rules. Bitcoin is decentralized, and we must build solutions that support that original framework of decision-making.""  The technical solution, if there is to be one, will ultimately come from the open-source developer community ratified by the miners and users.  In the meantime, we have temporary ways to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack, such as GHash's agreement to ""do all it can to limit its share of the total bitcoin network to 39.99%.""  Generally, participants understood this pledge to be a very unenforceable solution fraught with potential pitfalls, namely GHash's concern that they are being punished for their own success and how meaningful the pledge will be when other mining operators approach the same self-imposed threshold.  Potential solutions  In the last month or so, there have been a wealth of proposed technical solutions to minimize the likelihood of a successful 51% attack.  Gavin Andresen first made a recommendationhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/06/13/centralized-mining/ for utilizing P2Pool, a decentralized bitcoin mining pool that works by creating a peer-to-peer network of miner nodes.Mike Hearn expandedhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/03/mining-decentralisation-the-low-hanging-fruit/ on that thinking with a detailed description of 'freemining' – regaining miners' ability to select their own block content.  These are immediate solutions available today. Hearn states:  ""Freeminers mine in such a way that they both reduce their payout variance but also create their own blocks, a process that always requires running a fully validating p2p node like Bitcoin Core. If you aren’t running one, you aren’t decentralising the mining process.""  Newer technical solutions are most likely nine to 12 months away, given the development and testing cycles.  One of those solutions includes the Two Phase Proof of Work (2P-PoW) to disincentivize large mining pools yet enables existing miners to continue using there current mining hardware, as outlined by Cornell's Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer in ""How to Disincentivize Large Mining Pools."" This proposal is based on the research work of Andrew Miller and others at University of Maryland, College Park.  [post-quote]  Another solution, proposed by mathematician Meni Rosenfeld, involves the creation of Multi-PPS, a platform that allows miners to mine in multiple pools simultaneously.  Since a small pool could find either 10 blocks in a day or 0 in a week, many miners elect to use larger pools that offer a more consistent payout. Once the payout instability of small mining pools is reduced, it makes them a viable alternative.  According  to Rosenfeld, the basic premise of Multi-PPS is ""that miners should mine in multiple pools simultaneously, in proportion to each pool’s strength, which has two important features,"" these are:  (1) The miner enjoys performance that is equivalent to that of a pool with a combined size of all pools he uses together  (2) The stable equilibrium is not consolidation in one pool, but rather, maintaining a distribution between many pools according to the merits of each.  Crypto arms race    Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gün Sirer      called Two Phase Proof of Work (2P-PoW), to disincentivize large mining pools. We - See more at: http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/#sthash.i9Eo2RQV.dpuf called Two Phase Proof of Work (2P-PoW), to disincentivize large mining pools.    The reality of bitcoin mining today is that we are in a crypto arms race and this ASIC-driven computational power massively strengthens the network from outside attack by malicious actors or disgruntled states.  Would an attack be disruptive? Sure. Would it be fatal? No.  In many ways, it is the price we pay for a distributed, resilient cryptocurrency, for if we wanted to abolish all uncertainty on mining, we would simply centralize the block chain and anoint a trusted party like the Fed.  The 9th July roundtable meeting was a great start. It is my sincere hope that the participants of the bitcoin mining community continue to hold a regular forum to maintain an open dialogue on the decentralization of mining.

42377464,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A2n,1405607730,New York Reveals BitLicense Framework for Bitcoin Businesses,"The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released its long-anticipated list of proposed rules and regulations that will be required for New York-based bitcoin businesses.  The announcement came via a Twitter post from Benjamin M Lawsky, New York State's first Superintendent of Financial Services, who oversaw two regulatory hearings with digital currency leaders in January of this year.  Notably, the document states that bitcoin businesses that receive, transmit, store or convert virtual currency for customers; buy and sell virtual currency as a customer business; control, administer or issue a virtual currency; or perform conversions between bitcoin and fiat or any value exchange will need to be licensed to operate in New York. Merchants that accept bitcoin are not included under the rules and regulations.  State officials say the document is designed to strike a balance between protecting consumers and implementing common sense rules, and that they are still accepting feedback on the proposal.  Superintendent Lawsky said:  “We recognize that – as the first state to put forward specially tailored rules for virtual currency firms – continued public feedback will be an important part of finalizing this regulatory framework. We look forward to carefully and thoughtfully reviewing public comments on our proposal.”  Licensees will further be required to include the name of the licenses on all advertised products and services, and to ""disclose in clear, conspicuous and legible writing in the English language [...] all material risks associated with its products, services, and activities"".  The rules will also require that all licensed bitcoin businesses meet capital requirements, maintaining ""at all times such capital as the superintendent determines is sufficient to ensure the financial integrity of the Licensee and its ongoing operations"".  The document indicates New York will consider a variety of factors in this process, including the licensee's total assets, the composition of its liabilities and the expected volume of its business, among other factors.  Virtual currency is defined as any digital unit of exchange that has a centralized repository or administrator, is decentralized and has no centralized repository or administrator or that may be created or obtained by computing or manufacturing effort.  Impact on existing businesses  One uncertainty prior to the release of the rules was the impact on companies that already work with bitcoin and other digital currencies. The regulations outline a procedure for how businesses already working in the ecosystem can receive approval without suffering immediate disruption to their operations.  According to the NYDFS, existing companies have 45 days to apply for a BitLicense following the release of the final regulations. Applicants receive preliminary approval, but this designation may be subject to change following review by the agency.  The rules state that:  “[Applicants] shall be deemed in compliance with the licensure requirements of this part until it has been notified by the superintendent that its application has been denied, in which case it shall immediately cease operation in this state.”  Businesses that do not apply within 45 days face criminal prosecution for running an unlicensed digital currency company, the document concludes.  Account holder scrutiny required  The documents outline a data-heavy application process that, at it hearts, seeks to bring the reporting on digital currency activities and the companies that conduct them in line with the broader US financial system.  The NYDFS is requiring that all digital currency companies in New York follow detailed reporting guidelines on account holders. In addition to following procedures aligned with the US banking system, the rules state that high-risk or high-volume customers may be subject to additional scrutiny at the request of the superintendent.  The rules state:  “When opening an account for a customer, each licensee must, at a minimum, verify the customer’s identity, to the extent reasonable and practicable, maintain records of the information used to verify such identity, including name, physical address and other identifying information.”  Foreign account holders are subject to rules focused on money laundering prevention. Companies with a BitLicense are required to submit for review and implement “enhanced” reporting policies for customers located outside of the US.  As well, licensed businesses are prohibited from working with an international business that does not have an established base of operations within the US.  Financial auditing outlined  The proposed rules clarify the kinds of financial information companies that receive a BitLicense may need to disclose to regulators in order to lawfully work in the state’s digital currency sector. Overall, they mirror much of the same information required from other kinds of financial businesses.  Licensees will need to submit quarterly reports to the NYDFS that include complete balance sheet updates, cash flow statements, data on profit and loss, earnings and asset holdings, as well as other information at the discretion of state regulators. Changes in ownership equity are also to be reported should they take place.  Annual audits are also required. As the document outlines:  “Each licensee shall submit audited annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, together with an opinion of an independent certified public accountant and an evaluation by such accountant of the accounting procedures and internal controls of the licensee within one hundred and twenty days of its fiscal year end.”  Licensees must also attest to their compliance with digital currency regulations by submitting statements from their management teams. The NYDFS requires detailed reports on compliance performance and certification as to the veracity of those statements.  Unlawful financial behavior - and legal actions that arise from such events - must be reported to the agency immediately, the document states. Licensees must submit initial reports to the NYDFS, and may be required to draft additional filings should it be deemed necessary.  Emphasis on consumer protection  The proposed regulations also feature a number of sections that form a comprehensive bulwark against behavior that may fraudulently target consumers.  The document makes it clear that licensees must provide a wealth of information regarding the risks associated with digital currencies.  It reads:  ""As part of establishing a relationship with a customer, and prior to entering into an initial transaction for, on behalf of, or with such customer, each licensee shall disclose in clear, conspicuous, and legible writing in the English language and in any other predominant language spoken by the customers of the licensee, all material risks associated with its products, services and activities and virtual currency.""  Many of the related requirements focus on the technical aspects of bitcoin - including the irreversibility of transactions - and the lack of government support like the kind provided for bank deposits. Terms of services and terms of agreement must clearly outline both these risks, as well as the exact nature of whatever business relationship is being established between a licensee and its customer.  This also extends to any advertisements that a digital currency may produce. Any media intended to promote a licensee’s service or product must feature confirmation that the company received approval from the NYDFS to operate.  Transaction terms must be spelled out for customers. Receipts need to be produced and offered to consumers at the time of transaction, and the rules mandate that all receipts generated may be subject to scrutiny at the discretion of the state regulator.  Notably, the NYDFS is ensuring that it has a say in any new services or products that might be offered to customers by a licensee. Licensees must receive written permission to expand their company’s offerings or make significant changes to existing products or services.  Transaction recording mandated  The proposed regulations dictate how licensees keep track of transactions - rules that could cause concern for those in the bitcoin community who prefer to maintain pseudonymity.  Businesses in New York are required to report the personal information, including name and address, of those involved with a transaction that involves the purchase, sale or transferrence of bitcoin. The NYDFS requires details on the nature of the transaction, including the amount and destination of the bitcoins, and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) must be submitted from licensees should they be required.  Reports must be filed when a licensee engages in transaction volume that exceeds $10,000 in a given day. As the draft rules state:  “When a licensee is involved in a transaction or series of transactions for the receipt, exchange, conversion, purchase, sale, transfer, or transmission of virtual currency, in an aggregate amount exceeding the United States dollar value of $10,000 in one day, by one person, the licensee shall notify the department, in a manner prescribed by the superintendent, within 24 hours.”  Additionally, licensees are prohibited from offering services that attempt to mask the identity, source or destination of a digital currency transaction, and they cannot engage in behavior that might prevent scrutiny of information regarding those taking part in a transaction facilitated by a licensee.

42377458,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719wV,1405604694,Bitcoin Features in Latest FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report,"The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has published a new Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) analysis and, notably, the bulletin covers bitcoin.  FinCEN  , which is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, has already weighed in on bitcoin in the past. In the last six months, it has ruled that bitcoin miners and investors, as well as cloud mining and escrow services built on the bitcoin protocol, are not money transmitters.  FinCEN is tasked with policing financial transactions in the US and all money transmitters are expected to register with the bureau. This issue has hampered the development of several bitcoin initiatives and businesses in the US, as many bitcoin-related businesses had to register as money transmitters and meet the exacting standards required for FinCEN registration.  Suspicious bitcoin activity  In its latest technical bulletin FinCEN outlines the potential benefits offered by digital currencies, but also warns that the same attributes that make them attractive to lawful users also happen to attract illicit actors.  FinCEN explains why it has started covering digital currencies in its bulletins:  “FinCEN is observing a rise in the number of SARs flagging virtual currencies as a component of suspicious activity. Like all emerging payment methods, understanding virtual currencies is key to insightful SAR preparation and filing, and for that reason we explore virtual currencies, and Bitcoin in particular, in this Industry Snapshot.”  FinCEN goes on to explain how different components of the bitcoin network can unintentionally become involved in suspicious transactions.  “Each institution has a unique vantage point from which to observe these transactions and identify suspicious activity. FinCEN encourages the use of information sharing under 314(b) in this context,” said FinCEN.  FinCEN points out different financial institutions are likely to see different elements of the same suspicious activity due to their different roles in the system. Therefore it is vital to share information, it says.  Tracking down suspects  FinCEN says that provided information on users is “very useful” for the analysis of suspicious activity involving digital currencies. Some of these users can be engaged in illicit marketplace activity and the wire data that can trace them back to digital currency exchanges used is important.  Although bitcoin speculation is not illegal, FinCEN warns that speculation can share a transaction footprint with other suspicious activities, such as High Yield Investment Programmes (HYIP) or Ponzi schemes involving bitcoin. Depository institutions, brokers and dealers are the most likely participants to notice such activity. Dealers can be traced by using information from depository institutions, helping uncover unregistered businesses.  Banks hold vital information on market participants and FinCEN says those institutions have a “unique vantage point” as they are able to see aggregate fund transfers to and from foreign-based exchanges. Money transmitters and intermediaries have a similar vantage point, as they accept various payment mechanisms that can be used to identify customers and dealers in the US and abroad.  Bitcoin exchanges can help  The use of digital currencies by hackers and other cyber criminals involved in account hijacking is another concern. FinCEN says money service businesses (MSBs) are uniquely placed to help in such investigations, as they can track where the money from compromised bank accounts was channelled and where it was converted into digital currency. Digital currency exchanges and other operators in the space offer the other piece of the puzzle, as they conduct transactions within the crypto economy.  “For example, exchangers may know when users send Bitcoin to other users who are customers of that same exchange or may be able to compare Bitcoin addresses associated with illicit activity against the activity of addresses they have issued to their customers,” FinCEN explained.  FinCEN concludes that SAR reports filed by various entities can provide valuable information related to accounts, ownership and other identifying information, including bitcoin addresses associated with suspicious activity.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/17/bitcoin-features-in-latest-fincen-suspicious-activity-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b283fd0f5760ff5af1681d6fcea15e03e05cfa72-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A1X,1405602041,CheapAir Tops $1.5 Million in Total Bitcoin Sales,"California-based online travel booking website CheapAir.com has announced that it has completed more than $1.5m in bitcoin sales on flights, hotels and Amtrak bookings via its platform.  With the announcement, CheapAir joins Overstock as the second traditional e-commerce player in the bitcoin ecosystem to reveal that it has completed more than $1.5m in sales. Overstock disclosed that its figures topped $1.6m in May.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CheapAir CEO Jeff Klee suggested that the numbers are a testament to the loyalty of bitcoin users who have remained committed to the company even in the face of new competition.  Klee told CoinDesk:  ""One of the great things I've seen about bitcoin users is they seem to be incredibly loyal and in this industry its really tough, people tend to shop around. [...] I've seen research that shows the average person checks about 12 [travel] sites before making a purchase. Any time you can get someone to come back, it's great.""  CheapAir began accepting bitcoin for flight bookings in November and has since expanded its services to include bookings at its 200,000 partner hotels and railway offerings.  The news follows the June announcement that one of CheapAir's major rivals, bookings giant Expedia, would accept bitcoin for hotel bookings.  Rivals welcome  Klee told CoinDesk that CheapAir has been tracking the progress of Expedia and its new bitcoin offering, but that so far, it hasn't seen a sales decline, even as the number of travel options bitcoin users have has expanded.  ""We were wondering if we might take a hit because of it, but we haven't,"" Klee said.  CheapAir further responded to the idea that bitcoin users are now making use of both Expedia and CheapAir's platforms – using CheapAir to book flights and Expedia to book hotels, saying that the company views this as a positive for both bitcoin and CheapAir.

42377475,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71ACr,1405594481,Online Education Platform Skilljar Embraces Bitcoin,"Skilljar, a tech company that specialises in enabling third parties to deliver online training courses, has started accepting bitcoin payments.  Skilljar  says its platform is used by hundreds of online instructors, who offer classes in a wide range of different fields, from yoga to programming. The instructors can now be paid in bitcoin using Skilljar’s e-commerce platform, alongside credit cards, debit cards and PayPal, with the cryptocurrency being immediately converted to fiat at the time of the transaction.  The company joins a group of other educational platforms that have embraced digital currency as a means to facilitate payments. As Skilljar CEO and co-founder Sandi Lin explained to CoinDesk, one of the chief benefits of the integration is that international students have the opportunity to pay for their education at a reduced cost. She cited the financial barriers within the global payments network, saying:  ""We experience the pain of currency conversions on a daily basis in multiple ways, and [bitcoin] was an option that could help reduce that friction for a large number of our instructors.""  She added that bitcoin's digital nature and international appeal makes it an effective currency to use in the case of online education, as well as other cross-border oriented business.  Bitcoin via Stripe  Lin said the integration of bitcoin payments was a simple task, since the company already uses Stripe for its payment processing. Skilljar simply integrated Stripe’s bitcoin beta programme into its existing payments infrastructure.  “The decision to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment was simple,” said Lin. “It was driven by instructor requests, ease of integration, and the international nature of our business.”  Lin added that in the future, courses focusing on digital currency could be launched on the Skilljar platform.  Skilljar client Danielle Gould, CEO of Food+Tech Connect, welcomed the company’s decision to embrace bitcoin, saying that the digital currency can help decentralise and democratise learning.  Funding education with bitcoin  Skilljar is not the first company to offer online courses that can be paid for bitcoin. Tech education startup Treehouse started accepting bitcoin last month. The company told CoinDesk that bitcoin was a perfect choice for its tech savvy user base.  Additionally, non-profit online education site Khan Academy started accepting bitcoin via Coinbase last August. The academy accepts donations in the digital currency and also happens to offer an online course on bitcoin too.

42377456,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719qD,1405591347,World Bank Report: Bitcoin is a 'Naturally Occurring' Ponzi,"A recently published World Bank policy research working paper on Ponzi schemes mentions bitcoin as a “naturally occurring Ponzi”, clarifying that it has nothing to do with deliberate Ponzi schemes, as some bitcoin critics have claimed.  Kaushik Basu, World Bank economist and author of 'Ponzis: The Science and Mystique of a Class of Financial Frauds' points out that most Ponzis today are not always as obvious as in the past, being far more sophisticated and more difficult to identify.  Market-driven bubbles  “The problem stems from the fact that we can have what Robert Shiller calls ‘naturally occurring Ponzis’, that is, financial bubbles that form without the manipulator’s baton but from finished natural market forces and with one person’s expectations feeding into another’s,” says Basu.  Basu goes on to present a hypothetical scenario: if people believe housing prices are bound to go up, they will “beg or borrow” to buy a house, thus creating more demand and contributing to prices spiralling out of control. When the bubble bursts, people who bought at the high end of the market take a hit.  Gold is another example, as it has witnessed numerous bubbles and crashes over the years. Basu notes that gold lost more value in two days of April 2014 than it did in thirty years, baffling both speculators and analysts.  The bitcoin bubble  Basu then cites bitcoin as an example of such a scenario:  “One of the most recent cases of bubbles occurred in the new ‘Bitcoin’ experiment. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency; the main and original attraction of which is the low transactions cost associated with its use. One can buy bitcoin the way one can buy euros and trade freely with others having euros. Trouble started when people began speculating that the value of bitcoin would rise, thereby raising the demand for bitcoin and making the value-rise a self-fulfilling prophesy. In other words, what we witnessed recently in the bitcoin phenomenon fits the standard definition of a speculative bubble.”  In the past, notable bitcoin critics have claimed that the digital currency is a Ponzi scheme. Back in March, US economist Nouriel Roubini published a spate of heavily critical comments aimed at the cryptocurrency and its advocates via twitter.  In one post he said:    “So Bitcoin isn’t a currency. It is [by the way] a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn’t safe given hacking of it.”            Basu stresses, however, that bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi and that there is little to to gain by treating it as such. The bitcoin bubble of 2013 was the result of speculation rather than an organised scheme.  However, he says that bitcoin could have other things to teach economists and bankers:  “The main value of bitcoin may, in retrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers to central banks on the prospects of electronic currency, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut transactions cost.”  The World Bank has remained relatively silent on the issue of digital currencies until now. Last year it organised a discussion on digital currencies, but its focus on the phenomenon is essentially academic.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/17/world-bank-report-bitcoin-is-a-naturally-occurring-ponzi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c08bbf79a763088613dd609c4cdff9131dc67035-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
