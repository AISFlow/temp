Business Korea reports that Daishin Securities Co. has signed a memorandum of agreement with Coinone, based in Seoul, to open up exchange services between bitcoin and the won. Daishin clients can also use bitcoin as a deposit option for the broker’s services.  Beyond the integration between the two firms, the memorandum reportedly outlines plans to develop blockchain applications for stock services.  Founded in the 1960s, Daishin operates 84 branches within Korea, with subsidiaries in China and Japan. As of May 2013, investors had paid in roughly KRW 434.8m, or $380m, in capital, according to its website.  Coinone’s bitcoin exchange saw 309.8 BTC in 24-hour volume, according to data from Coinhills.com.

42426791,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwizh,1461005711,Hyperledger Project Explores Fighting Counterfeit Drugs with Blockchain,"At a working group meeting of the Hyperledger blockchain project today, a representative for global professional services company Accenture pitched the early phases of a project designed to fight the spread of counterfeit drugs using blockchain technology.  The details came during a meeting of the initiative's working group focused on project requirements.  Accenture's connected devices software lead Primrose Mbanefo, who works with its Internet of Things business development team and helps produce some of the company’s proofs-of-concept, described how more efficient tracking of medicines using immutable data could improve accountability in the pharmaceutical industry.  Mbanefo said:  ""If we could get that data and prove that documents have not been tampered with we could say the drug actually came from the factory that we say it came from.""  A key point up for debate at the meeting was the question of defining what exactly constitutes counterfeit activity in the pharmaceutical industry. According to Mbanefo, counterfeiters include both “rogue” manufacturers and established companies around the world that are failing to include the right amounts of active ingredients in medicines – or none at all.  ""That would be cleared up if we had a supply chain we could actually trust,"" she said.  The idea of using distributed time-stamping to differentiate counterfeit drugs is a compelling one, given the success of the trade.  In the United Kingdom, where Mbanefo is based, a counterfeit medicines bust last June resulted in the seizure of 6.2 million doses or medical devices, worth £15.8m. According to the BBC report, a total of £51.6m of counterfeit medical goods around the world were confiscated during that one operation.  The control of the counterfeit drugs problem is just one supply chain-focused use case being looked at by members of the Hyperledger project.  Other potential applications  of blockchain in supply chains include tracking the manufacture and assembly of computer components, assessing the quality of milk products shipped and sold and confirming the veracity of food labels.

42426806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjVh,1461002842,New York's 'Energy Czar' Talks Future of Blockchain for Energy Grids,"The state of New York is working to rebuild its power grid as a distributed platform and to create incentives for the powerful utilities companies to work with upstart innovators.  An unanticipated side-effect of the effort is that the environment has proved a fertile stomping ground for LO3, a startup using the Ethereum blockchain to give people the ability to sell solar energy directly to one another.  While the state’s so-called ""energy czar"" Richard Kauffman said the government projects don’t intentionally foster an environment beneficial to blockchain tech, the inefficiencies of the legacy power grid are particularly ripe for disruption.  Kauffman, whose official title is chairman of energy and finance for New York State, told CoinDesk:  ""The grid that we should be building is a hybrid system. It has the reliability and cost benefits of this traditional central station, production and distribution system. But with the innovation and flexibility of distributed solutions, where electrons would flow in more than one direction.""  For providers of power and individuals alike, a two-way flow of electrons means they might soon be able to buy green power directly from local producers using solar panels on their roofs as well as a microgrid built atop the existing infrastructure.    Payments for the energy sector        This is where LO3 would like to see its joint project, Transactive Grid, enter the picture.  ""What we’re developing is hopefully the secure, transactive layer that allows those transactions to happen across a blockchain,"" said Lawrence Orsini, the company's founder and chief executive.  Using the public-facing Ethereum blockchain, the joint operation with Brooklyn-based Consensys, is building an auditable, transparent means of transacting energy peer-to-peer. Another project of LO3, called Brooklyn Microgrid, is working to connect local neighborhoods into areas that can separate from the larger grid during times of duress.  The thinking is that through a combination of the microgrid concept and the Transactive Grid payment infrastructure, neighbors will be able to write smart contracts on the blockchain and choose where they want their energy to come from, what kind of energy they want to buy and even who they want to sell to or give it to.  Orsini told CoinDesk:  ""The utility grid we’re looking at for the future is going to look nothing like it does today. If things work well, you as a consumer are not going to be a consumer anymore, you’re going to be a prosumer.""  Rethinking the grid  To lay the foundation for the new distributed grid, Kauffman, who was appointed by governor Cuomo in 2013, has launched Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) a suite of policies designed to make the state’s existing architecture more affordable, resilient and cleaner.  Electricity companies are being refashioned into what the state calls distributed system platform providers (DSPPs) and mandated to upgrade the legacy system to transform the power grid into a patchwork of Mircogrids powered by the people.  Formally kicked off in April 2014, REV’s origins go back to a series of recent storms that wiped out power across much of New York over the past years, including Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, according to Kauffman.  The existing centralized grid around just a couple power companies ensured that if part of the grid went down it affected large swaths of the state that should not have otherwise lost power.  ""Communities across the state wanted more control over their energy when they were rebuilding,"" said Kauffman. ""These community grids really represent nodes in a distributed, hybrid system.""  The proof-of-concept  Last week, Transactive Grid hosted an event to mark the first transaction using its technology, which took place between two longtime friends in Brooklyn.  At the press event, retired US Environmental Protection Agency manager, Bob Sauchelli, used the Ethereum blockchain to buy 195 credits for renewable energy generated by solar panels on the roof of his long-time neighbor, Eric Frumin, an environmentalist and labor advocate.  Frumin told CoinDesk:  ""The power of this idea combined with the organization of the community can force these kinds of major changes to support [a] distributed generation of energy.""  Money at stake  As part of the REV project, the state set aside $40m for potential partners interested in working with the utilities to decentralize the grid. Of 150 applicants, including LO3, 83 received as much as $100,000 to conduct their own feasibility studies.  While LO3 was not among the companies selected for this early phase, as an applicant, it is qualified for stage two of the competition in which up to 10 companies will be awarded as much as $1m each for their engineering design, and business plans.  The state of New York expects to publish its request for proposal for the next phase of the REV competition in the near future, with an expected due date for responses sometime later this fall. Winners of the third and final round will be awarded as much as $5m each to bring their projects to completion  Though Kauffman wouldn't comment specifically on LO3 or any of the other applicants, he had this to say about blockchain technology generally speaking:  ""All of us are still used to thinking about things in a linear world and the question is are there certain things that are happening around us that take us into non-linear patterns. The power sector is not set up for non-linear change as well as other traditional parts of the economy.""

42426796,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjBh,1461000663,Collaboration and Consensus Are Essential to Harnessing Blockchain,"Michael Bodson is president & CEO of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), one of the largest post-trade services companies in the US, processing upwards of $1.6tn in transactions annually.  In this opinion piece, Bodson writes about the need for collaboration among post-trade industry stakeholders as blockchain and distributed ledger applications see further testing and development.  In the 224 years since the Buttonwood Agreement in Lower Manhattan created the New York Stock & Exchange Board, the investment world has evolved into a highly complex but orchestrated global marketplace in which financial transactions are executed across borders and geographic regions in microseconds.  As trading technology has advanced, so too has the post-trade infrastructure that underpins the system.  While today’s market infrastructures are highly efficient, relatively low cost and, most importantly, stable and reliable enough to protect the integrity of today’s global markets, the reality is that many parts of the system were not created through intentional architecture and design and, in some cases, have become unnecessarily complex.  But just as technology has transformed the trading process, distributed ledger technology has the potential to do the very same to the post-trade environment, creating a new ecosystem that is more efficient and cost-effective and that further reduces risk for trading parties and, ultimately, the end investor.  When you look at today’s challenging regulatory and economic environments, it’s clear that the emergence of distributed ledger technology could not have come at a better time.  At the recent DTCC Blockchain Symposium, a diverse audience of nearly 500 people representing a cross-section of the industry, including large global banks and smaller firms, regulators, end users, investors, infrastructure providers, technologists, academics and fin-tech, shared a wide range of opinions on the topic.  During this event, there were three themes seemed to dominate the conversation:  1. Industry-wide collaboration  First, many of the speakers agreed that the industry should engage in a collaborative re-architecture of core processes and practices to ensure standardization.  Despite consensus on this point, what we have seen over the past year is a frenzy of activity – mostly uncoordinated – in research and development efforts. Today, many banks and service providers are exploring how to leverage a consensus technology individually – an ironic twist that may help spark innovation but will also likely create a new and disconnected maze of distributed ledger silos based on different standards and with significant reconciliation challenges.  The end result may be a system with essentially the same challenges we have today.  A wiser approach is for the industry to coordinate efforts to develop the right architecture, prioritize the infrastructure building blocks and support focused and collaborative experiments to help the technology mature.  2. Standards and governance  Second, there is a need for the existing, regulated and trusted central authorities to play a leading role in introducing the standards, governance and technology to support distributed ledger implementations.  These organizations, working in partnership with a wide range of the industry, can help ensure that new opportunities truly enhance post-trade processing and are consistent with long-standing goals of mitigating risk, enhancing efficiencies and driving cost savings for market participants.  The critical role of governing and managing the standards, rules and trust boundaries must be managed with indisputable integrity and accountability, independent of any commercial conflicts.  By its very nature, blockchain requires open source, neutral protocols and standards to encourage widespread industry acceptance and implementation.  The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project represents the type of collaborative effort needed to establish, build and sustain an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries.  3. Defining white spaces  Third, the industry needs to forge consensus on identifying opportunities where implementing distributed ledger solutions are more cost effective than enhancing current processes with cloud computing technology or by standardizing workflows.  Many attendees at the Symposium agreed that the industry should explore targeted areas to improve upon the existing infrastructure where automation is limited or non-existent and where the technology provides a clear benefit over existing processes. It is only after that should the industry shift its focus to larger-scale opportunities.  In many ways, this reflects the approach we are taking at DTCC.  For example, we are working with Digital Asset to create and test a distributed ledger-based solution to manage the clearing and settlement of repo transactions. We have also teamed up with Axoni, four major banks and Markit to test using a distributed ledger to manage post-trade processes in the credit default swaps market.  While the hype around blockchain will likely continue to grow, especially as new experiments come to market, the most effective approach to fully realizing the benefits of this technology is to foster greater collaboration and coordination among industry participants, encourage central authorities to play a key role in developing the standards, governance and technology and reach consensus on areas of opportunity.  Further, though it is likely that wide-scale adoption of distributed ledger technology is still years from becoming reality, there is no denying that it has the potential to transform the post-trade landscape.

42426801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjLh,1460996738,"ShapeShift Lost $230k in String of Thefts, Report Finds","Digital currency exchange ShapeShift lost as much as $230,000 in three separate thefts over the course of a month, according to an incident report prepared by the service and obtained by CoinDesk.  The report comes days after ShapeShift was taken offline following a then-undetailed security incident that resulted in the loss of funds held in the exchange’s connected wallets.  ShapeShift later said that it believed the theft was an inside job.  According to the report, that employee stole $130,000 from ShapeShift in mid-March. The employee, who was not identified, later sold sensitive security information to an outside hacker after being fired from the exchange. Another $100,000 in funds denominated in bitcoin, ether and litecoin were stolen on 7th and 9th April.  The report goes on highlight the steps taken by the hacker to obscure his or her tracks. It also details two conversations between the hacker and CEO Erik Voorhees, during which it was claimed that the employee had sold key security data .  ShapeShift has since moved to rebuild the service, and it says it expects to reopen by 20th April, or this Wednesday. In the wake of the attack, the exchange says it has implemented new security protocols, developed in partnership with Toronto-based consultancy Ledger Labs.  “To reiterate, no customer money was lost or at risk, and ShapeShift will be back online soon. Thank you to the community and our customers for your patience,” Voorhees said in a statement.  Inside job detailed  According to the report, the first incident took place on 14th March, the company said, resulting in the loss of 315 BTC. It was soon established that a ShapeShift employee was behind the incident.  The employee was fired the next day, ShapeShift told CoinDesk. Work was then begun on moving the service onto safer hardware.  Yet according to ShapeShift’s report, the thefts continued. On 7th April, 97 BTC, 3,600 ETH and 1,900 LTC in funds were stolen. Within two days of that theft, after the site was taken offline and steps were taken to beef up security, an additional 57 BTC and 2,200 ETH were taken.  Analysis would later show that two servers used to house the exchange were targeted in the incidents, though direct evidence of any intrusion appeared to be scrubbed by whoever was behind it.  The report stated:  “Since direct evidence of a specific attack vector was not found during the digital forensic investigation, an analysis of the available facts was performed to identify all possible attack vectors that fit the facts. It was noted that the attacker was not only able to compromise both infrastructures fairly quickly, but they were able to identify their IP addresses equally as fast.”  Amid a subsequent investigation conducted in partnership with Michael Perklin of Ledger Labs, a hacker contacted the exchange claiming to have purchased information, including the IP address of ShapeShift’s office and access details for the exchange’s admin interface, from that former employee.  Next steps  The exchange says it has improved its security procedures, including how it goes about transmitting secure information between employees and manages access to its servers. In the wake of the hack. ShapeShift has also moved to draft and put in place formal security policies.  ""Ledger Labs has worked with ShapeShift on new infrastructure for a vastly more secure platform going forward,"" Perklin told CoinDesk by email. ""Even with internal sabotage from an employee, the company avoided any customer funds being lost.""  Legal action in the form of a civil lawsuit has also been taken against the former employee, though ShapeShift declined to comment on where the suit has been filed, citing privacy reasons.  The exchange says it believes it can recover a “significant” amount of the lost funds.  The full incident report can be found below.

42426797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwj9h,1460993434,Barclays Demos R3’s Corda Distributed Ledger at London Event,"At an event in London today to celebrate the graduation of its new startup accelerator class, Barclays demonstrated a smart contract platform built on Corda, the recently unveiled distributed ledger project from global banking consortium R3.  Calling the demo ""history in the making"", Dr Lee Braine of the Investment Bank CTO Office at Barclays said distributed ledgers constitute an ""elegant way"" to solve issues with legal agreements in the financial sector, a problem that has been labeled a point of focus for the Corda project by its creators.  According to International Business Times, Braine showcased a prototype of an investment banking application showing the lifecycle of an interest rate swap.  Braine was quoted as saying:  ""I emphasise to you that legal documentation processes can be lengthy, cumbersome and manual. Smart Contract Templates could simplify all of that and, because they are templates designed for reuse, they could drive the industry's adoption of standards that are legally enforceable.""  Braine said that the prototype was the result of a collaboration between Barclays, R3, the University College London, standards organization ISDA, French banking group Société Générale and TechStars, Barclays’ partner on its FinTech accelerator.  Braine showed how distributed ledgers can allow multiple parties within the system to see the same set of documents, simulating how nodes would exchange such information.  A key feature of Corda on display, according to the news source, showcased how not all nodes shared the information on the ledger. This design mechanism has been pointed to as an efficiency for financial institutions when compared to public blockchains such as Ethereum and bitcoin in public remarks by R3.

The remarks, the first for the agency on the subject, were issued in a strategic document this February. Established in 2015, the Ministry of Digital Affairs is a government agency whose mission is ""to create a digital boost for the development of Poland"".  Bitcoin and blockchain were listed alongside the Internet of Things as accelerating technologies that could foster development but that could also entail previously unknown threats.  In the statements, the Ministry acknowledged that while the emerging opportunities have to be exploited by the state for the public good, citizens should be protected from any dangers. No details were provided on how exactly blockchain tech could contribute to building public e-services.  Notably, the agency also proposed the following short definition of the blockchain technology, describing it as a ""distributed records of assets and transactions carried out on them"".  The statements follow similar remarks from the government of Dubai, which is investigating blockchain alongside a broader drive toward improving government services.  Poland's Ministry of Finance issued its own statement in late 2015, in which it stated that the government has no plans to regulate the industry at this time.
