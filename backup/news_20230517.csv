12731814,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533626,1684366222,SUSHI Down 45%: What’s Driving the Decline?,"The price of SUSHI, the native token of SushiSwap, a decentralized exchange, is down 45% from February 2023, when prices peaked at $1.63, the highest level in six months. SushiSwap Token Redesign This contraction is despite the successful implementation of a proposal to redesign SUSHI’s tokenomics, making SUSHI, a governance token, more deflationary. The proposal was first made in December 2022 by Chief Chef Jeremy Grey and was voted on and agreed on by the community early this year. Related Reading: SushiSwap To Redirect 100% Trading Fees To Treasury The proposal passed with a majority vote and will seek to reduce the SUSHI supply over the years. At the same time, it will increase the rewards for liquidity providers while encouraging users to stake SUSHI for longer. Grey argued that this implementation would promote decentralization while making the protocol have “more equitable governance with sustainable economics.” Eventually, by redesigning SUSHI’s tokenomics, the goal will be to keep annual inflation between 1% to 3%. The latest data from MoneyPrinter shows that SUSHI’s annual inflation stands at 1.23%, aligning with SushiSwap’s tokenomics redesign. If anything, this inflation rate is lower than Bitcoin, which has an annual issuance rate of 1.82%. SUSHI’s inflation is also lower than Cardano, which has an annual emission of 1.79%. While analysts expect low inflation to support prices in the long haul, the performance of SUSHI in the first half of 2023 has been dismal. SUSHI is down 45% from 2023 highs and 99% from 2021 peaks when the token changed hands at around $22. Blame The Winter, Hack, And Regulators While the markets have recovered, some, including SUSHI, could still be reeling from the effects of the crypto winter. Last year, Bitcoin, the largest coin by market cap, crashed by over 70% after peaking at over $69,000 in November 2021. The collapse of BTC dragged the altcoin market with it, forcing the more volatile assets even lower, adversely affecting SUSHI. Related Reading: SushiSwap Burns $5 Million Per Year, But Will It Rebrand In 2023? As an illustration, SUSHI is trending at 2022 lows at around $0.89, retesting a critical multi-month support level. Prices are also capped as investor confidence took a hit following SushiSwap’s RouterProcessor2 contract exploit in early April 2023. Hackers ended up with $3.3 million. Although the flaw has since been patched, the reputational damage associated with the vulnerability dents investor confidence. It remains to be seen how SushiSwap will navigate potential new regulations, particularly those from the United States. Some policymakers have taken a negative stance towards cryptocurrency, causing users in the country to hesitate to engage with DeFi protocols due to potential legal consequences.

12731210,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533621,1684364412,French Regulator Extends Open Arms to Fleeing U.S. Crypto Firms,"France is demonstrating its dedication to becoming a top choice for cryptocurrency companies seeking clear regulations by offering a welcoming environment for those fleeing uncertainty in the United States. Earlier today, a report from CoinDesk stated that the French regulator, particularly the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), disclosed its open arms and invitation toward crypto companies looking to flee from their US branch and relocate to other regions with clear regulations on the sector. Opening The Doors For Crypto Firms As the European Union (EU) takes significant steps towards implementing the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules, France has positioned itself as a potential hub for crypto. The country currently has 74 registered crypto companies, which is expected to rise to around 100 as more firms anticipate the implementation of the EU’s comprehensive regulatory framework. Related Reading: Coinbase Turns To Europe For Growth Amid Clampdown By US Regulators According to several analysts, this framework is designed to provide a robust and standardized set of rules for crypto assets, ensuring greater investor protection and market integrity. France’s notable advantage is its defined crypto service asset provider regime, PSAN, introduced in 2019. The PSAN legislation provides clear guidelines and regulations for crypto businesses, fostering an environment of transparency and stability. Benoît de Juvigny, Secretary General of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), emphasized France’s welcoming approach by stating: If American players want to benefit, in the very short term, from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly they are welcome. The Secretary General of the IMF also highlighted the positive relationships and ongoing discussions with U.S. counterparts, demonstrating France’s commitment to international cooperation in the crypto industry. Firms Fleeing The US Over the past months, many crypto firms have been considering or actively pursuing relocation from the United States. Regulatory concerns and an uncertain environment have prompted these companies to explore alternative jurisdictions that offer more favorable conditions for their operations. Crypto companies, such as Coinbase and Kraken, have expressed unease about the regulatory landscape in the United States. Various countries and regions have emerged as attractive destinations for crypto firms seeking more favorable regulatory environments. Such destinations are France, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Switzerland, and Singapore. France has actively embraced digital assets and implemented a regulatory framework offering legal certainty. The country’s commitment to providing clear guidelines, such as the crypto service asset provider regime (PSAN), has caught the attention of crypto firms looking for stability and regulatory clarity. Related Reading: BNB Remains Under Pressure As Regulators Crack Down On Binance Asides from France, crypto companies such as Coinbase have also been eyeing the UAE. In a Dubai Fintech Summit on May 8, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong noted: [The UAE is] exciting for us as a potential hub to build as well, an international hub for Coinbase that could serve not only in the Middle East but parts of Africa or other countries in Asia. I think the U.S. right now is a little bit behind in terms of regulatory clarity and some of the rhetoric from the top. The fact that crypto companies are moving out of the United States highlights the negative impact of regulatory ambiguity on the country’s position in the worldwide cryptocurrency market. While some firms may choose to maintain a presence in the United States, the departure of key players raises questions about the country’s competitiveness and ability to attract and retain crypto talent. Regardless, the crypto market has maintained composure despite the regulatory scrutiny on the industry. Over the past 24 hours, the global crypto market has seen a 0.4% loss, with a value sitting firmly above $1 trillion.

Metaco is a Swiss-based crypto custody firm and the deal, valued at $250 million, marks Ripple’s foray into the acquisition space. Metaco specializes in developing cutting-edge technology that enables financial institutions to securely store and effectively manage digital assets. Some of its notable clients comprise Citi, BNP Paribas, and the digital asset arm of Societe Generale. Related Reading: Polkadot Latest Update Fuels Anticipation Of Higher Price For DOT After the acquisition, Ripple will become the exclusive shareholder of Metaco. It will, however, allow the company to retain its independent brand identity and continue its operations uninterrupted. Nevertheless, this acquisition holds significant importance for Ripple. Its own cryptocurrency, XRP, currently ranks as the sixth largest in the world based on market capitalization. Ripple expressed that this acquisition will serve as a catalyst for expanding its institutional offering. Additionally, this will also strengthen its position in the cryptocurrency market. By integrating Metaco’s expertise and technology, Ripple aims to enhance its capabilities in providing secure storage and management solutions for digital assets. Investor Caution Has Been Growing Regarding Crypto Asset Storage Following a decline in cryptocurrency prices in 2022 along with notable collapses of major crypto firms like the U.S. exchange FTX, investor enthusiasm for crypto assets has waned. A critical factor contributing to this shift in sentiment is the growing alertness among investors regarding the storage of crypto assets. Several crypto platforms had frozen their withdrawals resulting in significant losses for investors. This has prompted them to choose and prioritize secure storage solutions to store their digital assets. Anticipating a surge in demand from institutional investors, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his expectation for an upswing in the need for crypto custody services. He also stated: By focusing on the infrastructure … you’re not really subject to the same gyrations of the crypto winters. If ultimately you’re solving a clear problem at scale for these customers, there’s going to be demand there. Amidst the intensifying enforcement actions by US regulators against crypto firms, CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the added appeal of Metaco, being based in Switzerland and having a workforce comprised of non-US employees. Garlinghouse emphasized that the regulatory landscape in markets outside the United States offers greater and better clarity. This enables companies to make sound and informed investments.

42410722,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgZSZ,1684357634,The Blocksize Wars Revisited: How Bitcoin’s Civil War Still Resonates Today,"This weekend, a pseudonymous developer known as Punk3700 made cryptocurrency history by launching what he calls the first smart contract written on Bitcoin. It’s the type of technical achievement – crafted in the bespoke programming language, Solidity – that lately has become more common on a blockchain known for its chelonian development speeds. Solidity, if you need reminding, is the crypto coding standard that Vitalik Buterin invented to run decentralized applications on the largest alternative blockchain, Ethereum.  This feature is part of our ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history.  Punk’s project is also an example of the type of change that’s been rankling many of Bitcoin’s oldest supporters: the Bitcoin maximalists who see other cryptocurrency efforts as a distraction at best, and a lead balloon at worst, capable of tanking even Bitcoin’s success. While Bitcoin essentially does one thing really well – mint and authenticate a currency without the backing of the state – Ethereum exists as a virtual computer capable of just about anything (including Ponzi-like monetary schemes that have soiled crypto’s reputation). Bitcoiners often want as little to do with Ethereum as possible.  But, about a year after Bitcoin’s latest upgrade called Taproot (which enabled new types of bitcoin transactions), developers have found they could build Ethereum-like programs and systems on Bitcoin. This started off with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which bitcoiners relabelled “inscriptions,” and has lately grown into a whole corpus of tokens and meme coins. Last week, Punk3700 deployed a version of Uniswap (Ethereum’s largest decentralized crypto exchange) on Bitcoin.  Punk3700 calls himself a “New bitcoiner,” and together with his team at New Bitcoin City is planning a host of projects looking to reinvent what Bitcoin is used for. This includes a metaverse (Generative), artificial intelligence lab (Perceptrons Square) and an “Ethereum Virtual Machine” or EVM (Trustless Computer), for Bitcoin, which will power the “sub-projects” of his digital city.  “[W]e’re taking a different approach. We prefer to reuse battle-tested technologies (like the EVM), battle-tested programming languages with years of developer community forming (like Solidity), and battle-tested dapps (like Uniswap and MakerDAO),” Punk3700 told CoinDesk.  While Punk’s designs may be grander and more sweeping than others’, he is hardly alone, following the surprising success of ordinals, in wanting to zap life into the open-source project. There’s clearly demand for Bitcoin’s non-monetary uses, and a growing roster of bitcoiners wanting to build. At the same time, this unexpected demand for Bitcoin block space (the amount of data that can fit into a newly-mined block, which people pay for in transaction fees) has caught many flat-footed.  See also: Alex Adelman – Web3 Should Be Built on Bitcoin | Opinion  Although an influx in bitcoin users benefits the network by increasing its security budget (by increasing the amount BTC miners can earn by processing transactions), many take issue with how the network is being used. Some think meme-coins and NFTs are outright scams, while others think the network congestion is harming the type of adoption bitcoin needs most – that is, by pricing out people looking to send remittances payments or buy small amounts of BTC. Transaction fees spiked above $10 last week, three orders of magnitude larger than the sub $0.01 fees paid at the beginning of the month. That’s not good if you want people in developing countries to think of bitcoin as a payment system.  As Bitcoin’s in-fighting crescendos, some have predicted this relatively mundane debate could devolve into a civil war. It’s happened before. Known now as the “Blocksize Wars,” the period between 2015 and 2017 was marked by rancor and internal division. What started as an argument nominally about how the network should scale to handle periods of increased transactions was inflamed into a philosophical tête-à-tête over Bitcoin's ultimate purpose and political drama over how the open-source project should be managed.  The two sides, then, were known as Big Blockers and Small Blockers, and they were split over a rather small technical decision: how many megabytes of data a BTC block should handle. Big Blockers wanted to increase the block size to accompany more transactions, lowering fees and making everyday payments more viable. Small Blockers were more conservative, both in the way their name suggests, as well as in not wanting to make irreversible changes to Bitcoin’s source code. Big blocks would enable more people to use bitcoin, increasing throughput, but would also require a protocol update known as a hard fork (an irreversible, and non-backwards compatible code split).  Worse, the thinking went, bigger blocks would also likely concentrate control of Bitcoin, with someone ultimately having to pay for increased performance (if it was not users). While there is no CEO of Bitcoin, the network can be thought of as being managed by a distributed cast of users (who pay for transactions and induce demand), miners (who expend actual energy to build Bitcoin’s blockchain) and node operators (who validated this ledger of transactions to ensure everyone is on the same page). Because big blocks were more data-intensive, fewer users would also be able to become miners or validators because fewer would be able to use higher-end hardware Big Blocks would need.  In a reflection of the narcissism of small differences, the in-fighting became a holy war over ecumenical interpretations of Bitcoin. Developers who proposed different Bitcoin implementations reportedly received death threats, Bitcoin forums became sites of propaganda and ostracization and, at one point, a sustained denial-of-service (DoS) attack waged against a Bitcoin fork brought down a major Internet Service Provider (ISP) on Long Island, New York. Ultimately, the small blockers won, a victory often described as a win for decentralization.  “I think small blockers won democratically. Of course, a lot of shenanigans happened on r/Bitcoin which affected public opinion, but at the end of the day, the rally cry behind favoring decentralization over TPS [transactions per second] was a real one and it won,” Eric Wall, an OG and chief investment officer of hedge fund Arcane Assets, told me.  Wall is something of a gadfly in Bitcoin circles, in part because of his support of non-monetary use cases for Bitcoin. While Wall has said he was an orthodox bitcoiner during the Civil War who ardently supported scaling the network through “layer 2s” rather than larger blocks, he has since become somewhat disillusioned with the results.  “The route chosen was a more conservative one. People who were inclined to try out riskier ideas were pushed out. Bitcoin ossified, with Taproot being the only new upgrade to reach the protocol in the following five years,” he said.  For years, Wall has been advocating for a spark of ingenuity in Bitcoin, and for its supporters to consider trialing tech developed on networks like Ethereum. He, like many bitcoiners willing to challenge the orthodoxy, has essentially been excommunicated, though he may not see himself as a casualty of war.  Today’s debate over transaction fees and Bitcoin development is different from the Blocksize War in one key regard: many of the questions over Bitcoin’s technical limitations have already been settled. In 2017, bitcoiners had a choice between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork that offered bigger blocks, which its founder Roger Ver said fulfilled the original mission of peer-to-peer digital cash. A later fork from Bitcoin Cash, called Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, founded by the untrusted individual who calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto without evidence, Craig S. Wright, offered even larger blocks. Instead, market participants have clearly decided the canonical blockchain is the real Bitcoin. And that’s a vote of confidence in the Small Blockers' plan to scale Bitcoin using layer 2s, and sidechains like Liquid and Lightning.  See also: Roger Ver: Bitcoin Cash Hard Forks Could Have Thwarted  While the high fees today paid to transact on-chain cause some concern, and perhaps provide impetus to build Bitcoin differently, as of yet no one prominent is suggesting a complete overhaul of the blockchain. However, adoption of Lightning, a payments-focused scaling option that settles on Bitcoin, has been slight (in part due to bitcoiner's proactive warnings that these systems are experimental). Liquid, built by major Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream, fares even worse.  Like the problem of high fees during periods of sustained use, the current Bitcoin architecture is also possibly vulnerable in the long-term if it cannot generate a ""fee economy"" needed to pay miners after the 21 million bitcoins are paid out as a pre-determined subsidy – or if most fee-generating activity migrates to layer 2s.  ""In hindsight, it is obvious why the small blockers needed to win, and it is their principles which I have become more aligned with, expanding the reach of sound money while maintaining decentralization,"" popular Bitcoin podcaster, and British football club and bar owner, Peter McCormack said in an email. Bitcoiners today generally accept open markets will work out some of these nebulous questions about Bitcoin's long-term security and current scaling limitations. Because block space, not unlike BTC itself, is a scarce asset with a highly-dedicated user base it is expected to be become increasingly valuable.  See also: Steven Lee – Can Bitcoin Afford to Maintain Its Core Network? | Opinion  In a recent op-ed, CoinDesk columnist and co-founder of investment firm Castle Island Ventures, Nic Carter wrote about the absurdity of some bitcoiners today rejecting the use of the network for novel assets like ordinal NFTs and the BRC-20 token standard. Given the crypto-libertarian unpinning of the Bitcoin movement, which traces its lineage to economic philosopher Murray Rothbard and the 1990s cypherpunk culture, it is unaccountable to call for these non-economic use cases to be censored, Carter said.  But the battle scars of the previous civil war are real  But Bitcoin culture has been imbued with willing or unnoticed hypocrisies since the beginning. Carter, too, has rejected and been rejected by contemporary ""toxic maximalists,"" which is likely a small but vocal contingent of the network's user base. This is a group defined often less by its radical economic beliefs than by a certain lifestyle brand that's coalesced on social media, which includes prodigious meat eating, a skepticism of authority (with pols who support bitcoin being an exception) and obsession with spreading bitcoin as a messianic cause. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor won this group's favor after redirecting his dot-com era tech company into a publicly-traded bitcoin vacuum, and has called this self-described toxic element Bitcoin's antibodies or ultra-protective ""killer hornets.""  See also: Paul Dylan-Ennis – The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  To the bitcoiner mind, the occasional purge of heterodox thinkers who violate some tenet of the Bitcoin Way and attacks of critics is a reflex developed during the 2015-17 civil war. ""Maximalism was formed in the crucible of the Block Size War and introduced a dogmatic Dark Ages that we are only now escaping,"" Dr. Paul Dylan-Ennis, a crypto historian, CoinDesk columnist and associate professor at the University of Dublin College of Business, said. At the time, the scaling debate was often described as being between ""populists"" who supported big blocks and expanding Bitcoin’s commercial potential and ""elitists"" protecting its status against upstart cryptocurrencies. That language has mostly been shed from the contemporary historical understanding of the Blocksize Wars, in favor of the ""democratic"" ends of preserving the ability to run a node.  Because history is written by victors, it's now said Big Blockers were essentially a coterie of monied interests in Bitcoin, like industrial miners in China and major crypto payments providers. Whereas Small Blockers are often depicted as underdogs – the ragtag assemblage of bitcoiners who wanted the network to remain closer to its original code base, and were wary of a backwards incompatible upgrade. There's a degree of truth to this. Influential and well-heeled Big Blockers included Jihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitmain, the largest incumbent mining company at the time; Brian Armstrong, the Coinbase chief executive who backed an astroturf movement to “fire the developers"" (as in Bitcoin Core) for their intransigence; and Roger Ver, who was once known as “Bitcoin Jesus” for his proselytizing media strategy that included maintaining the @bitcoin Twitter handle.  Further, the infamous New York Agreement exists in the public imagination (rightly or wrongly) as a closed door session at CoinDesk's Consensus conference in 2017, where dozens of corporate actors schemed under the direction of CoinDesk's parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) to force through a protocol update. The topic of conversation that day was SegWit2x, a sort of hybrid plan between big and small blockers that would double the Bitcoin block size to 2MB and activate the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade proposed by Bitcoin Core developers, which would improve network throughput by separating the data of who signed what transaction from the transaction itself.  If you don't already know, SegWit2x died in the water. SegWit itself was implemented on Aug. 1, 2017, a date celebrated as Bitcoin Independence Day, through a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF) symbolizing the Bitcoin community's bonhomie and power over monied miners. Thus ended Bitcoin's ""first of many civil wars,"" Luxor's Colin Harper wrote in an excellent Bitcoin Magazine retrospective. The UASF was a feat of technical and social engineering, combining ideas from disparate sources to avoid a hard fork while improving the network substantially. The event ""permeates"" Bitcoin culture, Arcane's Eric Wall said, and imbues the act of running a full node with significance. ""It changed the discussion climate in Bitcoin forever.""  Adding to SegWit's charm and legacy is that many miners and crypto companies dallied on implementing the change. It took Coinbase until February of 2018 to upgrade, for instance, and payments processor BitPay until July of 2020. Today, ""no true bitcoiner"" would be caught dead using BitPay, which is now known mostly as the impetus for Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier to launch an open-source alternative called BTCPay Server in 2017, after he found out the company signed the New York Agreement. Stories like this are carried by word of mouth, and brought up time and again on social media, because they speak to a certain self-conception among bitcoiners as punks interested in economics and tech.  It’s hard to say whether that spirit is dead. Bitcoin as a social technology has certainly changed over the years, especially with an influx of users during the meteoric bull run under COVID. And now it seems to be teetering on the edge of an even bigger shift. But the battle scars of the previous civil war are real, and it's unlikely the changes this time around will be technical. All tech is ""path dependent"" and bitcoiners chose their course long ago. Whatever curiosities like ordinals are unlocked next, we need to contend with a blockchain designed to be constrained. Ultimately, the market will decide whether buyers of Taproot Wizard NFTs overpaid for blockspace.  See also: Peter McCormack – Balaji Srinivasan's $1M Bitcoin Bet Could Be Right, but I Hope He's Wrong | Opinion  But I'll leave you with one last bit of history to mull: SegWit was written long before it was ever implemented, and found its way into Bitcoin's source code well before there was complete consensus between users and miners, with arguably just a slight quorum Bitcoin Core developers in favor. There's good that came from the resulting debate – including, as former Blockstream CTO Samson Mow noted, a concerted drive to reduce the concentrated power of miners (Blockstream was early on the trend of building mining facilities in North America). But SegWit was a change that made it into a Core release, which could have passed unnoticed had miners not boycotted the change. Is there not some version of the story where the rarefied circles of Bitcoin puritans are in the wrong? Where miners, wanting a vote, kickstarted a debate that changed how Bitcoin is governed for the better?  In a game driven entirely by economic incentives, you can drive yourself insane moralizing about actors and motivations.

42410718,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgZC2,1684357330,Regulators Should Not 'Front-Run' Congress on Stablecoins,"There is a quietly emerging consensus among key stakeholders regarding one area of crypto regulatory policy – payment stablecoins. On Thursday, the House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, will hold another hearing on stablecoins – the second on the subject in the last four weeks. Ahead of the hearing, two more drafts of bills were posted on the Committee’s website from Chair Rep. Patrick McHenry and from Ranking Member Rep. Maxine Waters – both variations of their joint draft that was under consideration by the committee last year. The latest hearing and newly circulated drafts signal the House’s commitment to introducing and passing a bill in this area.  While there are certainly differences of opinion among members of the Subcommittee on crypto, many appear to be aligned on a few key themes with respect to regulation of payment stablecoins. It may have been easy to miss during the cross-talk at last month’s hearing, but there was broad agreement among the testifying witnesses and many members of the Subcommittee that:  Congressional action is urgently needed on payment stablecoins;   Payment stablecoins backed 1:1 by cash or cash equivalents are distinct and separate from other types of non-payment stablecoins (which may use different mechanisms to maintain a “soft-peg” to the U.S. dollar or some other currency);   Payment stablecoin issuers should be subject to a prudential framework – similar to payments or banking regulation – with safeguards such as reserve and redemption requirements, segregation of assets, prohibitions on rehypothecation, restrictions on commingling of assets, and AML/KYC obligations; and   Maintaining U.S. dollar dominance and financial inclusion are critical public policy objectives that can be advanced with proper regulation and oversight of payment stablecoins.   What Congress has not done is propose regulating payment stablecoins through, say, a securities framework. Yet, one financial regulator, the SEC, appears poised to do just that. Given the legislative activity on stablecoins to date, financial regulators should not “front-run” Congress with regulation-by-enforcement.  Tuongvy Le is a Partner and the Head of Regulatory and Policy, and Khurram Dara is a Regulatory and Policy Principal, at Bain Capital Crypto, Bain Capital’s crypto-dedicated venture capital fund.  What is a payment stablecoin?  A “payment stablecoin” is the representation of a unit of fiat currency on a blockchain. Payment stablecoins are usually backed 1:1 by cash or cash equivalents and are intended for payments, as they are easily redeemable or exchangeable for fiat currency. While the term “stablecoin” is often used as an umbrella term, payment stablecoins are not as novel or exotic as their crypto origins may suggest. As one witness at last month’s hearing stated, these “look a lot like pretty basic cash instruments.”  Fiat-backed stablecoins differ from stablecoins that are algorithmically stabilized with a non-stable companion asset or those that are collateralized by crypto assets, like DAI. These non-payment stablecoins are said to be only “soft-pegged” to a unit of currency, as their value may fluctuate, and they may not be redeemable or exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for fiat.  The focus of the recent hearings and draft bills is primarily regulation of payment stablecoins, like USDC or Tether, which are estimated to account for ~90% of the overall stablecoin market and play an important role in the crypto ecosystem.  What is the point of payment stablecoins?  U.S. dollars are the preferred denomination of settlement for many crypto transactions. But without stablecoins, making payments in U.S. dollars or any other currency in exchange for crypto requires a third-party, such as a payments processor or a bank. Stablecoins are a useful innovation in that they represent a unit of fiat currency within an interoperable standard on a blockchain, allowing for transactions to occur and settle in U.S. dollars using “smart contracts” – self-executing code stored on a blockchain – rather than relying on a third-party intermediary.  Imagine an Apple Pay balance that was interoperable with any other cash balances you had on your phone, like those in your Venmo, Zelle or Amazon accounts. That’s essentially what payment stablecoins are. But with the added benefit of real-time, 24/7 settlement. In this sense, payment stablecoins are a bridge between crypto and traditional finance.  Of course, the value and usability of payment stablecoins are only as good as the cash and cash equivalents behind them. The good news is, since we’ve had cash-like instruments for some time, we know how to regulate them effectively.  Proposed legislation on stablecoins  The anticipated McHenry-Waters stablecoin bill is the latest in a long list of bills introduced over the last few years seeking to regulate stablecoins, such as the proposed Stablecoin Transparency Act, the Stablecoin TRUST Act and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, among others. While these bills vary in their scope and approach, they evidence a strong bipartisan consensus to regulate payment stablecoins as cash instruments – not as securities.  The latest versions of the draft bill would create a prudential framework for regulating payment stablecoins with important safeguards and limitations, such as:  capital and reserve requirements (1:1 backing)   redemption timeframe requirements   segregation of assets   limitations or prohibitions on commingling, re-hypothecation (like lending or investing the funds)   treating payment stablecoin issuers as financial institutions, subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and its AML/KYC requirements.   Indeed, of the various stablecoin bills proposed so far in Congress, only one – from 2019 – would potentially give the SEC authority to regulate payment stablecoins. Another bill from 2020 would give the SEC authority over “synthetic” stablecoins (e.g. uncollateralized, algorithmically-stabilized), but excludes reserve-backed (e.g. fiat-backed) stablecoins – instead establishing the Treasury Department (FinCEN) as the primary regulator. Nearly every stablecoin bill since then has taken a banking or prudential approach for regulation of payment stablecoins.  Payment stablecoins are not securities  While the SEC has not proposed a rule, issued guidance, or brought an enforcement action with respect to payment stablecoins, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly stated that he believes that these “so-called stablecoins” may be securities, describing them as “poker chips at the casino,” or, when used within crypto exchange platforms, possibly security-based swaps.  He has also said that some payment stablecoins resemble money market mutual funds. And in February, Paxos, a blockchain infrastructure platform that issues BUSD, a stablecoin regulated by New York State’s financial regulator, announced that the SEC was considering an enforcement action against it on the grounds that BUSD is an unregistered security.  It is clear the SEC views at least some payment stablecoins as securities, and that it could soon take enforcement action against them. While some stablecoin arrangements arguably meet the definition of an enumerated category of a security such as an “investment contract” under the Howey test or a “note” under the Reves test, payment stablecoins do not. Put simply, holders of payment stablecoins are not motivated by an expectation of profit, a necessary requirement under Howey, and a key factor of a multi-part balancing test under Reves. Payment stablecoins typically do not pay interest and are used like cash. Similarly, being fully-backed and used for non-investment purposes rebuts the presumption that payment stablecoins are notes under the Reves test.  As for their resemblance to money market mutual funds, most payment stablecoins are not marketed as dividend or income producing alternatives to bank deposits – instead, they are offered and used like digital cash. Most payment stablecoin issuers are not pooling and re-investing funds; they’re simply creating digital representations of fiat currency backed by cash or short-term treasury bills.  Although payment stablecoins must rely on an issuer or administrator to arrange for custody of the underlying cash or cash equivalents backing the stablecoin's value, this type of financial activity and relationship is typically regulated using a prudential framework that focuses on safety, soundness and supervision. Such an approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Presidential Working Group on Financial Market in its joint late-2021 “Report on Stablecoins” issued in collaboration with the FDIC and the OCC, and most stablecoin bills introduced by Congress so far.  Meanwhile, the CFTC has asserted in multiple enforcement actions that certain stablecoins – including USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI – are commodities. CFTC Chair Benham has also stated that USDC and other stablecoins similar to it would be commodities unless Congress says otherwise. The varied and sometimes conflicting positions taken by different financial regulators only underscores the need for Congressional action to get everyone on the same page.  Now that Congress is actively working towards a bipartisan, prudential regulatory framework to regulate payment stablecoins, the financial regulators, including the SEC and CFTC, should allow that process to play out. While the timing of any stablecoin legislation is unpredictable, stablecoin bills are clearly a high priority for both parties in Congress, which has spent more time on stablecoin legislation than any other crypto related policy area.  Comprehensive stablecoin legislation is good policy  Nearly all the witnesses at last month's hearing agreed that the U.S. has a strong public policy interest in providing regulatory clarity, maintaining the dominance of the U.S. dollar, and promoting financial inclusion. Sensible, comprehensive legislation on payment stablecoins will help to accomplish all three.  Some have speculated that stablecoins may pose risks to the broader financial system, citing the fact that Circle, which issues and manages USDC, held large deposits at the recently-shuttered Silicon Valley Bank. Chair Gensler himself attempted to make a connection between Silvergate and Signature Bank’s activities in crypto and their ultimate demise. However, at last month’s hearing, Adrienne Harris, Superintendent of New York state’s financial regulator, which regulated Signature Bank, definitively stated that its failure was not crypto related and called the claim a “misnomer.”  Others have criticized proposals for stablecoin regulation that would call for a dual state and federal approach similar to banking regulation. But this framework allows for better, more tailored regulation.  “It does not make sense for the OCC or the Federal Reserve to be spending significant amounts of time on a $2 million market cap stablecoin run out of Alabama,” said Austin Campbell, one of the witnesses at last month’s hearing, “but nor does it make sense for Alabama to be the sole overseer for a $500 billion market cap stablecoin.” Superintendent Harris also endorsed this approach, arguing that “states can act more nimbly,” and noting that FTX, Voyager, Celsius and Terra/Luna had been barred from doing business in the state.  While finding areas of agreement between crypto advocates and U.S. regulators has become increasingly difficult in the wake of recent events, the growing consensus on the need for comprehensive legislation on payment stablecoins provides Congress with an opportunity to enact sensible regulation over an important segment of the crypto market. The financial regulators should not front-run the democratic process.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked Grayscale to withdraw its application to make its Filecoin (FIL) Trust product more like a public company, the asset manager revealed Wednesday.  Grayscale had voluntarily filed a Form 10 to make its Filecoin Trust product a reporting company under which it would have been required to file quarterly and annual reports. The SEC has now asked Grayscale withdraw that application.  Grayscale said in a press release that it had received a comment letter from the federal securities regulator saying FIL ""meets the definition of a security.""  ""The SEC staff requested that Grayscale seek withdrawal of the registration statement promptly,"" Grayscale said. ""Grayscale does not believe that FIL is a security under the federal securities laws and intends to respond promptly to the SEC staff with an explanation of the legal basis for Grayscale’s position. Grayscale cannot predict whether the SEC staff will be persuaded that Grayscale’s position is correct, and if not, whether it may become necessary for Grayscale to seek accommodations that would enable the Trust to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or, alternatively, seek dissolution of the Trust.""  Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when asked if the agency could comment on FIL last month.  Grayscale said in a public filing in April that the SEC Divisions of Corporation Finance and Enforcement had reached out at the time ""concerning [Grayscale's] securities law analysis of FIL.  Grayscale ""acknowledges that FIL may currently be a security, based on the facts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to be a security under the federal securities laws, notwithstanding [Grayscale's] prior conclusion,"" the company said at the time.  FIL's price dropped nearly 3% (15 cents) on the news of the filing, before rebounding slightly and trading at $4.51 at press time, according to CoinGecko.  The back-and-forth reflects SEC staffers’ growing scrutiny of crypto tokens and their status under U.S. securities law. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly said that most cryptocurrencies are securities, a stance that fundamentally differs with that of the crypto industry, including Grayscale.  Issuers of securities have to register with the SEC and provide regular disclosures. The SEC has been cracking down on cryptocurrencies, especially projects which raised funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs), since 2017, forcing many of these projects to refund investors or shut down. Filecoin raised $200 million via an ICO.  Grayscale has previously made similar disclosures to its April Filecoin Trust disclosure related to its trust products for Stellar’s XLM, Zcash’s ZEC and Horizen’s ZEN.

The company filed for bankruptcy protection last July due to volatility in cryptocurrency markets and a default on a large loan made to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which will return customers about $1.33 billion in crypto assets. However, customers will only recover about 35% of their cryptocurrency deposits as the company winds down its operations after a failed buyout attempt by crypto exchange Binance.US. Related Reading: Ripple (XRP) Legal Defender Lauds Judge Torres’ Ruling As A Victory For The People Voyager Leaves Customers With Only Fraction Of Deposits Voyager’s bankruptcy case was complicated by two failed sale attempts during the bankruptcy process. The company initially sought to sell its assets for $1.42 billion to FTX, a deal that failed when FTX imploded in November. Binance.US signed a $1.3 billion offer but called off the deal on April 25, citing a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate.” Per the report, Voyager customers’ recovery hopes are now heavily dependent on the outcome of litigation with FTX, which is seeking to claw back $445 million in loan repayments made to Voyager before FTX collapsed into bankruptcy. However, If Voyager fully prevails in the FTX litigation, customers’ expected recovery would be 63.74%, according to Voyager’s court filings. Voyager intends to repay customers with the same type of cryptocurrency that they had in their accounts. However, for deposits held in unsupported cryptocurrencies that cannot be withdrawn from Voyager’s platform and for Voyager’s proprietary VGX token, Voyager will instead repay customers using the Circle’s stablecoin USDC. Voyager was one of several crypto lenders to file for bankruptcy in 2022 after a boom in the COVID-19 pandemic. Other companies that filed for bankruptcy include Celsius Network, BlockFi, and Genesis Global Capital. Did the SEC Play A Role in Binance.US’s Failed Acquisition? There are speculations that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have had a hand in Binance.US’s failed $1.3 billion acquisition of crypto lender Voyager Digital. The buyout was called off in April, with Binance.US citing a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate.” However, some industry experts believe the SEC’s increased scrutiny of the crypto industry may have played a role in the failed acquisition. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been ramping its efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. As a result, firms like Coinbase have been exploring ways to expand their operations to other jurisdictions. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Whales Move Massive Amounts, Dumping Going On?

The recent move has come despite muted price movements for the two cryptos and amid low volume, with bitcoin trading action 25% below its 20-day moving average and ether 33% below. Bullish ETH investors likely may be anchored to its now persistently deflationary status, with token supplies contracting by 240,000 since September.  A look at relative rotation graphs (RRG) shows both bitcoin and ether currently trailing traditional finance in performance and momentum over the most recent 10 days.  Relative Rotation Graphs display the relative strength and momentum of assets to a central benchmark. In this instance, the S&P 500 serves as the benchmark, while the Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 also serve as analogs. The most recent RRG shows BTC and ETH falling into a lagging quadrant relative to all three indices.  For context, lagging assets within RRG’s are underperforming on the basis of both performance and momentum.  A technical look at the ETH/BTC chart shows momentum increasing alongside the improved performance, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) up 13.6..  A look back at historical RSI levels implies that prices may stall however. Since 2015, the ETH/BTC RSI has fallen between 52 and 54 approximately 112 times, with average 30 day performance of just .002%. The data highlights bitcoin’s tendency to outperform ether historically. The ETH/BTC pair is currently trading 40% below its 2018 maximum of $0.11.  An additional 2% move higher would push ETH/BTC past the upper range of its Bollinger Bands, amplifying its recent ascent.

42420423,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpmBh,1684353135,USDC Issuer Circle Moves $8.7B to Repo Agreements to Protect Reserves From U.S. Government Default,"Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial is rebalancing the reserves backing the $30 billion USD Coin (USDC) as it braces for the risk of a U.S. government debt default.  The Circle Reserve Fund, managed by global investment management giant BlackRock, added $8.7 billion in overnight repurchase (repo) agreements to the portfolio as of May 16, according to the fund’s website. The so-called tri-party repo agreements involve banking giants such as BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada.  Overnight repo transactions are effectively short-term collateralized loans. The borrower is selling a security – in this case, U.S. Treasurys – for cash, and agrees to buy back the collateral the next day for a slightly higher price. What’s really happening, though, is that big institutional investors with cash to spare are parking that with Wall Street dealers that need funding.  “While this plan has been underway for many months, the inclusion of these highly liquid assets also provides additional protection for the USDC reserve in the unlikely event of a U.S. debt default,” a Circle spokesperson emailed in a note.  Circle is doing this as U.S. lawmakers are locked in discussions with President Joe Biden’s administration over raising the government’s ability to issue new debt, also known as the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the Treasury Department is set to run out of cash by early June unless the debt limit is raised.

42420415,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpm2P,1684352929,The Risks and Rewards of High-Frequency Crypto Trading,"I had a nice conversation this week about high-frequency trading (HFT) in crypto markets. Born out of an idea I had to explore the space generally, a bout of fortuitous timing let me speak with someone who has engaged in it first hand.  I’ve always viewed HFT as a quantitative trading style that combines individual quantitative acumen with technical tools to take advantage of price discrepancies. Market makers in stocks and derivatives markets famously deploy the technique, leveraging coding ability and technical skill to capture trading opportunities first.  Often this involves arbitrage, where one asset has two different prices on separate exchanges. If, for instance, you can buy an asset for $10 on one exchange and nearly instantly sell it for $10.25 on another, you will have essentially secured a riskless profit. Doing so over and over can be highly profitable. Some of the more well-known names in HFT are Jump Trading, Citadel Securities, Virtu and Hudson River Trading.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  In popular culture, HFT has been displayed in Michael Lewis’ 2014 book “Flash Boys,” along with the 2018 film “The Hummingbird Project.” Both describe real and fictional, respectively, efforts to help HFT firms speed up their trading reaction times by fractions of a second by running a new, straighter fiber-optic line across the U.S. Today, the fastest firms use microwave or shortwave radio networks.  HFT certainly has its critics. Some write it off as outright cheating, arguing that access to faster throughput enables them to “front run” orders. Others say that it provides an unfair advantage to institutions over individuals. And others attribute rapid crashes in prices to HFT.  Use of HFT within crypto markets could amplify those critiques to symphonic levels. Still, the part of me that enjoys the marriage between markets and technology can’t help but look further.  My curiosity brought me to a conversation with Keone Hon, CEO of Monad Labs. His current firm’s mission centers around delivering a proof of chain (PoS) blockchain, which increases transaction throughput, and maintains compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). His prior role included a role as quantitative trading team lead at a separate HFT firm.  And while I spent the first half of this column discussing what I knew (or thought I knew), I’d like to spend the second half discussing what I learned. Here are some takeaways:  What HFT provides to crypto  Part of the edge is borne out of the nascency of crypto itself. Since there are fewer participants than there are over in traditional markets, price dislocations are more common – meaning larger profits. As more participants come in, those opportunities will become more scarce.  Buyers and sellers are not necessarily prepared to trade at the same time, so HFT firms bridge that time gap, buying from sellers and vice versa.They also compete with other traders to quote prices as tightly as possible.  “At the end of the day, professional automated trading is providing a service, although it may not sound that way,” Hon said.  The different HFT strategies in use  Candidly, this was my most selfish question. I enjoy all conversations around strategy and how individuals synthesize their own interpretation of data into a plan of action.  It was apparent that a class of strategies exists in HFT. One (mentioned previously) is arbitrage, whereby the trader is looking to take advantage of mispricings across different exchanges. Other strategies are alpha-driven, kicked off by “quantitative signals that come from measuring things happening on the order book,” Hon said.  What stood out to me during our strategy discussion was the need to not only be thoughtful in execution, but in position management and exchange evaluation. Part of the requirement of trading across exchanges involves maintaining inventory there, which brings with it additional elements of counterparty risk, particularly with centralized exchanges.  To that end, I got the sense that Hon feels that decentralized exchanges need to catch up to their centralized counterparts in terms of the user experience and quality of execution. My impression is that part of his current firm’s goal is to bridge the current gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges.  Regulation  How can you have a conversation on crypto and trading and not bring up regulation at least once? On that end, I suspect his response will surprise some.

The individuals identified as Leonard Lancia and Alex Casimo broke off from the company to start a high-frequency trading firm called Portofino Technologies. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Trading Volume Soars Amid Bullish Price Surge According to the lawsuit filed by Citadel Securities, Lancia, former Head of Europe Systematic Market Making for Derivatives, and Casimo, Business Manager for the firm’s Europe team, tried to raise capital for their firm while still working at the hedge fund. Thus, the individuals allegedly breached their agreement with the company as they still have access to proprietary information. Citadel Securities is one of the world’s largest and most prominent hedge funds; its proprietary products allow it to gain an edge over its competitors. Last year alone, the hedge fund scored over $16 billion in profit while the rest of the market trended to the downside. Therefore, the company jealously protects its intellectual property. After examining the exact monetary damages for Lancia and Casimo’s alleged actions, the hedge fund seeks potential restitution. Crypto Execs Stole Trading Secrets From Citadel? In 2022, Portofino founders, Lancia and Casimo, claimed to have secured around $50 million to launch their crypto trading firm. The crypto firm was launched to provide liquidity for institutions and whales in the nascent sector. When the executives left the firm, Citadel Securities launched an internal investigation. As a result, they found a pitch deck from Portofino’s fundraising stage. The pitch was dated “months before the pair announced their intent to leave the firm,” the complaint noted. The investigation found that Casimo and his partner offered information about Citadel’s proprietary trading techniques, including High-Frequency Trading (HFT). Per the report, the hedge fund, worth over $50 billion, stated the following in the complaint: (…) engaged in a brazen scheme to steal Citadel Securities’ trade secrets, lie to their Citadel Securities colleagues and raid the ranks of Citadel Securities’ employees.

42420425,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpmCj,1684352165,Ethereum Staking Needs Its (Honest) LIBOR,"In any industry, standardization drives scale. Ethereum’s transition last year to proof of stake (PoS) unlocked an exciting opportunity to create a benchmark that tracks staking yields, which could serve as the basis for financial products that track this rate.  Under PoS, Ethereum block validators, also known as stakers, lock up a portion of their ether (ETH) as collateral to participate in the network's consensus mechanism. In return for their participation, stakers earn rewards in the form of new protocol emissions and transaction fees.  To fully achieve the promise of this innovation, a standardized benchmark can be produced by capturing and publishing the daily, annualized mean of on-chain rewards across all validators. It would be difficult to manipulate because of the inherent transparency, replicability and immutability of the blockchain – in contrast, say, to the infamously manipulated LIBOR benchmark that powered traditional finance (TradFi) credit markets for years.  Based on a preliminary analysis of how such a benchmark would behave,  average protocol emissions appear to trend downward as new validators come online. But it’s clear that the rate skyrockets with material increases to network activity resulting from a flight to safety (FTX’s insolvency) or new network activity (the recent PEPE meme coin frenzy).  A standardized ETH staking rate will provide immediate utility as:  a benchmark  a tool for risk transfer  As a benchmark, an ETH staking rate would work similarly to traditional instruments like overnight index swap (OIS) rates – delivering reference rate utility to market participants. From new crypto-native Sharpe ratios to pricing benchmarks, a standardized ETH staking rate can be used to discount future cash flows – letting investors better assess the present value of their investments in the Ethereum ecosystem.  A standard staking rate would form the underpinning of an important new tool for risk transfer. Interest among natural hedgers, especially validators, and prospective speculators will result in the inevitable formation of a forward curve resulting in swaps, futures and other derivatives. Basis swaps with traditional rates or cross-currency swaps with fiat currencies could provide an interesting new crypto rate onramp, while also allowing structured products to proliferate.  A new staking rate could unlock the next generation of financial products while serving as a building block of Ethereum’s monetary policy. As such, CESR represents an important development in the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem and a new frontier for innovation in the world of decentralized finance and beyond.  NOTE: CoinFund recently announced that it had partnered with CoinDesk Indices to launch CESR, a composite ether staking rate.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Christopher R.

Currently, OP is at the $1.6 price level as it seeks to consolidate its gains, which is bullish. Also, the upcoming upgrade in June might lead to an uptrend for the asset. Optimism (OP) Technical Analysis OP price is in an uptrend today, forming a higher high on the daily chart and moving up from the sideways trend of the last few days. However, despite its positive price moves today, the bears are still active in the market. OP is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bearish sentiment. Also, it is in the lower region of the Donchian channel, where it moved from its previous downtrend. This is also a bearish sentiment for the asset. However, it is not all bad for the digital asset as OP has formed four consecutive green candles on the daily chart confirming that the bulls are rallying once again in the market. OP has found strong support at the $1.621 price level. It is approaching the $1.709 resistance level as the bulls mount pressure today. OP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.47, close to the oversold region 30. The RSI is moving upwards, indicating a potential bullish recovery ahead.

42420424,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpmAf,1684351800,Ethereum Briefly Stopped Finalizing Transactions. What Happened?,"The Ethereum blockchain suffered two brief episodes last week where blocks weren’t finalizing – an unwanted bout of instability that presents risks to the blockchain’s security but isn’t considered dire.  There was a lot of confusion in terms of what the delay in “finality” meant for the functionality of the blockchain, prompting discussions about security concerns. So, it bears unpacking a bit.  You’re reading The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The cause of the temporary loss of block finality remains under investigation, though Prysm, a provider of client software used to run a node on the blockchain, just released a new version, describing it as “the first full release following the recent mainnet issues,” with “critical fixes.”  When data blocks don’t finalize, there isn’t supposed to be any downtime or difference in end-user experience. That said, a loss in finality can lead to some security issues like reorgs.  Reorgs occur when a blockchain produces more than one block at the same time, usually because of a bug or an attack. This means that a validator node temporarily creates a new version of a blockchain, which makes it difficult to properly verify if a transaction has been successful, while the old version of the blockchain continues to exist.  However, snowball effects from this incident led to some end-user jolts. DYdX, a leading crypto exchange platform, had to temporarily pause deposits because of one of last week’s incidents, and Polygon’s zkEVM also experienced some delays with deposits.  So how does finalization work?  In a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum’s, validators first have to propose a block that contains transactions. Once those are proposed, other validators have to sign off on the block to permanently add it to the blockchain, which takes about 15 minutes. Once it is approved, or “attested,” by two-thirds of validators, the block eventually becomes finalized.  Thus, finality is the point where transactions on a blockchain are considered immutable. Finality is supposed to guarantee that transactions within a block cannot be altered.  If finality cannot be guaranteed, the blockchain enters an emergency state called the ""inactivity leak,"" where validators receive penalties for not reaching finalization. When the state is triggered, it acts as a way to incentive the blockchain to start finalizing again. The incident last week triggered Ethereum's first-ever inactivity leak.  The Ethereum community has acknowledged that the current timeframe for blocks to be finalized is too long.  “Having a delay between a block's proposal and finalization also creates an opportunity for short reorgs that an attacker could use to censor certain blocks or extract MEV,” the Ethereum website shared in a blog.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was writing about finality seven years ago, an indication of just how important an issue it is.  When the first loss of finality occurred on May 11, developers immediately shared it over Twitter, saying they were going to deploy extra help to figure out what was going on. After 25 minutes, the issue seemed to have been resolved and the chain resumed finalizing.  Roughly 24 hours later, the chain stopped finalizing again for about an hour, which caused outages for some infrastructure providers.  In the past, finalization has temporarily stopped because of bugs in client software used to run the blockchain. Ethereum has multiple clients in the event that there is a flaw or glitch in the software, so there are other options, and the activity on the blockchain can keep running.  How did this affect the applications?  Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk the incident is “definitely significant, but it's not something where Ethereum’s security or soundness is at risk or compromised.”  “Within minutes, things were corrected and within like a day or two clients had software patches to make sure that this specific case did not come up again,” he said.  The developers are still looking to understand what caused the blockchain to stop finalizing, and are expected to discuss a post-mortem report in their upcoming Consensus Layer call.  Beiko told CoinDesk that the incident did not get to a point “where we began to test the very extreme fallbacks in the protocol to deal with this stuff.”  The incidents did affect several applications that run on top of the Ethereum blockchain.  Jordi Baylina, technical lead at Polygon, said that the finality stoppage meant that deposits onto the Polygon zkEVM chain were delayed, and since the chain relied on Infura, an infrastructure provider which also temporarily had an outage as a result of the loss in finality, issues for individuals using the zkEVM compounded.  “You need to wait for the finality in layer 1 deposit to be available in layer 2,” Balyina said. “So until you don't have finality, you cannot use [the chain] or you have the risk of double spending in layer 2.”  DYdX paused its deposits temporarily today due to the lack of Ethereum finality and said it was “continuing to monitor and investigate this issue.”  Despite this, Ethereum developers emphasize that the network did not go down.  “Today’s incident has been a great fire drill. It looks like two or three issues came together (as is often the case). The chain recovered gracefully and we discovered a few other issues that could be improved to make Ethereum more resilient,” tweeted Marius van der Wijden, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation.

The digital token gained 0.4% to $27.16K at 2:39 p.m. ET, after sliding to as low as $26.62K earlier in the session. On the other hand, ethereum ( ETH-USD ) slipped 0.3% to $1.82K. The intraday rebound in BTC coincided with a strong rally across the stock market, with all three major U.S. indices up at least 1.2% at the time of writing. The gains came as traders praised the results of Tuesday's meeting on the debt limit. Another catalyst that could be supporting bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) upswing is stablecoin issuer Tether's new investment strategy : investing up to 15% of its net realized operating profits into BTC.

While the wait continues, a recent ruling led Pro-XRP Attorney Jeremy Hogan to applaud Judge Analisa Torres as ‘The People’s Judge’. Judge Torres ruled on public access to the Hinman Speech document in the lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple. After the ruling, the Pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan took to Twitter to praise her. Ripple Attorney Hogan Applauds Judge Torres Judge Torres denied the SEC’s motion to seal Hinman’s Speech documents. The judge noted that they are vital judicial documents portraying a strong presumption of public access. In her ruling, Judge Torres stated, “The Hinman Speech Documents would reasonably tend to influence ruling on a motion.” Through an attachment in his tweet, Attorney Hogan noted that the Hinman Speech document could impact the court’s final ruling in the lawsuit. Hogan thinks that Judge Torres’ ruling aligns with the interest of the XRP holders, Ripple Labs, and the entire crypto space. Also, the move could impact the US crypto regulatory clarity. Related Reading: Does The Bitcoin Price Dump Signal The Start Of Another Bear Market? Before now, the XRP community called for more clarity and access to details about the SEC’s accusation against Ripple. Notably, the 2018 controversial speech by the former SEC’s director Hinman has been a significant factor in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. In a speech in 2018, Hinman stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities. However, he did not comment on XRP though the token was the third-largest crypto asset during the period. As such, the Silicon Valley-based blockchain firm Ripple has requested the Hinman Speech document in court, but the SEC denied it. Ripple wanted to discover the opinion attached to XRP regarding Hinman’s controversial speech. Though the Commission surrendered the document, it still filed a motion to keep the documents sealed. But the recent ruling will unseal the document as Torres has now approved public access. XRP Price Action The excitement is increasing with the XRP community following the recent SEC vs. Ripple case ruling. This achievement has shown a notable influence on the price action of XRP within the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $27,000, Here Are The Factors Driving The Recovery At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.4457, showing a surge of 0.72% over the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Whales Have Transferred Huge Amounts According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large SHIB and DOGE transactions have occurred during the last 24 hours. The first transfers that took place were those involving Dogecoin. In total, there were five such massive transactions, and interestingly, all of them saw the movement of the same amount of tokens: 680,000,000 DOGE. As this amount is quite large (the exact USD cost differs between the transactions, but it was still similar nonetheless; the transfers were worth just under $49 million each), it seems reasonable to assume that some sort of whale entities were behind the moves. Considering that the transfers all involved the same amount of DOGE and the fact that they all took place within a span of just 20 mins, a logical possibility arises: the transactions were made by the same whale investor. The full details of the Dogecoin transactions also confirm this; the sending and receiving addresses match up between the five transactions. This means that this single whale moved around $244.7 million worth of DOGE in such a short span of time. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment What did this humongous holder intend to do with this transfer? Well, below are the details regarding the first of these transactions, which may help shed some light on the context surrounding these transfers. This massive transaction seems to have only taken a fee of 2.4960 DOGE to go through | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address here was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform. Such addresses are generally investors’ personal wallets. The receiver, too, was an unknown address in this case. Generally, if investors want to sell, they deposit their coins to platforms like exchanges. In this case, however, the whale hasn’t done so, so it’s hard to say what the exact purpose behind the transactions may have been. It’s possible that they were simply done with the intent of moving to a fresh wallet, but it’s also possible that they were made to sell through over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Naturally, if the latter case is true, the price would feel a bearish effect. Interestingly, the Shiba Inu whale transactions from the past day have a similar story; they also seem to have been made by a single investor. In total, the holder moved 20,000,000,000,000 SHIB (about $174.4 million) across four transactions between unknown wallets. Looks like this transfer on the Ethereum blockchain cost around $4 | Source: Whale Alert These Shiba Inu transactions also occurred right after the Dogecoin transfers were finished. It’s uncertain currently, but the similar pattern and the close timing may suggest that these transactions involving the two largest meme coins in the sector may have been linked. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Is At A Crucial Junction, Will Bulls Find Victory? The assets have been struggling recently so it’s possible that these whales have given up on them and have decided to sell.

NovaWulf, an investment firm which was founded by the duo behind bitcoin miner TeraWulf (WULF), was the original bidder, known as the stalking horse, which set base terms for the auction. The process could be wrapped up as soon as this week.  The assets include Celsius’s mining unit, its loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrency, and other alternative investments, according to court filings.  Fahrneheit is backed by Arrington Capital, U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc. (known as U.S. Bitcoin Corp.), investment firm Proof Group Capital Management, former Algogrand CEO Steven Kokinos, and investment banker Ravi Kaza. It is formalized as a limited liability company.  Coinbase (COIN) is also involved in the bid, said Michael Arrington, founder of the synonymus VC firm, in a now-deleted tweet reported by Fortune. Arrington is also the founder of tech media site TechCrunch and information platform Crunchbase.  The two bids share similarities. Crucially, Fahrenheit plans to issue equity for the assets that will be managed under the new company, whereas Novawulf planned to tokenize the shares on the Providence blockchain.  ""Our bid not structured as a simple asset purchase. We are proposing that the assets be placed into a new company and is run with the sole goal of growing those assets to make stakeholders whole,"" Arrington said in a tweet announcing the Fahrenheit project.  Another bid was made by another consortium which includes Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation, decentralized finance firm Global X Digital and Gemini Trust Company.  Judge Martin Glenn expressed concerns that the process might hit a ""regulatory roadblock"" and compared it to Voyager, another crypto firm that went bankrupt last year. The Celsius legal team sought to reassure the judge, citing ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities.  A sale of $1 billion of Voyager's assets to Binance was abruptly terminated following pushback from regulators.  Proof Group's Managing Director Noah Jessop has also invested in bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ), according to his Twitter bio, which is both in its own Chapter 11 bankruptcy and in a dispute with Celsius.

In a poll of 1,860 “U.S. retail users,” the company supporting the popular DeFi token trading platform called Uniswap found that many respondents are put off by the complexity and cost of on-chain trading.  The survey indicates permissionless DeFi trading still has a ways to go if it is to succeed in mass adoption. In order to trade on a service such as Uniswap, crypto users must have a wallet, sufficient ether (ETH) to execute and a willingness to pay sometimes-exorbitant gas fees. And that’s if they understand what they’re doing to begin with.  There’s only so much a DeFi service can do about easing fees and self-custody, though. Uniswap Labs said it conducted the survey to get a better understanding of its customers and is committed to increasing educational resources that target these people who currently use centralized services.  “The entire industry now must work to help educate users about how to use DeFi and the benefits of self-custody.

The top-ranked online casinos offer a payout percentage of at least 95% or more, meaning that they usher in the highest possible win rates to their users. We advise online gamblers to stay away from casinos that have a payout percentage below 90%, no matter the welcome bonus. Promotions One of the advantages of gambling online is the bonuses and promotions available. When we review online casino sites, we look at the quantity and quality of bonuses available. This includes welcome bonuses, loyalty programs, and free spins. The top contenders in our list have an extensive range of bonuses for different players. We also evaluate the terms and conditions, and the wagering requirements of each bonus. Customer Service Lastly, we test customer service before we can recommend the site. Mainly, we check if the casino has a reliable customer support team that is available 24/7 to respond to customer queries. We also contact the support team to evaluate the response time and the quality of support offered. The best online casinos offer helpful solutions to problems and concerns that might come up.

42420419,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpm7Z,1684339223,What Does the Debt Limit Showdown Mean for Bitcoin?,"U.S. lawmakers are currently locked in a passionate, high-stakes and entirely ridiculous battle over a strange quirk of U.S. law known as the “debt ceiling.” Since 1917, the U.S. budget appropriations process has separated the actual budget – which members of Congress have already approved – from the government’s ability to sell bonds to pay for it. Treasury Secretary Janey Yellen has said that if new debt isn’t approved by June 1, the U.S. government could default on its financial obligations – including halting the payment of interest on Treasury bonds.  This unusual process has become a very appealing tool for a theatrical, media-friendly form of politicking. With increasing frequency over the past three decades, fiscal conservatives have used the vote to raise the debt ceiling as an opportunity to agitate for lower spending. It makes for good TV, with a looming deadline and frantic dealmaking, but none of the political risk of negotiating over specific elements of the U.S. budget.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For all its ultimate hollowness, the debt ceiling show down has real consequences in the traditional finance sector, most notably raising the cost of borrowing for everyone. Longer term, repeated debt ceiling standoffs have more systemic impacts on the U.S.’s standing as a pillar of global finance.  Both of those impacts have implications for bitcoin.  Fiscal responsibility theater  Most serious people regard the so-called “showdown” over the debt ceiling as pure political theater. First, because the legislators purportedly taking a bold stance against spending have already voted in favor of that spending. And second, because the consequences of actually defaulting on the U.S. national debt would be so incomprehensibly catastrophic that economists and the like can hardly conceive any lawmaker would actually follow through on the threat.  That theory is less reassuring when you realize that some of the loudest voices in the debt ceiling showdown come from the House Freedom Caucus, a coterie of far-right populists who seem to think defaulting on the U.S. debt would be Incredibly Based. That reality is leading Democrats to try to cut deals with the more restrained Republican factions, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA.), a politically fragile leader who needs protection from his own right wing.  It’s still very unlikely that the U.S. defaults on the national debt. But if it does, the price of bitcoin is going to be far down the list of almost anyone’s concerns. Janet Yellen was downplaying it when she described the consequences as “severe hardship for American families.” A U.S. default would trigger the domestic economic equivalent of a nuclear carpet bombing.  And just as with a barrage of nukes, the damage would come in two stages. The initial impact would include the interruption of all sorts of government payments, potentially anything from Social Security checks to big-money military contracts. This would cause an immediate, sharp drop in traditional metrics like GDP [gross domestic product] and the stock market. Given recent evidence of strong correlation between bitcoin and tech equities, it would almost certainly gut bitcoin’s short-term price, too.  A default is, again, a remote possibility. But its potential impact is so huge, even that slim chance is already being reflected in markets. The yield on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds is already inching up, reflecting increased risk of holding them. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and bitcoin have both limped downwards over the past two weeks, though other uncertainties in the market make it hard to connect those moves directly to the debt showdown.  But the second stage of the economic doomsday triggered by a default would be more complex and persistent – and just as deadly as the invisible radiation that lingers after a mushroom cloud drifts away.  Welcome to the debt polycrisis  A U.S. debt default would dramatically reshape the global financial system, in ways that would be likely to increase bitcoin’s role as global financial infrastructure. This is another example of bitcoin’s role as a theoretical hedge against a disastrous scenario: of something that’s good for bitcoin precisely because it’s very bad for human society.  Bitcoin’s neutral monetary layer could very well form a significant backstop simply because it is unfettered from national debt risk.  A U.S. default would, first and foremost, decimate international appetite for holding U.S. debt. That would spike the cost of servicing existing debt, likely forcing the U.S. into a brutal austerity regime. That in turn would slow the entire global economy dramatically – another downward pressure on bitcoin.  But by the same token, U.S. default would accelerate international efforts to decouple from the U.S. dollar as a trade and investment instrument. The dollar’s biggest appeal is its strength and stability, and a default would obviously harm that faith. Saudi Arabia, Russia and China have all made significant recent gestures towards getting the key oil trade off the dollar, but a default could push those efforts from rhetoric closer to reality.  This anxiety would be very likely to create at least some added marginal demand for bitcoin as an international trade instrument.  But as the cartoon rabbit says, that’s not all, folks.  When I and others sneer at the debt ceiling standoff as pure theater, it’s not because we disagree with the nominal goal of reducing government spending. Rather, the gripe is that a semi-annual debt ceiling standoff is a very bad way of pursuing fiscal responsibility.  That’s unacceptable exactly because debts and deficits are such deadly serious issues, not just in the U.S. but around the world. In the U.S., a staggering 7% of federal spending goes to servicing debt. Those taxpayer dollars are no longer doing anything to strengthen the economy or improve the lives of its citizens. And every time we run an annual budget deficit, that spending on debt service goes up.  See also: The World's Best Crypto Policies: How They Do It in 37 Countries  We’re clearly on an unsustainable path. But so is everyone else. Global national debt levels now sit at 102% of GDP, an all-time record that is just above the roughly 100% debt-to-GDP ratio that is considered sustainable for an individual country. This has led to increasing worry about what some have termed a “Great Reset” – a cascading series of interlocking national defaults that wipes out debt holders at huge scale.  Because national debt makes up such a huge portion of the assets on global balance sheets, the impacts would be catastrophic, and instability in the U.S. debt market is as likely to set off the cascade as anything.  This scenario is part of the much broader case for bitcoin’s ascendancy as a global reserve and trade instrument (setting aside, for the moment, very real technical limitations).

Migration From Ethereum To BSC The shift to move assets from the legacy smart contracting network could be driven by the desire to escape high gas fees. For every transaction executed on public ledgers like Ethereum and BSC, a fee is paid. In Ethereum, gas fees remain higher, especially for users deploying smart contracts. Analysis of the latest gas fee trends on Etherscan indicates shows that network fees have been fluctuating, and generally higher in the past weeks. As of May 17, Gas fees stood at 43 gwei or roughly $1.59 for simple transfers. Meanwhile, BscScan data shows that users have to pay 3 gwei for transfers, regardless of the urgency of the transaction. Related Reading: Historical Crossover Suggests Ethereum (ETH) Top Is In The difference in gas fees between Ethereum and BSC, when analyzed in USD terms, is apparent and could explain why users are seeking alternatives, moving assets from Ethereum to alternative blockchains like BSC that offer lower Gas fees. Is PEPE FOMO The Reason? The recent surge in Ethereum gas fees can be attributed, in part, to the hype surrounding the PEPE, a meme token. With PEPE spurring demand and forcing on-chain activity higher, Ethereum gas fees rose in tandem. According to Y-Charts, Gas fees on Ethereum increased from $43 on April 22 to $155 as of May 5, 2023. The unprecedented demand for PEPE due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) coincided with the near-exponential increase of fees from the last week of April to early May. This spike highlighted the scalability challenges faced by Ethereum during periods of increased activity. Fluctuating Gas fees, depending on network activity, is primarily one of the reasons why developers are looking to integrate long-lasting solutions, including on-chain and off-chain scaling methods. According to the roadmap, Ethereum will introduce Sharding, where the network will be broken into portions called “shards”. Shards are sub-networks that will form part of the whole of the Ethereum blockchain. Each Shard will process transactions independently but remain connected to other shards. In this system, Ethereum developers hope to scale transaction processing throughput on-chain, lowering fees. Shards remain an idea and are being studied. Given this, layer-2 scaling options are gaining traction as a means of improving scalability by re-routing transactions to an off-chain platform, relieving the underlying blockchain, and reducing processing fees. L2Beat currently shows that there are over 20 layer-2 scaling options aiming to scale the mainnet. Arbitrum and Optimism, two of the most active general-purpose platforms for deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications are the most active. The two, Optimism and Arbitrum, control over $7.5 billion of assets as measured by total value locked (TVL). Related Reading: Optimism Layer-2 Is Upgrading: Is This What Bulls Want? Optimism will release “bedrock,” via a hard fork in early June 2023. This upgrade aims to enhance scalability, improve transaction speeds, and reduce gas fees on the off-chain solution. With these improvements, Optimism hopes to carve out a larger market share, pushing its TVL higher.

The gravity of the situation was highlighted as the DOJ, in a press release dated May 16, announced the unsealing of two indictments against this individual, shedding light on the intricate web of criminal activities that have the potential to disrupt vital systems and compromise national security. Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev, who is known by various aliases such as m1x, Wazawaka, Uhodiransomwar, and Boriselcin, was identified as the accused individual after the unsealed charges made his identity public. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Break Free From Limbo? Market Awaits Bullish Catalyst A Multi-Faceted Attack According to a press release from the DOJ, Matveev’s attack was directed against a variety of targets across the US mainland, including law enforcement organizations in New Jersey and Washington, DC, as well as the healthcare industry and a number of other fields worldwide. Federal officials announced a $10 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Matveev on Tuesday. Russian hacker Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev in a wanted poster. Image from KrebsonSecurity According to court documents, federal officials have charged Matveev with conspiring to transmit ransom demands, conspiring to damage protected computers, and intentionally damaging protected computers. He faces more than 20 years behind bars if found guilty of his crimes. Russian Hacker Makes Easy $200 Million Ransomware variations of LockBit, Babuk, and Hive were used in the attack, which dates all the way back to 2020. According to reports, Matveev demanded up to $400 million and seized $200 million. James E. Dennehy, FBI-Newark special agent in charge, said: “These malicious actors believe they can operate with impunity – and don’t fear getting caught because they sit in a country where they feel safe and protected. That may be the case now, but the safe harbor may not exist forever.” In quotes by USAToday and published on Yahoo! News, Dennehy added that when they have an opportunity, they will do “everything in our power to bring Matveev and his ilk to justice.” The Russian hacker allegedly launched global attacks on hospitals, government organizations, and other targets using several ransomware variants from his base of operations in Russia. “These international crimes demand a coordinated response. We will not relent in imposing consequences on the most egregious actors in the cybercrime ecosystem,” Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the DOJ Criminal Division, said of Matveev. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has listed Matveev as one of the most wanted cybercriminals. The FBI describes Matveev’s connections to Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg, Russia, and asks people all over the world to be on the lookout for his distinctive physical features, including four fingers on his left hand and a tattoo sleeve on his right arm. BTCUSD drops below the crucial $27K region.

It is predicted that there were 236.1 million ransomware assaults worldwide in the first six months of 2022, data by AAG IT shows.

42420426,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpmEn,1684335754,Investors Track Pepecoin Whales to Cash In on Meme Coin Mania as Wider Market Stagnates,"After pepecoin (PEPE) took just weeks to go from zero to a nearly $2 billion valuation and produce almost-instant millionaires, envious crypto investors are prowling for the next get-rich-quick meme coin.  Anyone doing so is ignoring the fact that the shocking magnitude of PEPE's controversial rise is rare. Digital assets that have very little – or no – fundamental value like dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB) pop out of the ether every couple of years. But finding the next PEPE is next to impossible; every winner is surrounded by the ashes of many failures. (And, also, PEPE's market cap has crashed to less than $650 million, according to CoinGecko.)  That doesn't stop people from trying. For some, that means simply copying whatever early PEPE investors have put their money into next. On-chain data makes this easy. Wallets holding a large amount of tokens can be tracked on sites like DeBank.  Over the course of last weekend, several newly issued meme tokens surpassed PEPE in trading volume. This flurry of activity was down to whale watchers, people who buy assets based off what large wallets are doing.  One wallet that holds over $4 million worth of PEPE purchased a meme coin called HARAM – a token plagued with xenophobic imagery – at 22:22 UTC on Saturday. The market cap skyrocketed from $200,000 to $5 million in the next 4 hours, and 24-hour volume subsequently hit $20 million on Sunday.  This wasn't the only example. Bizarrely named meme tokens like RIBBIT, BOB, JEFF and WEN all experienced massive spikes in volume over the weekend. Amid this rush into meme coins, overall volume on Uniswap's decentralized exchange surged to $150 million an hour at numerous points on Saturday, way up from the typical $16 million to $30 million, according to Dune Analytics.  As attention switches to meme coins, other sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) are beginning to suffer. The total value locked (TVL) on DeFi protocols has slumped from $53 billion to $47 billion in the past 30-days, and while some of this can be attributed to a crypto market correction, outflows from platforms like Agility LSD, which has seen $500 million in outflows, could demonstrate a waning of interest.  And then there's the question of whether some meme coins have nefarious intentions. There are hundreds of new ones listed every day and a quick glance at DEXTool's ""live new pairs"" section suggests an increasing trend of rug pulls, where token creators either dump their tokens on new investors or alter the code to make it so investors can't sell.  Read more: GREED Token Is Not a Crypto Scam, but a Lesson on How to Get Scammed Amid Meme Coin Mania  While a select few investors might strike the jackpot and make substantial returns, the odds aren't in their favor.

12721199,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533540,1684335019,Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends Upwards: A Potential Breakout Or Impending Correction?,"After experiencing a bearish trend on April 17, 2023, that dropped the asset to a low of $10.12 from $12.88, Cosmos (ATOM) has managed to recover slightly. Between February 8 and May 17, ATOM witnessed a significant decline of 32.89%, reaching a low point of $10.175 on May 9. The current month has, however, brought a surge in demand for Cosmos (ATOM), leading to a remarkable price performance. What’s Ahead For Cosmos (ATOM)? According to data, ATOM experienced a substantial price decline, reaching $10.73, a 0.95% decrease within the last 24-hour trading period. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Break Free From Limbo? Market Awaits Bullish Catalyst Notably, the 24-hour trading volume is up by 9.04%, rising to $85 million, indicating that the market activities around ATOM are increasing. More buyers and sellers are actively participating in trading ATOM. Also, an increase of more than 9% signifies potential price volatility, which might influence the price of ATOM. But the current market sentiment of ATOM is bearish as its Fear and Greed Index shows 28, fear. This indicates a potential downtrend as investors and traders fear entering the market. This may also lead to high sell pressure from the investors. Based on the Fear & Greed Index reading, the market may likely experience some price correction if the bears maintain this momentum in the coming days. Cosmos (ATOM) Technical Analysis The 200-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) currently exceed the ATOM/USDT trading pair price. This indicates that the market is on a bearish trend in longer and shorter timeframes. Also, this means that the selling momentum is stronger than the buying. However, if the bulls increase the buying pressure, some price changes might occur in a few days. Related Reading: Power Play: Top 5 Cryptos Set To Ignite The Week With Decent Gains The Relative Strength Index shows 44.91, meaning there’s market indecision between buyers and sellers. The market in a neutral zone indicates low pressure from buyers and sellers. However, the MACD is above the signal line depicting a potential bullish momentum for ATOM. Also, the histogram is currently above the zero level, validating the bullish sentiment. Latest Development To Spike Network Utility The ecosystem recently announced the adoption of its first Cosmos native shared security model by a widely known Permissionless CosmWasm platform called Neutron. The Replicated Security brings a new era of utility to the network. It will also help Cosmos Hub to offer security to new projects launching as Hub-secured consumer chains. The consumer chain will share its revenue with the Hub in exchange, and will also be shared with ATOM validators. Neutron being the first platform to pioneer Cosmos Hub Replicated security, will enjoy instant access to the multi-billion dollar economic security of the Hub. This recent development could attract more investors, traders, and institutions into the network, driving the demand for ATOM significantly over time. featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/cosmos-atom/cosmos-atom-price-trends-upwards-a-potential-breakout-or-impending-correction/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42420412,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUplzJ,1684333848,"Florida’s DeSantis Waging Toothless Campaign Against Digital Dollars, Lawyers Say","The state-level campaign against a U.S. digital dollar made its first foray into established law with Governor Ron DeSantis’ signature on Florida’s effort to block the use of virtual government-backed money in business transactions.  But the Florida governor’s rhetoric that his state is banning central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as “government overreach and woke corporate monitoring” may not amount to much on paper. Legal experts in this facet of commercial law suggest the state’s effort is nonsensical and potentially harmful for the digital assets sector DeSantis said he’s trying to protect.  “They didn't ban anything,” said Carla Reyes, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law, who has done work in both digital assets law and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that Florida is focused on. “The law does exactly zero of the things that it says that it does.”  The state’s new tweak “expressly prohibits the use of a federally adopted CBDC by excluding it from the definition of money within Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code,” according to the governor’s office. From introduction to his signature last week took just 43 days.  DeSantis – one of the Republican Party’s early favorites as a potential presidential candidate next year – turned his May 12 signing of the law into a political event, claiming it as the start of a potential multi-state push from Republican state lawmakers to counter a digital dollar well before the federal government decides whether to issue it or not. North Carolina has also been considering a measure to oppose a U.S. CBDC, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem recently vetoed a bill to update its UCC in a way she argued would have allowed for CBDCs and “a potential future overreach by the federal government.”  “We’re on offense in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said at a press conference, standing behind a sign reading “Big Brother’s Digital Dollar,” referencing George Orwell’s tale of supreme government control, “1984.” The new law – effective in July – declared digital dollars won’t be considered money in the state’s version of the commercial code.  The UCC represents an accord among states, which have largely adopted this common set of rules for buying and selling of goods and conducting other financial transactions across state borders. Florida has officially thrown its CBDC wrench into that standardization, saying digital dollars aren’t money as defined in the code. But it doesn’t really ban CBDC use in interstate commerce, just puts those assets in another category than money, lawyers say.  ""I could still buy a computer using CBDCs if that's what they wanted me to pay in,"" said Reyes, who said the government-backed assets would now fall into the bucket of “general intangibles” under the UCC. “The UCC doesn't have the power to ban people from using any type of exchange. That's not what it does.""  CBDC Opposition  DeSantis called the CBDC “a massive transfer of power from individual consumers to a central authority,” and he said the federal government would “have the ability to control where that money is going,” citing a future government’s ability to stop gun purchases or halt somebody from buying too much gasoline.  Though DeSantis and other Florida Republicans suggest the U.S. is definitely heading toward issuing a digital dollar, that view isn’t yet reflected by what’s happening. While the administration of President Joe Biden is under orders to develop the concept of a U.S. CBDC, no federal entity has yet declared support for issuing it.  The Federal Reserve would be in charge of the digital dollar, and officials including Chair Jerome Powell have said the central bank won’t act without backing from the White House and Congress. The Fed also doesn't want to be in the retail CBDC business, so officials have declared that it won’t administer individual accounts and that people’s transactions would have to be managed by banks or in other outside digital wallets.  DeSantis acknowledged that if Congress eventually authorizes a U.S. CBDC, the state may have to back down. But more than that, Andrea Tosato, a legal scholar who has advised on UCC amendments and teaches at University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School, said that any federal law on this point will automatically override state law.  If that happens, though, it won’t have anything significant to override in Florida, he and Reyes suggested.  The UCC Reality  The UCC represents longstanding, battle-tested standards for basic transactions, and they‘re meant to be “super boring” and nonpolitical, Tosato said. The Florida effort to use it as a shield against digital dollars is “painting the UCC as something that it is not.”  The UCC gives both sides of transactions basic legal protections, Tosato explained, but it doesn’t tell them what they can or can’t exchange. That’s the job of regulations or criminal codes.  When one digs into “the rabbit hole and the craziness of what was done with this Florida bill,” Tosato said, “there is no light-bulb moment. It makes no sense.”  The governor’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on these points. DeSantis suggested during his press conference that he wasn’t just protecting people’s financial privacy but was also seeking to defend crypto from federal government interference.  “I think they want to crowd out and eliminate other types of digital assets like cryptocurrency, because they can’t control that,” he said.  While Florida rewrites its single-state corner of the 50-state standards, though, it’s also rebuffing a set of amendments suggested last year that were meant to set standards for the interstate use of cryptocurrencies, including in such examples as the use of bitcoin as collateral in lending. That could have been a foundation for digital assets in commerce, Tosato argued, and other states have been moving forward to adopt the changes.  Even the way Florida defines a CBDC could be problematic. Its new law says a CBDC is a government-issued digital currency ""that is made directly available to a consumer,"" but Tosato contends that doesn't reflect any of the current or planned CBDCs, which generally have service providers manage the accounts or wallets for using the virtual currency.  “There is no CBDC anywhere that is issued directly to consumers,” Tosato said.  As DeSantis and his allies celebrate their CBDC ban, Tosato says they’ve compromised the UCC’s crypto modernization and are misrepresenting the meaning of their overhaul of Florida law.

The startup allows developers to access and utilize cross-chain data using natural language requests backed by artificial intelligence (AI), an increasingly popular albeit controversial technology in the crypto space.  ""We did extensive interviews with developers over the past year, gaining insights into their previous tool usage and the challenges they faced,"" said Jason Goldberg, CEO of Airstack, in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Airstack was built to directly address those pain points.""  Since its debut in April, Airstack has successfully attracted over 200 developers, who have used the platform for projects spanning marketing engines, decentralized finance (DeFi) portfolio optimizers, customer resource management tools, advertising platforms, and decentralized social and messaging applications.  With Airstack, developers can query, combine, and integrate on-chain or off-chain, cross-chain, and cross-application data using a single query and response. For instance, a natural language query involving the Polygon blockchain's native MATIC token might be, ""Get all holders of MATIC token who hold a minimum of 10,000 MATIC, their token balances, and their ENS and Lens and Farcaster.""  The first half of the funding round closed in the third quarter of 2022 and included Polygon among the backers. Hashed Emergent, NGC, Primal Capital, UOB Ventures, and Signum Capital, among others, also were investors.  Simultaneous with the funding announcement, Airstack unveiled an updated version of its Jam social app. Built on Farcaster and Ethereum, the iOS and Android app features user profiles and groups built around users’ Web3 collectibles.  While Airstack currently provides its services free of charge, the company plans to implement a pricing model in the future. Goldberg expressed his strategy: ""Our immediate focus is to onboard thousands of developers onto Airstack in the coming months. We aim to identify the areas where we add the most value and where genuine business use cases emerge before finalizing our pricing model.""

This migration highlights a growing trend of utilizing Bitcoin within Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and other interesting areas. Billions Of Bitcoin Being Tokenized Out of the $5.75 billion worth of BTC exported from Bitcoin, over $1.44 billion found its way to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) with more BTC tokens flowing to Avalanche, Fantom, and Solana. Just like Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, and other ecosystems where tokenized BTC found its way to, support smart contracting. Therein, holders can engage in DeFi, possibly earning income. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Break A Pattern Held Throughout Halving Cycles: Glassnode Bitcoin doesn’t support smart contracts; explaining why some holders are tokenizing their assets. Still, while there appears to be growing demand for DeFi, reading from this outflow of BTC to smart contracting platforms, total value locked (TVL) and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have been low and even stagnant. Data from DefiLlama.com, a DeFi analytics platform, shows that TVL is flat and below $50 billion. Meanwhile, DEX trading volumes have been relatively low in recent months. This phase of decreased activity could suggest a temporary slowdown in decentralized trading, mirroring the general trend of crypto prices in recent months. With less than $2 billion of registered DEX trading volumes on May 17, there has been a notable slump in activity over the last months, especially from early 2022. In November 2021, at the peak of the last bull cycle, DEX trading volumes, on average, stood at over $7 billion. BTC Prices Suppressed But Coin Is A Safe Haven While users port their BTC to smart contracting platforms, Bitcoin prices remain under pressure partly due to regulatory decisions across the world, mainly in the United States and Europe. On May 16, the European Union (EU) approved comprehensive crypto regulations which aim to bring transparency and oversight to the crypto industry, addressing concerns such as money laundering and investor protection. Even in this bearish environment, Geoff Kendrick, the head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, recently opined that Bitcoin prices could rally by as much as 70%, adding $20,000, should the United States default on its debt. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses Grip On $27,000 Handle Amid Debt Ceiling Concerns – Details Although Kendrick said the probability of this default is a “low-probability, high-impact event”, his prediction has generated significant interest within the crypto and Bitcoin communities as some begin to theorize the potential impact of the world’s superpower defaulting on its debt obligations on the broader financial landscape. Any such event would result in economic turmoil and an inevitable loss of faith in traditional financial systems that would most likely drive investors towards alternative assets, mostly cryptocurrencies. Considering Bitcoin’s stature and setup as a safe haven, the coin, in Kendrick’s view, could benefit, subsequently posting significant gains.

With the acquisition, Ripple is seeking to capitalize on increasing demand for institutional cryptocurrency custody services. The institutional crypto custody market is expected to reach $10T by 2030, it said. ""Recent research conducted by Ripple shows that most global finance leaders at financial institutions and enterprises have plans to use crypto custody solutions in their business within the next three years — primarily through a third-party provider."" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC that the company used $250M of cash from its balance sheet to fund the acquisition. Metaco provides custody infrastructure for institutions to scale new business models in the crypto economy. Its technology offerings are currently available in Switzerland, Germany, Turkey, France, the U.K., the U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, among other jurisdictions. Last year, BNP Paribas ( OTCQX:BNPQF ) teamed up with Metaco to offer crypto custody services to its clients. Other Metaco clients include Societe Generale ( OTCPK:SCGLF ) and Citigroup ( C ). Ripple, associated with the XRP ( XRP-USD ) token, uses blockchain and cryptocurrency for use in such areas as cross-border payments, central bank digital currencies, liquidity management, and tokenization. ""Enabling customers to custody, issue and settle these tokenized assets is a natural next step in both the company’s and the industry’s evolution,"" the company said . The acquisition comes even as regulatory issues hang over the crypto sector. Ripple Labs said it expects to spend $200M fighting a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC contends that XRP is a security, while Ripple considers it to be a currency. The SEC filed the lawsuit in December 2020.

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Blockchain-based play-to-earn project Axie Infinity's native cryptocurrency AXS ralliedafter the company’s card-based strategy game debuted on the Apple app store. AXS surged over 12% from $7.16 to $8.04 on the news, becoming the top gainer on CoinDesk Indices' leaderboard. The game will initially launch in the Apple store across Latin America and Asia. Bitcoin traded down on Wednesday, struggling to hold the $27,000 mark as investors keep a close eye on developments around raising of the debt ceiling in the U.S. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has lost 9% over the past month.  Crypto companies fleeing U.S. regulatory uncertainty have been offered a welcome in France, by officials boasting a regulatory framework that offers relative predictability. The European Union member already boasts around 74 registered crypto companies. “In France, we are proud to be pioneers,” said Benoît de Juvigny, Secretary General of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), noting his country’s crypto service asset provider regime – known as PSAN – was passed in 2019, “If American players want to benefit, in the very short term, from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly they are welcome,” he added. “We have good relations and discussions with our U.S. counterparts.”  Using distributed ledger technology (DLT) in securities markets could create savings north of $100 billion per year, a report produced by a major traditional-finance lobby group has said. In a paper published Tuesday evening, the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) called for regulators to allow the technology that underpins crypto to aid collateral management, asset tokenization and sovereign bond markets.“ Distributed ledger technology holds promise for driving growth and innovation,” said Adam Farkas, Chief Executive of GFMA, whose affiliates in the U.S., Europe and Asia count major players such as JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and Nomura among their members.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the 24-hour change in volume and open interest in futures tied to the top 10 cryptocurrencies.  Payments-focused XRP has been the most active cryptocurrency of the past 24 hours, with volume growth of over 200%. The notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in open futures contracts, has increased by 9%, signaling an influx of new money into the market.  An uptick in volumes and open interest often brings increased price volatility.

42420420,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpm5V,1684324800,Tether Says It Will Buy Bitcoin for Stablecoin Reserves Using Realized Profits,"Stablecoin issuer Tether will regularly buy bitcoin (BTC) for its stablecoin reserves using a portion of its profits starting this month as part of a new investment strategy focused on the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, the firm announced on Wednesday.  Tether said it will allocate up to about 15% of the realized profits from investments – excluding any unrealized price appreciation of its reserve assets – to purchase BTC and will add the tokens to the reserve surplus.  The company will custody the BTC stash on its own, without using any third-party custodians, according to the statement.  The development comes after Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin on the market, the $82 billion USDT, revealed last week that it holds $1.5 billion of BTC and $3.4 billion of gold among the assets that backs the value of USDT and its smaller stablecoins. Some 85% of the reserves are held in cash and cash-like assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, according to its 2023 Q1 attestation.  Stablecoins, now a $131 billion asset class, have become a crucial building block of the cryptocurrency infrastructure, facilitating trading and transactions between government-issued fiat money and digital tokens by keeping their price anchored to an external asset, usually to the U.S. dollar.  BTC investments  The firm’s BTC purchase campaign aims to strengthen and diversify the stablecoin reserves, while capitalizing on its price appreciation as an investment, the press release said.  “Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential,” Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether, said in a statement. “Our investment in bitcoin is not only a way to enhance the performance of our portfolio, but it is also a method of aligning ourselves with a transformative technology.”  The company said it will exclusively utilize realized profits from its investment operations for buying BTC, disregarding unrealized capital gains. It means that the firm considers “only the tangible gains from its operations,” consisting of the difference between the purchase price and net proceeds from an asset sale or, in case of maturing assets such as Treasury bills, between the purchase price and the reimbursed amount, per the statement.  Tether said that it also focuses on developing communication systems, energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure among its smaller investments.  For years, Tether has been criticized within the crypto industry for its lack of transparency about its reserves and controversial investment decisions.  However, the firm’s flagship token USDT emerged as a safe haven in March as the U.S. regional banking crisis hit Circle’s USDC, the second largest stablecoin. The sudden implosion of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) left a part of USDC’s cash reserves frozen at the bank over a weekend, and several stablecoins lost their dollar peg temporarily in a knock-on effect.  Tether came out of the calamity as a clear winner by maintaining its price stability due to its perceived disconnection from U.S-based banks, being incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong. USDT’s circulation has grown 24% this year while most rivals have suffered significant outflows.

The purchase will allow Ripple to expand its offerings by incorporating the technology to custody, issue, and settle tokenized assets. Metaco offers customers crucial and secure custody infrastructure, allowing institutions to scale new business models in the crypto economy.  Diversifying into custody solutions will bring new revenue opportunities, Ripple said, adding that the acquisition is part of its strategy to broaden its presence beyond the U.S and its uncertain regulatory landscape.  In 2020, Ripple and some of its executives faced a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the unregistered sale of approximately $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens.  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently estimated that the legal battle will cost the company around $200 million, while also cautioning crypto entrepreneurs against establishing their businesses in the U.S. While the judge residing on the Ripple lawsuit, said on Tuesday that the regulator cannot seal documents tied to former official William Hinman's 2018 speech on crypto and securities.  Read more: SEC Can't Seal Docs Tied to Hinman's Ether Speech, Judge in Ripple Suit Rules  According to a company spokesperson, the acquisition was financed through a combination of cash and Ripple equity.  “Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive branch and a truly unmatched customer track record,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.  Ripple will become the sole shareholder of Metaco, which will continue to operate as an independent business unit led by its founder and CEO Adrien Treccani.

With US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issuing warnings that the US is projected to breach the debt limit as early as June 1, the stakes have been raised significantly for both the financial markets and the cryptocurrency industry.

Furthermore, its seven-day decline of 2.7% reflects a persistent bearish trend in the market that has many investors concerned. Source: Coingecko One factor that has contributed to the low liquidity in crypto markets is regulatory uncertainty. Market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto have recently retreated from crypto trading in the US, citing concerns over regulatory challenges. This has added to the already existing concerns surrounding the lack of regulation in the crypto industry, which has made investors wary of entering the market. According to a report by crypto data firm Kaiko, Bitcoin’s 1% market depth – a measure of liquidity conditions – has dropped by 4% over the past month, while Ethereum’s has fallen by 2%. Altcoin liquidity has suffered even more, with a roughly 17% decline on a monthly basis. This low liquidity has made it difficult for traders to execute large orders without experiencing significant price slippage, further contributing to the bearish trend in the market. As such, investors are closely watching developments in the regulatory landscape to determine if a more favorable environment for crypto trading can be established. BTCUSD slips below the crucial $27K region.

42420421,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpm8b,1684319792,Indian Authorities Asked to Restore Crypto Exchanges' Access to UPI,"India's government and central bank have received proposals asking to restore access of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a widely popular real-time payment system, to the crypto industry, several sources familiar with the matter have told CoinDesk.  Two proposals have already been made. A third proposal will be made ""in the coming few weeks"" by India's newly formed crypto policy advocacy group, the Bharat Web3 Association (BWA), one individual familiar with the decision told CoinDesk.  The proposals, while not coordinated, appear to be the first major push by India's crypto stakeholders to seek policy changes that govern the burgeoning industry since it suffered a series of blows in the form of harsh taxes, a crypto winter, and a ""shadow ban."" The shadow ban saw Indian payment processors cut off banking access to crypto exchanges. UPI services were ostensibly suspended around the same time last year.  Since the pandemic, UPI adoption in India has rapidly increased with approximately 74 billion UPI transactions worth $1.5 trillion conducted in 2022. UPI allows citizens to pay for groceries and other goods using a QR code linked to their bank account. The system is used nationwide because merchants aren’t charged any fee for accepting UPI payments.  How Indian exchanges lost UPI access  The trigger for the payment rail crisis appeared to be Coinbase's launch in India. On April 7, 2022, Coinbase launched its India operations with executives touting how easy it would be to trade on the company app with payments being processed by UPI. Hours after the event, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) – the entity that governs UPI – tweeted to clarify that it was “not aware of any crypto exchange using UPI.” The NPCI is under the aegis of the nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Read More: UPI Was Central to Coinbase India Launch; Now the Crypto Exchange Says It's 'Unavailable'  One proposal to restore UPI access was made by an Indian crypto exchange that asked not to be identified because the matter hasn't been made public. ""We have submitted a representation with the NPCI, seeking the removal of restrictions on use of UPI services,"" the crypto exchange said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  The proposal was made shortly after India added crypto to anti-money laundering rules (PMLA or Prevention of Money Laundering Act), making crypto exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and custody service wallet providers legally responsible for monitoring suspicious financial activities in March 2023. The jury on what this meant for India was divided. Legal experts said this gave teeth to the regulators overseeing the industry for the first time. At the same time, advocates of the crypto industry said this gave ""more legitimacy"" to the sector because ""adding crypto to anti-money laundering rules is some semblance of regulation,"" a senior industry participant said Monday.  ""Our submission highlights that VDA (Virtual Digital Assets) service providers are now covered as ’reporting entities’ under the PMLA and are also registered with the FIU (Financial Intelligence Unit). We believe that these guardrails go a long way in helping secure VDA transactions and arresting malfeasance, if any,"" the same crypto exchange's statement said.  The second proposal, made in tranches over the past few weeks – both before and after India added crypto to anti-money laundering rules to different authorities – came from public policy advisory firm Black Dot, its founder Mandar Kagade told CoinDesk. The firm has previously collaborated with the Indian government. CoinDesk has seen an email from the Finance Ministry acknowledging Black Dot's proposal and other emails confirming the firm sent the proposal to entities like the NPCI, the RBI and Jayant Sinha, the chairperson for the Standing Committee on Finance.  What Black Dot's proposal contains  Black Dot's proposal argues that UPI's seamless user experience encourages transactions to remain onshore providing a visibility trail for regulators and law enforcement. Citing the Economic Times, it said 80% of digital asset transactions may be conducted on a peer-to-peer basis since the closure of UPI access. The proposal also says ""arbitrarily denying a class of investors from accessing instruments of their choice via UPI when another group of investors has access to their choice (e.g., IPO) may also violate Article 14 (equality before the law).""  The proposal asks NCPI to group crypto exchanges based on how they meet agreed norms among banks.  It's unclear whether authorities will restore UPI access to crypto exchanges but doing so would lend credibility to the space while making it much easier for retailers to start or continue trading on crypto exchanges.  CoinDesk has reached out to the Finance Ministry, RBI, NPCI and BWA for comment.  Read More: India Has Clamped Down on Crypto.

AXS surged over 12% from $7.16 to $8.04 after the news, becoming the top gainer on CoinDesk Indices' leaderboard. At press time, AXS was on track for its best single-day percentage gain since Jan. 22. The cryptocurrency fell by over 3% in April, registering its third consecutive monthly decline amid the token unlock and risk aversion in the broader market.  Initially, Apple store users across Latin America and Asia in countries including Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam will have access to the card-based game called Axie Infinity. The game already has 1.5 million installations across all platforms. Sky Mavis, the creator of the play-to-earn project, plans to expand the game's outreach via Google and Apple mobile users.  Open interest spikes  AXS's price rally was accompanied by a sharp increase in the notional futures open interest or the dollar value locked in open futures contracts. That's a sign of an influx of new money into the market.  The notional open interest rose to over $75 million from nearly $40 million a day ago, reaching the highest since February, according to Coinglass.  However, the leverage appeared skewed to the bearish side, as funding rates in the perpetual futures market remained negative. Negative rates indicate the dominance of bearish short positions in the market.  Investors probably shorted perpetual futures contracts to protect the long position in the spot market from a sudden price drop, a reflection of lack of confidence in the sustainability of the price rally.",POSITIVE,AXS,ASIA | AXS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/17/axie-infinitys-axs-token-jumps-14-on-apple-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8cf1c57254fdcde74483864b7c1a3391d8891fb-1230x466.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The level has been a significant hurdle for the meme coin to cross since early May, and it has made several attempts to break past it, only to face rejection each time. This resistance level has caused considerable anxiety among SHIB holders and traders, who are now closely monitoring the coin’s movements to see if it can finally overcome the dreaded line and push towards a new all-time high. Related Reading: Power Play: Top 5 Cryptos Set To Ignite The Week With Decent Gains Shiba Inu Faces Market Pressure Amid ‘Death Line’ Fears Shiba Inu has been grappling with market pressure in recent weeks, with its CoinGecko price hovering at a meager $0.00000878 and experiencing a stagnant 24-hour change of 0.8%. Over the past seven days, SHIB has seen a 1.9% decrease in value, struggling to break free from the grips of the recent slump. Source: Coingecko The SHIB token faces significant challenges, with the existence of the “Death Line” looming ominously over its future. The term refers to a crucial resistance level at $0.000008, which the token has been unable to breach despite repeated attempts. The failure to overcome this barrier could potentially cause the token’s price to plummet to $0.000007, marking a severe setback for SHIB and its holders. #Bitcoin #Cryptonews #Ethereum #BTC #Crypto #Blockchain Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) ‘Death Line’ Might Cause True Horror on Market https://t.co/xXo8RIXBRC pic.twitter.com/qPgwLqt1Ba — CryptoverseEu (@Cryptoverse_Eu) May 16, 2023 Source: TradingView Furthermore, despite reaching a solid support level at around $0.000008, SHIB’s price is under considerable pressure from the market. If the token fails to maintain its position above the support line, a significant price correction could ensue. SHIB currently has a market cap of $5.27 billion.

Analyzing Potential Downturn Several factors hold sway over the trajectory of the Shiba Inu token and the wider crypto market. Market sentiment, for instance, plays a significant role. The emotions, opinions, and attitudes of investors can greatly impact the demand and value of cryptocurrencies. Positive sentiment can fuel bullish trends and drive prices upward, while negative sentiment can trigger sell-offs and result in a bearish market. Technical analysis indicates the possibility of a downturn in the crypto market, but it’s crucial to recognize the ever-present volatility that characterizes this realm. Despite the indications, it is important to acknowledge that nothing is definitive in this unpredictable landscape. -Featured image from iStock",NEGATIVE,BTC | SHIB,BTC | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-faces-tough-resistance/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

12714241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533401,1684315842,"Coinbase And Ripple Playing Game Of Poker With The SEC, CNBC Correspondent Says","Amid deep regulatory uncertainty in the United States, several cryptocurrency firms consider sailing to more welcoming atmospheres. Top US-based firms Ripple and Coinbase, who’ve been cross-chairs with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), have already hinted at possible relocation. Reacting to the issues, two CNBC correspondents, Ryan Browne, and Arjun Kharpal, weighed in. According to the journalists, crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase are playing a poker game with the SEC. Crypto Firms Threaten Relocation To Ease Regulatory Pressure The regulatory atmosphere in the US crypto space has become supercharged over the past few months as the SEC accelerated their crackdown moves against crypto companies. The SEC turned its attention to Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and Kraken amid long-running litigation with Ripple. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Is The Most Undervalued Asset in Crypto These firms aren’t comfortable with the increased enforcement threats from the regulators as they complain the SEC has taken the regulation-by-enforcement approach without providing any clear guidelines for them. Coinbase and Ripple even threatened to relocate their business outside the US, hoping regulators would reconsider their hawkish stance. The CNBC correspondents further noted that Ripple executives joined forces to publicly criticize the SEC and gain support from the broader crypto community. Prioritizing Politics Over Policy Is Unfavourable for the Economy, Ripple CEO Says In their report, Browne and Kharpal quoted Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who, as a US citizen, expressed his disappointment with the situation. In a statement, Garlinghouse said, “The US is getting passed not just by a little bit but by a lot.” Garlinghouse claims more challenging is the fact that the US considers politics over policy, an unfavorable decision for investors. On most occasions, the SEC repeatedly argued that nearly all crypto tokens in the market constitute securities. Related Reading: Power Play: Top 5 Cryptos Set To Ignite The Week With Decent Gains That was why the regulator sued Ripple in December 2020, accusing the firm of offering XRP as an unregistered security. However, Ripple has continued to contest this issue in court with the SEC, hoping to get a favorable ruling soon. The SEC did not only point fingers at Ripple, as it recently came at Coinbase, issuing a Wells Notice alleging possible securities law violation. Crypto exchange Kraken suffered the same fate and had no choice but to discontinue its staking services in the US with a settlement of $30 million. The SEC claims its moves are to protect Americans from crypto investment risks. However, pro-XRP lawyer, John Deaton, asked the SEC chief, Gary Gensler, to stop claiming to protect the American public against crypto. These regulatory actions have attracted reactions from industry figureheads, including Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. Hoskinson urged crypto enthusiasts to support pro-crypto policies in the next elections to stop regulatory issues.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China published its guidelines for the treatment of NFTs on Monday, recommending stronger ""risk research and judgment"" and to ""accurately punish crimes.""  After China cracked down on local crypto trading and cut off banks from offering crypto-related services in 2021, the local industry all but vanished – until NFTs stormed the scene, and started gaining popularity in China as ""digital collectibles,"" that didn't fall into the same basket as high-risk crypto. But the prosecution agency's new report warns otherwise.  ""While it has high popularity, it is very likely to cause financial risks, management risks, network security risks, etc., especially the legal risks. Prosecutors are paying close attention,"" the report from Monday said.  NFTs attach a unique digital identifier to virtual or real items, that allows proof of ownership to be recorded on a blockchain. China's prosecution agency argues owners cannot really ""enjoy"" the ownership, particularly of digital art, which can still be replicated and distributed.  ""From the perspective of property rights, consumers do not enjoy the ownership of the NFT digital assets they purchase in the sense of civil law, and consumers cannot prohibit others from accessing, copying or disseminating the digital assets mapped by NFT,"" one author of the report said. ""What consumers enjoy is only an exclusive right to prohibit others from tampering with the ownership of the NFT recorded on the blockchain.""  Despite China's aversion to crypto, the country is looking to harness the blockchain technology that underlies virtual assets to build out national digital infrastructure.

Though the token has retracted in value, a former Dogecoin millionaire offers some insights on PEPE. Glauber Contessoto, aka Dogecoin millionaire, took to Twitter to lay out a suitable period to invest in the meme coin. Dogecoin Millionaire Recommends The Best Time For PEPE Investment According to the crypto strategist, enthusiasts should wait till the meme token drop by 80% to 90% from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00000431. Then, that will be the right time to invest in PEPE again. Contesssoto’s tweet has attracted much criticism, as many users stated that the PEPE pump is over. Some users called his suggestion “unintelligent,” while others advised him to return to DOGE. A particular user asked DOGE Millionaire why he didn’t take the same investment approach for Floki Inu.

However, the meme coin faces fierce volatility, which has drained its value and market cap. Now, PEPE is trading at $0.0000016525, indicating a drop of 2.25% over the past 24 hours. Also, the value of the meme coin has plummeted by over 60% from its ATH of $0.00000431. The market cap currently sits at $660.9 million.

42420417,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpm3R,1684308097,"Fleeing U.S. Crypto Firms ‘Welcome,’ French Regulator Says","PARIS, France – Crypto companies fleeing U.S. regulatory uncertainty have been offered a welcome in France, by officials boasting a regulatory framework that offers relative predictability.  The European Union member already boasts around 74 registered crypto companies – a number that could surge to 100 as a last round of firms seek to anticipate the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets rules that were formally signed off by ministers earlier Tuesday.  “In France, we are proud to be pioneers” with the crypto service asset provider regime, known as PSAN, that was legislated in 2019, Benoît de Juvigny, Secretary General of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), told reporters Tuesday.  “If American players want to benefit, in the very short term, from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly they are welcome,” he added. “We have good relations and discussions with our U.S. counterparts.”  The legal certainty now apparently achieved in France is only recently gained. In January, lawyers were warning that legislative amendments proposed by the national Senate – eventually watered down – could kill innovation.  There are also still some gray areas: French lawmakers are still pondering what kinds of crypto social media influencers should be able to promote. The EU is still deliberating on how to regulate financial services that have no central entity, and Juvigny said the AMF will produce a paper with some ideas in the coming weeks.  But essentially the legal framework is all but nailed down, contrasting sharply with the situation across the Atlantic. In recent weeks, players including Bittrex and Coinbase have quit the U.S., or threatened to, citing the uncertain regulatory environment caused by active regulatory enforcement, combined with no obvious prospect of a crypto law from Washington.  Not easy  France may be predictable and stable, but that’s not the same as being easy or straightforward.  Seventy-four companies, including Binance and Bitstamp, have already been awarded a registration demonstrating basic governance and money-laundering compliance. Firms can also take the further step of seeking a license, if they have enough capital, though no company has yet acquired one.  Under new transitional measures agreed earlier this year as a bridge to MiCA, companies applying as of July will undergo a “reinforced” registration, in which they have to prove they have resilient IT systems and a conflict of interest policy. MiCA itself, set to take effect in 2025, grants the right to serve the pan-European market, and extends wider to include services such as crypto investment, advice and portfolio management.  That web of four different coexisting regimes is complex, as de Juvigny himself concedes – but officials are keen to bat off complaints from the industry that some requirements are impossible to meet in practice, and procedures unduly lengthy.  Complaints  Contrary to some industry concerns, officials say it’s indeed possible for crypto firms to get commercially insured to AMF standards. “I’ve seen the contracts with my own eyes,” Stéphane Pontoizeau, a director at the AMF responsible for supervising market infrastructure and intermediaries, told reporters.  Those who do their homework by studying the AMF’s guidelines will find they can acquire a new status in just a few months, Pontoizeau said – adding that those who find it takes longer often didn’t get their house in order.  With dozens likely waiting in the wings to get registered, there could be around a hundred companies on the “start line” in France before MiCA kicks in, Pontoizeau said – though some, headquartered in other EU member states or serving only the French market, may not seek a full AMF license under the EU law.  And for some, France’s rigor may be the point – such as Circle, the stablecoin issuer which has applied for registration from the AMF, and said it also wants to seek a license.  Together with the ACPR, the arm of the French central bank responsible for vetting crypto companies’ money laundering compliance, “the AMF … have a strong reputation for being a major market regulator that is forward thinking but manages risk well,” Circle’s Vice President for Policy and Regulatory Strategy Teana Baker-Taylor told CoinDesk. “It's not a light touch jurisdiction.”  Read more: EU Crypto Industry Applauds MiCA – But Looks to What’s Next  Quotations have been translated from French.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/17/fleeing-us-crypto-firms-welcome-french-regulator-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2aa9eeaa106756bdd4300e3e169618ce55bad26c-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420408,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUplwD,1684307794,Even Licensed Firms Say Opening Bank Accounts Is Hard in Hong Kong,"Crypto companies' applications to operate in Hong Kong following its push to reinstate itself as a crypto hub have been piling up, but these companies are finding it difficult to do something as basic as open a bank account.  Applicants told CoinDesk that just eight officers at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) are handling around 80 applications, and even licensed firms are running into difficulties when it comes to bank accounts.  “This probably would have been a different story six or nine months ago,” Amy Yu, APAC CEO for crypto bank SEBA, told CoinDesk.  Hong Kong has become a jurisdiction that companies are considering, after regulators relaxed their opposition to the sector, even as other countries look more critically at crypto. Singapore’s financial regulator has made it clear to the market that it will be less supportive of what it considers to be speculative, and the U.S. looks less than friendly to crypto.  Hong Kong's de facto central bank knows that banking access is an issue for crypto companies. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has reminded banks that there’s no ban on offering crypto firms accounts, but a roundtable it organized last month, attended by banks and crypto firms, focused only on easing access for firms that already held or which were applying for licenses, an attendee told CoinDesk.  “It was more like a wish list from the regulator,” he said. “Whether the banks fully embrace it is another matter.”  CoinDesk spoke to a C-suite executive at a crypto firm based in Hong Kong that holds a Type 9 license, which allows the company to carry out asset management activities. The company was still unable to open a Hong Kong bank account and relied on overseas banking partners. This executive said that this made on- and off-ramping difficult for potential investors.  “It’s not clear to us what extra information the banks need,” she told CoinDesk. “Internally, they don’t seem sure about what they want from us.”  Facing rejection  Venture capital firm Braeside founder Tak Lo told CoinDesk that “many crypto companies present themselves as other firms other than asset management firms in order to facilitate bank account opening.”  When companies are upfront about what they do, that can mean their applications are rejected.  Prosynergy managing director Louie Lee told CoinDesk that opening bank accounts is an “acute issue” at the moment, and that banks can be ""sensitive and restrictive in their approach.”  Amid all the talk of licensing and regulations in Hong Kong, “not all crypto-related activities require a license,” Lee continued. “You may be operating in an unregulated space, but this does not mean it's illegal,” he said.  “The process is you apply and you get rejected,” Jehan Chu, founder of crypto venture capital firm Kenetic, told CoinDesk.  Even if firms manage to get accounts, Chu added, “six months later you get it shut down for no reason.” He said that firms try to stay low-profile.  Sometimes firms opt to buy an expensive insurance or investment product so that their relationship is more valuable for the bank.  It’s considered the cost of doing business since banks are for-profit entities after all. But that kind of decision doesn’t make sense for many startups.  Keeping accounts open  Even players who have successfully opened bank accounts “have a lot of uncertainty on whether or not they can continue having that account going forward,” corporate credit card issuer Reap co-founder Kevin Kang told CoinDesk.  This uncertainty means they’re constantly on the look out for new options and opportunities to set up bank accounts.  “They don't have visibility on when they're going to be checked,” Kang said, referring to banks examining transactions.  When transactions are targeted by a compliance team within banks, it can mean the company is unable to use that account. Unless they provide a certain amount of documentation within a period of time on those transactions, their transactions may be stopped and sent back.  Firms are subject to the whims of the bank account providers and end up dedicating resources to opening bank accounts.  It’s not the first time an industry in Hong Kong has encountered issues with bank account opening.  Kang points to money-service operators who held licenses from the Customs and Excise Department that enabled them to exchange funds. Banks were reluctant to serve them due to perceived anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing risk.  Policies or actions from the regulator may give the banks more confidence such as having deposit requirements, Kang said.  Lee added that it doesn’t help that another Asian financial hub, Singapore, has had trouble with the collapses of crypto companies which did hold licenses, like Three Arrows Capital.  Some local players have stepped into the space, with virtual bank ZA Bank presenting itself as the go-to bank for Web3 businesses.  Following the collapse of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, “inquiries have increased enormously,” ZA co-head of retail banking Devon Sin told CoinDesk.  Most players who CoinDesk spoke to were optimistic about future discussions on banking between the industry and the regulators.

The network saw over 645,000 transactions on Sunday, data from BitInfoCharts shows, briefly crossing both Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions that day before falling back to previous levels as of Wednesday.  Historical data shows Dogecoin typically sees around 20,000 daily transactions However, the introduction of the DRC-20 token standard on May 9 has led to an immediate increase in network activity.  These standards allow developers to issue tokens that take network fees in the form of dogecoin (DOGE). This adds to the value proposition for dogecoin and lays the path for potential decentralized finance (DeFi) services built on the blockchain.  DRC-20 Attracts Criticism  Despite the bump in transactions, not everyone is amused with the DRC-20 token deployment. Critics point out that DRC-20 may lead to network congestion and that it moves away from dogecoin's aim of being used as an everyday currency.  “The DRC-20 Dogecoin community should stop this shameless hype,” wrote one Dogecoin community member on Twitter. “Everyone should probably focus on the transactional currency use case,” said another.  High fees and network congestion are valid concerns for any blockchain as they may lead to the network becoming expensive, and slow, for everyday users – damping adoption plans.

During a recent Reddit ask-me-anything (AMA), representatives for the agency revealed that it not only owns crypto but also has its own NFT collection. Moreover, the agency has praised blockchain technology’s potential to fight financial crime, indicating a growing awareness and adoption of these technologies in law enforcement. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Is The Most Undervalued Asset in Crypto Secret Service Praises Blockchain’s Transparency In Fighting Financial Crime During the AMA session, the San Francisco Field Office of the United States Secret Service and the Bay Area Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) addressed various questions from the public. Although not all the queries were answered, the law enforcement agencies did respond to some of them. Despite the skepticism of many regulators regarding cryptocurrency as a tool commonly exploited by scammers and fraudsters, the REACT task force has recognized the remarkable potential of blockchain technology for combatting financial crime, applauding its inherent transparency. The AMA Reddit thread from the United States Secret Service. Source: Reddit. This endorsement marks a significant turning point, as the task force sees blockchain as an extraordinary opportunity in the ongoing fight against fraudulent activities. By leveraging the public and transparent nature of blockchains, law enforcement can more easily track the flow of money and identify potential financial crimes. They said: “The beauty of the blockchain helps us trace funds, but attributing wallets to individuals is a different story… It’s only anonymous until it’s not.” But even then, the US commander-in-chief’s bodyguards said that in every instance “we have applicable laws and we must follow judicial process when working to identify bad actors.” Secret Service Admits Owning Crypto And NFTs The AMA session not only covered various serious topics but also included some light-hearted moments. During the session, a Reddit user asked if the Secret Service had any plans to create its own meme coin. The agency responded to the question by promoting its own NFT collection available on the OpenSea platform. This exchange shows that the agencies were open to engaging with the public on a lighter note and willing to showcase their interest in blockchain technology by highlighting their NFT collection. An inquisitive Redditor inquired about whether the Secret Service possessed any cryptocurrency. In response, the agency candidly stated that they were indeed holders of crypto, even going as far as describing themselves as “crypto enthusiasts” in subsequent replies. The Secret Service acknowledged that owning cryptocurrency provided them with a deeper understanding of the intricate workings of the crypto world, emphasizing the importance of familiarity with these emerging technologies.

42393542,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biz67J,1684285680,First Mover Asia: Crypto's Rotating Profits,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Amid Bitcoin role debates and halving concerns, bitcoin and ether start flat in East Asia; Cobo's data points to market confidence recovery and Bybit links memecoin surge to reinvestment, warning of mining impacts if Bitcoin doesn't stabilize above $30,000 post-halving.  Insights: Bitcoin's reduced congestion impacted altcoin rallies and BRC-20 tokens' demand led to high fees and boosted miner revenue without new users, possibly changing bitcoin's relationship with ether and its market dynamics.

According to the Asset Under Custody (AUC) data from Cobo, an institutional custodian, the confidence in the cryptocurrency market hit its lowest point in February 2022, followed by a quick recovery from March onwards. Cobo's AUC has already bounced back to the level in November 2022, indicating that funds are returning to the market, the firm shared with CoinDesk in a note.  ""The recent surge in memecoins that occurred alongside a decline in general interest in crypto (as measured by Twitter and YouTube analytics), suggests these capital inflows are likely the result of investors rotating profits made from crypto’s strong performance year-to-date,” said Charmyn Ho, head of crypto insights at Bybit, in a note to CoinDesk.  Ho wrote that there might still be some space for further depreciation and that these ranges represent attractive accumulation zones for long-term HODLers.  Meanwhile, macroeconomics continues to be the defining part of the bitcoin story. But there’s debate around whether bitcoin is a store of value, or a hedge against risk, which won’t be solved any time soon.  Then there’s the halving. Expected sometime in early 2024, this is thought to be the next chapter in the pricing narrative. But Cobo CEO Mao Shixing disagrees.  “From an economic point of view, bitcoin halving currently does not play a significant role, but it is a good narrative logic,” he told CoinDesk in a note.  One thing to look at, he noted, is the impact it might have on miners.  The S19 mining machine remains the mainstream choice for miners. However, he told CoinDesk, if the price of the coin doesn't stabilize above $30,000 following the next halving event scheduled for next year, these mining machines will inevitably have to cease operation.

This easing has taken the wind out of the rally in bitcoin knock-offs, bitcoin cash (BCH), and bitcoin SV (SBV). Both rallied last week as congestion on Bitcoin saw investors pour money into alternatives. Bitcoin continues to uphold its 1 MB block size. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have expanded their block sizes to 32 MB and a whopping 128 MB, respectively. Consequently, these two protocols offer notably lower transaction costs than the Bitcoin protocol.  As the episode is over, we can look back at the final tally of the fees paid out during Bitcoin’s Ordinals rally, as noted by Glassnode, which are enormous.  The surge in demand for block space due to BRC-20 tokens has led to notably high fees, with the average fee per block exceeding the block subsidy for only the fifth time in Bitcoin's history. This has brought total daily fees near an all-time high at $17.8 million per day and resulted in an additional $100M revenue for miners, raising fee-based miner revenue to 11.5%, Glassnode wrote.  Meanwhile, this has resulted in record-breaking transaction counts, achieving a new all-time high of 682,000, representing an increase of 39% from the peak in 2017.  But is this bringing in new users? Not really. Despite the surge in transaction activity, the number of active addresses decreased, indicating a trend of BRC-20 users reusing Bitcoin addresses.  One question on the minds of many is will the introduction of BRC-20-powered tokens and NFTs onto Bitcoin move the relationship between bitcoin and ether into something different.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the 30-day rolling correlation between bitcoin and ether prices has dropped to 77%, the lowest since 2021, indicating a possible long-term decoupling of the two largest cryptocurrencies.  This weakening correlation could boost trading activity in bitcoin-ether pairs on major exchanges, creating new opportunities for traders to capture the relative value between the two without involving the dollar.  Or, for Bitcoin’s narrative, is this just an annoyance or actually a material change?  Important events.

Dark Defender, a cryptocurrency analyst and researcher, has analyzed patterns in XRP’s price movements and predicts that a break above the resistance line could happen anytime between now and August 2023. Related Reading: DeFi’s Rising Star: Why Rook DAO Is The Best-Performing Token Of 2023 Poised For Explosive Growth? Once XRP breaks through the resistance line, Dark Defender predicts the price will hit $1.33 and then $3.82. These projections are based on technical analysis and historical patterns. Moreover, XRP is facing two significant resistances in the short term before it can hope to reach the $0.500 mark and rally further to its annual high of $0.5838, reached in March 2023. These resistances are represented by the yellow line, which denotes the 200-day Moving Average (MA), and the brown line, which represents the 50-day MA, as shown in the chart below. Furthermore, despite XRP’s current downtrend, crypto analyst Dark Defender has noted that the token has shown resilience by bouncing back from its primary support level of $0.42. This rebound can be attributed, in part, to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reaching an oversold zone in the daily indicator, suggesting that XRP may have been oversold and due for a rebound. In the short term, Dark Defender has identified a crucial resistance level for XRP at $0.4696. This level will need to be overcome by XRP’s bulls if the token is to continue its potential bullish momentum and push above the $0.500 line. XRP Ledger Sees Explosive Growth In NFTs And Tokenization It has been approximately six months since the introduction of XLS-20 to the XRP Ledger. XLS-20 includes extensions to the XRP Ledger that support a native NFT type and operations to enumerate, transfer and hold such tokens, providing native NFT functionality to the platform. Since the amendment was proposed, voted on, and approved by the validator community, the XRP Ledger’s developer and creator ecosystem has flourished. This has resulted in new projects, use cases, and collections on the XRPL, showcasing the platform’s potential for NFTs. Since the mainnet launch of XLS-20, over 1.3 million NFTs have been minted, with over 740,000 offers to buy NFTs accepted. This has made the XRP Ledger among the top 10 blockchains for NFT sales volume and transactions. The top three natively built marketplaces by XRP volume are OnXRP, Sologenic, and xrp.cafe, which account for over 80% of total NFT transactions on the Ledger. In addition, over 5,000 total issuers and hundreds of NFT collections spanning various use cases, from events and ticketing to music and IP access rights, to the metaverse and loyalty rewards, to real estate and beyond. The top three NFT collections by lifetime sales volume, including IOUs, are XPUNKS, Bored Apes XRP, and The Bearable Bulls. Alongside NFT projects, infrastructure apps and tools are being developed on the XRPL to provide additional resources and support to the developer community. This includes tokenization infrastructure and tooling, which can help facilitate the creation and management of tokens on the XRP Ledger.

David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple, has stated that the growth of NFTs on the XRP Ledger is a testament to the platform’s versatility and potential for innovation. He believes that the XRPL is uniquely positioned to support the development of new use cases and applications for blockchain technology and that the growth of the NFT ecosystem on the platform is just the beginning.

12700882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533360,1684281658,"Cardano Price Rejected at $0.36, How Long Will The Correction Last?","The price of Cardano has been following a bearish trajectory for the past couple of weeks. However, in recent trading sessions, there were bullish attempts as buyers tried to push the price higher. Unfortunately, selling pressure emerged again, causing Cardano to trade near its crucial support level. The technical outlook for ADA is bearish. The chart’s demand and accumulation indicators have been depreciating, suggesting a lack of buying interest in the market. Moreover, the broader market strength remains uncertain, with Bitcoin recently dipping below the $27,000 price zone in the recent past. This has resulted in many major altcoins, including Cardano, facing rejection at their immediate resistance levels. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Is The Most Undervalued Asset in Crypto Currently, Cardano finds itself at a critical price point. If it manages to move above the overhead resistance, it could initiate a recovery for the coin. However, if the price falls from its current level, it would struggle to sustain itself above the crucial support, potentially leading to bearish dominance. If Bitcoin trades above the $27,000 mark, it might positively impact Cardano’s price and potentially lead to a recovery. However, for a significant price turnaround, it is essential for buying confidence to resurface in the market. The decline in Cardano’s market capitalization indicates that sellers have dominated the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Cardano (ADA) was priced at $0.367. Over the past 24 hours, ADA experienced a 1.3% decline in price, while there hasn’t been any significant movement on the weekly chart. The key resistance level for ADA is at $0.37, which has proven to be a strong barrier that the bulls have failed to break through in recent weeks. If ADA surpasses the $0.37 resistance, it can reach $0.39, resulting in a significant price increase. However, if the price falls from its current level, it could drop below the crucial support line of $0.35, which the bulls have been defending thus far. The trading volume of ADA in the last session was in red, indicating a decrease in the number of buyers participating in the market. Technical Analysis Throughout the month, ADA has displayed weak buying strength. This is evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) staying below the 40-mark, indicating a prevalence of selling strength rather than buying strength. However, if ADA surpasses its immediate price ceiling, it could lead to a recovery in buying strength. Moreover, ADA has also fallen below its 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, further confirming that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. Contrary to previous observations, ADA showed buy signals on the one-day chart. The Awesome Oscillator, which indicates momentum and trend reversal, displayed green histograms associated with buy signals. This suggests a potential price appreciation in the upcoming trading sessions.
