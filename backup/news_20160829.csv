42427057,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylhh,1472506259,"IBM Bridges Blockchain, AI With New Business Unit","IBM is reorganizing its internal blockchain team into a business unit that encompasses its artificial intelligence and cloud computing efforts.  Called 'Industry Platforms', the division will be led by Bridget van Kralingen, IBM’s former senior vice president of Global Business Services. Further, as part of the launch, IBM's entire blockchain leadership will make the transition to the unit, first announced last September.  In addition to the work on blockchain tech, the business unit will lead IBM's efforts to bridge its financial services work with its Watson artificial intelligence initiative.  IBM CEO and chairman Ginni Rometty said of the move:  ""The Industry Platforms business will bring clients radically optimized processes and marketplaces that leverage Watson, IBM Cloud, IBM Systems, blockchain, deep domain expertise and ecosystems of partners and developers.""  ""This is an important move by IBM as we increasingly focus on blockchain,"" the firm further stated.  The unit will house IBM’s global industry managing directors for banking and insurance, its client managing directors and other financial services industry solutions.  IBM's Global Business Services, in turn, will now be led by Accenture senior executive Mark Foster.  Building on blockchain efforts  Based in IBM's Armonk, New York headquarters, Industry Platforms will have company-wide responsibility for blockchain research and development, in addition to helping foster open technology standards with the stated goal of accelerating market adoption.  The new unit represents the next phase in IBM's blockchain push, building on past efforts that have seen the firm develop a range of prototypes and play a leading role in the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger Project.  In early 2015, IBM unveiled one of its earliest blockchain projects, a proof-of-concept that integrated BitTorrent, Ethereum and TeleHash. Since then the company has been working to leverage Watson artificial intelligence with distributed ledger technology.  This past June, IBM opened the Watson Centre in Marina Bay Singapore, dedicated to developing artificial intelligence, with a focus on blockchain applications.  Update: A previous version of this article stated that IBM's Global Business Services is part of IBM's Industry Platforms.

42427051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylXh,1472494158,Mizuho Bank Dealt Blow in Mt Gox Lawsuit Update,"A US judge largely denied a bid last week by Mizuho Bank to dismiss charges filed against it in a class action lawsuit tied to the collapse of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  In a court order dated 26th August, US District Judge Gary Feinerman ruled Mizhuo should face charges related to unjust enrichment and fraudulent concealment in connection with the exchange's failure. Despite claims by the bank it had no formal business relationship with Mt Gox, Feinerman found the parties had a ""transactional relationship"".  The order is the latest to speak to the complex dealings between Mt Gox and Mizuho, including allegations that the bank continued to accept deposits from Mt Gox customers, even as it limited withdrawals, thereby putting additional operational pressure on the troubled startup.  Feinerman wrote:  ""Mizuho stopped processing withdrawals but continued accepting wire transfer deposits (and reaping the associated fees) from Mt Gox users. It did so in an environment in which press reports discussed delays of, but not absolute bars to, withdrawals of fiat currency from Mt Gox's accounts.""  While a number of charges will move forward, the bank did succeed in getting a charge for tortious interference dismissed.  Feinerman, however, indicated Mizuho is likely to move to have more charges dropped. The judge noted Mizuho ""intends to raise foreign law at a later stage in the litigation"", meaning that the bank may seek to invoke Japanese regulations.  The case is one of several legal efforts to emerge in the wake of the Mt Gox collapse, which fell apart after months of growing withdrawal problems and criticisms about its long-term viability.  CEO Mark Karpeles was later arrested by authorities in Japan and charged with embezzlement. He was released from custody last month.

42427052,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylZh,1472489660,Blockchain Executives Sign Pledge to Address Governance Issues,"Executives representing the top-level leadership at a range of blockchain companies and projects have signed a letter calling for a new focus on perceived issues with blockchain governance.  Calling themselves the 'Muskoka Group', the 14 executives include leaders building a diverse set of open-source distributed ledgers, as well as the heads of notable for-profit startups.  The letter, published today, follows a two-day governance workshop held by authors Don and Alex Tapscott in Muskoka, Canada, one that the organizers said he found participants focusing on the ""big picture"" surrounding the technology.  Don Tapscott told CoinDesk:  ""There was a strong sense that we need a rising tide to lift all boats.""  Concrete steps attendees will seek to take include exploring how to fund a ""Blockchain Hub"" using the Global Solutions Network (GSN) program and whether to create a ""network of networks to help coalesce the community"".  Signatories of the letter included Brian Behlendorf, managing director of the Hyperledger Project; Perianne Boring, founder of Chamber of Digital Commerce; Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys Systems; Matthew Roszak, founder of Bloq; Pindar Wong, chairman of VeriFi; and Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation.  Action resolved  As part of this effort, the group wants to develop a ""roadmap and action plan"" to help signatories better collaborate with ""leaders at the municipal, state, federal and supranational level"" to develop blockchain strategies.  To help spur that collaboration along, the group also proposed launching a ""syndicated research program"" to study how blockchain tech might impact industry, government and society.  ""The world needs horizontal research investigating areas such as supply chains, asset tracking, marketing and management. We need vertical research into industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare, retail, manufacturing and government,"" the letter read.  Toward that end, Tapscott spoke out about how governance issues are harming perception of the technology more broadly and holding back wider adoption.  Tapscott concluded:  ""'It’s clear that decentralization and self organization should not be confused with disorganization. We need better collaboration and coordination in this ecosystem.""  The actions follow the notable struggles of the ethereum community following a recent technical change, and amid an ongoing debate in the bitcoin community of how best to increase the network's transaction capacity.

42427045,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylLh,1472480039,Bitcoin Tipping Platform Zapchain to Shut Down,"Another bitcoin-based content monetization startup has announced it will shut down.  Social network Zapchain, launched in 2014 as part of accelerator Boost VC's fourth batch of startups, has told users that it will cease services effective 31st August. The announcement comes less than a year after the startup raised $350,000 in seed funding.  The decision, made public on the company's website, marks the end of a project that was once one of bitcoin’s fastest-growing projects, and comes amid a decline in the number of consumer-facing startups seeking to launch services on the bitcoin network.  Bitcoin tipping platform ChangeTip, for example, announced it had sold its staff to Airbnb in April, and that it was searching for a buyer of its intellectual property. No details have yet been provided on whether Zapchain will seek similar sales.  Despite these challenges, however, the concept that blockchains could come to serve a vital part of content monetization lives on, most recently with the controversial success of social media platform Steemit, though it uses an alternative to the bitcoin blockchain.  Representatives from Zapchain could not be reached at press time.

42427048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylPh,1472474427,Singapore Central Bank Proposes New Rules for Bitcoin Startups,"The central bank of Singapore has proposed a new regulatory framework for payments providers in the city-state, a move that would bring digital currency exchanges under its oversight.  The proposed framework would require applicable companies to obtain a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and divides payment activities into several categories. Digital currency exchanges would be covered by a provision overseeing startups that provide ""money transmissions and conversion services"".  The MAS said:  ""The scope of currency conversion activities is intended to encompass the business of exchanging of currencies at a rate of exchange. In addition, it is likely that under the [Proposed Payments Framework], virtual currency intermediaries which buy, sell, or facilitate the exchange of virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, will also be considered to undertake [money transmissions and conversion services].""  The institution outlined the need for a ""flexible"" regulatory framework for payments, one that reflects the changing face of finance amidst a period of technology upheaval.  That any exchange services within Singapore might be brought under the oversight of the MAS isn’t a foregone conclusion, however. A comment period for the proposal runs through 31st October, and as part of the comment period, the agency is seeking feedback on whether the move should be undertaken.  Bitcoin exchanges operating in the country, like CoinHako, Coinbase and Quoine would likely be impacted should the framework come into effect.  Council creation  The MAS also proposed creating a ""National Payments Council"" that would steer policy and coordinate with industry stakeholders. Its membership, the institution said, would be drawn from both the public and private sectors in Singapore.  The proposal comes just over a year after the MAS announced that it had begun allocating funding to explore applications of the technology.  Last July, the institution announced that it was providing funds for a blockchain-based recordkeeping trial as part of a broader $225m package devoted to financial technology experimentation.  ""The potential benefits of such a distributed ledger system include: faster and more efficient processing; lower cost of operation; and greater resilience against system failure,” managing director Ravi Menon said at the time.

42427060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylph,1472470228,Could the Blockchain End Bureaucracy?,"Alexander Hitchcock is a researcher at Reform, a UK-based think tank where he has authored reports on healthcare, welfare and public procurement.  In this opinion piece, Hitchcock discusses how blockchain technology could be used to fight bureaucracy by enabling governments to make strategic cuts in their workforces.  Bureaucracy, Ludwig von Mises explained in 1944, is ""always applied with an opprobrious connotation"", and such connotations – that it is time-consuming, frustrating and costly – have stood the test of time.  If you wanted to ask a question about a self-assessment tax return in October, you'd have been waiting 47 minutes to do it. In 2014-15, the public-sector wage bill was £150bn.  New thinking can change this, however.  Blockchain – a distributed public ledger capable of recording transactions securely (explained here) – is a key means. Businesses are proselytizing the technology as able to remove back-office functions that eat into profit margins. Banks believe they can cut $20bn from running costs. Government must likewise see it as a way to dramatically improve efficiency.  The UK Government has been making positive noises this year. In January, the Government's chief scientific adviser published 'Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond Blockchain', setting out a number of possible applications of the software concept.  In April, Cabinet Office Minister Matthew Hancock, explained that blockchain is being explored as a way to streamline the distribution of government grants and track aid spending to ensure it is spent correctly. The last Government wanted ""blockchain brainstorming"" to explore further options.  One overlooked application is in replacing administrative work in the civil service. This alone accounted for 170,000 staff at a cost of £3.25bn in 2014-15 (see graph).  Blockchain can replace some of these functions by recording transactions.  Governments across the globe have begun experimenting with using the software to record property ownership. This is administratively light as it is automatically documented by the blockchain and it skips the current need for people to use central registers to access information.  The Government could use this approach to more efficiently spend Land Registry's £13m annual staffing bill. Sweden believes this can be done while cutting the time it takes to complete real estate deals.  The real win, however, comes from streamlining the running of the biggest departments, which are most heavily weighted toward administration.  This can be done through the use of 'smart contracts' on blockchain.  These contracts automatically carry out certain functions if pre-defined conditions have been met. Businesses could, for example, set-up real-time tax payments when they receive income – and automatically receive rebates where appropriate. Similarly individuals could set up automatic self-assessment returns, skipping the need to interact with HMRC officials.  Elsewhere, the Department for Work and Pensions could automatically pay and update social security in reaction to working status – a clear compliment to Universal Credit, which pays benefits dynamically, based, in part, on working hours.  Moving responsibility for paying taxes and distributing benefits onto the blockchain can allow these departments to reduce human administration. HMRC has an aim to become ""diamond-shaped"", which entails the cutting of over 14,000 jobs, assuming numbers of staff at other levels remain constant. This alone would reduce staff costs by £275m.  In 2015, DWP officials mooted reducing employee numbers by 30,000 – or 36%. Replacing 36% of officials would save £290m in staff costs – although in all likelihood the axe would fall more heavily on administrative jobs because of their potential automation.  These are ambitious aims. The history of labour-force change in the private sector reveals that for every lower-skilled job that is automated, as many as four are created.  Today’s frugal public sector may stop such expansion.  But to understand blockchain's effects, government should follow the advice of its chief scientific adviser in distributed ledger technology and begin piloting its use. Only then might bureaucracy finally be consigned to the scrapheap of history.  This article originally appeared on Reform's website and has been republished here with the author's permission.
