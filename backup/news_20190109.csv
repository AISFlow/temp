42402416,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg1v,1547073316,Venezuela Calls US Sanctions Against Its Petro Cryptocurrency 'Discriminatory',"Venezuela is pushing back against U.S. sanctions before the World Trade Organization, including ones imposed against its controversial cryptocurrency efforts.  The complaint, filed late last month and published this week, addresses a number of actions taken by the U.S. in recent years, claims that the country is infringing on Venezuela's rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) signed in 1994 and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Notably, the complaint notes certain restrictions placed upon ""Venezuelan digital currency"" transactions.  ""The United States has imposed certain coercive trade-restrictive measures on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the context of attempts to isolate Venezuela economically,"" the complaint reads.  Venezuela first announced it was developing a cryptocurrency, the petro, near the end of 2017. The currency was launched in 2018 and has since been ordered into use within several different industries by the nation's strongman president, Nicolas Maduro.  However, the controversial token has seen pushback as well, in particular from U.S. lawmakers, who have denounced the cryptocurrency, and more strongly by President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order targeting the petro last March.  Venezuela's complaint claims that these sanctions are ""discriminatory coercive trade-restrictive measures.""  In particular, the complaint explains, the measures mean Venezuelan financial services and financial service suppliers receive ""less favorable"" treatment than services and suppliers in other WTO member nations.  For that reason, such measures are in violation of Article II:1 of the GATS, which states that no member nation will treat another member less favorably than any other nation, according to Venezuela.  The complaint goes on to say:  ""Furthermore, inasmuch as digital currencies originating in the United States are not subject to the same prohibitions as Venezuelan digital currencies, the United States is according less favorable treatment to Venezuelan financial services and service suppliers than to like domestic financial services and service suppliers, in violation of Article XVII:1 of the GATS.""  Article XVII:1  says member nations will not treat financial services and service suppliers of other nations less favorably than they treat such providers in their own nations.  According to Reuters  , the U.S. has 60 days to respond to Venezuela's complaint. Should the nation fail to do so, Venezuela can then ask the WTO to decide on the complaint's merits.

42402410,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCfw1,1547067633,Former NASDAQ Exec Joins Blockchain Startup Concordium,"Hans-Ole Jochumsen, who retired the last fall as vice chairman of NASDAQ Europe, has joined the advisory board of Concordium Foundation, the Swiss non-profit developing a cryptocurrency with a built-in compliance function.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Jochumsen will guide Concordium's compliance efforts, providing expertise in taxation, know-your-customer (KYC) practices, and transaction provenance.  The stock market vet told CoinDesk he was already interested in the blockchain technology while working at NASDAQ and was involved in ""multiple activities and projects"" related to the tech, for example, blockchain-based electronic voting for the shareholders of NASDAQ's Estonian branch. He explained that he sees promise in blockchain technology to radically reduce the cost and time of global transactions for the industry he's worked in for decades.  ""Many people forget that what we see with the financial institutions is that you have a very complicated setup, every county has its own approach, and if you need to do something globally, it's extremely complicated, and even if in the end the task is solved, somebody has to pay for it, and it's the customer,"" Jochumsen told CoinDesk. ""In Concordium, there is a great vision for something that financial industry worldwide needs.""  Concordium, founded by former Saxo Bank CEO and founder Lars Seier Christensen, is working on a proof-of-stake blockchain and is planning to launch its testnet ""within the next month,"" Christensen told CoinDesk.  The project aims to combine a built-in anti-money-laundering (AML) and KYC function with zero-knowledge cryptography and compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The beta launch of the mainnet is scheduled for the third quarter of 2019, and Concordium is expected to go live in 2020, Christensen said.  Despite entering the market late in the game, Concordium's new cryptocurrency (GTU, or global transactions unit) can still gain traction for its identity-checking feature, Christensen told CoinDesk.  “As a first mover with strong focus and expertise in this area (ID/KYC), we are not late, but really among the first to the real game, one that has not started yet, because early generations of blockchains and cryptocurrencies did not achieve real business use in spite of all the hype,"" he said, adding:  ""So the next era is beginning now and this will be the time when the real potential of public blockchains will finally begin to unfold.""  Concordium's research team includes cryptography specialists from Aarhus University in Denmark and just added as cryptography lead Professor Ivan Damgård, a co-inventor of the Merkle–Damgård construction underpinning the principles of hashing algorithms.  From finance to fintech  Jochumsen spent nine years at NASDAQ, including almost three years as a president and a year as a vice chairman for Europe, responsible for the exchange's European expansion.  Before NASDAQ, he worked as president and CEO of Copenhagen Stock Exchange, leading it when it merged with its counterpart in Stockholm. He also served as president of the Scandinavian exchange OMX before it was acquired by NASDAQ in 2008.  In October 2017 the NASDAQ announced that Jochumsen would retire that year, upon turning 60. NASDAQ's CEO Adena Friedman called him ""a true mentor, partner and friend"" in the exchange's internal memo.  At the same time, Jochumsen told Reuters he was talking to a New York-based fintech firm about an advisory role.  Indeed, soon he started advising Alkymi, a startup aiming to automate the documentation flow of financial services firms.  Now Jochumsen works as chairman of Nordax Bank AB, a non-executive director of Nykredit A/S and senior advisor at Alkymi.

At press time, the BTC long positions placed on the exchange total 33,750 units, worth $137.3 million at current market prices, whereas the number of short positions is roughly 11,000 units less at just 22,787 - now worth just under $93 million.  This creates the long-to-short ratio of nearly 1.5:1 – its highest since August 6th of last year.  Bitcoin longs and shorts (Bitfinex)  The drop in short positions is not exactly surprising, considering the price of bitcoin fell roughly 50 percent between Nov. 14 and Dec. 14, giving traders ample time to lock in profits while awaiting further opportunities.  A bullish technical reversal pattern known as the “inverse head and shoulders” pattern is also evident on the bitcoin’s price chart, which may be playing another factor in scaring bears out of the market for now.  Although the long/short ratio being at multi-month highs may seem encouraging for bitcoin bulls, the market will likely witness another sharp decline if key support near $3,200 is breached, as it would signal the latest corrective bounce to nearly $4,400 has ended.  This would put the market at risk of experiencing a “long squeeze” or rapid closure of long positions, which could have a rapid and bearish effect on the price of bitcoin since the only way to terminate a long position is to sell back the longed BTC.

The company also corroborated information released by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

SlowMist further said that it is still seeking to find out where exactly the identified addresses are located, which the firm said can be deduced ""if the relevant exchanges are willing to assist.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, SlowMist identified Gate.io, Bitrue and Binance as the exchanges they’re looking to work with in order to locate the attacker.

Lubin announced that “ConsenSys 2.0” would seek efficiencies – and a broader reliance on outside partners and investors. “Spinning out” these ventures has gone from an aspiration to a mandate.  “We have been interacting much more with external investors, mostly VCs, over the last nine or 12 months,” Lubin told CoinDesk during an interview in early December. “We’re gonna be ramping that up significantly.”  But even if ether prices recover and ethereum-based tokens come back into vogue across the broader marketplace, former employees and prospective investors tell CoinDesk they worry the road ahead for these projects may be rocky.  Simply put, because of the unusual way ConsenSys structured its investments, it will be hard persuading outsiders to put money into them.  According to six sources familiar with the company’s strategy, ConsenSys often held at least half, if not more, of the equity for each of its ""spokes,"" and Lubin resisted early efforts to seek external investors.  ConsenSys declined to comment on how much equity the company owns in various projects across the conglomerate, but said that ""people who contribute significant value"" to spokes are able to ""develop significant equity"" or ""participate in profit sharing.""  One former spoke advisor told CoinDesk that ConsenSys previously ""felt uncomfortable owning less than 50 percent of the spoke."" He added Lubin’s insistence on control, in turn, discouraged other investors from funding these projects, even during the 2017 bull market.  ""A ton of funds and individuals were uncomfortable having Joe on the cap table at all, let alone [with a] controlling stake,"" the advisor said. ""We heard from the occasional group that they would’ve been interested had ConsenSys not been involved.""  Re-slicing the pie  Indeed, one anonymous investor – who is currently in talks with several ConsenSys spokes about potential equity deals – told CoinDesk that these projects will face considerable challenges attracting external investment.  According to this investor, it’s not clear how much equity ConsenSys owns in many of the spokes that the company is trying to “spin out.” In some cases, the startup founders themselves may not know with certainty.  ""You're effectively investing in Joe Lubin’s company and it’s unclear what his relationship, and what ConsenSys’ relationship, is to that company,"" the investor said. ""You want to invest in a company where the owners and founders are building it, because they are the most motivated.""  Even at the spokes where ConsenSys is not a major stakeholder, there is still a lack of clarity and uniformity surrounding ownership complicating negotiations as well, the prospective investor said.  The spokes will need to overcome these hurdles to raise capital quickly in order to stay afloat. The prospective investor said:  ""My expectation is that very few of these projects will be able to [raise].""  ConsenSys disagreed in a statement, offering the ConsenSys-incubated company Trustology as an example since it raised capital from Two Sigma Ventures in December. However, given the range of company structures involved with ConsenSys, an incubated company may not face the same challenges as ones that seek to ""spin out.""  The company appears to be ramping up traditional accelerator programs run by its ConsenSys Ventures arm instead of seeking new projects to fund and then spin out as businesses.  To be clear, “spinning out” is different than layoffs, and Lubin’s team says all spokes have the option to spin out. Still, company representatives tell CoinDesk, ""there will be a number of core projects that will remain internally incubated.""  Yet one current ConsenSys employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk that no one at the company feels secure in their job these days.  He personally expects ConsenSys will be reduced to 200 fintech-focused technologists and consultants – roughly one-sixth of its current size.  An expected 13 percent reduction in staff was announced last month. But it’s difficult to say how many layoffs are yet to come, in the traditional sense, because even beyond “spinning out” many former employees said they worked with short-term or informal contracts.  In a statement emailed to CoinDesk, ConsenSys said that all spokes are being prepped to engage with external investors while ConsenSys itself looks to make ""active seed stage investments"" in new projects.  The survivors  Meanwhile, Kevin Owocki, co-founder of the ConsenSys spoke GitCoin, told CoinDesk he hopes people will pay more attention to the work ConsenSys spokes are still doing, regardless of staff reductions.  “Clearly it’s a time of contraction right now, but I hope that we can focus on the positive points,” Owocki told CoinDesk. “I’m still very happy with ConsenSys as a backer and I think they’re doing good things for the ecosystem.”  Despite the “crypto winter” impacting the broader ethereum community, Owocki’s 11-person team is still focused on shipping a diverse range of products.  “We didn’t do a token sale. We’ve focused on product traction,” he said. Speaking to the broader ethereum ecosystem, including ConsenSys spokes, he added:  “The Ethereum Foundation grants have, up until now, done a great job of giving one-time cash infusions. … What’s really needed is reoccuring, stable funding so that people can focus on their roundmaps. And that’s what we’re looking to provide.”  Among its products and services, GitCoin arranges various processes for using cryptocurrency to fund contributions to open source projects. So far, the startup is earning up to $9,000 a month from a tokenized grant product and an advertising system called CodeFund.  With regards to grants, GitCoin has helped distribute more than $738,221 worth of crypto bounties related to hundreds of open source projects. Users include the Ethereum Foundation and other ConsenSys spokes, like the in-browser crypto wallet MetaMask.  Owocki said that the overall platform handles close to $90,000 worth of crypto each month. One of GitCoin’s clients, the stablecoin startup MakerDAO, recently contributed almost 1,000 DAI tokens a month (worth $1,000) to a GitCoin grant for open source contributions to a commissioned project Owocki’s team is also working on, a specialized crypto wallet.  “We’re all working on Ethereum 2.0 as an ecosystem and people need sustainable ways to fund their work,” Owocki said of this grant system, adding he also has high hopes for a subscriptions model that monetizes some GitCoin services.  “I would love to be one of the first staffs that gets to profitability with a subscription model in Web3,” he said, referring to the goal of a decentralized internet.  Owocki admitted these early sources of revenue are not enough to cover his team’s salaries, but said he is not concerned because the team could seek additional venture capital in 2019 if needed. Furthermore, ConsenSys added a statement saying:  ""While 2018 did represent a contraction in the ecosystem as it overextended itself in 2017, we expect 2019 to be a year of exceptional growth.""  Decentralized?  Despite the media narrative that some ConsenSys employees weren’t diligently seeking results, former employees said a lack of clarity about decision-making power beyond Lubin was a greater hindrance than any lack of motivation.  One former ConsenSys employee, who tallied income and asked to stay anonymous, told CoinDesk that revenues from some decimated and rearranged spokes “were positive and growing nicely.”  Reassignments started in September, former employees said, and some teams were assured they had plenty of runway just weeks before the layoffs abruptly began. Another former employee, who also asked to stay anonymous, told CoinDesk he was discouraged from critiquing technical solutions because spokes were desperate for clients.  ""You can't turn to the [spoke] CEO because they have no power,” the former employee said, referring to ConsenSys’ “extremely high” percentage of equity. ""Joe created the company in such a way that no one is able to make decisions without him. No one had the budget.”  While some projects operated with more independence than others, some participants expressed concerns that part of Lubin’s aim for ConsenSys was to boost the value of the ethereum network, which he invested in considerably and is widely believed to own a significant portion of ETH.  A 2018 report by the hedge fund Tetras Capital estimated the ConsenSys INFURA project with centralized servers cost Lubin more than $10 million a year to subsidize infrastructure for many of the ethereum applications that attracted new investors to the ecosystem, even though ethereum's distributed network wasn't ready to support high transaction volumes.  Indeed, ConsenSys reps say the company's early focus was on priming the pump for future advancements:  ""ConsenSys 1.0 was about fostering an appetite for a decentralized approach to the IT infrastructure that supports a wide variety of society's systems.""  Yet that may have gone hand-in-hand with other motives. Speaking to how Lubin’s personal net worth and businesses both benefited from soaring ether prices, the former spoke advisor said:  “The core business model seemed to be: do things to better the ethereum network then capture value when the price of ETH appreciates.”  Although it has been a long time since ConsenSys partners and employees were compensated in cryptocurrency, the question for many remains where ConsenSys spokes will go from here, one year into the bear market. Lubin's team said they are proud of the company's ""continued commitment to collaborating with others in the space on open, shared infrastructure.""  Perhaps that's why the former employee who worked with income statistics told CoinDesk he remains optimistic, adding:  “ConsenSys is an experiment. We’ll see what’s really left from spokes in a couple of months.”  ConsenSys image via CoinDesk archives.

42402419,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg4s,1547046018,US Department of Energy to Fund Blockchain Research Projects,"The U.S. Department of Energy has announced federal funding of up to $4.8 million for universities working on R&D projects, including those related to blockchain.  Announced  Monday, the funding is being made available through the department's Office of Fossil Energy as a part of the ""University Training and Research"" initiative aimed to develop fossil energy applications.  Projects under the initiative are aimed at achieving various objectives, including the development of early-stage technologies for more affordable domestic energy resources and improved electric grids, the department said.  One of the areas being targeted for funding is blockchain technology that would “secure process signal data and other information flows within distributed sensor networks for fossil-based power generation systems.”  Other potential projects not necessarily including blockchain include those that would explore advanced computing resources for coal plants to generate analytical results, improve water reuse processes, and investigate physical and biological sciences to measure chemical elements within coal fly ash.  The department said it funds research and development projects to reduce the ""risk and cost"" of advanced fossil fuel-based energy technologies and make more sustainable use of fossil resources in the U.S.  This is not the first time that the department has looked to explore blockchain for technological improvements. Last January, it partnered with BlockCypher to develop solutions allowing energy transactions to be settled across multiple blockchains.  And, in July 2018, the department awarded a grant of nearly $1 million to a Colorado-based blockchain startup Grid7 in a move aimed to advance the development of a decentralized energy grid.

42402420,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCg5r,1547042404,New Bitrefill Service Aims to Make Lightning Payments Easy,"Stockholm-based startup Bitrefill now offers a way to mitigate bitcoin’s expensive learning curve for new users.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitrefill’s new Thor service allows people to give lightning channels to someone else with no setup on the recipient's side. Lightning was created to allow cheaper, off-chain bitcoin payments.  Bitrefill’s John Carvalho told CoinDesk:  “Thor allows people to connect to the lightning network whether they have bitcoin or not. All you have to do is download one of the supported wallet apps, install it, and then either you or a friend can come to Bitrefill and purchase a channel opening.”  Typically, this is how lightning works: Someone has to set up a channel between two parties and deposit enough bitcoin to hold it open. Users can only send as much money as the channel’s capacity supports.  What Thor allows users to do is outsource the technical work for opening a channel, which can be paid for with bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, dash or dogecoin. Bitrefill will then maintain active channels for 30 days.  “The idea here is to be able to allow everyone to get on the lightning network and running a hot wallet,” Carvalho said. “There’s still a lot of lightning development left to go and a lot of convenience that is needed so it’s not so intimidating to get onto lightning.”  After more than a year of experimenting with lightning payments, this 12-person startup has allowed people to pay phone and cable bills and use the network for a variety of other transactions, totaling 3,760 completed orders. The first week of 2019 alone saw 105 new orders, the company says. According to 1ML.com, Bitrefill is one of the top five organizations increasing global lightning channel capacity, which now hovers above $2 million across the network.  Carvalho said overall lightning usage is growing steadily, adding:  “As far as giving bitcoin enthusiasts a way to onboard other people and teach them about lightning, I think [Thor] will be a good tool.”  Thor works with several free wallet apps such as the LND wallet. Users scan the QR code on the Thor page provided while paying for the service, then copy and paste script – all without needing to deal with the raw command line themselves.  Anton Kumaigorodskiy, a developer for the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet that also integrated directly with Thor, told CoinDesk this service could help boost lightning usage. He said at least 3,204 users have installed the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet app on their phones so far.  New possibilities  “Opening an incoming payment channel is something which was not possible for mobile [lightning network] users before,” Kumaigorodskiy said. “But now anyone can install a fresh wallet, order an incoming channel and start receiving lightning payments right away.”  All things considered, lightning usage is poised to continue growing in 2019.  This bitcoin scaling solution burst onto the scene with user-ready beta software less than one year ago. And yet already a comparison of 1ML.com statistics to Ethernodes.org, which tallies nodes for the second largest cryptocurrency network, reveals there are roughly half as many lightning nodes as there are unique ethereum nodes, more than 5,215.  However, when it comes to lightning-enabled payments competing with traditional fiat methods, Kumaigorodskiy said he is “a bit skeptical.” For now, Kumaigorodskiy said he still thinks professional traders have the most to benefit from using this nascent technology.  It will take quite a bit of experimentation before lightning services are ready for a high volume of low-value payments from mainstream users. Speaking of his own hopes for lightning growth in 2019, Carvalho added:  “The more these services are working, live and tested, the more this will become a majorly used network that people can transact on.”  Team meeting image via Bitrefill",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | ETH | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/09/new-bitrefill-service-aims-to-make-lightning-payments-easy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd5b63c757411c038ac4cd782692de0608a57b17-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rml5,1547035240,European Finance Regulators Call for Bloc-Wide Crypto Rules,"Two major European regulators have separately called for cryptocurrency and ICO rules at the EU level.  Firstly, the European Banking Authority (EBA), a regulatory agency of the EU, has urged the European Commission to examine whether unified crypto rules are needed across the region.  In a report published Tuesday, the EBA said that crypto asset-related activities do not currently fall under existing EU financial laws and, as these activities are “highly risky,” appropriate rules need to be put in place to protect investors.  The EBA has, therefore, asked the commission to carry out a “comprehensive"" analysis to determine what action may be required at the EU level.  Adam Farkas, the EBA's executive director, said in a statement:  “The EBA's warnings to consumers and institutions on virtual currencies remain valid. The EBA calls on the European Commission to assess whether regulatory action is needed to achieve a common EU approach to crypto-assets. The EBA continues to monitor market developments from a prudential and consumer perspective.""  The EBA also advised the commission to take into account recommendations to be issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money-laundering watchdog, in June of this year.  The FATF is expected to issue guidance for international cryptocurrency regulation covering crypto exchanges, digital wallet providers and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Meanwhile, throughout 2019, the EBA said it will take a number of steps to monitor the crypto sector, such as developing a common monitoring template for crypto activities, assessing business practices regarding advertisements in the industry, determining the treatment of banks’ holdings or exposures to crypto assets, and more.  A second regulatory agency in the economic bloc, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), also published a report on crypto assets and ICOs today. It advises the EU's Commission, Council and Parliament on the existing rules that could be applied to crypto assets and further sets out any regulatory gaps to consider for policymakers.  Notably, it says that some crypto assets could fall under the EU's MiFID financial framework and be classed as financial instruments, although some adjustments may be required.  Steven Maijoor, ESMA chair, said:  “Our survey of NCAs highlighted that some crypto-assets may qualify as MiFID financial instruments, in which case the full set of EU financial rules would apply. However, because the existing rules were not designed with these instruments in mind, NCAs face challenges in interpreting the existing requirements and certain requirements are not adapted to the specific characteristics of crypto-assets.  Another category of cryptos would not fall under MiFID, but should still have to comply with anti-money laundering rules. Additionally, risk disclosure should also be enforced, to alert consumers to potential risks when investing in crypto assets, it said.  “In order to have a level playing field and to ensure adequate investor protection across the EU, we consider that the gaps and issues identified would best be addressed at the European level,” Maijoor concluded.

42381468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rn6T,1547031668,Bitcoin Price Faces Minor Pullback as Indecision Creeps into Market,"With the bitcoin (BTC) market showing signs of indecision, prices could soon retreat back below $4,000.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessed two-way business yesterday before ending largely unchanged on the day (as per UTC) at $3,995 on Bitstamp.  Worryingly for the bulls, BTC created a doji candle on Tuesday – widely considered a sign of indecision in the market – even though a bull flag breakout, witnessed yesterday, had seemingly set the stage for a move above $4,300.  Notably, the candlestick pattern appeared at the top of the recent recovery rally and near crucial resistance above $4,100, representing bullish exhaustion.  The bears, therefore, have an opportunity to make a slight comeback, especially if buyers fail to keep prices above the previous day’s low of $3,934.  As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,010 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.80 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC has carved out a doji candle at the confluence of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance.  The prospects of a bull breakout above $4,130 (neckline + 50-day EMA) would drop sharply if BTC confirms a bearish doji reversal with a UTC close below $3,934. That will likely put the focus back on the long-term bearish technical setup and allow a drop to $3,566 (Dec. 27 low).  It is worth noting that a drop towards $3,566 would imply inverse head-and-shoulders failure, which is widely considered a strong bearish signal.  Put simply, the bulls need progress soon. A UTC close above $4,130 would confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and open the doors for a stronger rally.  4-hour chart  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart yesterday, signaling a resumption of the rally from the Jan. 6 low of $3,753.  So far, however, a break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $4,130 has remained elusive. That said, the bull flag pattern is still valid and would lose credibility only below the previous day's low of $3,934.  View  Bullish exhaustion seen at the key hurdle above $4,100 could embolden the bears.  A UTC close below $3,934 could yield a drop to $3,566 (Dec. 27 low). A break below that level would violate the bullish-higher low pattern and expose the December low of $3,122.  On the higher side, $4,130 is the level to beat for the bulls. An inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, if confirmed, would invalidate yesterday's doji and open up upside towards the psychological hurdle of $5,000.

42381454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmsd,1547028039,Pakistani Bank Teams With Alipay for Blockchain Remittances,"Pakistan-based Telenor Microfinance Bank, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecoms multinational Telenor Group, has launched cross-border payments using blockchain technology from payments firm Alipay.  Claiming it as Pakistan’s first blockchain-based international remittance service, the bank announced Tuesday that the product is a joint effort between Telenor Group’s Malaysian fintech subsidiary Valyou and its Pakistani mobile banking arm Easypaisa, offering real-time money transfers between the two nations.  Blockchain will “significantly boost the speed and efficiency” of payments, the bank said in a statement, adding that the money transfers will be “highly secure and transparent.”  “Currently, Pakistan receives about $1 billion in home remittances from Malaysia and this Easypaisa-Valyou collaboration is going to change it for the better,” said Roar Bjærum, senior vice president at Telenor Financial Services.  “Home remittances contributed to over 6 percent in GDP, equivalent to over 50 percent of our trade deficit, 85 percent of exports and over one-third of imports during FY 2017-18,” added State Bank of Pakistan governor Tariq Bajwa.  Alipay, operated by Alibaba Group’s Ant Financial, is said to have waived transaction fees for use of its technology during an initial one-year trial period.  “By eliminating intermediary costs, the new remittance service reduces transactional cost for end-users,” the bank said in a statement.  While Pakistan appears to be keen on the potential of blockchain technology, it has taken a negative stance of cryptocurrencies to date. Back in April, the country’s central bank, the State Bank of Pakistan, issued a statement barring financial companies in the country from working with cryptocurrency firms.  “Any transaction in this regard shall immediately be reported to Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) as a suspicious transaction,” the central bank said at the time.

42381461,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmxf,1547024446,Decentralized Exchanges: 2019's Key to a Dapp Comeback,"David Lu is a partner at 256 Ventures where he focuses on partnering with early stage blockchain companies and a venture partner at Virgil Capital, a quantitative cryptocurrency hedge fund. Find David on Twitter.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Ethereum and EOS, the two major platforms on which decentralized applications (dapps) are built, have market capitalizations of $15 billion and $2 billion, respectively. But, unfortunately, the number of dapp users simply fails to correlate with the market capitalization or valuations of these projects, with figures ranging in the thousands at best.  Whilst it is impressive observing dapps execute functions in a decentralized manner that once required centralized authorities, we're still many years from seeing their mainstream adoption, setting aside that gambling dapps have seen the highest levels of usage to date.  Yet, a class of dapp that we should all be extremely excited about in the short term is the decentralized exchanges.  A decentralized exchange is built on the blockchain and allows for the peer-to-peer trading of tokens native to that blockchain. How this works is that the users simply connect their cryptocurrency wallets to the decentralized exchange to begin interacting with the smart contract on it. This process automatically matches, verifies and executes trades without the need of a third-party. Traditionally, DEXs have been built on the ethereum blockchain (Kyber, 0x Protocol, Airswap), however, this has recently extended to other blockchains such as EOS or NEO.  As a standalone, the decentralised exchange is a dapp that facilitates liquidity but arguably, their function extends beyond that. Here’s why.  Dapps will often require multiple tokens to operate them. You might require the native dapp token, ethereum to send and confirm transactions on the blockchain, a storage token (Sia & Storj) to store the data for the dapp and perhaps a few other tokens depending on the specific needs of the project.  The project might have these tokens to power the service on the backend, but it is unlikely that the users of these dapps will have such a portfolio of tokens (on top of having the correct ratios) to operate the application. The dapp can integrate with the DEX, which abstracts all of the tokens to the back end — providing a “just-in-time” mechanism that creates a seamless user experience.  Throughout this process, there is no third-party API or account setup is required. Below are two examples that highlight the use cases of this.  Liquidity and payments  Melonport’s integration with decentralised exchanges such as 0x, OasisDEX and Kyber Network is a great example of leveraging the liquidity pools that DEXs provide. Melonport is trying to develop a decentralised asset management tool with the front-end operating on top of IPFS, while the back-end leverages off a set of ethereum smart contracts.  In this scenario, the DEX functions as a liquidity provider for fund managers to directly tap into these pools when managing their portfolios. The ability to swap assets with one click is an incredibly convenient function for fund managers to instantly trade or hedge their investments.  Etheremon’s integration with Kyber Network, one of the first dapps to integrate with Kyber’s onchain liquidity, illustrates another use case of DEXs. As more dapps get created, so do the number of different cryptocurrencies — resulting in a more fragmented token ecosystem. Holders of cryptocurrenies are less likely to just hold traditional pairs such as BTC or ETH, but numerous other altcoins in their wallets.  Meanwhile, most dapps usually only accept ETH and perhaps the games’ native token. The implication is that players need to exchange tokens they hold to ether or games’ tokens every time they want to play, which may adversely affect the user’s experience when playing such a game.  In this scenario, the DEX functions as a swap service that allows its players to pay with any supported ERC-20 token, such as Basic Attention (BAT), OmiseGo (OMG) or Zilliqa (ZIL). Simplifying the payment process into one step will allow users to seamlessly enjoy the game and more broadly, driving adoption for the entire dapps ecosystem.  What’s next for DEX?  DEXs will no doubt play a key role in the adoption of cryptocurrencies. But at the moment, they are very much in their infancy — DEXs are used by a niche audience and the technology behind them is still relatively nascent.  However, the interest and merits of DEXs cannot be ignored. Radar Relay completed a $10 million Series A funding round in August. Airswap recently executed the world’s first security token transfer on a public blockchain with partners SPiCE VC and Securitize. The P2P compliant transfer of a security offers a significant innovation to the way in which traditional securities market operate, cluttered by intermediaries.  And finally, centralized exchanges like Binance are considering their own DEXs despite their position as one of the leading exchange on the market. All that being said, it is important for the DEXs to consider the relevant compliance measures as platforms such as EtherDelta, which brand themselves as a “DEX,"" have recently come under fire from the SEC for operating an unlicensed exchange.  There’s no question that blockchain will play a significant role in our technological DNA moving forward. But rather than seeing the blockchain as a thing on the internet and as a tool to decentralize it, the question that should really be focused on is “What can we do with this technology that we couldn’t do before?”  The decentralized exchanges capture this sentiment very well – for the first time in history, users are able to have full control over their funds by utilizing non-custodial wallets that allows them to spend and trade their currency in a peer-to-peer manner.

42381466,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rn3x,1547018147,Security Token Offerings: A Way Past the SEC's Incomplete Crypto Guidance?,"Chi-Ru Jou is a partner in the Blockchain Technology & Digital Currency Group of CKR Law LLP, a global law firm with approximately fifty offices worldwide and more than forty attorneys contributing to the blockchain group. The views offered in this article are her own only.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  2018 has been a tumultuous year on the regulatory front for the blockchain industry.  The year began with news that the SEC had issued dozens of subpoenas for blockchain startups that had issued unregistered token offerings, spreading alarm throughout the crypto world. These investigations have recently resulted in penalties, mandatory securities offering registrations and in some cases reimbursement to investors, for a few blockchain companies.  SEC Director William Hinman issued informal guidelines that bitcoin and ether were not securities because those networks had become “sufficiently decentralized.” Now, as the year winds to a close, we hear that the SEC will issue “plain English” guidance on the security token analysis as soon as early 2019.  In this uncertain regulatory environment, most blockchain startups contemplating token offerings are steering away from the public crypto markets and venturing into the brave new world of security token offerings. The buzz on the street is that “STOs” may be the next big wave for blockchain fundraising.  However, many blockchain startups initially planned their business model around what they perceived to be a utility token – a software license to use the token on a platform, often as the currency to pay for services or earn rewards in a digital marketplace powered by a blockchain.  As these start-ups shift their plans from doing ICOs toward the regulatory landscape of STOs instead, the biggest question is whether the STO is going to be the panacea everyone is looking for: what unresolved legal issues for STOs do we confront in 2019? What cutting edge issues are currently boggling the minds of securities attorneys as they begin to execute these STOs?  Using Security Tokens on a Blockchain  Most STOs that are currently being initiated are private placement securities offerings to accredited investors.  However, the private placement poses a number of unresolved problems for blockchain companies wishing to use the tokens on their platforms. These issues will have to be analyzed carefully under the facts and circumstances of each blockchain platform, but some general considerations include:  Accreditation: Will the accredited status of investors have to be checked every time that the platform issues tokens, even where the tokens are being issued as rewards earned on the platform?  One-Year Lockup: Will initial token users have to hold the tokens for a year each time they earn tokens on the platform before using them for functional purposes on the platform such as paying for services?  State Issuer Dealer Registration: Will blockchain companies have to register as issuer dealers with several states that have such requirements before they can transact in their own securities on their platform? The American Bar Association published a useful article on state issuer dealer registration laws. Although these issuer dealer laws usually affect primarily public offerings of securities rather than private placements, a different novel question is presented by blockchain platforms that deal in their own securities on an ongoing basis after initial issuance.  Registration as an Alternative Trading System (“ATS”): If the blockchain platform is acting as a marketplace to bring together sellers and purchasers of security tokens, at what point does it need to register as an ATS? The SEC has yet to issue clear guidance regarding the circumstances under which a blockchain platform dealing in security tokens would be regarded as a securities “exchange,” particularly in difficult cases where the platform does not call itself an exchange of any kind.  Brave New Frontier of Reg A+ STOs  For blockchain companies that intended their tokens to be sold to the general public rather than accredited investors, without resale restrictions, all eyes are on the backlog of exempt public security offerings, or Regulation A+ STOs, currently sitting with the SEC awaiting approval.  Although blockchain companies that have filed Form 1-As under Regulation A+ generally regard their discussions with the SEC as confidential, the grapevine has relayed that there are currently unresolved obstacles to SEC compliance for these offerings. Hopefully in 2019, we’ll see the first qualifications of Reg A+ STOs and the exempt public securities offering will no longer be considered an “experimental” area.  Problems for Secondary Trading  Once hurdles with regard to federal securities laws on resales are cleared, blockchain companies will have to figure out some way to comply with state Blue Sky laws regarding secondary trading.  Each state offers a set of exemptions under which secondary trading may take place, with many states offering an “unsolicited brokerage transactions” exemption. 2019 will be the year when issues regarding state securities laws on secondary trading must be resolved.  Conclusion: Looking Ahead  2019 promises to be an exciting and eventful year for security token offerings.  For the first time, the blockchain industry will figure out if there is a way forward from the SEC’s informal guidance that most token offerings will have to be registered or issued under an exemption from registration. Furthermore, a wild card has been thrown into the regulatory mix with the recent introduction of a new bill amending the Securities Act to define cryptocurrencies as not being securities so long as they are utilized on a functioning network.  It is far from clear that STOs will provide an easy solution for blockchain start-ups that planned a utility token model and are now steering clear of the public crypto markets, but undoubtedly securities attorneys will throw in their best efforts to resolve these issues.

42381451,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rmnb,1547011542,The Case for a 2020 Bitcoin Bull Run,"Christopher Brookins is the founder of Valiendero Digital Assets, a quantitative crypto fund founded out of Carnegie Mellon.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Since the end of 2018, price action has been demonstrably negative, which surprised many expecting the end of Q4 historical “pump” in prices.      The price plummet appears largely driven by negative sentiment and swathes of selling pressure after the 2018 support level of $6,000 finally broke (dashed black line). This selling pressure kept prices well into the oversold range (using RSI and SWTO) for several weeks.      Only recently, has price begun to rebound. Even so, RSI and SWTO are still trending downward (black arrows), which may point to further price weakness at the beginning of Q1 2019 while bitcoin searches for a sustainable bottom.            Charts via Tradingview.com    Volatility ≠ Price Growth    As mentioned prior, many market commentators and participants assumed, incorrectly, that Q4 was always a strong period for market price growth, specifically from mid-November to the end of December. However, what many viewed as historically consistent price growth during this period, was in fact historically consistent volatility growth.      The graphic below shows historical daily volatility trends of bitcoin on a yearly basis since 2013. Thus, the supposition that many bulls were wrongly betting on was that higher volatility always equates to higher prices.            *Gdax/Coinbase Pro      As the volatility chart illustrates, the volatility trends of BTC, since 2013, do follow predictable patterns, culminating in higher volatility during Q4. This dynamic unfolded again in 2018 as price volatility compressed from October to mid-November (black lines), which typically precedes a breakout in price action. However, this time, volatility broke out to the downside for bitcoin.      After analyzing the overall trend in 2018 (demonstrably bearish), price volatility compression, historical volatility patterns, and fundamental indicators, it should have been more clear to market participants that the probability of a negative price breakout was far higher than to the upside.    Fundamental Indicators    Fundamental indicators can be quite useful for ascertaining a “narrative” of price movements and patterns, as long as the narrative is rooted in non-subjective data exploration. However, given the small sample size of bitcoin market cycles (n=10), each indicators output and predictive ability should be taken with a “grain of salt”.      Nic Carter from Castle Island Ventures / CoinMetrics and Antoine Le Calvez from Blockchain.info recently pioneered a new concept called realized cap (capitalization). The differentiation between realized cap and market cap being “instead of counting all of the mined coins at equal, current price, the UTXOs are aggregated and assigned a price based on the BTC/USD market price at the time when said UTXOs last moved.""      David Puell and Murad Mahmudov do an excellent job explaining these terms and significance further in their article.      Using data from CoinMetrics, the significance of realized cap compared to market cap can be visualized quite dramatically, albeit via a small sample size. The crossover points between market cap and realized cap can be viewed almost similar to golden crosses, whereby market cap breaching above realized cap is a re-ignition of a bull cycle, while a cross beneath may indicate the final stretch of a bear cycle. Beyond the aforementioned, this comparison offers lessons which may bear out or ""repeat"" in 2019.      Looking at the graphic, market cap went beneath realized cap on December 28, 2014, and stayed beneath realized cap until October 28, 2015, which coincides with the data-validated, high volatility period for bitcoin.      In this case, volatility coincided with price growth for bitcoin and kicked off the start of an amazing two-year bull run for bitcoin. This time around, market cap fell beneath realized cap on November 20, 2018. So, if history repeats itself (which is a tepid assertion), an investor might expect further price declines in 2019 followed by sideways trading, until a reignition of a new bull cycle at the end of Q4 2019 (November to December 2019).            Correlation to Δprice of 0.19      Additionally, using realized cap, an additional ratio or oscillator can be created that further explains bitcoin’s market cycles, market cap to realized cap (MVRM). The MVRM provides a useful indicator that visualizes the above dynamic via one ratio.      For example, historically, a value beneath 1.0 is undervalued while a value above 3.0 is overvalued; and above 4.0 is a negative inflection for prices. Currently, MVRM is 0.82 and the all-time low is 0.56. So, despite bitcoin being in undervalued territory, MVRM still possibly has further room to fall, which is consistent with the end of Q4 2019 narrative.      Further support of the significance of MVRM for price movements can be seen by the correlation between price and MVRM of 0.19, and correlation between price and MVRM of 0.98, which is extraordinarily high.            *coinmetrics.io        Network transaction volume to active addresses ratio (TAAR)    This ratio acts as an “equilibrium” gauge of bitcoin’s price to fundamentals valuation, where transaction volume and active addresses both represent ""quantity and quality"" growth of the bitcoin network; validated by 0.15 and 0.07 correlation between price, respectively.      For example, when TAAR and price are closely distributed, price (valuation) and fundamentals are aligned in equilibrium; and when either TAAR or price deviate substantially from each other, price is out of equilibrium which has historically resulted in price devaluation (albeit small sample size). The market’s recent selloff has helped reduce the gap between price and TAAR, which has persisted since Q4 2017.            Correlation to Δprice of 0.13      The 30 day moving average of TAAR is ~$2500 while TAAR daily is ~$2000, thus an “equilibrium” range for price appears between $2,000 and $3,000. *Note: prices seldom mean revert directly to their equilibrium level, they typically over-correct, which makes further price depreciation beyond the stated levels possible. Additionally, as can be seen on the logarithmic chart, price has bounced off TAAR’s 30-day MA twice in 2018 (black boxes), and has most recently rebounded momentarily.      The final price flush before finding a stable bottom will likely coincide with price falling beneath the TAAR 30 day MA, price recovering that level, and then TAAR beginning to trend upward once more.            *coinmetrics.io      Similar to MVRM, the TAAR to price ratio is an oscillator that visualizes the same dynamic via one ratio. Historically, a ratio of 1.5 and above is undervalued, 1.0 to 2.0 is ""safe"", and beneath 1.0 (“equilibrium”) is overvalued. Currently, the oscillator is ~0.70 which still indicates overvaluation, but the overall trend back towards 1.0 is positive.            *coinmetrics.io    Conclusion    While the recent price action for bitcoin has been harshly negative, these market clearing events have begun the normalization process for bitcoin’s price valuation, which can be seen in several indicators. Per the MVRM analysis above, if history repeats itself, price will likely fall further, then trade sideways until the end of Q4, then reignite a new bull market.      An additional verification of this narrative will be if the TAAR to price oscillator enters undervalued territory above 1.50 in 2019, especially, prior to Q4.    *Disclaimer: this article is for educational purposes only and should not be considered investment or trading advice.
