42384787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNUr,1601146800,The One-Way ETH 'Burn' That Will Kick-Start Ethereum 2.0,"With final preparations for the launch of Ethereum 2.0 soon to be underway, CoinDesk's Christine Kim spoke with developers Raul Jordan and Eduardo Antuña Díez about what's left to do and what comes next.    For free early access before our regular releases, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, CastBox or direct RSS for your favorite podcast player    This episode is sponsored by Crypto.com, Bitstamp and Nexo.io.      The final preparations for Ethereum 2.0 launch will soon be underway.      Lead developer at Prysmatic Labs Raul Jordan, who has been building Ethereum 2.0 software for over two years, explained his team would be wrapping up all feature development by Oct. 15.      “At that time, it’s all hands on deck to just have good documentation, good user experience, fix up security holes [and] basically prepare for launch. That’s where we are today if all remains on track,” said Jordan.      The final features currently in development by Prysmatic Labs and other software development teams include making sure different code implementations of Ethereum 2.0, also called “clients,” are interoperable and can be used interchangeably by a user without running the risk of losing validator rewards.      See also: A Day in the Life of an Ethereum 2.0 Validator      It’s not only client developers who are beginning final preparations for this network upgrade. Ethereum startups building hardware and tooling for users to participate in the Ethereum 2.0 launch are also working on adding last-minute features to their products.      Eduardo Antuña Díez, project lead at DAppNode, said, “The most important thing that we realized after the first [Ethereum 2.0] testnet is that people need to know the status of their validators. Having a good monitoring system to be able to know when your validator is down … we are working in that direction.”      Before Ethereum 2.0 goes live, Jordan and Díez both noted a new contract will be created on the current Ethereum blockchain to receive deposits of 32 ETH. Only once this contract accumulates a minimum of 524,288 ETH, which is worth roughly $181 million at time of writing, will the new Ethereum blockchain officially kick-start at midnight UTC the following day.      See also: Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters      About the security of the deposit contract, Jordan said, “There’s no way to retrieve [funds]. … It’s considered a burn in the short term. It’s not like there’s any sort of admin key or any sort of way to take those funds out. There’s no way somebody can take all the ETH that is locked in there.”      To download or stream the full podcast episode with Jordan and Díez you can go to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, CastBox or direct RSS for your favorite podcast player.

42384777,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNH1,1601102538,Over $280M Drained in KuCoin Crypto Exchange Hack,"Roughly $281 million of an Asian cryptocurrency exchange’s funds have been compromised in a security breach.      The Singapore-headquartered digital asset exchange KuCoin said in a statement it detected large withdrawals of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) tokens to an unknown wallet beginning at 19:05 UTC on Friday.      In a live stream on 4:30 UTC Saturday, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu said one or more hackers obtained the private keys to the exchange’s hot wallets. KuCoin transferred what was left in them to new hot wallets, abandoned the old ones and froze customer deposits and withdrawals, Lyu said.      KuCoin’s cold wallets were unaffected, Lyu claimed. Cold cryptocurrency wallets are not connected to the Internet and are considered more secure than hot cryptocurrency wallets.      In an updated statement on its website, KuCoin released a list of BTC, bitcoin sv (BSV), ETH, litecoin (LTC), XRP, Stellar lumens (XLM), tron (TRX) and tether (USDT) wallet addresses where the stolen funds were transferred.      Two Ethereum wallets belonging to KuCoin have sent more than 11,480 ETH, which currently trades at a price of about $350, to the Ethereum wallet address associated with the hack, according to data from blockchain explorer Etherscan.      The Ethereum wallet address has also received over 150 Ethereum-based tokens worth more than $150 million from the two KuCoin Ethereum wallets, Etherscan’s data shows.      The other identified wallets have received exactly 14,713 BSV, 26,733 LTC, 18,495,798 XRP and 999,160 USDT, along with over 2,015 BTC at three addresses (one, two and three), 9,588,383 XLM and 199,038,936 TRX, according to blockchain explorers Blockchair and Tronscan.      The cryptocurrencies are trading at roughly $10,700 per BTC, $165 per BSV, $45 per LTC, $0.25 per XRP, $0.07 per XLM, $0.02 per TRX and $1 per USDT, as of writing.      Tether and several cryptocurrency assets and exchanges such as Bitfinex have blacklisted the wallet addresses, according to the updated statement.      Over 200 cryptocurrency assets trade on KuCoin with a combined daily average volume of around $100 million, ranking it as one of the busiest trading exchanges, according to the cryptocurrency data site CoinGecko.      The price of KuCoin’s exchange token KCS fell by 14% to $0.86 within an hour on Saturday as news of the security breach spread on social media.      KuCoin is investigating the hack with international law enforcement and stolen customer money will be “covered completely” by an insurance fund, Lyu said in the livestream, though the exchange has since recovered about $204 million in stolen funds, Lyu informed users in a Tweet on Oct. 3.      UPDATE (Sept. 27, 2020, 1:00 UTC): Addresses and balances for cryptocurrency wallets associated with KuCoin’s hack have been added.

In a late Friday tweet, the Central Bank of the Bahamas announced that on Oct. 20 it will begin the ""gradual national release"" of its consumer-facing ""Sand Dollar"" digital currency, perhaps the world's first retail CBDC.  Though it was already known that the Bahamas was eyeing a mid-October release, the Friday announcement sets a hard date for the historic event and sheds new light on the rollout.  In the first phase, private-sector players such as banks and credit unions will ready their systems with know-your-customer (KYC) and other compliance checks across low-value, personal and enterprise wallets.  Sand Dollar's second phase, slated for early- through mid-2021, will focus on preparing essential infrastructure services in the government and private sectors, such as utility companies, for the CBDC.  A growing cadre of financial and payment institutions slated to intersect with Sand Dollar have already invested in building out mobile wallets for their users and have been on-boarded for the rollout accordingly, the central bank said.  Those wallets will be secured with ""multi-factor authentication"" safeguards, according to the announcement.  Users cannot and should not expect to have cash-like anonymity when using the CBDC, the central bank said. Even so, it said Friday that wallets will be encrypted ""to ensure confidentiality.""  Additionally, the central bank said it has prepped the CBDC by subjecting it to a ""rigorous cybersecurity assessment"" to overcome public fears of paying with a digitally native currency.  Regulations surrounding the Sand Dollar CBDC are still in the works. The central bank said those ""will be crystalized in the public space over the month of October.""
