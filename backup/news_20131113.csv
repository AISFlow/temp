42376678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beI9,1384369736,FEC proposes rule allowing political campaigns to receive bitcoin donations,"The US Federal Elections Commission (FEC) is proposing a measure that would allow election campaigns to accept bitcoin donations, but they would not be treated the same as cash currently is.  In an opinion letter dated 7th November, the FEC responded to a group called Conservative Action Fund (CAF) regarding its request to have an opinion about the acceptance of bitcoin donations. The opinion states that CAF can accept donations in bitcoin, but must sell them for cash in order use them for any sort of payment.  ""The Commission concludes that CAF may accept bitcoins as in-kind contributions under valuation, reporting, and disbursement procedures,"" the letter states.  ""CAF may not, however, make disbursements using bitcoins. Instead CAF must sell its bitcoins and deposit the proceeds in its campaign depositories before using the funds.""  CAF has told the commission its plan is to use a payment processor to accept bitcoin donations, and uses the company BitPay as an example of a provider it might utilize to do so. The letter states:  ""Under the BitPay model, CAF could choose whether to receive the contribution in the form of bitcoins transferred to CAF’s bitcoin wallet, or in the form of US dollars transferred to CAF’s bank account.""  It's clear the FEC wants to make sure that any bitcoin donations are not made anonymously, a key feature that bitcoin enthusiasts champion about the decentralized virtual currency.  ""CAF represents that it would acquire and record the 'relevant' information regarding each contributor who makes a contribution to CAF using bitcoins, such as the contributor’s name, address, occupation, and employer, as applicable,"" says the letter.  The US government is paying a lot of attention to bitcoin. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security, chaired by US Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), is set to meet next week to “dig into what a whole-government approach to this new and unique technology may look like”.  [post-quote]  One of the reasons bitcoin is being closely watched more than ever is its burgeoning value. Another is that some agencies, specifically law enforcement, are starting to see a rise in virtual currency-based fraud and scams.  It's clear that the FEC does not consider bitcoin as cash under its policies, but that it has monetary value.  ""Bitcoins do not meet the Commission’s regulatory definition of 'money.' Bitcoins are not currency of the United States or any other nation, and they are not negotiable instruments,"" the letter states.  The Uniform Commercial Code defines a 'negotiable instrument' as an ""unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money"" to a bearer or order on demand, or at a definite time.  ""Unlike checks and money orders, bitcoins do not grant their holders an 'unconditional' right to be paid in currency,"" the letter adds.  Public comments of draft advisory opinions such as this are open to public comment. The deadline for comment on this particular advisory opinion is today.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/13/fec-proposes-rule-allowing-political-campaigns-to-receive-bitcoin-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13d1a8358a245dab667d1406b52b9226d1580e84-1000x752.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beAb,1384345839,"Bitcoin's cruel world: scams, thefts and the FBI's influence","While the cops are away, the liars and thieves come out to play. Bitcoin’s world is a cruel one – making it a fascinating technology to keep tabs on. Yet at the same time, its risks are immense to investors and businesses working inside the bitcoin economy.  Can bitcoin ever reach a stage of legitimacy? It’s obvious that an unregulated, decentralized currency is a needed instrument in today’s constantly changing global financial markets. The fact that bitcoin has worth, that it keeps being a topic of financial discussion, is proof of concept. But bitcoin, as well as other distributed systems of payments, is also quite disruptive.  Bitfloor  The exchange Bitfloor was one of the first to feel the wrath of the US banking industry’s fears of bitcoin. In April, that exchange had to shut its doors after its bank account was permanently closed. It began refunding users in July, but this proved that banks did not yet want to cooperate with bitcoin.  There’s been too much risk involved in virtual currencies, something bankers despise. But it’s clear that the government wants to provide some guidance for the US banking industry and others, so that’s a step forward. The main reason is because government agencies want to be able to track criminal activities such as money laundering.  Bitfloor was an example of what might happen if you get tangled with banks, which want to comply with government agencies like the FBI. This shutdown event happened after 24,000 BTC was stolen from Bitfloor previously, in September 2012. Back then, those bitcoins were worth $250,000. Today, they are worth over $8m.  GBL  Imagine if the bank you did business with just disappeared one day. Wake up, and all of your money is completely gone. It isn’t a scenario that happens in banks residing within countries that have a lot of financial regulation. But with bitcoin, it happens. Hong Kong-based exchange GBL is an example of this.  After being in business since May of 2013, the site shut down near the end of October, taking $4.1m in investor money with it. In the Chinese bitcoin market, where BTC China has the number one global bitcoin exchange ranking, regulation is not even on the horizon. The lack of regulation makes these types of things more common, begging the question why there isn’t more security.  “This is happening frequently, and I think this is not good for the bitcoin ecosystem,” says Ankur Nadwani, the developer behind payment project BitMonet. “Cases like these show that there is a market for companies in the bitcoin space that focus on security.”  Inputs.io  On 23rd October, hackers were able to compromise the supposed high-security bitcoin wallet inputs.io, which like most wallets is hosted by a third party. The estimated value of those bitcoins was over $1.2m, which has, in a very short amount of time, become much more valuable due to the increase in BTC prices.  The developer, who has gone by the name of Tradefortress on bitcoin forums, said he does not plan to contact the police since bitcoins are untraceable, which is not entirely true. Tradefortress has already had a history of truth aversion, as he has claimed he once worked as a developer on Blockchain.info, which that site has denied.  “Tradefortress has never worked for or written any code for Blockchain.info. He claimed a bounty to help package the chrome extension for submission to the Chrome extension gallery but in the end the work was not used,"" said Ben Reeves of Blockchain.info.  There is some good out there  Probably one of the worst things about bitcoin scams is there is not much an investor can do if BTC or any other decentralized currency is stolen. Reporting it to the FBI makes sense, but it doesn’t mean that there will be any retribution.  “The individual investors are unfortunately the ones who bear the brunt of these scams, and often times there is no recourse, particularly if the exchange was a victim as well,” says Andrew Beal, corporate attorney at Los Angeles-based firm Crowley Strategy who works primarily with startup technology companies.  [post-quote]  Yet it’s already clear there are a number of companies who are putting time and money into making virtual currencies viable for the mainstream. ItBit, as a recent example, is an exchange using NASDAQ technology looking to attract accredited and then retail investors, and has secured over $5.5m in total funding to build something reliable for bitcoin.  Life’s not fair, and things can become really unruly if one decides to place their chips on a bitcoin bet. This was evident once again with a Czech exchange called Bitcash.cz, which has had 4,000 customer wallets emptied by thieves. Expect this to continue, with only the strongest bitcoin companies surviving and thriving.  “The most important thing an investor can do is be selective in deciding where to put their money,” says Beal, the attorney. “There are a lot of honest, reputable companies in this space who are committed to providing safe trading environments.”  That’s why it is always important for investors in any market perform their due diligence before making any investing decisions. Virtual currencies possess major growth potential, but also could become completely worthless due to a number of factors.  Ultimately, the bottom line is this: Don’t invest any money you cannot afford to lose.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/13/bitcoins-cruel-world-scams-thefts-and-the-fbis-influence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f48b5546dc438c0a126363acee73ba576ac3b1b-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
