42380926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92bCD,1529614803,"21e800: Bitcoin, Satoshi and the Mystery Twitter Is Obsessing Over","#00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a  This is a hashtag, but not just any hashtag. In all likelihood, it's the longest and most confusing one you'll ever come across trending in the crypto community.  Posted on June 19 by Mark Wilcox, the hashtag actually represents a cryptographic code known as a hash that's produced each time new transactions are validated and written onto the bitcoin blockchain. There are several of these written each day, so at first glance, it seems strange that this particular one produced on Tuesday at 19:32:37 (UTC) would be of any groundbreaking importance.  That's where you'd be wrong.  Well, actually, that's where you might be wrong.  Some background: There is a theory in physics that attempts to explain the interactions and dynamics of all forces in the universe with one simple mathematical structure known as the E8. Presented in a paper titled, ""An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything"" by Garrett Lisi in 2007, it still remains unproven.  Couple the unsolved status of the E8 theory with the equally unsolved mystery of the exact identity of the person(s) who invented bitcoin – with its supply cap of 21 million coins – into existence, and you get the hypothesis that ""21e800"" isn't just some random string of numbers and value. In fact, the theory seems to suggest, it is a ""vanity hash"" purposefully placed by the creator of bitcoin himself/herself/themselves, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Starting to get goosebumps yet?  If this hash is indeed a ""vanity hash"" or, in other words, one deliberately created as some kind of sign, the computing power to create it is not only magnitudes greater than is currently capable by the average computer, but the time needed to create it is somewhat jaw-dropping, as shown in a chart posted by developer Andrew DeSantis.  So for all these reasons and a few more (which we'll get to shortly), several people on Twitter are raving about the sheer impossibility of the existence of this hash, if indeed it was created and purposefully marked by an unknown person(s).  The impossibility of it all has led others to assert that perhaps the true identity of the creator of bitcoin is really something out of this world.  Hold your horses  But before we go jumping to any more wild conclusions, it is important to note the possibility that perhaps this string of characters is just random and simply the output of an ordinary hash function – not engineered by a hidden mastermind.  As Cornell University professor and blockchain researcher Emin Gün Sirer explains, the string of characters ""21e8"" isn't all that ""magical"" and actually occurs about once a year.  To this point, many others have also refuted the idea of a ""vanity hash"" entirely.  Instead, they see the more likely idea being that ""21e8"" isn't anything special and might even be a complete hoax.  What's keeping the magic alive?  What's clear from the day's social chatter is that the mystery behind this hash value is closely linked to the mystique – and fascination – with Satoshi Nakamoto and the creation story of bitcoin itself.  Indeed, a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum highlights how today's viral mystery is actually a rather old one.  Begun back in 2013, a post dubbed ""A mistery[sic] hidden in the Genesis Block"" on bitcointalk.org questions the creation of the first verified transaction using bitcoin.  As you may have heard, mining, the activity that verifies or ""unlocks"" blocks on the blockchain to write in new transactions is getting progressively harder. However, back in bitcoin's early days, the computing power required to process a block was comparatively lower – and at the same time, the computing processors in use weren't as powerful as today's power-hungry ASICs.  To put things in perspective, from unlocking Block 0, the genesis block, to Block 1, the approximate time to transpire was 6 days.  But according to calculations that have to do with the size of nonces – which are basically the additional data values added by miners to the hash function in order to get the appropriate hash value validating the next block – the approximate time to unlock Block 0 was only 4.2 minutes.  How is that possible?  Alas, that mystery persists. Perhaps, as in the words of @nondualrandy, these are all a series of ""easter eggs"" strategically planted to keep the magic behind bitcoin alive.

42380908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92aub,1529609734,$3 Billion Blockchain Tron Kicks Off Token Migration,"The 10th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world is set to commence its token migration process on Thursday.  Created by former Ripple representative Justin Sun, Tron aims to build infrastructure for a ""truly decentralized internet"" that can host decentralized applications (dapps). The project, which started on the ethereum blockchain and launched its own blockchain in late May, has positioned itself as a competitor to its former host.  As such, the token migration is an intermediary step in what Tron has called its progression towards ""independence,"" or in other words, the completion of its departure from ethereum and the activation of its mainnet technology.  Though the token migration is now a key part of the realization of Tron's technology, the original iteration of the project's roadmap did not include a token swap, much less the launch of an original Tron mainnet.  Sun initially intended for the project to remain on ethereum, however, according to a May Medium post, ""network issues"" triggered the decision to ""detach"" from the protocol.  He wrote further:  ""This is the only way to propel the industry into a stage of large-scale, rapid growth...Independence from ethereum is our answer to the calling of the blockchain era.""  The implementation of the network is likely to be contingent upon the success of the events of the upcoming week, which Tron told CoinDesk users can watch via its blog and social channels.  Whether the protocol will measure up to Sun's claims after the activation, however, remains to be seen.  Implications for token holders  For token holders, the swap merely means that the placeholder ERC-20 TRX tokens Tron distributed during its development phase will be switched out for native ""TRON-20"" TRX tokens.  Likewise, the swap means the balance of tokens in users' ethereum wallets will subsequently be transmitted to their Tron wallets.  Unlike other projects, such as EOS, which provide users with the option to carry out the swap manually, Tron's migration process will be facilitated wholly by exchanges. The process commences on Thursday, and users will have until June 24 to deposit their ERC-20 TRX tokens to one of 30 participating exchanges.  Users who already hold their tokens on a participating exchange do not need to take any action.  From June 22 to June 25, users will be unable to withdraw their TRX from exchanges. On June 24, the exchanges will take ""snapshots"" of users token balances to ensure the sums transfer correctly, and on June 25, both TRX deposits and withdrawals on exchanges will be frozen. Users will still be able to trade TRX during this period.  According to Tron, the completion of the token migration on June 25 will mark the point at which the Tron mainnet will become ""fully independent"" from the ethereum blockchain.  Following ""Independence Day,"" users will be able to resume deposits and withdrawals on June 26 in time for Tron's ""super representative election.""  Similar to EOS' block producer election, this process requires users to stake or ""freeze"" their TRON20 TRX tokens to vote for block validators to operate in Tron's delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus system.  Upon the completion of the election, the Tron blockchain will be fully activated.

Speaking at CB Insights' Future of Fintech conference on Thursday, the noted Fedcoin supporter – that is, a cryptocurrency operated by the U.S. central bank – addressed the challenges that regulators face when applying existing financial regulations to the nascent crypto space.  She went on to explain:  ""We are trying to jam crypto trading into state money transmission laws, it just doesn't work. I think at some point, we will need a federal framework to have some type of regulatory oversight of exchanges established to trade crypto assets. They may also be securities, if there are [initial coin offerings] being used to raise equity, they need to regulate it.""  Bair declared that she ""welcome[s] regulation"" of the cryptocurrency space, advocating for action that takes place sooner than later.  Indeed, the former head of the U.S. government corporation that backs up bank deposits said that the private sector may force financial institutions to adopt private currencies – including cryptocurrencies – because ""everybody hates bank account fees, the retailers hate interchange fees.""  ""If there is a way to get around that, I think you can see a shift [fairly] quickly,"" she said, adding:  ""I do think the Fed needs to get ahead of this.""  Bair reiterated her support for a FedCoin, noting that a central bank-issued cryptocurrency would solve transitional issues existing in current monetary policies issues while allowing the Federal Reserve maintain its ability to control the U.S.' money supply.  As an example, she pointed out that a bank which receives a 1.95 percent interest rate with the Fed tried to offer a 0.01 percent rate to individuals opening a savings account.

42380911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92ax7,1529600402,Ripple CEO Defends XRP's Utility at Fintech Conference,"""Let's be clear: Ripple is different than XRP,"" Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of distributed ledger startup Ripple, argued during CB Insights' Future of Fintech conference on Thursday.  Garlinghouse opened his talk by pushing back against arguments that the XRP cryptocurrency may be considered a security, given its close link to the San Francisco-based company. He also spoke about the work the company has done to date in partnership with a range of banks and financial firms.  Perhaps his strongest comments came in response to a question about whether XRP is a security for Ripple, a claim he – and other Ripple employees – have strongly rejected. A senior official for the Securities and Exchange Commission recently stated that bitcoin and ether aren't securities and the lack of any similar comment about XRP renewed that critique.  As he explained during the CB Insights event:  ""XRP is not a security for three reasons: if Ripple, the company, shuts down tomorrow, the XRP ledger will continue to operate; it's an open-source, decentralized technology .... if you buy XRP, [you are] not buying shares of Ripple - buying XRP doesn't give you ownership of Ripple.""  Garlinghouse also repeated concerns he has about bitcoin, saying ""I own ... [and] am bullish on bitcoin but we need to acknowledge ... when we talked about something being centralized and decentralized, control is the key element.""  He even went so far as to cast doubt on the SEC's classification that bitcoin is not a security, asking ""How decentralized is it?""  ""Three miners in China control more than 50 percent of the hash rate of bitcoin,"" he asserted, contending that the Chinese government may interfere with these miners and, as a result, have the ability to exert some form of control.

42380915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92b3P,1529594002,Bitcoin Just Got a Shoutout in a New US Supreme Court Opinion,"That's not something you see every day: an opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court that makes a reference to cryptocurrencies.  On June 21, the Supreme Court issued a ruling on Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, a court case involving a dispute over whether worker stock options can be taxed as a kind of ""compensation"" in the same way that money is.  According to Ballotpedia, subsidiaries of the Canadian National Railway Company lost their initial court battles, with both a district court and, later, an appellate court, ruling that the stock options are taxable under the U.S. Tax Act.  However, the ruling made Wednesday by the Supreme Court has confirmed stocks do not count as ""money remuneration"" and the case should be ""remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,"" according to majority opinion issued Thursday.  The dissenting opinion, drafted by the 79-year-old associated justice Stephen Breyer and backed by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, argues that the nature of what constitutes ""money"" is less rigid than the majority's interpretation, noting that ""what we view as money has changed over time.""  That's a notable argument coming from the more conservatively minded Supreme Court, setting the stage for what is the first reference to bitcoin in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.  Breyer wrote:  ""Moreover, what we view as money has changed over time. Cowrie shells once were such a medium but no longer are ... our currency originally included gold coins and bullion, but, after 1934, gold could not be used as a medium of exchange... [P]erhaps one day employees will be paid in bitcoin or some other type of cryptocurrency.""  Such a statement raises a key question, given the source: what are the implications of this?  While the opinion, in this case, has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies directly, the passing reference nonetheless signals that at least some of those that make up the top U.S. court are sympathetic to the idea that a cryptocurrency is a kind of money, as opposed to a form of property (as the Internal Revenue Service has ruled) or commodity (in the view of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and, more recently, a U.S. district court judge).  Perhaps it's far too early to say – but it's not impossible that questions about the nature of bitcoin could one day make their way to the Supreme Court.

Notably, the startup claims it will work with Binance Labs and Huobi Capital when investing in companies.  Though its fund will be used to back startups - including their finance, marketing, and recruitment needs - that are built on the IOST ecosystem, Bluehill told CoinDesk in an email that it is ""open to all projects irrespective of whether they're presently building on IOST.""

The exchange stated:  ""We have announced about 35 billion Korean won of damages ... Bithumb is reducing the amount of damage through ongoing damage recovery, future figures are expected to be lower.""  It explained that it was working with cryptocurrency exchanges and others to prevent further losses and retrieve the funds.  Further adding that the exchange keeps company and customer funds separately, the update said: ""The company believes that you can use Bithumb safely.""  News of the hack broke Wednesday after Bithumb confirmed that attackers had managed to access their systems and stolen the millions in cryptocurrency. So far the firm has provided no details on how the attack was carried out or which cryptos and in what amounts were taken, although XRP is believed to have been targeted.  The company did reassure customers that the remaining assets had been moved to offline cold wallets as a security measure and that it has halted all deposits and withdrawals for the time being.  In what is likely welcome news for customers, Bithumb has also stated that it would cover the losses arising from the breach from its own reserves.  In a press release issued today, the Korea Blockchain Association, a self-regulatory group comprised of exchanges and blockchain startups, called the hack ""embarrassing,"" but added that exchanges taking on hacking losses is ""a good way to protect our users.""  The association continued to say: ""We will continue to establish standards for user protection such as security, standard conditions and dispute settlement procedures that cryptocurrency exchanges should have. ""  According to today's update, the agencies that are helping investigate the causes of the breach include the Korea Communications Commission, KISA and the National Police Agency.

42380918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92b5v,1529585986,Ethereum Accelerator to Offer Crypto Coders Resources and 'Reality Check',"ConsenSys is launching Tachyon, the first ethereum-focused accelerator program in San Francisco, the firm announced Thursday.  Starting in September, up to 15 projects will receive between $75,000 to $100,000 in investments, plus access to an eight-week program. According to the company, the new venue will feature everything from educational workshops to public demo days with venture capital firms from Silicon Valley and Switzerland.  ConsenSys Ventures managing partner Kavita Gupta gave CoinDesk the exclusive scoop on the program's debut, saying that the effort hopes to provide a dose of realism in an industry overflowing with excited young entrepreneurs.  Gupta said:  ""It's [about] having a reality check about how mature this space is, which is not really very much, and who are the real users. What is missing to optimize the current processes?""  Applications are open to anyone with a project that fits with one of the three tracks – social impact startups, general ethereum startups, and open-source projects, including blockchain agnostic tools. So far, applications are already pouring in from China, Israel, Colombia and Abu Dhabi.  Also invited, Gupta said, are teams from established tech companies.  ""There are lots and lots of projects coming out of Google, Uber, etc, which have really strong themes and a product vision. But didn't have a deep understanding of how blockchain technology really works,"" Gupta said.  In this way, Gupta said strategic mentorship will be a key value-add.  Each team will be paired with at least two mentors, one from established crypto startups like MetaMask, Token Foundry, ConsenSys Labs or Adhara, and another from a traditional Silicon Valley ""unicorn"" company.  ""I think the most important part is, why do they really think this is missing from the market?"" Gupta said. ""How do they see that product interacting and pushing the envelope for the whole decentralized economy and community, instead of just their standalone project?""  Heavy hitters  Tachyon will hardly be the first blockchain accelerator program, but it promises to leverage the strategic positioning of ConsenSys, itself a hub of startups, to offer value to entrepreneurs.  Some teams will work on open-source tools instead of full-fledged business ideas. Gupta said she is most interested in solutions in this area that aim to address scalability, security and optimized data transmission.  On the other hand, she also hopes to be surprised by new ideas.  ""I have a lot of people coming to me and saying: 'This doesn't exist. We're going to build it.' And I'm like, have you ever thought that people are not stupid in this space? Why haven't they done it? Then we think on it, and the solutions, instead of sitting on this high horse,"" she said.

Dubbed Coin Master, the mobile app – available for both iOS and Android – will track the real-time prices of cryptocurrencies on over 100 exchanges and automatically calculate overall losses or profits after users update their trading histories.  The company said investors are able to update their portfolios either by inputting their transaction information manually, including both fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto transactions, or linking the app with the wallets or exchanges on which they store the assets.  Cheetah Mobile's senior vice president, Edward Sun, said the new product allows cryptocurrency investors to ""check the status of their assets anytime, anywhere.""  Publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Cheetah Mobile was rebranded from Kingsoft Security in 2010 and is a subsidiary of Kingsoft, one of the oldest and largest software companies in China. Notably, the firm's vice chairman is Lei Jun, the well-known Chinese entrepreneur who founded electronics manufacturer Xiaomi.  The app release follows Cheetah Mobile's entry into the cryptocurrency space in January, when it launched a wallet app for Android and iOS devices.  Additionally, Tong Huashun, a widely used stock tracking and trading app in China, briefly rolled out a cryptocurrency price tracking service last month, but later appeared to have removed the feature – possibly due to regulatory uncertainties in China.

42380910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92avr,1529578834,"This $575 Million ICO With Royal Backing Is So Crazy, It Might Be Real","Crypto loves Lamborghinis.  So much so it seems that a startup looking to release movies – early offerings include a biopic about the founder of the car company and his feud with the founder of Ferrari – has raised a whopping $575 million off its private sale of TTU crypto tokens from investors including BlockTower Capital and even a prince.  With that, the startup, called TaTaTu, has raised the third largest round ever using the initial coin offering (ICO) model – surpassed only by EOS and Telegram, according to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker.  If you think that sounds crazy – such a huge raise by a company called TaTaTu with no history in the crypto space – you wouldn't be alone. Even one of the project's backers admits that the news, announced today, will catch many off guard.  ""The large round seems surprising in the context of a crowded and bearish crypto industry, in which investors typically participate with crypto, and not fiat. We think it, in fact, isn't,"" Allan Cassis, the CEO of Lvna Capital, told CoinDesk. Cassis' family gave money to the project, but Lvna Capital did not participate in the round.  Pointing to a new category of interested crypto backers, he continued, saying, ""This is new money coming into the markets at a time when we continue to see delays from the long-expected institutional investors' participation in bitcoin.""  Sure enough, some of that new money is coming from European royalty and nobility – Prince Felix of Luxembourg, second in the line of succession, and Lady Monika Bacardi, of the family that owns the famous liquor company, Bacardi Limited. (CoinDesk was not able to confirm Prince Felix's investment by press time, but TaTaTu previously disclosed Lady Bacardi's pledge on its Medium blog, where it ""estimated"" her backing at $100 million.)  Plus with BlockTower Capital investing and Lvna Capital acting as a strategic advisor, there seems to be quite a bit of support for TaTaTu's endeavor – which isn't only about movie making.  On top of creating its own video content, TaTaTu plans on building a token-powered video-on-demand platform to compete with Netflix. According to the press release, the funds raised will be used to build the platform, build audience and promote an ad-supported service that will share revenue with viewers.  TaTaTu CEO Andrea Iervolino said in a press release:  ""The response is further validation that our model of acquiring and producing our own content mixed with rewarding users with TTU tokens to watch that content on the platform will benefit everyone.""  Still, there's a number of things about this round that may give observers in the space pause.  For starters, huge rounds tend to make people more skeptical than reassured, plus projects that flaunt celebrity-like backers have many times ended badly. Plus there's a number of small things – including spelling errors on websites, the white paper and in the press release – that will add doubts (spelling errors are generally seen as the mark of scammers).  But perhaps one of the most notable breaks from typical industry practice is that the white paper does not indicate how many tokens will be created for TaTaTu or whether more will be created over time.  Instead, the white paper only acknowledges that 57 percent of the project's ethereum-based tokens were set aside for the private sale. And provided that hasn't changed, that would value the token supply at a little over $1 billion.  While BlockTower Capital's Ari Paul did not respond to a request for comment, he did confirm that he gave this statement for the announcement:  ""I'm excited for projects that will spread cryptocurrency beyond the current less than 0.5 percent of the world that holds it.""  The TTU economy  The way TaTaTu plans on getting crypto into the hands of everyday users is by sharing its revenue with content viewers and creators.  The basic idea behind TaTaTu is simple on its face: viewers of the content distributed through the service will share in the ad-revenue earned by the service, as will creators who provide their work.  And according to the white paper, revenue from advertisers will be paid in the native crypto token and all rewards for the viewing of content will be paid out in TTU as well, which it calls advertising video-on-demand (AVOD). But later in the document is where the business starts to blur since it explains that AdMob, a Google-housed mobile advertising company, will be the ""preferred monetization solution"" and ""pay TaTaTu in fiat.""  The white paper goes on, though, stating that regardless, the funds that come in from third-party ad providers will be converted into the platform's tokens – and those will then be shared with viewers (whose identities will be verified) and content providers over the next few weeks.  Here again, TaTaTu breaks from the norms of most ICO-backed companies, as the white paper discloses, ""TaTaTu takes a small percentage of profits in order to run the platform while the large majority goes to the user.""  Many ICO issuers have decided to send all revenue to users, with the company making money off the growing value (as adoption increases) of crypto tokens held in reserve. That said, TaTaTu will also earn funds in that way. The white paper indicates that unsold tokens are held in a reserve (35.5 percent), which will be used for stabilizing the market, but another 5 percent is set aside for the team and advisors and 2.5 percent for the founder.  And if that in itself didn't add a significant amount of complexity, once the video-on-demand service goes live, it only becomes more complicated.  The white paper describes eventually adding features familiar to other major websites, such as celebrity profiles, blockchain-based digital rights management, peer-to-peer recommendations and user-generated video, among other ideas. It also describes other kinds of video content, such as sports streaming.  According to the white paper, these additional features will be completed between now and sometime around March 2019.  Users already?  It's an ambitious plan, but according to the press release, one that has garnered significant attention not only from investors but also future users.  The platform launched an alpha release on June 15 for 500 users, yet the press release states that 200,000 people have joined the waiting list to participate in the new platform.  Early users will earn tokens for testing and interacting with the platform, and much like other content platforms, such as Steemit, these early entrants are likely to receive some of the richest rewards if the new protocol works as planned.  That said, the project's priority appears to be content over technology. According to the white paper, only 15 percent of the funds raised will be used for overhead, which includes software development. Meanwhile, 35 percent will be devoted to user acquisition and another 35 percent to content acquisition. Lastly, another 15 percent will be put towards marketing.  Indeed, the Lamborghini film isn't the only one slated for the service; another film the company is promoting is a forthcoming documentary chronicling actor Jeremy Renner's efforts making music for the animated film, ""Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad.""  Speaking to her support of Iervolino's past work in film, Bacardi said in the press release:  ""Andrea is a forward thinker who has always met, and in many instances exceeded, his own high business standards.""  Still, with TaTaTu's charge into film distribution, the company will face an extensive array of competition on the blockchain, as many other projects have entered into different aspects of this space. The most direct competitor is Flixxo, but others include YouNow and VideoCoin.  That said, if money is what will make or break this use case, TaTaTu's reported fundraising round is larger than all those other efforts combined.  Stan Higgins contributed reporting.

Bitcoin rose to a six-day high of $6,580 on Monday on Bitfinex, adding credence to indications that the cryptocurrency could be in for a relief rally.  The bullish bias has strengthened further in the last two days too, courtesy of a bullish Bollinger band breakout and a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA). Furthermore, bitcoin refused to embrace the negative narrative on Wednesday after the $31 million hack of South Korea's Bithumb exchange, indicating that the sellers are likely running dry.  Despite all this, though, the cryptocurrency has struggled to find acceptance above $6,800 in the last 72 hours, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  Bitcoin printed intraday highs above $6,800 in the last three trading days (as per UTC), but still closed well below the $6,800 mark.  The repeated failure to scale $6,800 in a convincing manner forces us to consider the possibility of the bears making a comeback, although the charts do not see that happening while BTC is holding above $6,550.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,730 on Bitfinex.  4-hour chart  The chart shows BTC has created a rising wedge – a bearish continuation pattern. A break below $6,550 (rising wedge support and 50MA support) would put the bears back in the driver's seat and allow a drop to $6,000.  A drop below $6,550 would also push the relative strength index (RSI) below the ascending trendline, further strengthening the bear case.  View  The immediate outlook remains bullish as long as bitcoin is holding above $6,550.  On the higher side, stiff resistance is noted at $6,943 (100-candle MA on 4-hour chart) and $7,000 (psychological hurdle).  A downside break of the rising wedge pattern (below $6,550) would open the doors to $6,000.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 would expose the next major psychological support of $5,000.

The new ATM service – facilitated through a partnership with Dutch software firm ByeleX – is currently at the beginning of a six-month trial period to determine if there is sufficient demand from travelers, the release indicates.  Tanja Dik, director of Consumer Products & Services at Schiphol, commented:  ""With the bitcoin ATM, we hope to provide a useful service to passengers by allowing them to easily exchange 'local' euros for the 'global' cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum. That can be beneficial if, for instance, it's not possible to spend euros in their home country.""  The effort comes as other international airports are starting to embrace the idea of cryptocurrency as a potentially beneficial added service for their customers.

According to an announcement on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), an extensive database maintained by the central bank's St. Louis branch, is now offering data points for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin.  The price data for the well-known and widely cited economic research database is being provided by the U.S. exchange Coinbase and is updated on a daily basis, according to the announcement. Furthermore, the database makes available the historical price data of the four assets back to as early as 2014.  The move to add crypto data is not, perhaps, entirely surprising, given that the St. Louis Federal Reserve – a center for local, national and global economic research – has never shied away from taking a focus on cryptocurrencies.  Most recently, speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in May, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, raised concerns that the sheer number of cryptocurrencies these days may bring the risk of a ""chaos of exchange rates"" that has been seen previously in U.S. history – especially during the civil war.  The St. Louis branch has had its eyes bitcoin since as early as 2014, when its vice president, David Andolfatto, hosted a seminar on the topic and notably commented at the time that the innovation is forcing traditional institutions to either ""adapt or die.""

42380901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92Xhp,1529553655,"Amid Crypto Bear Market, Attention Turns to Small-Time Investors","""It's all being bought by retail.""  Speaking at CB Insights' Future of Fintech conference Wednesday, Nasdaq president and CEO Adena Friedman hit on a theme almost everyone at the event echoed: the central role normally marginal figures – small-time investors and millennials in particular – play in the cryptocurrency market (as well as financial technology or ""fintech"" more broadly).  During the first day of the conference in New York City, Friedman spoke about retail investors – who she called ""Mr. and Mrs. 401(k)"" – and their interest in crypto tokens created via initial coin offerings, or ICOs, a funding mechanism that exploded in late 2017 and early 2018.  And while Freidman expressed ""real concerns about transparency"" and the fear that ICOs could ""take advantage of people,"" she acknowledged that the technology opens up access to the early-stage investments, particularly now that IPOs are subject to so many rules that she said ""no longer serve a purpose ... or protect investors.""  Even though IPOs are a big source of revenue for Nasdaq, Freidman said of ICOs:  ""You want to make it so that retail has access to great companies.""  Still, quite a bit of ambivalence was displayed about the fundraising mechanism, made popular by ethereum's ERC-20 standard but now available in several different forms on many different blockchains.  Even as a conservative Republican with inclinations toward light regulation, Mick Mulvaney, the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), raised the frightening prospect of no oversight at all – speculating on what would happen if Mt. Gox ""became a regular occurrence.""  However, he went on to recognize that the application of old laws and regulations to cryptocurrency could produce ""an absurd or unintended result,"" which the CFPB wants to avoid.  Retail will be fine  Still, several speakers noted that retail investors will need both help and protection in interacting with the high-risk, high-reward ICO market.  These are not wealthy investors, after all, who the SEC treats – in Friedman's words – ""like big boys, big girls.""  In contrast, Vlad Tenev, co-CEO of Robinhood, the millennial-focused, mobile-only investing platform, expressed no hint of high-minded concern for retail investors. These small-time traders are Robinhood's ""bread and butter,"" he said unapologetically.  The app started out offering commission-free trades in equities, followed by options – commonly regarded as high-risk investments – and then, in January, added bitcoin and ether to the investment options. In May, the company raised $363 million in a Series D to build the ""largest crypto platform.""  This move into crypto – which is currently available to people in 16 states – came after large numbers of users began requesting that Robinhood list cryptocurrencies, Tenev said, making no mention of agonizing over how best to protect this group of investors.  If anyone should be worried about their financial futures, it is the stock brokerages and cryptocurrency exchanges that charge high fees, he continued, adding:  ""If you look at cryptos, people are paying exorbitant fees right now – four, five percent per transaction – and it's very similar to brokerage before we came in and lowered fees dramatically.""  Robinhood's small-fry millennial customers, he seemed to be saying, are too smart to pay those kinds of fees.  Don't mention the bears  And yet, what went mostly unsaid at the conference was telling.  Bitcoin prices have waltzed off a cliff since hitting nosebleed highs around $20,000 in December 2017. According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the cryptocurrency is trading for around $6,750 at the time of writing – down more than two-thirds from its all-time high.  But no one seemed particularly eager to talk about the pain this bear market might have caused retail investors. Friedman and Mulvaney hinted at it in the abstract but made no mention of the fact that many retail investors are nursing steep losses right now.  At the same time, speakers and attendees sometimes appeared to salivate over the goldmine that millennials and other small-time investors represent. Soon the younger generation will be worth trillions of dollars, a CB Insights researcher pointed out in one presentation.  And Tenev boasted that over a million people signed up to Robinhood's waiting list to trade cryptocurrency within the span of a few days – this at the very height of the recent mania. He also mentioned that equity trades on the platform are often in the ""tens or hundreds"" of dollars – in other words, implying that its users are hardly wealthy (though maybe they're just cautious).  As such, it was perhaps easy for some to come away from the conference with the same see-sawing misgivings that Mulvaney and Friedman seemed troubled by.  While some ask why regular people shouldn't be able to access potentially lucrative crypto opportunities, the space is rife with half-truths, sketchiness and outright scams, and in turn, another question presents itself: should often-inexperienced investors be expected to fend for themselves?

42380895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XaH,1529546417,Winklevoss Brothers Score Another Crypto Investment Patent,"Crypto exchange Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have long sought the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  And while that process remains in flux, a company tied to the brothers has won another U.S. patent related to the creation of exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies and digital assets.  The patent was awarded to a firm called Winklevoss IP LLP, and both Winklevoss brothers are included as the inventors along with Evan Louis Greebel, Kathleen Hill Moriarty and Gregory Elias Xethalis.  The patent, awarded on June 19, details a method ""for providing an exchange-traded product holding digital math-based assets"" as well as the issuance of shares tied to that ETP. It adds to the body of intellectual property the Winklevosses have sought to obtain, though it's not entirely clear when or how the concepts will be applied to real-world products.  An ETP  , such as an exchange-traded fund (ETFs), is a type of security, the price of which is derived from other investment instruments - in this case, cryptocurrencies.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the Winklevoss brothers won a patent last month for a system that settles transactions for ETPs tied to cryptocurrencies. Like the other patent, this week's award names a variety of cryptocurrencies, from major ones like bitcoin and monero to more obscure ones like BBQcoin.  Publicly available data shows that this week's patent is the seventh crypto-related patent the Winklevoss brothers have received, with the first being awarded in December of last year.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once denied a bid proposed by the Winklevoss brothers in March 2017 to list a bitcoin-tied exchange-traded fund (ETF), citing ""the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.""
