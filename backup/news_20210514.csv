42406413,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7k2,1621024103,Market Wrap: It's 'Doge Day Afternoon' as Memecoin Jumps 47%; Ether and Bitcoin Rise,"Dogecoin soared on Friday but the cryptocurrency’s circulation ownership raises questions. Ether pops as its futures market hits a record. Bitcoin faces pressures from its options market and a downward trending dominance percentage.    Dogecoin (DOGE) trading around $0.56 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 47% over the previous 24 hours.  Dogecoin’s 24-hour range: $0.39-$0.58 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $50,263 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $49,009-$51,502 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $4,055 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 10.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,641-$4,165 (CoinDesk 20)  Dogecoin correlation to BTC near zero as asset pumps    Meme-friendly cryptocurrency dogecoin bounced back in a big way Friday, up 47% as of press time. The expectation that Coinbase would list and begin trading the asset in the near future was likely one culprit for the FOMO. So far in 2021, dogecoin is up over 12,000% on Binance, according to data provided by charting software provider TradingView.      Not all industry participants are amused by dogecoin’s tricks, however.      “Being something of a crypto old-schooler I am really troubled by the comical approach taken to dogecoin,” said over-the-counter bitcoin trader Henrik Kugelberg. “As if it’s somehow not actual people’s money being the victim of extremely rich peoples’ whims and fooling around.”      Interesting to note from Kugelberg is the sheer concentration of wealth in the dogecoin ecosystem. According to blockchain data from Bitinfocharts, one person owns 28.8% of all doge in circulation, and just 102 wallet holders own another 38.5%. So 67% of all dogecoin is effectively controlled via 103 wallets.      “I am staying far from DOGE,” added Kugelberg.      What may be of interest to larger holders, however, is that dogecoin does not move in tandem with bitcoin. At least not anymore. According to CoinDesk Research, dogecoin’s correlation with bitcoin has fallen to near zero, which means the two cryptocurrencies are both marching to the beat of their own drums, at least since October 2020 when the two were closely correlated.      “At this point the financial future of doge could very much be dictated by Elon [Musk, the Tesla CEO] and others who unilaterally decide to adopt it as their currency of choice,” said John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritum. “That decision is likely not to be based on merit of the traditional sort but, rather, just because they like it.”      “As far as our portfolio, we aren't specifically long dogecoin but may trade its volatility in a delta-neutral manner if it suits us,” Willock added.    Ether futures explosion    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $4,055 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up more than 10% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bullish signal for market technicians.      “Regarding ETH, for the rest of this cycle at the least I expect that it will continue to lead BTC, as it's the more speculative asset,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quant fund Efficient Frontier. “It also benefits from the growth of apps built on top of it,"" most notably decentralized finance (DeFi).      Speculative indeed. On Thursday, the last day for closing data at press time, ether futures hit $100 billion for the first time. By comparison, bitcoin futures on Thursday were at $132 billion.      Ether futures volume was the highest in three months. More futures and more exchange traded funds, or ETFs, which allow investors a more regulated way to pour money into ether, might mean more bullishness ahead for ETH.      “More institutional investors view ether as a serious asset,” said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation Group. “There’s also been increased engagement after Canada allowed the launch of three ethereum exchange-traded funds,"" he added. “And just last week, ETF sponsor VanEck filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a similar fund. It’s one more potential positive for the digital asset.”    Bitcoin options market, dominance in the dumps    The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin, was up Friday by 3.2% as of press time and at a $50,263 spot price. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was near the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      One culprit for bitcoin struggling to make gains versus other crypto assets: the options market. Fredrick Collins, a seasoned options trader and researcher at Glassnode, noted heavy short-selling might be putting bear pressure on BTC. “Market makers were heavily short puts in the range of $52,000 to $50,000, and I estimate were forced to sell nearly 2,900 bitcoin during the crash to offset the short gamma exposure,” Collins told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. “That likely exacerbated the bearish move.”      Another factor: Altcoins are more exciting. According to charting software TradingView, bitcoin’s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, is down 2.9% Friday and has fallen this year over 42% since Jan. 1.      Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, says differentiation between various crypto assets such as BTC, ETH and DOGE is what is causing bitcoin’s tepid market while ether and doge continue to pop.      “It’s market and trader segments that have settled into three different types of crypto investors,” Lau told CoinDesk. “There is the longer-term store of value, which is BTC. Then there is the ecosystem, application-driven, which is ETH. Then you have the meme and momentum-driven, which is DOGE.”      For retail traders, or anyone with access to a stock brokerage account, there might be an opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap right now. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) currently has a discount that represents the difference between the price of the underlying bitcoin assets and the value that’s implied from the price of the trust’s shares. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary.)

Demand has surged in cryptocurrency markets for Terra’s LUNA token, which works as part of an automatic balancing system that helps to keep prices for the stablecoins, well, stable.      The LUNA price has climbed a flabbergasting 25-fold this year, outpacing the already-impressive sevenfold gain for larger rival MakerDAO’s maker (MKR) tokens. LUNA’s market capitalization has jumped to about $6 billion from $300 million in less than five months, overtaking MKR at $4.7 billion.

The power station operator said it will invest in a “portfolio” of greenhouse gas reduction projects to offset 100% of its miners' carbon footprint. It also plans to invest some of its mining profits in renewable energy projects in New York, according to its statement on Friday. The miner owns its own ~40 MW natural gas plant, the energy source prompting the carbon credit purchases.      Greenidge, which is planning to go public through a merger, came under fire last month for its plans to expand its upstate New York bitcoin mining facility. Environmentalists objected to the power station burning natural gas to mine bitcoin as well as to its cooling system’s alleged impact on a local lake.      “Each project has been reviewed and certified by one of three well-recognized Offset Project Registries, the American Carbon Registry (ACR), the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) and Verra, ensuring that any projects funded by Greenidge reduce emissions or increase sequestration of greenhouse gas in a manner that is real, permanent, and verifiable,” the release reads.      The Greenidge case is one battlefront in a growing war over bitcoin’s environmental footprint. Critics have blasted energy-hungry crypto miners for in their view needlessly contributing to the climate crisis, while defenders of bitcoin’s proof-of-work blockchain argue that the crypto amounts to an insignificant blip in global emissions.      “All miners should follow their example and buy offsets; they’re only around 10 bps (basis points) to neutralize the climate impact,” Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and frequent commentator on the mining controversy, said of Greenidge. “Offsets are an expedient and efficient tool to solve this problem.”      Read more: New York Bill Would Freeze Bitcoin Miners Pending Environmental Review      Greenidge’s carbon offset announcement comes as new waves of media attention foment controversy surrounding Bitcoin’s energy use.      The Chinese government has begun cracking down on coal mining in Inner Mongolia, expressly for its carbon footprint.      Earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk suspended the electric-car maker’s policy of allowing bitcoin as a payment because of environmental concerns. He said Tesla could revisit the crypto once “mining transitions to more sustainable energy.”      In response, some North American miners have begun making moves toward 100% renewables in their energy sourcing. In MONTH, the Crypto Carbon Accord was created, with a growing number of companies pledging to make the crypto mining industry carbon neutral by 2040.      Though Greenidge’s bitcoin rigs will remain dependent on energy from fossil fuels and will use more energy once it expands its mining operations, the company appears to be one of the first crypto miners with a carbon emissions offset plan.      Notably, bitcoin mining’s energy mix trends from 36-76% renewables depending on the time of year. Currently, Chinese miners are migrating away from the coal-rich region of Xinjiang to the hydro-rich Sichuan region.

42406402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7aC,1621017643,Musk Has Doge on a Leash. Is He a Manipulator?,"Elon Musk and Tesla have had a uniquely outsized influence on price movements for bitcoin and dogecoin in recent days and weeks. Through a series of announcements, tweets and ""Saturday Night Live"" quips, the electric carmaker and its CEO have sent those prices on wild rides and likely helped juice the overall crypto market.      But some might wonder whether all that signaling amounts to market manipulation. Musk has a track record of recklessness here, having paid a $20 million fine to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 over misleading tweets about Tesla stock. But whether out of bounds or not, Musk’s adventures through crypto-land cast important light on how token markets work – and on larger questions of market influence in the social media age.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Here’s the recent tape: On the evening of May 13, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweeted that he was “Working with DOGE devs to improve system transaction efficiency.” The price of the dogecoin cryptocurrency immediately jumped 14% and has continued legging up. It continued weeks of dogecoin mentions by Musk, which helped the coin skyrocket – despite the fact that it was literally started as a joke and has no meaningfully differentiating technological features.      It was the latest in a head-spinning series of jokes and statements about DOGE. Musk was substantially responsible for a meteoric run-up in DOGE that started in early April. But an expected push even higher short-circuited when he called the meme-coin “a hustle” while hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" on May 8. That dismissive quip sent DOGE down more than 35%.    Read more: ‘Call Me the Dogefather’: Elon Musk Explains Crypto to SNL’s Audience    Musk and Tesla have also been assertively moving the price of bitcoin. Tesla first announced it would accept bitcoin as payment on Feb. 8, at the same time it announced it was buying $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. That announcement helped push the price of bitcoin over $50,000 for the first time ever. When the option to use bitcoin then went live on March 24, it was notably clunky – so primitive, in fact, that buyers were apparently left at risk of inputting the wrong wallet address. Its unveiling was nonetheless followed by a BTC rally to over $58,000.      Then this week, Musk announced Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin for payment, over environmental concerns. Bitcoin plunged nearly 10%.      These rallies and crashes were all driven by the most powerful logic in the cryptocurrency speculation trade: adoption is everything. Since the early days of crypto, the announcement of new companies accepting crypto payments, new exchange listings, and new major investments have been the biggest and most consistent drivers of price movement.    If you buy stock with the purpose of pushing the price up so that other people will buy it, that’s market manipulation.    That logic, combined with Tesla’s reputation for innovation and Musk’s immense personal platform, mean that they have huge power to move crypto markets.      That power has been very profitable for Tesla, in ways that the conspiracy-minded might find suspect. After the bump generated in part by its own bitcoin moves, Tesla sold about 10% of its BTC for a $101 million profit, improving its first-quarter earnings results by nearly 30%.      To some extent, Tesla and Musk’s power to move markets is no different than that of veteran investors like Warren Buffett or Stanley Druckenmiller. They’re able to lead markets because people trust their judgment.      But it’s almost inevitably a gray area. Writing about WallStreetBets and GameStop earlier this year, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine encapsulated the horns of the dilemma:    “If you buy stock with the purpose of pushing the price up so that other people will buy it, that’s market manipulation,” he wrote. “If you buy stock hoping that the price will go up because other people buy it, that’s not market manipulation; that’s just normal. Those things are not so different.”    That ambiguity certainly applies to Tesla’s bitcoin investment – the company’s market position meant its purchase was something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The question becomes whether the purchase was based on that possibly manipulative thesis, or on a broader genuine belief in the asset. As Levine points out, it may ultimately be unanswerable, because the motives are so hard to tell apart.      Things are even less clear when it comes to Musk’s infatuation with dogecoin. Reuters and others have been unable to determine whether Musk has a personal position in dogecoin, which would be prerequisite to any genuinely out-of-bounds manipulation. There has been some speculation that the SEC could take an interest in his activities (a possibility Musk cheekily said would be ""awesome""), but no clear evidence that they have.      But the legal question is probably less significant than the simple reality that Musk has DOGE on a rhetorical leash. He could crash it tomorrow if he really set his mind to it. Or he could simply lose interest and leave his Shiba followers to languish. Whatever Musk’s intent, that puts DOGE holders in a uniquely vulnerable position, dependent on the good graces of one man to hold up billions of dollars of nominal value.

Russia's Central Election Commission is currently testing a three-day electronic voting format in anticipation of the nationwide election campaign this fall. Golos told a news outlet Open Media the system became even more opaque than it was last September, when the technology was used for the first time. Back then the website for online voting allowed observers to download data from the blockchain, but now is only shows fragments of transactions' hashes, with no open data to view.      In addition, it's not clear how the system works because it mysteriously rejected some of the voters who wanted to take part in testing, Golos head Grigory Melkonyants told Open Media. He said people told Golos that they were refused the electronic ballots because the system could not check their personal data; in some cases, they were told that they were ""not picked by a random choosing method.""      Melkonyants said that Golos suggested ways to improve the system to the Central Election Commission, but the recommendations were not accepted.      ""The Commission is happy with a system in which nobody can understand anything,"" he added.

42406411,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7j3,1621015214,Money Reimagined: How the Fed Could Fail,"Not a great week for crypto markets, the worst of which came Tuesday and Wednesday. First, a report from the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested it might not be so keen on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund after all. Then, a surprisingly high April consumer price index (CPI) readout raised fears an inflation-wary U.S. Federal Reserve might turn off the money machine that has propped up stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies this past year. Finally, to top it off, Tesla CEO Elon Musk went cold on bitcoin, sending its price into a tailspin that drove it below $50,000.      This week’s newsletter deals with all these issues, with the main column arguing that we need a longer-term view to understand bitcoin’s relationship with inflation, one that focuses on a bigger problem than monthly increases in the CPI, and that is the risk of a debt-fueled monetary breakdown.      That big-picture perspective dovetails with the grand theme of this week’s ""Money Reimagined"" podcast. As part of our lead-up to CoinDesk’s Consensus conference starting May 24, with a lineup that includes Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, we wanted to focus on the big geopolitical themes that those speakers will highlight.      So, Sheila Warren and I talked to Bruno Macaes, a Portuguese politician, author and influential thinker on geopolitical trends, and Tomicah Tillemann, the Director of the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative at the New America think tank. The conversation took an surprising turn, as both guests essentially said that if the U.S. plays its cards right, it could turn the current moment of economic uncertainty to its advantage. But to do so, they said, it must embrace the principles of open systems and open society that lie at the heart of the crypto ethos.      Have a listen after you read the newsletter.    What kind of inflation hedge is bitcoin?    Hats off to Nathaniel Whittemore.      On Monday, the host of CoinDesk’s ""The Breakdown"" podcast highlighted the many signs of rising prices in the U.S. economy – in lumber, copper and truck drivers’ wages, for example – and asked if it was a sign that inflation was taking hold even if it’s not represented in the data. Then, on Wednesday, the April consumer price index was released: up 4.2% on the year, the fastest inflation in 13 years.      This, naturally, spooked world markets as investors reasoned that the Federal Reserve will need to unwind its accommodative monetary stance earlier than expected. The sell-off included bitcoin, which then went into a more precipitous decline Wednesday evening after Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer be accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for its cars.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Moments like this tend to confound people inside and outside of the crypto space. Isn’t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation?      To that I say, no, not in the sense that it will rise automatically when the CPI is up and fall when it eases. There are still plenty of speculators who treat bitcoin as a risk asset akin to stocks. To them, anything that creates uncertainty around the future of monetary policy hits BTC as hard as stocks, if not harder.      It’s more appropriate to think of bitcoin as a hedge against a wholesale debasement of fiat currencies in the further-off future when governments, faced with untenable fiscal burdens, are left with no choice but to monetize their ballooning debt burdens. Of course, that also results in inflation, since devaluing currencies will translate into higher prices for everything, quite possibly hyperinflation. But that’s separate from the short-term, pandemic-driven demand-and-supply factors that are currently showing up in the CPI.      In other words, if you buy into the bitcoin thesis that it will be a “digital gold” hedge against a more unstable monetary state, you can make the argument that its moment is yet to come.      Still, in that context, this week’s CPI result is important. Landing in a global economy that’s still far, far from healthy, a resurgence in consumer price inflation could expedite that long-term reckoning with debt. That’s a worry for the world. But it’s generally bullish for bitcoin.    A vicious circle    Let’s game this out, shall we?      First, consider the issue currently roiling markets. Investors are worried higher inflation threatens the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve full employment and stable prices. Any signs it is failing on the latter could prompt it to pare back its aggressive quantitative easing (QE) policy of asset purchases, which helped drive a long-running rally in both stock and bond markets this past year.      On the surface, that’s a legitimate concern. The Fed’s current long-run inflation target is 2% and while it has signaled a willingness to let inflation surpass that threshold during the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath, it can’t afford to let the numbers run too high for too long without doing something about it. Failing to act could undermine its legitimacy, upon which its power and effectiveness rests.      But now consider the obvious outcome if and when the Fed starts to seriously tighten monetary policy. Naturally, interest rates will rise, potentially very sharply.      In normal times, that would be welcomed as tighter monetary conditions would cool an overheated economy and contain price increases.      But these are not normal times. The COVID-19 global economy is a story of massive economic pain, of looming, unrealized losses for a host of industries on the wrong side of the work-from-home zeitgeist, and of, surging debt – most importantly, fiscal debt. If interest rates rise too far, they will make that debt fundamentally unserviceable.      How much debt? Well, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s latest projections, if existing policies and laws were to remain in place, U.S. federal debt would reach 102% of GDP this year, rise to a record-high 107% by 2031 and then almost double to 202% of GDP by 2051. The IMF’s rule of the thumb is that a debt-to-GDP ratio above 80% can sow debt crises.      This trajectory is fed by three sources: the debt previously issued to pay for the fiscal stimulus after the 2008 financial crisis, the new debt needed to cover the Trump and Biden administrations’ responses to the pandemic, and the as-yet unissued debt to pay for a surge in Medicare and Social Security claims from Baby Boomers.      The bond market is acutely aware of these numbers. As such, it will freak out if interest rates rise too far too fast. Even the most incremental increase will add trillions to the government’s debt servicing costs.      The Fed faces a vicious circle, as do the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan or the People’s Bank of China, all of which face similar, if not worse, debt outlooks. They will have no choice but to monetize their debt.    End game    At first, central banks will do this indirectly, as they’ve already been doing. They will expand QE, by which they buy bonds and other assets in the secondary market. But pretty soon they will run out of enough of those to buy. So, they’ll hold their noses and buy newly-issued debt from their governments.      This will undermine central banks’ legitimacy, but they will have no choice. The inevitable result: a collapse in the value of fiat currencies, the flipside of which is an appreciation in all things money can buy – yes, consumer goods, but more importantly, scarce assets: gold, real estate and bitcoin.      This, by the way, is the thesis of legendary investor Ray Dalio. He will be talking to me as one of the main keynotes at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference on Monday, May 24, about the 75-year debt cycle that the world finds itself in and how the debasement of money is its inevitable result.      It’s a rather scary idea, but it’s the issue people need to keep their eyes on, not the knee-jerk responses to month-by-month changes in the CPI.    Off the Charts: DeFi summer 2.0?    Remember the DeFi summer of 2020? There was an explosion of new protocols built as“legos” on top of each other. As market participants imported their ether or wrapped bitcoin into the ecosystem and tried all sorts of new yield farming tricks to earn money from lending, borrowing or both, the world of decentralized finance went berserk. The ultimate measure of that was “total value locked,” which by mid-September broke through the $10 billion level to mark a major milestone.      Now we’re starting to hear about DeFi summer 2.0. Excitement is growing over a host of new advances: a more sophisticated version 3.0 of popular automated market maker Uniswap, a host of new layer 2 applications – which will, in theory, curtail the problem of network congestion and high gas fees – and, maybe, just maybe, the introduction of some Wall Street money into the space. All this will make DeFi summer 1.0 look “tame,” says one observer of the space.      So, if the excitement is growing, are players deploying funds to get ahead of it? Are we seeing it in the TVL numbers? A look at the screenshot charts from data provider DeFi Pulse provide an answer, and it is “it depends.”      Certainly, as the above chart shows, if we measure the total value in terms of its dollar value, there has been a steady rise in the amount of funds ported into the DeFi world. But that dip at the end of the chart tells us something: that this measure is highly dependent on the dollar value of the cryptocurrencies invested. This week saw a huge selloff in both ether and bitcoin, the two biggest cryptocurrencies deployed as collateral in DeFi lending platforms. So, naturally the dollar value fell.      What, then, if we look at these numbers over the same time frame in terms of the actual cryptocurrencies locked?      This is DeFI Pulse’s measure of total ether locked in DeFi, (Note: it counts actual ETH locked; it is not the total value expressed in ether terms.) It looks like there was a big surge of activity early in April, possibly around the time of the deployment of Uniswap V3. But since then, there seems to have been some liquidations.      It’s not clear why such a drop off would happen. One explanation is that people and institutions want that ether for other money-making ends, including new eth-backed funds or staking projects. But given that ether continues to be the most important collateral currency in DeFi, the number offers some caution on the prospect of a summer surge.      And here’s total bitcoin locked – a measure that stems from the wrapped bitcoin token, a contract that allows holders of bitcoin to lock up their funds in a contract that’s then converted into an ERC-20 token. All up, there hasn’t been much of a change over the past three months – save for two odd occurrences that look like technical glitches. If anything, however, there has been a modest increase since April. So maybe bitcoin HODLers are looking to DeFi again.      Overall, the data are a bit of a wash. Given all the big developments in the space, there's still good reason to expect that DeFi summer 2.0 is around the corner. But, as ever with still-young crypto markets, don't be counting your sushi/pizzas/yams just yet.    The conversation: Musk spoils the party    Oh, Elon, how could you?      Wednesday evening’s bitcoin sell-off was indisputably driven by this tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.      Why the violent reaction in crypto markets? It goes back to Feb. 8 when Musk kicked off a new bout of bitcoin price gains in announcing that Tesla had bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin and planned to accept the cryptocurrency in payments. And now he has a change of heart.      Given that Musk, one of the three richest people on Earth, had recently turned himself into the most influential player in the crypto meme wars, his apparent reversal into someone spreading serious doubt prompted all sorts of reactions on Crypto Twitter.      J.P. Koning cleverly reminded us that the actual impact of this position change is meaningless, at least in terms of bitcoin demand and supply dynamics.      But the point here is not that Tesla is curbing actual bitcoin transactions per se. It’s about the signaling, most importantly to future buyers. In warning that bitcoin might not be such an environmentally friendly investment, Musk, with his 54 million followers, is giving license to ESG-conscious investors who might have been on the fence about buying it to say no.      And that needled people.      Author and hard-money bitcoin advocate Saifedean Ammous was predictably snarky, but his sharp and to-the-point tweet neatly highlighted a hypocrisy in Musk’s position.      Meanwhile, Chainstone Labs CEO and Satoshi Roundtable founder Bruce Fenton found a pointed way to tell everyone to move on.    Relevant reads: Bitcoin ETF ever?    In its endless wait for a U.S.-approved bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the Bitcoin community had more ups and downs this week. Mostly downs.    CoinDesk’s coverage started with Sebastian Sinclair’s take on the upbeat assessment from Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, on the prospects of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a bitcoin ETF this year. Balchunas was swayed by the solid performance of Canada’s ETFs and the possibly crypto-friendly leanings of new SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.  But a day later that optimistic take seemed premature. As Nikhilesh De and Danny Nelson reported, an SEC report poured cold water on those hopes with a rather downbeat assessment of bitcoin markets and that hinted that it was not going to rush into an ETF approval after all.  So what’s one of the more high-profiles submitters of a number or pending ETF approval requests doing? As Danny Nelson reported, mutual fund manager VanEck has begun stashing bitcoin into a new private fund and courting well-heeled investors who meet accredited investor standards.  Meanwhile, Bitwise has decided it will find another way for mainstream investors to get exposure to cryptocurrencies. Daniel Palmer reported that the crypto asset manager had launched an ETF of 30 companies that can be considered “pure-plays” in the sector, including Coinbase and MicroStrategy.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

42406408,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7g6,1621013147,Terra’s 25-Fold Price Jump This Year Shows Growing Bet on Algorithmic Stablecoins,"There’s no shortage these days of blockchain-based projects to build or develop a digital version of U.S. dollars: private efforts including tether, USDC, diem, dai and the Federal Reserve’s research into whether to issue a central bank digital currency. But one project, Terra, appears to be outperforming the rest – at least based on the issuer’s governance token price so far in 2021.      Terra is a three-year-old project from the South Korean developer Terraform Labs, built to support a basket of decentralized stablecoins. Demand has surged in cryptocurrency markets for Terra’s LUNA token, which works as part of an automatic balancing system that helps to keep prices for the stablecoins, well, stable.      The LUNA price has climbed a flabbergasting 25-fold this year, outpacing the already-impressive sevenfold gain for larger rival MakerDAO’s maker tokens. LUNA’s market capitalization has jumped to about $6 billion from $300 million in less than five months, overtaking MKR at $4.7 billion.      Cryptocurrency analysts see value in Terra’s two current major use cases: Mirror protocol, which allows users to create tokens that track the price of real-world assets like stocks, and Anchor protocol, a lending and saving platform. Both protocols make use of Terra’s own stablecoins such as TerraUSD (UST), which is pegged to U.S. dollars, and TerraKRW (KRT), which is pegged to the Korean won.      LUNA serves as a governance token and is used as part of an algorithmic balancing system that helps the stablecoins maintain their pegs. For example, when TerraUSD trades above $1, users can send $1 worth of LUNA to the system and receive 1 UST in return – a trade that helps to bring the stablecoin’s price back in line.      The combination of Anchor and Mirror creates “a flywheel that effectively retains and grows monetary inflows,” Messari analyst Phang Jun Yu wrote May 6 in a report.      “When the market is bullish, users will turn to equities and start using Mirror,” he wrote. “When the market is bearish and people are wary of investments, they turn their assets back into cash and deposit it into Anchor.”      Stablecoins – whether centrally managed versions like tether and USD coin, or decentralized versions like dai that are managed by blockchain-based protocols – have proven popular assets in digital-asset markets, as alternatives to major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, whose prices can be volatile.      An emerging subcategory is “algorithmic stablecoins” like Fei Protocol (FEI), which use software-coded procedures embedded into the protocol to maintain the currency peg. While some of these projects have encountered mixed success with keeping the peg at an on-target reading of 1-to-1, proponents say they have advantages.      “The advantage you get with algorithmic stablecoins is that nobody can take that away from you and it retains all the censorship-resistant properties of bitcoin,” Terraform CEO Do Kwon told CoinDesk in an interview.      Of course, it’s important to note that prices for newer cryptocurrencies like Terra can be extremely volatile, and these decentralized blockchain-based protocols have short track records and can be prone to glitches and snafus. Fei’s recent difficulty keeping its stablecoin at a 1-to-1 peg might be seen as a cautionary tale.      Kwon said that some algorithmic stablecoin projects are struggling because they failed to recognize the importance of mainstream adoption and limited their projects' use cases – such as staking the stablecoins to earn rewards.      “These protocols don’t natively print stablecoins to incentivize the users to hold, which would be like a recursive incentive,” Kwon said.      Since the UST dollar stablecoin was first minted in December, the amount outstanding has climbed above $2 billion, according to CoinGecko. While that’s still a fraction of tether’s $58.5 billion, it’s not too far behind the $4.6 billion for two-year-old dai.      Kwon said the rapid value growth of UST is backed by the success of protocols like Mirror and Anchor.    At least 50 different protocolshttps://terra.smartstake.io/eco have announced plans to support the Terra-backed stablecoins, including an options protocol on top of Mirror.    “For the next six months, what we are going to be focusing on is to make sure that these new projects that are launching are successful and then sort of help to compose them into use cases leveraging our existing assets,” Kwon said.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/14/terras-25-fold-price-jump-this-year-shows-growing-bet-on-algorithmic-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66a065c348d0ed391405e8ff4b3cded139f35c36-1177x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto initiated coverage of COIN on Friday, and in a note to clients, he wrote that the exchange has continued to expand its market share, despite the industry's dramatic growth, according to a CNBC report.  “In our view, COIN is the most scaled play in the crypto space, an asset class that has the potential, in our view, to reshape financial services and the technology underpinning it,” Repetto said, according to CNBC.  The analyst set a price target of $335 for COIN; at the time of publication Friday, the stock was trading up 0.16% at $265.52.  “As COIN continues to grow its assets on platform and verified users count through (1) further adoption of crypto by the public and (2) increased market share, we believe Coinbase’s revenue potential has increased in optimal operating environments and raised their operating floor in subdued, non-volatile, markets,” Repetto aid.

42406395,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7RL,1621009800,"Banks Are Already Cracking Down on Crypto, Indian Traders Say","India hasn’t formally banned cryptocurrencies, but the country’s banks appear to be cracking down on crypto and exchanges.      Indian crypto exchanges are struggling to keep fiat coming in as banks are halting transfers to crypto-related accounts, according to members of the local crypto community. Crypto traders also are receiving notifications from banks asking about crypto-related transactions and warning their accounts may be closed, they said.      The situation has likely been prompted by the anti-crypto move by India’s top financial regulator. The country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has been approaching banks and asking them to sever ties with crypto, according to a Thursday report by Reuters.      The banks have reportedly asked the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a central bank-owned retail payments system, to block crypto-related transactions. However, the agency refused to do it. Despite that refusal, crypto exchanges are having issues with their clients’ banking transfers.      Crypto has been gaining popularity in India recently, especially among the younger generation, which sees cryptocurrencies as a novel investment option, replacing gold that traditionally has been used to store family wealth. However, the country hasn’t come up with a consistent regulatory approach yet and rumors of a possible crypto ban have been hovering around India over the recent months.    Exchanges’ struggle    WazirX, an Indian crypto exchange, has been having issues with transfers from banks for the past two weeks, said founder Nischal Shetty.      “We do have trouble with banks not allowing crypto exchanges with access to banking APIs for receiving customer deposits,” Shetty told CoinDesk, referring to application program interfaces.      He said the bank WazirX worked with stopped serving the exchange last week, so WazirX had to quickly find another one. As the change took place, there were no banking services available for a few days over the weekend, he said. Shetty did not disclose which bank stopped working with WazirX.      The rationale behind the banks’ behavior is not clear.      “There’s been no official statement from RBI yet. But I think it’s mostly the banks themselves that are deciding not to provide access to crypto startups in India,” Shetty said, adding, “We are talking to multiple banks now. I’m sure a few forward-looking banks will offer their services.”      Read also: India’s Millennials Embrace Digital Gold Despite Proposed Bitcoin Ban      Vikram Rangala, chief marketing officer at the ZebPay exchange, told CoinDesk that ZebPay, too, had briefly dealt with banking issues.      “Our deposits were down for part of one day and we had to turn to manual deposit methods, which are slower. We are switching to other payment channels so we're able to adapt, but it is still disruptive,” Rangala said.      He believes the banks might be following the old anti-crypto order that the RBI issued in 2018, which was overturned by the Indian Supreme Court in 2020.      “That Supreme Court ruling is the law of the land and even the RBI has confirmed that crypto is not illegal. We still have some banks citing the 2018 notice, even though it has been ruled unconstitutional,” Rangala said.    Users get a red notice    It is not only crypto businesses that have encountered banking troubles. Naimish Sanghvi, founder of Indian crypto news website Coincrunch, told CoinDesk that Axis bank, where he had his account, sent him a letter saying his transactions were found to be “inconsistent,” and his account would be closed in 30 days.      “It is not per the normal activity expected as per the information provided by you at the time of account opening,” read the letter, reviewed by CoinDesk.      Last summer, Coincrunch reported that Axis bank made its clients sign obligations not to deal with crypto, especially targeting those who were interacting with WazirX’s account at Karur Vysya Bank.      Another user that contacted this CoinDesk reporter via Telegram said his brother received a letter from HDFC Bank inquiring about his crypto purchases. The user, nicknamed as “Crypto hustler,” refused to share his real name, fearing “the wrath of government,” but showed CoinDesk the letter his brother received.      “Which are the channels/websites through which you are investing in cryptocurrencies?” the letter said, asking the user to share documents related to crypto transactions “for verification.”      Read also: Indian Crypto Firms Suggest Policy Ideas to Government Ahead of Possible Ban      “But we haven't shared anything to them,” the user wrote. “We withdrew all money and that bank account is empty. Also not withdrawing to banks nowadays due to this fear.”      Indian YouTube influencer Kashif Raza told CoinDesk there were many people who felt an impact of the new policies by their banks. The exact scope of this, however, is not clear.      Raza tweeted last week that “banks are closing the individual accounts for dealing in crypto but they are not giving it in writing.” According to Raza, payment networks also shut down on crypto businesses as they “have informally told exchanges in advance that they can’t work with them as they fear RBI wrath.”      CoinDesk reached out to Axis and HDFC Bank for comments but had not heard back by press time.

42406393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7TJ,1621008012,Ransomware Attacks Growing More Profitable: Chainalysis,"Ransomware attackers are growing more dangerous, more sophisticated and sharply more profitable in extracting crypto from their victims, according to on-chain data reviewed by Chainalysis.      In a new report, the blockchain analytics firm said ransomware-linked addresses have banked at least $81 million in crypto this year after amassing a record $406 million in 2020. Chainalysis suspects the true toll is far higher. New addresses frequently pop up, and victim corporations often keep their ransomware run-ins under wraps.      Just last week Colonial Pipeline suffered a debilitating ransomware attack that forced it to freeze a critical oil and gas artery for the U.S. eastern seaboard. Colonial ultimately paid the group, which was using DarkSide ransomware, $5 million in crypto to unlock its network, according to reports.      Chainalysis said the prevalence of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is contributing to the blistering spread of corporate cyber attacks. Under RaaS, ransomware developers essentially license out their software strains and share in their affiliates’ profits. DarkSide generated the vast majority of RaaS revenue through Q1, the report said.      Ransomware payouts are also steadily growing. Victims paid an average of $54,000 in Q1, compared to $46,000 in Q4 2020 and just $12,000 average in Q4 2019. There tends to be at least one $10 million ransom paid a quarter, but groups have demanded as much as $50 million.      Cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, the top ransomware payout, is inherently traceable because of its public blockchain, allowing Chainalysis to follow the money. It said ransomware addresses spread over 9% of victim funds across fraud shops, hacking tool service providers and even professional negotiator services last quarter to support their extortion efforts. Just 3% of the crypto flowed that way in Q1 2020.      But the vast majority of last quarter’s ransomware payouts, over 75%, ended up on crypto exchanges, Chainalysis said.      Likewise, the vast majority of ransomware strains appear to emanate from Russia’s sphere of influence. Russian-affiliated cybercriminals “have been among the most prolific in the world,” Chainalysis said, especially in crypto crime. They account for a “larger share” of ransomware activity in 2021.      The most profitable ransomware strains of 2021 are hard coded to avoid Russian-speaking victims, Chainalysis said. It estimated Russia-linked strains have taken in 92% of this year’s ransomware proceeds, compared to 86% last year.      Law enforcement entities may be targeting ransomware proprietors.

42406397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7VH,1621006490,Crypto-Philanthropy Is Here. What Will It Do?,"New ways of making money have often generated new approaches to giving it away. With cryptocurrencies now worth more than all the U.S. dollars in circulation, holders face a crucial question: what kind of donors do they want to be?      The rise of cryptocurrencies has forced the finance industry and the world at large to re-examine assumptions on transparency, efficiency and power distribution. And so, crypto donors have an exciting opportunity to not only grapple with the decision of “how much” but also “how.” How, in other words, can they add both to the pool of available resources and ensure it’s better spent?    Joe Huston is Managing Director at GiveDirectly, an organization devoted to delivering unconditional digital funds to the poorest people in the world.    For better or worse, new sources of wealth often change how philanthropy works. John D. Rockefeller, America’s first billionaire, built its first modern foundation. Rockefeller had more money than he could give away himself and set up an entity to give according to a broad mandate long after his death. His peers – Carnegie, Mellon, Ford – soon followed and a new philanthropic tool was born.      Decades later, the personal computing revolution spurred Bill & Melinda Gates to position their foundation as a uniquely influential private player in the public health space. And in the years that followed, wealth from internet companies like Facebook drove the growth of effective altruism (or evidence-based philanthropy), as well as the expanded use of new legal structures like donor-advised funds or L.L.C.s.      Crypto donors have already begun to make their mark. In 2018, a person (or persons) calling themselves Pine gave 5,104 bitcoin to 60 charities entirely anonymously. FTX is the world’s only trading platform, crypto or otherwise, that was founded explicitly, “with the goal of donating to the world’s most effective charities.” It donates 1% of its net fees (in 2020, its founder was baffled to find himself then-candidate Joe Biden’s second largest donor).    Read more: Twitter CEO Will Donate Proceeds From the Genesis Tweet to GiveDirectly    New structures for giving have also developed. GitCoin uses quadratic funding to crowdsource and match funding for public goods in the Ethereum space. And nonprofit Noora Health issued an NFT promising the purchaser a digital claim to the impact achieved through the NFT’s purchase price.      This is just the beginning. In a conversation with economist Tyler Cowen, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said if Bitcoin’s price reaches $200,000, half of the world’s billionaires would be crypto billionaires.      So how can crypto donors do the most good? First, they can join pioneers like Open Philanthropy Project in helping make altruism more effective. Too much giving still turns on anecdotes versus data. And more of those controlling the purse strings must ask the difficult questions about evidence and impact.      As the Managing Director of a nonprofit called GiveDirectly, I believe charities have much to learn from the transparency, efficiency, and decentralized power at the heart of crypto’s potential. The status quo aid model requires donor money to move through a complex web of multinational and local organizations before reaching its end-destination. Both dollars and information are often eroded along the way, and the end-user is too often deemed a passive recipient of goods or services, instead of an active agent of resource allocation.      One alternative is to simply give people money. At GiveDirectly, we have delivered over $380 million to hundreds of thousands of people, including residents in urban slums, refugees, and survivors of natural disasters across 10 countries. Direct cash transfers are not a silver bullet, but they’re evidence-backed, efficient, and have been increasingly adopted as an industry benchmark.      Cutting out the middlemen in aid has resonated within the crypto community. People like Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin have joined Pine and thousands of others in sending more than $25 million in cryptocurrencies to people in need through GiveDirectly. Cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology broadly could also help improve the implementation of giving itself better. Smart contracts could implement new approaches to results-based financing, public ledgers could open up new standards in transparent aid, or digital currencies could offer ways to distribute aid despite capital controls or inadequate fiat currencies. Of course, realizing these possibilities will require building with the world’s poorest people in mind (and investing more in those who are already doing so).    Read more: Pete Howson: The Downside of Crypto Donations    While crypto donors have important decisions to make about how and where to give, the work begins further upstream within the industry itself. As Teddy Roosevelt remarked about the industrialists’ new foundations, ""No amount of charities in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them."" For cryptocurrency, that may mean tackling carbon footprints, rooting out the scams that prey on its most vulnerable community members, collaborating productively with regulators and tax authorities, or ensuring tomorrow’s financial system includes more diverse perspectives than today’s.      Still, if the giving often looks like the earning, there’s a lot to be hopeful about in the rise of crypto-philanthropy. Let’s make sure it delivers on that potential.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Joe Huston,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/14/crypto-philanthropy-is-here-what-will-it-do,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5dc7c5355239450c1789dc37305ed6e51fc5ad13-1211x1012.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406409,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7h5,1621004347,Crypto Options Market Makers Starting to Influence Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin (BTC) tanked on Wednesday, hitting multi-month lows near $46,000 as renewed fears of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, the recent dour mood in financial markets and Tesla's decision to suspend bitcoin payments were all blamed for the slide.      But the downward move was likely aggravated by options market makers selling the cryptocurrency in the spot/futures market to hedge their books (offset bullish exposure), according to Fredrick Collins, a seasoned options trader and researcher at Glassnode.      ""Market makers were heavily short puts in the range of $52,000 to $50,000, and I estimate were forced to sell nearly 2,900 bitcoin during the crash to offset the short gamma exposure,"" Collins told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""That likely exacerbated the bearish move.""      The episode shows how the growing trade in cryptocurrency options in recent months has become a force to reckon with for participants in the underlying spot market for bitcoin, with monthly expiries proving to be a catalyst for price volatility. According to data source Skew, the options market has exploded in the past 12 months, with the open interest rising from $50 million to over $10 billion.      Options market makers are individuals or entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. They make sure there is enough depth in the order book by offering to buy or sell a call/put option contract at any given point in time.      For example, if a trader wants to buy a bitcoin call at the strike of $80,000 right now, and there is no matching sell order, the market maker will step in to sell the $80,000 call, facilitating the transaction. A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, called expiry. A put option gives the right to sell.      Thus, market makers always take the opposite side of investors' trades and maintain a market-neutral portfolio by buying and selling the underlying asset as the price swings. This act of balancing books is known as ""gamma hedging"" in options parlance.      Gamma refers to the speed of change in delta - sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. In other words, gamma measures the rate of change in the option's price relative to changes in the spot market prices.      Holding a long put position is considered a long (positive) gamma trade, as the option starts gaining value at a faster rate with the drop in the price of the underlying asset, thereby making money for the buyer and producing a loss for the seller (holder of short gamma position).      According to Collins, market makers were short gamma (sellers of puts) at $52,000-$50,000 on Wednesday. As bitcoin started falling, the negative gamma exposure became a pain: Puts sold at the aforementioned strikes began gaining value, signaling losses for the market makers. Thus, market makers responded by selling bitcoin in the spot/futures market.      Data provided by Collins shows estimated dealer inventory fell by 2,900 BTC during bitcoin's price slide. The inventory estimate represents the number of bitcoin shorted in the spot and futures market. (One BTC futures contract represents one coin on major exchanges. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s contract size is 5.)      Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of options analytics platform Genesis Volatility, agreed with Collins' theory, stating in a Telegram chat that many traders were holding long put positions or bearish bets at $50,000 and $48,000.      The theory can be debated on the grounds that the sale of 2,900 BTC worth $145 million at the current price around $50,000 is too small a trade to have a sizable bearish impact on the cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.      Nevertheless, the fact that traders and analysts are starting to assess the cryptocurrency options market makers' hedging activity reflects the derivatives segment's growing relevance in the bitcoin market.

Announced Friday, Anchorage, the first crypto custodian to win a U.S. federal banking charter, is adding support for DeFi tokens 1INCH, BNT, Curve Finance (CRV), REN and SushiSwap (SUSHI).      DeFi investment has grown at an explosive rate with the equivalent of more than $85 billion USD currently locked across Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem at the time of writing. Anchorage pointed out in a blog post that the DeFi universe had grown by more than nine times in value since Anchorage added support for Uniswap, Yearn and others late last year.      “In broad strokes, this is all based on client demand for these tokens,” Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley said in an interview, adding:    “Sometimes it even surprises me how sophisticated people are and how much they're wanting to go into this. We do custody for the Bitwise DeFi Index, for example, and traditional hedge funds are coming in and wanting to buy these tokens and even to use these networks.”  Read more: DeFi Index Fund Is Bitwise’s Fastest Grower, With $32.5M in 2 Weeks: Hougan    Plus, the fast-moving experimental nature of DeFi means a firm like Anchorage has to do some serious tire-kicking before adding a project, McCauley said.      “In order to support these assets is to run them through a pretty comprehensive due-diligence asset support framework,” McCauley said. “It’s a condition of us having (a) federal bank charter.”",POSITIVE,없음,1INCH | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/14/cryptocurrency-custodian-anchorage-adds-five-more-defi-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e96e8d62c40180a34e4068afdfd7e4fd24ffa59-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The two firms said Friday they are now working with the CCA to develop a new working group to promote the accord’s objectives, while also working to increase transparency around energy sourcing by crypto mining operations.      The CCA is a private sector-led initiative that sets out to reduce overall emissions in cryptocurrency mining, which has become a cause for concern for some high-profile investors such as Elon Musk. The organization is encouraging the industry to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.      “The Crypto Climate Accord helps lay the groundwork for real, tangible action to address Bitcoin mining’s impact on the environment, and we are both eager and determined to ensure that Supporters and Signatories remain committed to the group’s goals,” Argo Blockchain CEO Peter Wall said.      Argo and DMG said it’s estimated that crypto mining worldwide accounts for up to 0.5% of global power usage, though they did not provide a source for the data.      The two firms are already working on environmental initiatives, having signed an agreement in March to launch a bitcoin mining pool that would be completely powered by clean energy.

42406410,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeu7i4,1620997650,Record ‘Grayscale Discount’ Might Mean Bargain Bitcoin for Retail Traders,"A closely tracked ratio in cryptocurrency markets known as the ""Grayscale premium"" flipped earlier this year to a discount, and it has widened this week to a gaping 21%, which is the highest level on record, according to Skew, a crypto analysis firm.      For retail traders, or anyone with access to a brokerage account, the growing disparity might present an opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap, analysts say.      The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), from the crypto asset manager Grayscale, is the largest U.S. investment vehicle for buying bitcoin (BTC) through a stock exchange. The Grayscale discount represents the difference between the price of the underlying bitcoin assets and the value that's implied from the price of the trust's shares. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.)      The bet some traders could be making now is that the discount would evaporate if Grayscale receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the trust to an exchage-traded fund. If that happened, according to one analyst, the shares might quickly climb back toward the price of the underlying bitcoin – allowing traders to recapture the discount as a profit while still booking any gains from the cryptocurrency itself.      “Investors looking for long-term passive bitcoin exposure are probably better off buying GBTC over spot bitcoin since you get paid to wait more via the discount than you pay in excess fees,” David Grider, strategist at investment research firm FundStrat, wrote in an email.      In recent years, when GBTC was trading at a premium, the situation looked much different.      Accredited investors – usually big institutional players or wealthy people – could profit from buying into GBTC at the trust's net asset value (NAV). They were subject to a lockup period of six months, but after that, they could then sell their shares for a profit in the open market to lock in any gains from bitcoin and capture the premium as an extra kicker. The 20%-50% GBTC premium also could offset the risk from any potential declines in bitcoin’s price.      But that ""Grayscale trade"" wasn't available to retail traders.      Then in March, as bitcoin's 2021 rally stalled and more competition arrived from bitcoin ETFs in Canada, Switzerland and elsewhere, GBTC began trading at a discount to its net asset value, a disincentive for new institutional buyers. Another deterrent was the 2% annual fee.      “Much of the discount has been the result of investors expecting a U.S.-listed bitcoin ETF in the near future after the approval of several in Canada,” Grider wrote.      Grider’s view assumes Grayscale is successful in converting the trust into an ETF, which is far from assured. There's a risk that the SEC might not approve any bitcoin ETFs or that Grayscale's proposal might not be approved as soon as competing investment vehicles are.      But now that Grayscale is “100% committed to converting GBTC into an ETF,” market confidence could return and potentially unlock roughly $5 billion worth of GBTC shares in the coming months, according to Grider.      These unlocked GBTC shares will be available to retail traders at a discount.      “Investors who own GBTC could see their shares converge towards NAV,” Grayscale wrote in an email.      Another short-term or medium-term risk is that the GBTC discount widens from current levels.      “For traders, I wouldn’t be surprised if the gap widens over the next few weeks as a big chunk of new supply comes to the market, but the overhang should start to clear up heading into Q3,” Grider wrote.      Digital Currency Group authorized the purchase of up to $750 million worth of shares of GBTC on May 3. Repurchasing shares is a common tool used by companies seeking to increase the price of those shares by simultaneously creating demand while decreasing the number of shares outstanding.

Such loss of confidence could see more consumers “locked into private money”, he said, citing stablecoins launched by Big Tech platforms as an example. These are likely “to have greater functionality and lower transaction costs than the current commercial bank digital money offering and could quickly attract a large number of users.”      Thus far the central bank has only published a discussion paper and announced a taskforce to explore a CBDC, so the comments are perhaps notable as a sign of intent.      In other news, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, has warned again about investing in crypto assets, soon after bitcoin’s price took a sharp dip under $50,000.      Also read: Former CFTC Boss’ Digital Dollar Project Ready to Kick Off First US CBDC Tests      Speaking at a Bank of England citizens’ panel event Thursday, Bailey spoke of the “warning sign” of people looking for investment opportunities in crypto.      “You’ve probably seen all the stories about the price of bitcoin, share prices in the U.S. suddenly rocketing up for companies that nobody quite knows what they do,” he said.      “Buy it if you want, but it has no intrinsic value,” Bailey concluded, echoing his comments of a week ago when he told a press conference that crypto investors should be prepared to lose all their money.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/14/bank-of-england-official-its-probable-uk-will-launch-a-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a93c4e4d625b5bc31c123012d0adf88ea0834df0-1500x861.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move will provide 1inch users access to several Polygon-based liquidity sources that initially include Curve, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Aave V2, and Cometh. More protocols will be added in time, the company said in a press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.      Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Polygon facilitate faster and cheaper transactions by running parallel networks, or sidechains, alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. Polygon is becoming more popular, with DeFi giants like Aave integrating with the network to bypass Ethereum's high gas fees – the cost of using its network.      Polygon aims to help Ethereum ""keep up with the competition"" as it moves to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, 1inch said. Polygon is said to offer a high throughput of around 7,000 transactions per second.      The decision to integrate with Polygon comes in the wake of increased user demand, according to 1inch.      ""After the 1inch Network's expansion to Binance Smart Chain, there was a massive request from the community to make Polygon also available for swapping via 1inch,"" said Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch Network. ""Currently, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is already deployed on Polygon, while the 1inch Liquidity Protocol and the 1inch Governance Protocol are expected to expand over to Polygon in the upcoming few weeks.""      Also read: DeFi Major Aave Working With Polygon to Bypass Ethereum Congestion      Polygon runs a bridge connecting its blockchain with Ethereum to facilitate easy transfer of assets between the two blockchains. Thus, traders accessing 1inch via Polygon can transfer their digital assets between the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Polygon also has a dedicated wallet where users can store their assets.      Per data source Messari, Polygon is the biggest layer 2 scaling protocol currently, with a near $6 billion market capitalization. Meanwhile, 1inch is the leading DEX aggregator across smart contract blockchains, according to DeBank.      Prices for Polygon's MATIC token were up 41% over the past 24 hours, for a market capitalization of $7.2 billion, according to Messari. 1inch's 1INCH token gained 13%, for a market value of $977 million.",POSITIVE,MATIC,1INCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/14/decentralized-exchange-aggregator-1inch-network-expands-to-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19d96abc4ac25e383e489c2199cf24452079600e-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a Twitter comment by Musk on Thursday evening, Tesla and its CEO are ""working with Doge"" developers to ""improve system transaction efficiency.""      Prices across major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini and Poloniex are posting around 22% gains over a 24-hour period for the Shibu Inu-inspired meme coin. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands for around $0.48. The increase came even as other major cryptocurrencies' prices sank.      Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would be adding DOGE to its suite of crypto offerings in six to eight weeks, likely due to client demand as has been the case with other major exchanges.      The world's second-richest man has played a large role in DOGE's astronomical 9,400% rise in value since it was just a pup trading at around $0.005 on Jan. 1.      Musk's handiwork has previously affected DOGE's price. Last month, Tesla's CEO hinted the Shibu Inu-inspired crypto would feature on ""Saturday Night Live,"" with Musk calling himself the ""Dogefather."" Prices immediately spiked on the tip, jumping 24% from $0.25 to $0.31.      DOGE's price continued to soar leading up to Musk's appearance on the show, touching an all-time high of around $0.74, but immediately cooled after traders' hopes were dashed by Musk's meager mention of the crypto that night.      See also: Coinbase to Add Dogecoin in the Next 6-8 Weeks      The problem, some argue, is that DOGE is unlikely to survive without Musk's help, though developers appear to be making headway in a project that once had zero involvement from crypto technicians.
