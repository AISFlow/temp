42424977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJHh,1372084056,Bitcoins seized by Drug Enforcement Agency,"The US Drug Enforcement Administration has posted an official notice stating that it seized bitcoins from an individual for purchasing a controlled substance. According to Let's Talk Bitcoin, this may, in fact, be the first time a law enforcement agency has seized bitcoins.  The DEA notice shows that, among many other people, a Mr. Eric Daniel Hughes (AKA Casey Jones) had 11.02BTC, with a value of $814.22 USD, on April 12th, earlier this year. The digital money was taken in forfeiture as the individual was in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq.), in the district of South Carolina.  The notice is a general release, detailing all of the forfeitures by US citizens in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, of which Mr Hughes is one of many. As such, there are no details in the notice as to how the bitcoins were actually seized.  However, Let's Talk Bitcoin say:  There is no indication the Bitcoin protocol was compromised. ‘“Seizure” is probably a word used to imply that money was received in the process of a Silk Road sting operation, rather than actually seized from the bitcoin user’s wallet. ” said Andreas M. Antonopoulos, a security expert and Let’s Talk Bitcoin contributor.  The bitcoin address referenced in the notice, 1ETDwGUC1QcjYuehFr3u1FD3MvDaUs7SFy, can be seen on the blockchain receiving 11.02 BTC on April 12th 2013, which matches the DEA notice.  The blockchain also shows the same bitcoin address that paid the 11.02 BTC had remaining funds of 33.580606 BTC that were transferred into a change address. Mr Hughes then went onto spend another 1.7 BTC on the same day.  The receiving address, cited in the DEA notice, transferred the 11.02 BTC out five days later, and on the 22nd of May received a further 17.24 BTC, which was then sent onto another address which was subsequently combined into a 200 BTC block, effectively anonymizing further transactions.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/24/bitcoins-seized-by-drug-enforcement-agency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b6bf960d5a90a5b73513a569420e5853ff5d4ca-300x151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJ3h,1372078898,Bitcoin crowdfunding sites find funding difficult,"Could bitcoin be a suitable vehicle for crowdfunding? Over the past couple of years, crowdsourced funding projects have bloomed, but most of them still require contributions in fiat currencies. Now, however, some sites are emerging designed to help people attract bitcoin-based funding from a broad community of donors.  Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGogo have become a popular means of funding for a range of projects, from manufacturing through to content production. According to market analyst Massolution, crowdfunding platforms raised $2.7 billion in 2012, 81% up on the year before. It predicts just under double that amount will be raised this year.  But regulators are still writing the rules for crowdfunding. At present, companies are not allowed to give away equity to investors as part of a crowdfunding project. Instead, projects must be funded via preorders for a product or service, or simply through patronage, which limits the concept’s potential.  The US passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act last year, but left the SEC to sort out the details in a process which is still ongoing. Up in Canada, little has been done to understand or articulate any regulations for crowdfunding.  But bitcoin isn't a currency, as such. Only businesses that exchange it for fiat currency are regulated as money transmitters. There are some businesses operating what amount to equity-based crowdfunding in the bitcoin domain. Generally, they call themselves bitcoin stock exchanges.  BTC Trading Corp.  is one such entity. It enables people to offer equity in their online ventures, but covers itself by pasting the site with disclaimers. ""Nothing is verified. Everything is virtual,"" says one. It says that assets on the site are not to be considered real, and that everything is for educational and entertainment purposes only. Another, BitFunder, also enables people to sell shares, in exchange for a fee ranging between 0.5% and 1%. It lists the assets available on its site, including well-known online ventures such as ASICminer, which is building its own ASIC mining equipment to generate bitcoins.  The ASICminer shares, however, are 'pass-through' shares, which are essentially shares purchased from someone who already bought real shares in the company. This happened because ASICminer stopped selling real shares after the first equity-based crowdfunding platform it used, called the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, closed down. This shows how shaky the concept of equity crowdfunding/bitcoin IPOs can be.  There are now some sites emerging that focus on patronage or preorder models, rather than equity. But, given the proliferation of fiat-based crowdfunding sites, why bother? The first reason is lower fees, says a representative from CoinFunder, one bitcoin-based crowdfunding site.  However, CoinFunder has yet to make a dent in the crowdfunding space. ""Thus far, we have not had one successful crowdfunding project,"" said its spokesperson, by email. Indeed, its front-page project was a crowdfunding project to help convince a US mail order subscription firm to accept bitcoins.  ""We don't have any current plans to support bitcoin for crowdfunding campaigns,"" said Lou Doctor, CEO of Crowd Supply, a crowdfunding site that includes its own fulfillment service for projects involving physical goods. ""We've discussed it a couple of times but didn't feel like the time was right and that it was likely to add confusion to an area that has a considerable learning curve already.""  Still, some are experiencing more success. Bitcoinstarter, launched April 1, saw its first project fully funded this week, with 10 other projects partially funded to date. 60 bitcoins have been pledged so far, said founder Matt Allen.  Allen is hoping that the Bitcoin community will look after its own. ""I think the Bitcoin community rallies behind bitcoin-related projects much more easily, which of course helps new websites gain momentum fairly quickly,"" he says. ""One aspect that works to our advantage is everyone has a project they're working on with bitcoins.""  That said, the biggest hurdle – beyond finding people interested in pledging bitcoins – is the quality of projects, he complains. Kickstarter has a critical mass of quality projects funded in fiat currency, but it is harder to find decent projects in the rarefied Bitcoin world.  ""With some of the projects we've received, project creators tend to leave it behind for us to help market it for them,"" he says.  Some projects are well-managed, but controversial. One such crowdfunding initiative is DEFCAD, which is designing a search engine for 3D printable models. DEFCAD, which tried to host CAD models of 3D printable weapon parts, had its files removed by the US Department of Defense. The search engine will make it possible to find models on the Internet, minimizing the risk of takedowns, the project's organizers say.  “We try to be agnostic to projects as long it doesn’t put us in legal harm,” says Allen. “All projects are given a fair look.”  He had to make a choice when Defcad approached him, he adds. “We decided there is no reason why we wouldn’t want to support such a cause.”  While most of the projects on bitcoin 'stock exchange' sites seem to be variations on mining initiatives, projects on patronage or preorder sites a more varied. Bitcoinstarter includes projects to distribute free IT equipment too poverty-stricken areas, and a bitcoin anonymizing service. Then, there are the wildly ambitious. Someone wants to buy a private island in Canada and make a ""resort for bitcoin"". Nobody had pledged towards the 1222 BTC goal so far, at the time of writing. Go figure.  In fact, the proportion of projects on the Bitcoinstarter site that has not yet received funding is depressingly large. This will partly be down to the number of visitors to the website, which in turn will be a function of the project owners' own marketing. If there is one piece of conventional wisdom in the still-nascent crowdfunding space it's this: if you are going to crowdfund a project, you must put in the work to build a community around it first. That is something that the likes of Allen can’t easily do for project owners.  Nevertheless, he can at least give people the tools. Bitcoinstarter is working on a new feature: an API using Reddit’s bitcoin tip bot for crowdfunding. This will enable Reddit users to fund each other's projects in bitcoins.  Crowdfunding in bitcoin has a long way to go, and for a long time to come, fiat currency crowdfunding sites will dominate the space. Selling equity for bitcoin is entirely doable, but fraught with potential fraud issues. People wanting to source money from the community have a long and rocky road to travel.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/24/bitcoin-crowdfunding-sites-find-funding-difficult,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4106c9ba56feaf32114b06c26aaee0edeb6a5aa-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXIzh,1372074004,"CoinJar Q&A: ""Bitcoin represents the power of choice""","Asher Tan tells us what makes his company – CoinJar – different to other bitcoin wallets and what he believes is the biggest challenge for the digital currency.  CD: Why did you decide to set up CoinJar?  AT: I've been working on startup projects for about a year. As much as I would like to take credit for forming the CoinJar team, it really formed itself. All three members were keen to work with each other in one way or another, and bitcoin was the common denominator among us.  Getting accepted in the AngelCube venture accelerator program gave us a great reason to leave our former jobs and undertake this project.  CD: What makes CoinJar different from other bitcoin wallets?  AT: In terms of usability I think we rank highly, we're probably the best looking wallet around. In addition, being an Australian solution also sets us apart quickly in terms of regional service.  CD: What are your security measures?  AT: Industry standards: The site runs over SSL certificates, hashed passwords, offline (cold) storage, etc. Having been in sticky situations in the past, our team is incredibly cautious (perhaps borderline paranoid) about security.  CD: Do you have an app?  AT: We have an iPhone app that's coming out soon, followed by Android app soon after. Usability and good design is currently on lacking mobile bitcoin wallets. We are making some inroads into accessible UX.  CD: How many users do you currently have?  AT: We've only been in operation for a month with minimal advertising – at this moment we have over 300 users.  CD: What is bitcoin uptake like in Australia?  AT: Bitcoin interest among retailers has been tepid, however enthusiasm among the community is very high.  There are bitcoin Meetup groups in all major Australian cities right now and interest is growing daily. CoinJar believes retailers will quickly adapt once they see bitcoin as a viable means to increase sales.  I think bitcoin represents the power of choice, where people have the ability to transact in alternative medium. Choice is good.  CD: What do you see as being the biggest challenge for bitcoin at the moment?  AT: While bitcoin is technologically fundamentally solid, we've been studying what it means in terms of implied cultural identity.  All currency operates on some cultural pretext, and I think bitcoin users are still discovering what it means to use a decentralized currency. We've been chatting with an anthropologist in the UK to try and get a better understanding of this.  CD: What next for CoinJar?  AT: We're looking to be the market leader in the Australia, followed by expansion into other countries.  Have you used CoinJar? If so, let us know what you think of it.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/06/24/coinjar-qa-bitcoin-represents-the-power-of-choice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7214f997d6b63cdd0e1dabe38d83882c95982bc1-1024x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
