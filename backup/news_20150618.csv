42398425,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTUyu,1434670811,Canadian Senate Panel Calls for 'Light Touch' Bitcoin Regulation,"A long-anticipated report published by the Canadian Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has called for a ""regulatory light touch"" on bitcoin and digital currencies.  The report, entitled ""Digital Currency: You Can't Flip This Coin!"", comes after a months-long review that included a number of hearings before the Senate committee, and will undoubtedly play a role in how the Canadian government shapes future regulation.  The committee recommended that the government look for ways to utilize digital currencies and blockchain technology, deeming the technology ""ingenious"" and capable of potentially meeting critical needs in both the financial sector and the unbanked in the world.  The report stated:  ""The federal government [should], in considering any legislation, regulation and policies, create an environment that fosters innovation for digital currencies and their associated technologies. As such, the government should exercise a regulatory “light touch” that minimizes actions that might stifle the development of these new technologies.""  The committee also recommended that the government work with other countries on regulatory frameworks that offer a balanced approach to oversight, provide publicly available information on the legal and tax implications of digital currencies, and conduct further reviews of the study's findings over the next three years.  Notably, the committee recommended that Canadian digital currency exchanges be subject to money transmission regulations, but that companies that solely offer wallet services in Canada should not fall under that classification.  The report cited money laundering, terrorist financing and price volatility as ""serious obstacles"" for the government as digital currency regulation is considered.

42398429,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTV0s,1434664013,Judge Rules in Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin Lending Lawsuit,"A US judge has ruled that a Kentucky man must repay a loan he originally solicited in bitcoin.  Judge Frank Fletcher  of the Breathitt County District Court, in an order signed 5th June, stated that Dennis Kerley must repay $67,591 on a loan he had received in bitcoin via the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform BTCJam.  The loan, dating back to December 2013, fell into default within a few months of receipt. The plaintiff in the case, Daniel Kaminski de Souza, loaned Kerley 11.95 BTC, worth just over $10,000 at the time it was solicited.  The case is perhaps suggestive of how US judges who lack a general understanding of bitcoin consider cases, even providing a degree of precedent for future cases involving P2P loans denominated in bitcoin, according to lawyer Kevin Palley, who represented de Souza in the case.  Palley told CoinDesk:  “The judge did not understand what bitcoin was, and this is a small county in rural Kentucky. So he asked anybody in the courtroom if they knew about it and one or two people raised their hands.”  Palley said that he went on to treat bitcoin as a kind of highly speculative foreign currency, a explanation that was ultimately accepted by the court.  Kerley, according to Palley, did make an appearance during the 5th June hearing, and though Kerley responded to the initial lawsuit, Palley successfully petitioned the court to deem that reply a non-response to the specific claims in the suit.  Kerley could not be reached for comment for this report.  Mining loan  In December 2013, Kerley sought funding to buy bitcoin mining equipment from Bitmine, a Swiss company that ultimately went bankrupt amid accusations of fraud.  Kerley said that he intended to buy a 1 TH/s bitcoin miner, as well as a 400 GH/s unit if enough funds were available. In the loan description, he wrote that he planned to generate as much as 0.76 BTC per day.  Kerley added that he was offering an interest rate of 20%, explaining:  “I realize there is some speculation and risk with this investment. But, as I am and have been actively mining bitcoins for more than a year, I believe this is a sound investment and worth the risk.”  Issues emerge  According to the user comments on to the BTCJam loan page, payment issues began shortly after solicitation was complete.  De Souza asked about the status of payment on 6th February of last year, and Kerley replied that the issue stemmed from shipping problems and damages to the miners he received.  ""I have over half the payment ready to send and will have it all in a couple of days. I will then make the payment and bring my loan to current,"" Kerley wrote. ""From this point forward there will be not more late payments and I will actually be paying the loan of early.""  Two weeks later, when asked for an update, Kerley wrote:  ""I have mined 2.3 BTC but can not make a partial payment on the loan dues to the BTCJam system design. I will soon have the coin to pay the late payment and will soon be at full capacity before the next payment is due.""  That message, dated 22nd February, was the last Kerley would post on that page.  Just over two months later, de Souza wrote that he had received notification that the loan would enter arbitration for nonpayment.  Relief sought  When borrowers agree to use BTCJam, they enter into an agreement that states: ""The arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding and judgment may be entered thereon.""  Arbitration services are provided to BTCJam users by a company called net-ARB. According to an arbitration award document provided to CoinDesk, de Souza was granted an award for 64.74381250 BTC following 91 days of nonpayment.  Following the arbitration award, de Souza told CoinDesk, he hired Palley, who subsequently reached out to Kerley to seek redress for the defaulted loan. In a response letter, Kerley requested information regarding the amount he allegedly owed, as well as verification of Palley's credentials.  In March 2015, Palley formally filed suit against Kerley on behalf of de Souza, seeking either an enforcement of the arbitration agreement or relief for breach of contract.  The complaint read:  ""Plaintiff has suffered damages due to Defendant’s failure to honor its contract and Plaintiff requests damages for breach of contract in the amount of $30,723.53 as of September 3, 2014, pre-judgment interest in the amount of $17.07 per day as of September 3, 2014, court costs, fees and post-judgment interest.""  Two months later, Judge Fletcher found in favor of de Souza.  Next steps  According to Palley, the next phase in the suit against Kerley involves seeking repayment on the loan, a process he suggested could pose additional challenges.  ""The hard part is going to be the collecting,"" he explained. ""So what I’ll have to do is do an asset search and see if there’s anything to collect. Getting a judgement is easier than collecting, and [de Souza] understands it could be some time.""  De Souza said one current issue is identifying financial institutions used by Kerley in Kentucky, a process he claimed has been hindered by a lack of information from BTCJam.  ""A measure [Palley] will have to take now is to send a garnishment letter to every bank in the Breathitt county because we don't know in which bank and agency the debtor has an account,"" he said.  When reached for comment, BTCJam told CoinDesk that it was supportive of the outcome of the suit, calling it a successful example of the settlement process it has in place.  The company noted that it was bound by the law to provide sensitive information only through legal processes, but would be happy to do so through the courts if requested.

42398430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTV1r,1434661052,GAW Miners Absent in Ongoing Mississippi Court Case,"UPDATE (19th June 21:00 BST): This report has been updated with comment from Mississippi Power Company.      A utility firm in Mississippi is seeking a default judgment against cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners months after filing suit for breach of contract.  Mississippi Power Company  (MPC) said in a 17th April filing submitted to the US District Court of Southern Mississippi that it was entitled to a default judgment in its favor owing to a lack of response from GAW.  MPC is seeking $346,647.29 in damages plus interest. MPC began offering services to GAW in October of last year, providing electricity to its Mississippi-based data center.  The company, which is being represented by Gulfport-based law firm Balch & Bingham LLP, filed suit in April, seeking to recoup hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid power bills.  The filing stated:  ""Defendant, GAW Miners, LLC, has failed to answer or otherwise defend as to plaintiff’s complaint, or serve upon the undersigned attorney of record for plaintiff a copy of any answer or other defense which it might have.""  According to court documents, a individual named Lester Briney was served on GAW's behalf on 11th May, just over a month after the initial suit was filed. In an April post on the now-defunct forum HashTalk, GAW CEO Josh Garza said that the suit stemmed from “a dispute over the fee structure”.  If the court does grant its request for default judgement, it remains unclear how MPC might go about recouping the funds. GAW is effectively defunct following months of staff exits, service shutdowns and the release of thousands of emails that detailed the company's inner workings.  Reports also suggest that former customers and investors are in the process of pursuing a group civil action to recover losses. The number of litigants involved in that potential case could be as high as 500, according to those involved.  After the publication of this article, a representative for MPC provided the following statement:  “Mississippi Power filed a motion for default judgment because GAW failed to answer or otherwise defend the lawsuit. We are asking the court to give us a final judgment on the amount that's owed on this account.”  Neither Garza nor Balch & Bingham responded to requests for comment by press time.

42398445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTVAi,1434654925,Is Greece Really Behind Bitcoin's Latest Price Surge?,"After months of relative calm, the price of bitcoin broke out this week, spiking to a high of $257 on 17th June.  Of particular focus for many observers was the speed at which the market made its gains, with most of the run occurring between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC on 16th June. Though such volatility is by no means uncommon in the bitcoin market, the wider community quickly sought to correlate the market movement to larger trends.  One of the most prominent theories that emerged was related to the market's timing, which roughly coincided with growing indications that Greece will likely default on its debt obligations. Nicknamed the ""Grexit"", some believe the default could result in Greece leaving the eurozone, even as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders strive to downplay such speculation.  The narrative is not a new one for the bitcoin market, given that, as an asset class, digital currencies are one of the few that can act as a hedge against fiat currency fluctuation. For example, many in the bitcoin community have correlated the rising interest in bitcoin in 2013 with economic issues in Cyprus.  As CEO of bitcoin-to-gold exchange Vaultoro Joshua Scigala admits, while mostly psychological, the connection is still powerful given that the market that moves on sentiment.  Scigala told CoinDesk:  ""It's this sort of rallying point. Like when Cyprus was happening, it's not that everyone in Cyprus was buying, it's that everyone was going, 'Whoa look, Cyprus is in trouble and we see the value proposition of something like bitcoin or private assets in general.'""  Nonetheless, the connection was seized upon by the press, with an early and prominent piece from Reuters contributing to the wider discussion.  But as UK Digital Currency Association board member Paul Gordon points out, while a convenient narrative, there remains little evidence to suggest the timing is anything but coincidental or that activity in Greece is actually at the root of the movement.  ""It's nice to say that the Grexit is happening and the price has gone up, sure. But, we could've gone down,"" Gordon told CoinDesk.  Still, the larger question that has emerged is whether the price increase will mark an end to the downtrend that has persisted since bitcoin's all-time high in 2013.  As indicated in interviews, most say it's too early to tell whether the latest price movement is the sound of a sleeping giant awakening or simply a loud snort in a still-deep slumber.  Links to Grexit scarce  As for whether any real-world metrics can support the notion that Greek citizens may be turning to bitcoin, Scigala seems to be among the few business owners that seems to have found evidence of the conclusion.  Vaultoro, he said, has recently seen a 124% increase in visitors with Greek IP addresses, compared to 64% growth in Europe and 83% in Asia.  ""Greece stood out at 124% growth because it’s a smaller country and we don’t do any direct marketing in Greece,"" he continued. At the same time, Vaultoro saw 66% and 62% increases from Germany and Spain, respectively.  However, because Vaultoro ultimately allows its clients to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange between fiat currency and gold, Scigala clarified that any uptick in Greek users on his service was unlikely to affect price.  Other digital currency industry business owners, including European exchange providers such as LocalBitcoins and Kraken, reported no changes in their incoming IP traffic from Greece.  ""I can’t see any notable increase in new registered users from Greece apart from normal growth,"" LocalBitcoins community manager Max Edin told CoinDesk. ""Overall trade in EUR is up a bit this past week, but still within the regular growth trend we see.""  Further, Edin sought to downplay the idea that activity in Greece on its exchange was notable enough to spur price movement.  ""Trade volume from Greece is such a small part of our overall volume that it can’t have an effect on the market price,"" he added.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell supported this conclusion, stating that he has found no figures from his exchange that suggest interest from Greece is on the rise. Additionally, he found no increases in account funding or trading volume due to the activity of Greece-based clients.  ""It's really hard to know how much actual bitcoin movement in Greece is driving activity and how much of it is just outside speculation,"" Powell continued.  Historical difference  Despite the figures, the idea that Greece may be a prevailing psychological factor in this current trading cycle still holds sway on some traders, including Crypto Currency Fund manager Timothy Enneking.  ""It's not 100% that this price move is due to Greece, but I'd say that 95% it is,"" Enneking said.  Enneking believes that this might actually be a bearish comparison for the market due to his conclusion that all gains from bitcoin's Cyprus bump were eventually erased. To this point, he noted how it would be unlikely for bitcoin to become anything but a short-term solution to local issues with fiat currencies.  ""Greeks aren't going to buy bitcoin because they have long-term faith in bitcoin. That means they're going to sell their bitcoin. They're not sudden bitcoin converts, capital controls are only temporary,"" he cautioned.  Powell, however, believes there could be consequences in drawing attention to a false correlation between Greece and the price of bitcoin, namely that, without any inciting incident, he suggested the spike in market activity might subside.  ""If it turns out that the price movement is purely speculative and there isn't any real underlying interest materializing in Greece, the increase might not be sustained,"" Powell said.  Others, like Whale Club community leader BTCVIX, suggested that this time around, much of the attention to the price was perhaps a construction of those with vested interests in the technology.  ""To be frank this is just a news story in excuse of price action movement, I see no reason that this event specially increases demand for BTC in that region but hey if it gets BTC price action news hype going might as well get on the bandwagon,"" he told CoinDesk.  Long-term reversal  This isn't to say that the latest movement in price isn't significant for traders.  Whether or not the price falls back eventually, there is at least some sentiment that the market might have found a stable bottom from which it can build. Such an opinion was expressed by Enneking, who indicated that he believes that the continued stability of bitcoin might have played a role in the price increase.  ""It had been stable so long, it might have been time to move up and Greece may have had a small psychological effect,"" he suggested.  BTC.sx co-founder George Samman indicated that this might have been the case as well, suggesting some traders might have been feeling a bout of ""selling fatigue"", as evidenced by what he called a recent drop in exchange liquidity.  Enneking estimated the shallow orders books at major exchanges have created a scenario where as little as 10,000 BTC in buys could have caused the increase. Should the market have been affected by a small amount of large trading, however, he suggested the price would likely return to previous levels, erasing recent gains.  BTCVIX indicated he would be looking for more consolidation around current levels as a precursor to any spring or summer rally.  ""The bitcoin market is heavily driven by sentiment and technicals so Grexit plus price breaking above key levels has been enough to get people's attention, now the question is, 'Is this a countertrend rally or the start of a new trend?'"" Samman asked, adding:  ""That's a wait-and-see question.""

First announced in fall 2014, the Case wallet became available for pre-order this May, with shipment of the first 1,000 units expected to be completed this summer. The product promises various security features including multisig and biometric authentication technology.  In a statement, CEO Melanie Shapiro suggested that Case's funding may coincide with a broadening of its ambitions beyond the consumer market. Notably, Shapiro addressed the recent interest of major financial incumbents such as Nasdaq in bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology.  She said:  ""Case is poised to provide trusted, decentralized and biometrically secure signing of those and similar transactions.""  The funding also marks the latest bitcoin play by increasingly active VC firms Future\Perfect Ventures and RRE Ventures.  Future\Perfect and RRE have funded a number of notable digital currency industry startups within the last year, including Blockchain, Blockstream and BitPesa, Gem, Mirror and Ripple Labs.

BitBay  , Cryptoins.com, bitmarket24pl and Bitmarket.pl confirmed that the regional payments processors they work with – CashBill and BlueMedia – had informed them that their accounts were being closed at the request of their own partner banks.  Bitmarket.pl told CoinDesk that PKO Bank Polski had also informed them that their bank accounts were being closed.  Representatives from CashBill and BlueMedia confirmed that the closures had taken place. A spokesperson for CashBill, who declined to provide specifics, told CoinDesk that the company had been informed by ""various banks"" in Poland that continued work with bitcoin exchanges ""will result in termination of our services in those banks"".  The spokesperson continued:  ""Our aim is to provide 100% payment channel coverage of for all our customers. This has forced us to immediately terminate our operations with all bitcoin exchanges.""  BlueMedia  declined to comment on the specifics, but noted ""in general, we always warmly welcome such initiatives based on technologies and innovation. However, security always comes first. Our decision was made exclusively based on fraud risk and assessment"".  Fraud cited  When reached for comment, PKO Bank Polski representative Michal Tkaczuk declined to comment on the account closures, calling it ""a subject of bank secrecy"".  Tkaczuk provided the following statement:  ""In our opinion virtual currency markets are poorly regulated. Client identification and procedures use by bitcoin exchange platforms are inadequate and raise legal doubts. Taking this into account, PKO Bank Polski acts to prevent suspicious transactions.""  Notably, the CashBill representative suggested that the company had an interest in bitcoin, but that the legal liabilities represent too great a risk.  ""We would gladly add bitcoin payments to our payment channel portfolio, but sadly bitcoin is not currently regulated in any way by Polish law and doing so would constitute a legal risk for our operation,"" concluded the spokesperson, adding that the change in policy ""left us puzzled"".  Sudden notice  At least one of the exchanges indicated that the shutoff was a surprise, with a representative for Cryptoins.com telling CoinDesk that CashBill had terminated its contract ""without prior notice"".  Mariusz Sperczyński, a spokesperson for Bitmarket.pl, said that its bank, PKO Bank Polski, had decided to terminate accounts with the exchange, a loss that occurred as its BlueMedia account was also suspended.  Bitmarket.pl previously had its bank account suspended by Bank BPH in January this year. Sperczyński said that the impact of the latest closures was minimal.  The impact on BitMarket24.pl appears to have been more significant. A spokesperson told CoinDesk that its revenues had fallen sharply owing to the fact that 95% of its payments were previously channeled through CashBill.  Justyna Laskowska Witek, a marketing specialist at BitBay, said CashBill informed them earlier this week that it had received instructions from its bank partner to terminate its agreement with the digital currency exchange.    Since CashBill terminated its contract, Witek said that BitBay's daily trading volume – previously 1000 BTC on an average day – had decreased.

Its head of research and development will discuss applications of the technology at Consensus 2015.  Twenty billion dollars a year – that's how much banks could save on cross-border payments, compliance and securities trading if they used blockchain tech to move money and assets around the world, according to a report co-written by Spanish megabank Santander published last month.  Julio Faura is one of the Santander executives playing a crucial role in making that massive cost-saving a reality. He commissioned a report on bitcoin and banks last August, making waves because it was one of the first public instances of a big bank investigating the bitcoin space.  Faura is director of research and development at Santander, where he leads its efforts in innovation. He also works on the bank's M&A deals and contributes to its venture-investing work in the fintech space.  Faura knows high-tech and high-finance equally well. He started his career as a chip designer at semiconductor manufacturer SIDSA. He then moved on to consult for McKinsey, focusing on financial institutions in Spain, Europe and Latin America.  Faura landed at Santander in 2007 where he took on key roles in consumer finance, investment banking and technology and operations. As head of innovation at Santander now, Faura focuses on cryptocurrencies, mobile payments and e-commerce.  Santander is the world's tenth largest bank, according to Forbes' annual ranking, and it's the largest bank in the Eurozone by market capitalisation.  Although Santander remains coy about its exact involvement with blockchain technology, Faura told Business Insider recently that the bank has a team working on the technology internally and that international payments is one area where blockchain tech shows potential.  The Spanish bank's venture arm, Santander InnoVentures, is just as enthusiastic about blockchain technology. Its managing director, Mariano Belinky, has said the technology could ""transform"" banking.

42398418,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTUt0,1434596696,Secret Service Agent to Plead Guilty for Silk Road Violations,"US Secret Service special agent Shaun Bridges will plead guilty to charges of money laundering and wire fraud stemming from the government investigation into the illicit online black market Silk Road.  Details first emerged of Bridges' alleged improper actions in March, when court documents revealed that Bridges had diverted $800,000 in digital currency to his personal bank accounts without authorization. Bridges was charged alongside Carl Mark Force IV, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent also working on the case.  Notice of the agreement was filed in the US District Court Northern District of California on 17th June, with the formal court filing including the request that Bridges will enter his guilty pleas on 31st August or 1st September, depending on court availability.  The filing indicates that Force completed 10 wire transfers from proceeds of his illicit actions on Silk Road to bank accounts at Quantum Fidelity and PNC Bank. Nine of the wire transfers were for amounts exceeding $99,000, according to a separate 16th June filing, with the largest totaling $225,000.  As part of the agreement, the US government has moved to request that Bridges relinquish any property traceable to his illicit actions and be forced to pay ""a money judgment equivalent to the amount of property"" involved in the violations.  Bridges was assigned to conduct forensic computer investigations as part of an effort to locate the Silk Road servers for the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force.
