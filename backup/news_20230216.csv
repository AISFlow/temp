42388045,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR33en,1676587907,"Bankman-Fried $250M Bond Is a ‘Joke,’ Claims Securities Lawyer","Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail terms are “ludicrous,” said James Murphy, securities lawyer and founder of Ludlow Street Advisors, a platform geared towards the metaverse, crypto and Web3.  Murphy, former chairman and co-founder of law firm Murphy & McGonigle PC, said there was no real money used for Bankman-Fried’s bond, only the promise of it should he flee the country.  “The original bond is a joke,” Murphy said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.  In December, Bankman-Fried was arrested on a number of charges “in a global scheme to deceive and defraud customers and lenders of FTX and Alameda, the defendant's crypto hedge fund, as well as a conspiracy to defraud the United States government,” according to the Justice Department. After he was extradited to the U.S. from the Bahamas, where he was arrested, Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond, co-signed by his parents, who put up their home in Palo Alto as collateral.  According to Murphy, the agreement made by his parents to pay $250 million should Bankman-Fried decide to flee the U.S. is not what it seems because the parents “don’t have the assets nearly in that amount, as far as we know.”  On Wednesday, Judge Lewis Caplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) disclosed the names of the two additional bond co-signers, Stanford University’s Andreas Paepcke, a senior research scientist; and Larry Kramer, once a dean of the university’s law school. They had agreed to pay $200,000 and $500,000, respectively. However, said Murphy, only if Bankman-Fried decided to skip town would “they have to write a check.”  The terms of their bonds had the same stipulations, according to Murphy, who previously called into question whether the terms of Bankman-Fried’s bond were in fact substantial.  “Normally you’ve got to put up property assets to back the bond or go to a bail bondsman and give them 10% to 15% of the face amount of the bond,” he said. In Bankman-Fried’s case, “none of that happened,” Murphy said, adding that “Sam put down nothing” and “his parents put down no cash.”  However, Anthony Michael Sabino, co-founder of law firm Sabino & Sabino P.C., told CoinDesk in an interview there is no bail bond entity in the U.S. that is “is going to put up any bond, let alone [for] someone of this colossal nature, unless they have in hand either cash or a mortgage on a piece of real estate or somebody’s jewelry.”  Sabino, also a professor of law at St. John’s University, added that if it were the case that no money was placed upfront, bond issuers would be taking on further risks. He added that when bonds are posted, “people usually don’t discuss it. It’s a private matter.”  As to whether the Bankman-Fried’s bond was issued in a fair manner, Sabino said that “a bond in the amount of $250 million is a very serious matter,” and “I wouldn’t call it a joke.”  He said the reason the bond is as high as it is because there is “the very real danger of Mr. Bankman-Fried fleeing the jurisdiction,” adding that in light of Bankman-Fried’s recent actions he’s proven to be troublesome. The potential for him to jet off somewhere outside of the U.S. can’t be completely ruled out.  “[Sam Bankman-Fried] is precisely the kind of guy because of his political connections, his resources [and] the fact that he again spent a lot of time already in another jurisdiction. He is very definitely a flight risk.”  Murphy told CoinDesk TV, “Prosecutors wanted to look tough and wanted to be able to say, 'This is the largest bond anybody’s ever seen. This is quite onerous,'” in reference to why prosecutors acted fast and negotiated with Bankman-Friend’s lawyers in an effort to prevent the 30-year-old from fleeing the Bahamas.  Bankman-Fried’s bond rules, however, may soon be changing following a request from federal prosecutors that would stop Bankman-Fried from using his cell phone and accessing the internet except under certain circumstances. That, Murphy said, came as a shock, adding, “that was not an original condition of his bail.”  “I cannot explain it, based on my 30 years of doing this. I've never seen anything this lenient in a situation where someone has millions of victims,” Murphy said. “I don't know why they [federal prosecutors] continue to be lenient, as he's kind of pushing the envelope in terms of what he can do.”  Attorney Sabino, however, said that “because it’s not a crime of violence, we tend to be more lenient in our justice system.”  “The mini travails of Sam Bankman-Fried have been unique,” Sabino said, adding that “SBF is darn lucky,” to have gotten bail.

The SEC alleged that Terraform and Kwon misled investors on a number of issues, including who was using TerraUSD for payments, and called both the yield-bearing Anchor Protocol and the LUNA token ""crypto asset securities,"" according to the complaint. The SEC is charging Terraform and Kwon with fraud, selling unregistered securities, selling unregistered security-based swaps and other related claims.  ""Terraform and Kwon also misled investors about one of the most important aspects of Terraform's offering – the stability of UST, the algorithmic 'stablecoin' purportedly pegged to the U.S. dollar,"" the suit said.

The complaint alleged that Kwon and Terraform worked with a U.S. trading firm, which was not named, to restore UST's peg after it fell nearly 10 cents in May 2021. After the trading firm bought amounts of the UST token, it received LUNA tokens from Terraform.

Federal prosecutors sent a letter to the court earlier this week claiming that Bankman-Fried had violated a previous court order against using encrypted technology when he used a virtual private network (VPN) to watch the Super Bowl. They urged the court to consider stricter measures, including blocking Bankman-Fried from using cellphones, computers or any internet-connected devices except in limited, case-related circumstances.  During Thursday’s hearing to discuss the letter, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer Mark Cohen pushed back, calling the measures “draconian” and arguing that Bankman-Fried needed access to the internet and applications like Google Docs to effectively prepare for his coming trial.  But U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan seemed to disagree with Cohen on Thursday, and even suggested the government’s proposed measures might not be enough to keep Bankman-Fried from meddling with the case or otherwise breaking the conditions of his bail.  Kaplan told the court he had “probable cause to believe” that Bankman-Fried may have committed “witness tampering,” which is a felony, and expressed doubt that he was, in fact, using a VPN to watch football.  “What was he doing watching a football game on a VPN – if that was, in fact, what he was doing – that someone can just turn on a television and watch for nothing?” Kaplan asked.  Cohen told the court that Bankman-Fried’s use of the VPN wasn’t an intentional transgression, but instead an oversight.  “The condition was no encryption,” Kaplan responded. “If there is one person in this courtroom who knew [that VPNs use encryption], I’m guessing it would be your client.”  Kaplan told prosecutors that he was concerned about their proposal to install monitoring software on a single cellphone and laptop in Bankman-Fried’s parents’ home in California, where he is currently living.  “Would I be wrong in assuming his parents have cellphones?” Kaplan asked. “A couple of Stanford professors – it seems likely.”  The prosecution’s suggestion, Kaplan argued, would “leave [Bankman-Fried] in a house with a bunch of unmonitored devices that are perfectly capable of doing what you are trying to stop him from doing.”  “Why am I being asked to turn him loose in a garden of electronic devices?” Kaplan asked.  A prosecutor told the judge that there was not really a solution to keep Bankman-Fried from accessing his parents’ devices.  “Oh, I think there is a solution,” Kaplan quipped. “It’s just not one anyone has suggested yet.”  The judge brought up the possibility that, if Bankman-Fried continues to defy the terms of his bail, revocation proceedings – a hearing to decide whether Bankman-Fried must await his trial in prison – could be on the table.  “It could get there,” Kaplan warned.  Kaplan told prosecutors and Bankman-Fried’s attorneys to work on a new set of proposed bail conditions that could more effectively monitor and prevent future issues.  “I want this to be tight,” Kaplan said.  Kaplan also made an unorthodox request of Cohen – for Bankman-Fried’s legal team to provide an independent technology expert for the court’s use, who Kaplan suggested could work “effectively like a law clerk” and counsel him on the risks posed by VPNs and “other gizmos.”  Both prosecutors and Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have until next Tuesday to submit new proposed guidelines for Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/16/bankman-fried-remains-out-on-bond-but-judge-warns-revocation-proceedings-possible-in-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab31bd208c34356730fb03d8e480ab1fd4ce39f6-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

All of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs year-to-date are Bitcoin or blockchain related. The new year has brought positive tailwinds into crypto. Since the year started, digital assets and equities have outperformed the broad market. The crypto rebound has driven an even larger rebound among digital assets equities, strengthening the case that digital assets equities represent a leveraged bet on digital assets. Digital assets have bounced back ferociously after a dismal 2022. In fact, all of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs year-to-date are Bitcoin or blockchain related. 1 The MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index has even outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum year to date, suggesting digital assets equities may be a leveraged bet on the digital assets market, with the potential to perform better in a bull market and worse in a bear market. In a recent blog , we addressed the fundamental and technical reasons why Bitcoin is rallying. In this piece, we will focus on the equities. Performance Lowlights in Digital Assets Equities Since its inception, the Digital Assets Equity Index has significantly underperformed both the broad equity benchmark and digital assets benchmarks.

Returns for actual Fund investors may differ from what is shown because of differences in timing, the amount invested and fees and expenses. Index returns assume that dividends have been reinvested. In a blog published over the summer , we identified a few reasons why digital assets and related equities had underperformed at the time. Simply put, they took on too much debt. Among listed equities, Bitcoin miners in particular borrowed too much when times were good, and many have filed for bankruptcy, ceased operations, or were delisted from major exchanges in 2022. Voyager Capital (5.3% weight on 12/31/21) filed for bankruptcy after Three Arrows Capital defaulted on hundreds of millions worth of unsecured loans that Voyager had made. Core Scientific (4.5% weight on 3/31/21) filed for bankruptcy after falling Bitcoin prices severely hampered the company's abilities to pay its outsized debts. EQONEX Limited (5.2% weight on 12/31/20) was delisted from the Nasdaq exchange after failing to maintain a minimum of $1 share price. Beyond these, many companies (including Stronghold Digital Mining, Greenidge Generation and Core Scientific) have had to undergo significant debt restructuring to avoid outright bankruptcy. 2023: A New Hope? The new year has brought positive tailwinds into crypto. Since the year started, digital assets and equities have outperformed the broad market. It's impossible to predict if this is a short-term bounce or if the crypto bear market is really over. What's interesting to note is the degree of outperformance that crypto equities have had over digital assets themselves. Year to date, the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index has outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum by nearly double. Some analysts posit that the shortage of liquid crypto-related stocks may be drawing investors into the small handful of liquid options (and ETFs), leading to gains that may exceed the fundamental improvement. Keep in mind that some crypto-related SPACs failed to merge in 2022 (Circle and eToro are two examples), leading to fewer liquid options for investors looking to allocate to crypto. We believe that digital assets equities represent a leveraged bet on digital assets. In a bull market, digital assets equities would be expected to perform better than digital assets, and in a bear market, they would be expected to perform worse. For years, we've seen this relationship play out in gold and gold equities.

Digital Transformation Correlation and Portfolio Positioning The MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index provides diversified exposure to companies at the forefront of the digital assets transformation, including digital assets exchanges, miners and other infrastructure companies. By design, these companies must generate more than 50% of their revenues from digital assets business lines. This leads to a basket of companies that are pure-play-meaning, they are actually operating within the digital assets business. Because these companies are pure-play and because they are operating within digital assets, their performance is typically highly correlated to the broader digital assets market.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index. With these correlations in mind, we believe that the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) can provide exposure in a growth, disruption, innovation or alternative sleeve and serve as a core-satellite allocation. These names are not in the broad market benchmarks (yet), and the return profile does indicate a low correlation to the broad market. Investors may receive diversification and potential for alpha over a longer time horizon. It's also important to emphasize that the MVIS Global Digital Asset Equity Index is new and without a long track record. That correlation to both digital assets and broad equity benchmarks will most likely not remain static.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Ethereum (ETH-USD) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Amongst cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization. VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) and VanEck Digital Asset Mining ETF (DAM) DAPP and DAM will not invest in digital assets (including cryptocurrencies) (i) directly or (ii) indirectly through the use of digital asset derivatives. The Fund also will not invest in initial coin offerings. Therefore the Fund is not expected to track the price movement of any digital asset. Investors in the Funds should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility in the price of the Fund's Shares and the possibility of significant losses. An investment in the Funds involves a substantial degree of risk. An investment in the Funds is not a deposit with a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Therefore, you should consider carefully various risks before investing in the Funds, each of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Funds. An investment in the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) may be subject to risks which include, among others, risks related to investing in digital transformation companies, special risk considerations of investing in European issuers, equity securities, small- and medium-capitalization companies, information technology sector, financials sector, foreign securities, emerging market issuers, market, operational, index tracking, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, passive management, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, non-diversified and industry concentration risks, all of which may adversely affect the Fund. Emerging market issuers and foreign securities may be subject to securities markets, political and economic, investment and repatriation restrictions, different rules and regulations, less publicly available financial information, foreign currency and exchange rates, operational and settlement, and corporate and securities laws risks. Small- and medium-capitalization companies may be subject to elevated risks. An investment in the VanEck Digital Assets Mining ETF (DAM) may be subject to risks which include, among others, risks related to investing in digital asset miners, special risk considerations of investing in Asian and Chinese issuers, equity securities, micro-, small- and medium-capitalization companies, information technology sector, financials sector, foreign securities, emerging market issuers, depository receipts, market, operational, index tracking, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, passive management, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, non-diversified and index-related concentration risks, all of which may adversely affect the Fund. Emerging market issuers and foreign securities may be subject to securities markets, political and economic, investment and repatriation restrictions, different rules and regulations, less publicly available financial information, foreign currency and exchange rates, operational and settlement, and corporate and securities laws risks. Micro-, Small- and medium-capitalization companies may be subject to elevated risks. The technology relating to digital assets, including blockchain, is new and developing and the risks associated with digital assets may not fully emerge until the technology is widely used. Digital asset technologies are used by companies to optimize their business practices, whether by using the technology within their business or operating business lines involved in the operation of the technology. The cryptographic keys necessary to transact a digital asset may be subject to theft, loss, or destruction, which could adversely affect a company's business or operations if it were dependent on the digital asset. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for digital assets and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of digital assets. Digital asset miners and other hardware necessary for digital asset mining are subject to the risk of malfunction, technological obsolescence, the global supply chain issues and difficulty and cost in obtaining new hardware. Malfunctions and normal wear and tear will, at any point in time, cause a certain number of digital asset miners to be taken off-line for maintenance or repair. Any major digital asset miner malfunction could cause significant economic damage. The physical degradation of miners will require replacement of miners. Additionally, as technology evolves, there may be a need to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive, which can be costly and may be in short supply. Given the long production period to manufacture and assemble digital asset miners and the current global semiconductor chip shortage, there can be no assurance that miners can acquire or maintain enough digital asset mining computers or replace parts on a cost-effective basis for efficient and profitable digital asset mining operations. VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF An investment in the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) may be subject to risks which include, among others market and volatility, investment, futures contract, derivatives, investments related to Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, indirect investment, credit, interest rate, illiquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, of cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/asset-backed securities, and sovereign bond risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund. The value of Bitcoin and the Fund's Bitcoin Futures holdings, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment. The Fund does not invest in Bitcoin or other digital assets directly. The further development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the Bitcoin network may adversely affect the price of Bitcoin and therefore cause the Fund to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in Bitcoin or restrict the use of Bitcoin or the operations of the Bitcoin network or venues on which Bitcoin trades in a manner that adversely affects the price of Bitcoin and, therefore, the Fund's Bitcoin Futures. Bitcoin generally operates without central authority (such as a bank) and is not backed by any government, Bitcoin is not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of Bitcoin, and regulation in the United States is still developing. Futures Contract Risk. The use of futures contracts involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets. The market for Bitcoin Futures may be less developed, and potentially less liquid and more volatile, than more established futures markets. Bitcoin Futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Fund's ability to achieve its target exposure. Margin requirements for Bitcoin Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (""CME"") may be substantially higher than margin requirements for many other types of futures contracts. Futures contracts exhibit ""futures basis,"" which refers to the difference between the current market value of the underlying Bitcoin (the ""spot"" price) and the price of the cash-settled futures contracts. This risk may be adversely affected by ""negative roll yields"" in ""contango"" markets. The Fund will ""roll"" out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract on Bitcoin with a later expiration date. The ""rolling"" feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Fund's performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the Bitcoin. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a ""contango"" market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses. Unlike traditional mutual funds that are structured as regulated investment companies for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Fund has not elected and has no current intention to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company under the Code because the extent of our direct investments in Bitcoin Futures would generally prevent the Fund from meeting the qualification requirements under the Code for regulated investment companies. Investing involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing.

Please read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before investing. General Cryptocurrency Disclosures Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency's blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance. Fees and expenses associated with a cryptocurrency investment may be substantial. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of cryptocurrencies. Investors should conduct extensive research before investing in cryptocurrencies. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

The miner produced a record 687 Bitcoins in January, a 45% increase from the prior month. Total unrestricted Bitcoin holdings as of the end of the month stood at 8,090. Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is up over 100% year-to-date as the 2023 stock market fully sheds concerns about the prior year's high-profile exchange failures. In my opinion, the sentiment is clear, the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) winter is thawing and its institutional infrastructure from miners to exchanges and banks all now stand to reverse more than a year-long decline in their commons. Data by YCharts The surge has come on the back of what remains an almost 44% short interest in Marathon. Whilst some of Bitcoin's use cases face headwinds, the bears face material risks here. The current surge could be extended especially as the positive macroeconomic news that catalyzed the present rally was driven by positive inflation figures. This has set the backdrop for an end of the current Fed funds rate hike cycle and has come together with a heightened potential of a soft landing. What The Bulls Should Be Concerned About Marathon acts as a proxy for a direct Bitcoin investment and has been buoyed by the enthusiasm building around a near-term end to rising Fed funds rate. It's likely there will be two further 25 basis point hikes to close out its chapter. Marathon tracks Bitcoin which in turn moves in parallel with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index ( QQQ ). Data by YCharts To be clear, Marathon's recent outperformance has not been built on an improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the cryptocurrency but on broader macroeconomic conditions that have placed the company on the same path as more traditional tech stocks. Why do I think this is concerning? A pertinent argument put out by Bitcoin maximalists was that the digital asset presents a hard break away from financial orthodoxy and a hedge against inflation. Data by YCharts But Bitcoin has acted proportional to inflation over the last year with the asset dropping when a flight of capital away from stocks and bonds to crypto was meant to take place to reflect the dominant crypto narrative. That this didn't happen significantly limits the use case for Bitcoin and its relevant investment proxies like Marathon in my opinion. It adds legs to bearish arguments that Bitcoin is mainly a speculative asset whose previously insatiable animal spirits now look to be returning on the back of an end to the current Fed rate hike cycle. Marathon recently released its January Bitcoin mining update. The company produced 687 Bitcoins , a 45% increase over the prior month and a record number of Bitcoin produced in a single month. This total mined is roughly currently valued at over $15 million and sets the company up for a decent recovery for its fiscal 2023 first quarter if currently elevated prices are sustained. Cash as at the end of the month stood at $133.8 million with Marathon's balance sheet further buoyed by unrestricted Bitcoin holdings increasing to 8,090. Why 2023 Offers More Uncertainty The current bearish rally could eventually get divorced from the improving fundamentals of the US economy to reflect what remains a collapsing crypto ecosystem now facing material headwinds to mainstream adoption and whose catalysts have been increasingly placed ever beyond the horizon. The most recent setback was the SEC rejecting the second application by ARK 21Shares for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The ETF would have been partially managed by Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest and comes on the back of ongoing litigation being brought by Digital Currency Group's Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ) to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF. The continued failure of attempts to create a spot Bitcoin ETF reflects the barriers Bitcoin will continue to face to broader adoption. With the direction of Bitcoin now being driven by broader economic factors, 2023 will bring uncertainty in response to the monthly drops of macroeconomic figures that communicate whether or not the Fed funds rates can stop their ascent. A return of animal spirits now lingers in anticipation of a dovish pivot by the Fed as the US economy looks set to grow this year, avoiding previous forecasts for a recession. Hence, even as we see an increasingly aggressive SEC take an aggressive stance against Bitcoin, the digital asset could still come out on top. Fundamentally, the bears could still win if inflation remains elevated for longer than the current rally expects. This would force the Fed to institute more hikes and maintain the rates at higher levels for longer. Whilst I don't think 2023 will bring a return to Bitcoin's pandemic-era highs, the bulls are currently ahead with the asset and the broader stock market now amidst a bull run. Bitcoin is still down versus its year-ago comp so results for Marathon's fiscal 2023 first quarter will be poor, albeit a material improvement from fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings. I expect this will see Marathon report a record net loss and a significant impairment charge.

Marathon Digital stock has more than doubled this year, aided by short-squeeze rumors on Reddit and rising Bitcoin prices. This analysis aims to shed light on the company's profitability profile, balance sheet health, and the changing competitive landscape. Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA) stock surged on February 14 as Soros Fund Management led by billionaire investor George Soros revealed an investment of $8,984,659 in convertible notes of the company that could be converted into 39,600,000 common shares. Not surprisingly, Mr. Market welcomed this news, given that George Soros has built a reputation for exploiting mispriced bets in capital markets. Cryptocurrencies have started 2023 on the right foot - at least from a market performance perspective - with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices up more than 33% YTD. MARA's run continued yesterday too, with the stock ending the day up more than 18%. This analysis aims to shed light on the company's profitability profile, balance sheet health, and the changing competitive landscape. Months Or Decades Away From Profitability If the above subheading confused you, that was exactly what I was looking for. The primary driver of a Bitcoin miner's profitability is the underlying Bitcoin prices, which makes Bitcoin mining operations similar to mining assets such as gold and silver. Bitcoin prices are highly volatile and predicting future prices is next to impossible although some analysts have come up with price targets that cannot be rationally justified using math. Because of the high volatility of Bitcoin prices, it is difficult to predict when Marathon Digital will turn a profit. Investors, however, need to consider a few other factors in addition to Bitcoin prices to determine the potential profitability of the company. The cost of electricity. The price of Bitcoin mining equipment. The competition in the industry. Using Q3 data, Marathon Digital will breakeven at a Bitcoin price of $16,646 from a cost of mining revenue perspective, but as illustrated below, Bitcoin prices will have to rise astronomically for the company to breakeven from an operating profit perspective. Exhibit 1: Breakeven Bitcoin prices for public miners as of Q3 2022 Blockware Solutions Because Bitcoin prices are highly volatile, Marathon Digital might end up with profits as soon as just a few months if Bitcoin takes off, but the opposite is also true. One of the main points raised by bulls is that Marathon Digital's hash rate will grow exponentially aided by the company's investments in miners. In its latest investor presentation, Marathon Digital highlighted how its hash rate could swell to 23 EH/s by mid-2023 from just 3.8 EH/s reported in Q3 2022. Exhibit 2: Projected hash rate growth Investor presentation These projections look rosy but to add some context, the company initially guided for 13.3 EH/s by Q2 2022, a target that Marathon Digital failed to accomplish. As a growth-oriented investor, I am willing to take calculated risks to beat the market in the long term but I believe investors need to be cautious about investing in a Bitcoin miner solely based on hash rate growth projections. Leverage Is A Concern Marathon Digital raised close to $750 million in a convertible note offering in Q4 2021, and the company used the majority of these proceeds to purchase Bitcoin mining equipment aggressively. In December 2021, the company struck a deal with Bitmain to purchase 78,000 Bitcoin miners for a staggering $879 million. According to the purchase agreement filed with the SEC, Marathon Digital agreed to pay over $11,000 per unit for Bitmain S19 machines. Exhibit 3: Delivery schedule and price details as per the purchase agreement with Bitmain Company filings Company filings The company entered a non-fixed price deal with Bitmain and under the payment terms, Marathon Digital agreed to pay 35% of a batch's price at least 6 months before shipment. Since Marathon struck this deal, prices of Bitcoin mining equipment have plummeted. Exhibit 4: Bitcoin ASIC price index Hashrate Index The above prices are calculated based on unit prices and their hash rate output, and in summary, unit prices have fallen more than 85% from the highs seen in 2021. The company's decision to purchase mining equipment at elevated prices might come back to haunt investors in the coming years with its convertible debt maturing in December 2026. In addition to the convertible debt, the company has secured two other credit facilities; a $100 million term loan and a $100 million revolving credit facility. Both these loans require the company to keep Bitcoin as collateral at the time of drawing from these facilities. In Q3, Marathon Digital used $50 million from the term loan at a cost of around 9% (prime rate plus 1.75%) and used $50 million from its revolving credit facility as well. The company had to use 9,490 Bitcoin as collateral for these loans. Investors, with this understanding of Marathon's capital structure, need to make the necessary adjustments to calculate the unrestricted liquidity of the company at any given time without using the total Bitcoin holding as a proxy for unrestricted liquidity. In general, investing in a highly leveraged Bitcoin miner seems inherently riskier than investing in Bitcoin itself as companies could go bankrupt amid liquidity issues. In contrast, direct Bitcoin investors are not exposed to this risk. Short-Term Volatility Is On The Cards Marathon Digital stock has more than doubled this year (+133%) aided by rising Bitcoin prices and a notable improvement in investor sentiment resulting from George Soros's association with the company. Another possible reason behind the recent gains is the rising interest in MARA among traders looking for potential short-squeeze opportunities. The Reddit ""Shortsqueeze"" community with 161,000 members has been actively discussing the outlook for MARA stock as a one-of-a-kind short squeeze opportunity, and these discussions have led to a renewed interest in the company among traders. Competitive Landscape May Improve Some Bitcoin mining companies have come under pressure with recent macroeconomic challenges, forcing them to go out of business. Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZQ), one of the largest crypto mining companies in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy protection in December, triggering widespread investor fears for the future of its rivals. For Marathon Digital, these bankruptcies may come as a blessing in disguise as a potential decline in hash rates will allow the company to make more bang for the buck with reduced competition. Takeaway Marathon Digital, one of the largest public Bitcoin miners in the U.S., is investing aggressively to bring more mining rigs online. This strategy will help the company mine more Bitcoin in the coming quarters, thereby relieving some pressure on its liquidity profile with the company now starting to sell Bitcoin to fund its business operations. Despite some positive developments, as a long-term-oriented investor, I do not feel comfortable taking a position in MARA given that investing in Bitcoin directly seems a better option if I were to invest in cryptocurrencies.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579185-george-soros-revives-investor-interest-marathon-digital?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9515322.jpeg
42414397,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5l0S,1676580721,Compute North’s Reorganization Plan Approved by Bankruptcy Judge,"A federal judge approved the final reorganization plan for effectively defunct crypto mining services firm Compute North, which was one of the largest in North America, setting the firm on track to become a shadow of what it once was.  Compute North filed for bankruptcy protection in September because it was unable to meet its debt obligations. The mining firm has closed 13 asset sales, four of them major, which have “satisfied” all of its secured debt, which was $250 million, said Compute North’s attorney at a Thursday hearing.  “Nobody was going to like what I was getting ready to do,” Judge Marvin Isgur of the Southern District of Texas said when Compute North’s attorney revealed a last-minute “Hail Mary” that will allow the mining hosting firm to move forward with its restructuring plan.  Compute North has settled its debts with numerous companies in order to get them on board with the plan and avoid future litigation. Those include industry giant Marathon Digital Holdings, which agreed on Feb. 9 to a general unsecured claim to $40 million in return for accepting the plan. Another 11 firms had to settle with Compute North for relatively minor claims for the plan to go through.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Marathon Expects to Recover Less Than Half Its Deposit From Bankrupt Compute North  Three of the agreements – two from customers and one from a supplier – came at the last minute.  The last three holdouts were Decimal Digital, which had ordered machines and hosting services from Compute North, which will get its machines back but pay the packing and transport fees. Decimal will also serve in the committee that will oversee the enforcement of the plan, along with investment firm Touzi Capital.  Corpus Christi Energy Park, which was building the infrastructure for a mining site in Texas, also agreed at the last minute to retain an up to $5 million unsecured claim.  BitNile, a relative newcomer to the industry under a parent group with a wide portfolio, has claimed $20 million, $18 million of that in damages. The miner has also sued Compute North for fraud, arguing that the hosting firm never tried to plug in its machines as per their deal signed in August, just before the bankruptcy. BitNile was allowed a $1 million unsecured claim for voting purposes.  The plan approves the final list and classification of creditors’ claims, and sets up a litigation trust to go forward looking for funds from ongoing cases. This will in turn determine how Compute North’s remaining assets will be divided among the remaining claimants.  One of its major lenders, Generate Capital, earlier took over two of the bankrupt company’s mining sites in Texas, which U.S. Bitcoin Corp. will manage. Foundry, which was owed $10 million from an equipment loan, bought two other minor sites. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent, Digital Currency Group.  According to the plan, remaining unsecured creditors will retain ownership of remaining assets, such as transformers and containers, and disburse them among the claimants. A litigation trust will be set up to close from ongoing legal procedures.

Since December 26, 2022, when Bitcoin was showing signs of having found a bottom a month earlier, it has rebounded from its 52-week low. During this time of low Bitcoin prices, the company is focusing on cutting costs, stabilizing cash flows, and investing in R&D for the purpose of developing new products. The performance of the company will continue to be affected by Federal Reserve policies, which have a negative impact on high-growth tech stocks. Canaan Inc. ( CAN ), a company that competes in the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining, ASIC computer chip and computer markets, has had a tough couple of years, falling from a two-year high of approximately $39.00 per share on March 8, 2021, to its recent 52-week low of $1.87 on December 28, 2022. Most, if not all of its performance is directly related to the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which have driven down the price of Bitcoin while having a negative impact on the cryptocurrency sector. Looking ahead, the major issue for the company is whether or not the Fed is getting close to reaching the upper limit of its interest rate increases, or it will continue on for a period of time because of the strong labor market, and in some areas of the market, ongoing stubborn inflation. I still hold to my thesis that the Fed doesn't have a lot of room left to boost interest rates because of the pressure it would put on the U.S. government to pay its rising bill. While I do believe there will be some more interest rate increases, I also believe it won't go much above 5 percent as a ceiling because of it being cost-prohibitive to the Federal government. With that in mind, while I think it's possible for Bitcoin to take another dive before entering into a period of a sustainable upward move, it appears the worst may be over, even if it once again tests its recent low; I don't see it lingering near the $16,000 mark or slightly lower for any prolonged period of time. I tend to think it's not going to drop to that level again, but it's possible that it could. But even if it does, I think the share price of CAN will hold above its 52-week low based upon it doing so when Bitcoin crashed below $16,000 in the latter part of November 2022. In this article we'll look at some of the numbers from its latest earnings report, and more importantly, how management is framing and responding to the current weak environment in the cryptocurrency sector. TradingView Some of the numbers Revenue in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB916 million (US$137.5 million), compared to revenue of RMB1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2021 - down 25.8 percent. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB234.2 million or US$32.9 million, down 74.8 percent sequentially, from RMB929.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, and down 68.4 percent from RMB741.7 million in the third quarter of 2021. Net income in the reporting period was RMB61.00 million (US$8.6 million), or US$0.34 per diluted share. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter of 2022 was RMB2.00 billion (US$281.5 million). It should be taken into consideration that these numbers will be lower in the fourth quarter of 2022 because the price of Bitcoin fell significantly below what it had been trading, on average, in the third quarter of 2022. So, while expectations for the fourth quarter should be low, if the price of Bitcoin continues to recover, the numbers for the first quarter of 2023 should show meaningful improvement over the third and fourth quarters of last year. Whether or not that will be the end of negative conditions CAN has been operating in will be determined by the actions of the Federal Reserve. Preparing for the inevitable turnaround Since the price of Bitcoin and the actions of the Federal Reserve are out of control of CAN, management is taking steps to endure the crypto winter, as well as position itself for the inevitable rebound in the price of Bitcoin, which will be a powerful tailwind for the company. To that end, CAN has changed its focus to cutting expenses, investing in R&D for the purpose of developing new products, and stabilizing its cash flow. After using some of its Bitcoin holdings to pay for mining costs in the third quarter, the company had 535.5 Bitcoins left; that's 188.7 Bitcoins more than it had in the second quarter of 2022. Another step it's taking in regard to its mining business is to diversify geographically in order to mitigate risk, using this time to expand its global footprint. As for further deploying machines geographically in its mining business, the company expects to have an increase in depreciation in relationship to its total costs. One particular thing I like in CAN's strategy is the fact it is continuing to invest in R&D and isn't going fully into survival mode. Having cash and cash equivalents of US$281.5 million is a positive catalyst it has at its disposal, which should pay off for the company in the long term. That is evidenced from the introduction of two new mining machine models in the reporting period, which management claims is ""a significant improvement over the previous generation of mining machines."" At the time of the earnings report management said it's preparing to mass produce the two new mining machines, saying mass shipments should launch no later than the early part of 2023. General outlook During the last earnings call the company said that within the current macroeconomic and interest rate environment, it expected the price of Bitcoin to remain under downward pressure, and in fact they were right in that outlook. It also noted industry confidence would likely wane, which also came about, as did overall sentiment for Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market. Taking that into consideration, management stated it was likely to have another tough couple of quarters ahead, which include the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. There's no doubt the numbers from the fourth quarter are going to be underwhelming based upon the further drop in price of Bitcoin during that period of time. On the other hand, if the price of Bitcoin holds support and moves up from where it has been trading at recently, there could be an upward surprise in the first quarter results of 2023. While that would be welcome, what's most important is how Bitcoin does for the remainder of 2023, what steps the Fed takes, and what investor sentiment for Bitcoin is in the quarters ahead. In the near-term investors shouldn't expect too much out of CAN, but further out it should do very well unless there's an unforeseen event, or the global economy plunges into a severe and prolonged recession. To get an idea of what management thinks, it guided for total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be approximately RMB310 million. That's very low, but based upon economic visibility and the ceiling I see concerning how high the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates, I think that's going to be the bottom for the company. Conclusion I like what I heard in the third quarter earnings report, in that management had a solid grasp on the challenges it faced, and didn't shy away from discussing them and how it would impact the short-term performance of CAN. I also liked its basic overall strategy of not only cutting costs, which was a given, but also maintaining its momentum concerning R&D and not holding back on developing new products that should be a tailwind as the crypto market eventually turns around. For the most part, I think the worst is over for CAN, and even if there are a couple of more bumps on the road, I don't think the stock is going to collapse, even if there are some more corrections in the price of Bitcoin before it begins a sustainable upward move. Since reaching its 52-week low on December 28, 2022, the stock has recovered nicely, pushing up to approximately $4.00 per share before pulling to about $3.00 per share as I write. It wouldn't surprise me to see it correct because of that quick upward move, but barring a major negative catalyst that isn't visible at this time, I think the company has seen its worst and will probably trade somewhat level in 2023 until the price of Bitcoin confirms it is in recovery mode.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579174-canaan-worst-close-to-being-over?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9514710.jpeg

According to the report, Binance moved the funds between January and March 2021 from BAM Trading's Silvergate account. BAM Trading is the name of the entity operating Binance US. Merit Peak is a trading firm the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating over its ties to Binance.  Binance itself lacks the licenses to operate in the U.S.  Former Binance US CEO Catherine Coley reportedly asked about the funds and their transfers at the end of 2020. Coley departed Binance US in April 2021, and has not held a public role at a crypto company since then.  A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk it was ""a Binance.US issue."" A spokesperson told Reuters that the news organization had ""outdated information"" but did not appear to address the transfers.  While Binance US spokespeople did not return a request for comment, the company's Twitter account tweeted that ""only Binance.US employees have access to Binance.US bank accounts,"" and noted that Merit Peak has not operated on Binance US since 2021.

42410865,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs2Ry,1676576424,"Blur Surpassed OpenSea in Daily NFT Trading Volume Wednesday, Nansen Shows","On Wednesday, Feb. 15, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur overtook OpenSea in daily Ethereum trading volume, according to data analytics platform Nansen.ai.  Other data aggregators point to Blur's steady rise over the past month. A Dune dashboard created by data scientist Hildebert Moulié shows Blur's daily trading volume more than quadrupled following Blur’s release of a native token the day before, a move that has helped push the competition between the two NFT marketplaces to a new level.  The trading volume on Blur’s marketplace stood at 6,602 ether (ETH) Wednesday and OpenSea’s trading volume stood at 5,649 ETH, per Nansen. Meanwhile, another Dune dashboard created by sealaunch.xyz posts higher daily trading volume figures for both Blur and OpenSea – 30,410 ETH and 7,232 ETH, respectively – showing a greater disparity between the two marketplaces, compared to Nansen's data.  Blur’s surge in daily trading volume also followed a blog post from Blur recommending creators block NFT listings on OpenSea as a means of collecting full royalties on Blur’s zero-fee marketplace. Currently, conflicting rules bar artists from simultaneously earning royalties on OpenSea and Blur.  Blur gains on OpenSea  OpenSea’s trading volume per week has always been several times higher than Blur’s trading volume, and in the most recent week, OpenSea’s weekly volume stood at 36,608 ETH, while Blur’s weekly volume sat at 11,424 ETH, per Nansen.  Moulié's Dune dashboard, on the other hand, indicates that Blur has led OpenSea in weekly trading volume since Dec. 2022, except for one week in Jan. 2023.  Another important metric to note is the number of sales and wallets on OpenSea is still greater than on Blur.  From Feb. 7 to Feb. 14, the number of sales on OpenSea was, on average, 8.37 times larger than the number of sales on Blur, while the number of wallets on OpenSea was roughly eight times greater than the number of wallets on Blur, per Nansen.  The gap between OpenSea and Blur in terms of the number of sales and wallets has been closing and was at its smallest as of Wednesday. That day the number of sales on OpenSea stood at 19,908 – 1.63 times greater than Blur’s total number of sales, 12,185.  See Also: NFT Marketplace Blur's Token Reaches $500M Trading Volume After Airdrop  When looking at the number of wallets active on the two marketplaces, an analogous trend arises: The number of wallets interacting with OpenSea is now only twice as great as those interacting with Blur, showing how the race between the first- and second-largest marketplaces is tightening.

42414405,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5lmD,1676574770,Canada Close to Tightening Rules for Crypto Exchanges: Sources,"Later this month, Canada’s umbrella markets regulator, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), will tighten requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country, according to two people who have been briefed on the plans.  The collapse of FTX, among other failings in the crypto industry, has speeded the resolve of the CSA, which announced midway through last year that it required certain compliance “commitments” from unregistered crypto trading platforms operating in Canada while they pursue registration.  The CSA declined to discuss updates to the pre-registration undertaking (PRU) regime, but said it would “publish additional details in the near future.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has already begun accelerating its crackdown on crypto companies, settling charges with exchange Kraken and alleging that a stablecoin issued by Paxos is a security. Other G-7 countries like the U.K. and Canada are likewise increasing their efforts to police the industry in the wake of last year’s disasters.  Some Canadian industry players are worried about the possibility of onerous demands to acquire individual approvals from principal regulators in various territories, for instance. As it stands, some of Canada’s marketplace rules governing alternative trading systems are not passport-able to other jurisdictions.  “This [update to PRU] was primarily driven by the Ontario Securities Commission and will crush the Canadian crypto industry overnight as it completely changes the CSA’s own stated rules and structures and will ensure it’s simply too expensive to do business in Canada,” said one person who asked to remain unnamed due to their ongoing business with regulators.  The CSA’s strengthening of its oversight of crypto trading platforms will impact some of the large global exchanges operating in the country. Binance Canada, for example, has had run-ins with the OSC in the past.  U.S.-regulated crypto exchange Coinbase also operates in Canada under the purview of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), the organization responsible for financial regulation in the Canadian province of Quebec.  A person familiar with the situation said Coinbase has leeway to move over from the AMF to Ontario’s OSC if it made sense for the exchange.  Coinbase declined to comment.

Every NFT will have a second, physical activation which can only be minted in a specific city tied to that NFT.  Sign up for The Airdrop Newsletter, Your Weekly Wrap of Web3 Trends and News  The two companies have commissioned artist Michael Kozlowski, commonly known as Mpkoz, to release a collection for this partnership. Titled Metropolis, the body of work features generative art NFTs based on architectural influences from London, Berlin, New York, Mexico City and Los Angeles – five cities where Bright Moments galleries are located.  Kozlowski told CoinDesk that he’s enthusiastic that the collection will help bring generative art, a genre that’s recently been defying the downward trends of NFT markets, in front of the eyes of crypto and non-crypto native collectors.  “The fact that you don't know what you're getting when you're a collector, and you get to see [the mint] happen in front of your eyes while you're standing next to the artists that made it in sort of a unique situation catered to the specific project that you're minting,” said Kozlowski. “It's just very special.”  The 500-unit collection’s minting begins online Feb. 22, but the in-person component will depend on which city each Metropolis NFT corresponds to. At the designated time, holders will be able to mint “a diptych” – a counterpart to the original NFT. The second work of art, which is free, can only be minted in real life.  Art Blocks and Bright Moments laid plans to team up in January to produce “experiential collaborations.” Art Blocks previously partnered with Pace Gallery in June to further its mission to bring generative art to wider audiences.  Kozlowski is the artist behind Chimera, an early NFT collection minted on Art Blocks. According to data from OpenSea, the collection has a 2.16 ETH or about $3700 floor price, and a trading volume of 3,753 ETH, nearly $6.4 million.

Kramer, along with Stanford computer scientist Andreas Paepcke, were both identified yesterday as bail guarantors after Bankman-Fried’s lawyers missed a window to appeal the decision.  For his part, Kramer and SBF’s parents Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried have been “close friends since the mid-1990s.” They were very supportive during a cancer scare in Kramer’s family. “In turn, we have sought to support them as they face their own crisis,” Kramer said, adding he was acting solely in a personal capacity and does not have financial exposure to the mess that is FTX.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  No one could fault a lawyer for giving a canned response, especially considering the many legal uncertainties surrounding Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial and FTX’s bankruptcy process. Kramer must have had his statement prepared, at least since District Judge Lewis Kaplan signaled the public’s right to know who co-signed SBF’s bond outweighed potential risks to their safety.  See also: James Murphy – Bankman-Fried's Incredible Shrinking '$250 Million Bond' | Opinion  All four of Sam’s backers have ties to Stanford University, an ""Ivy-like"" school that acts as a pipeline to the tech industry. Whatever damage happens to their individual reputations pales in comparison to the latest impact FTX will have on the tech and crypto industries – including the longstanding ties between prestigious research industries and the startups founded by alumni.  Pulling back, the tech industry is already going through a period of forced reinvention, amid a shrinking economy, dwindling financial prospects and the “techlash” against companies once positively called disruptive. Public perception of tech firms, once seen as building a better, “flatter” future, has shifted – as their unaccountable power and ties to The Establishment grow.  Tech skeptics have been proven right in recent months as Facebook, Google and other tech giants have laid off well-paid employees, even as total U.S. unemployment shrinks, about the unsustainability of the contemporary tech industry. The unofficial feeder system between top-rated computer science schools and the largest tech companies is clogged.  Crypto, which has a presence in both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, has certainly benefited from this system. But it might benefit more from the tarnishing of Big Tech’s prestige. Companies like Google and Facebook used to sop up talent by offering generous benefits, uber-competitive salaries and, perhaps most importantly but hardest to quantify, prestige.  That may have been why Bankman-Fried spent so lavishly building FTX's brand, both in the public light by paying celebrity endorsers and for stadium naming rights as well as gaining respect in the tech industry by funding ""effective altruism"" causes popular among tech elite and on campuses. At least some of FTX's questionable expenditures in the Bahamas were a way to reward and attract top talent.  Crypto firms, too, have cut back. CoinDesk found the industry shed nearly 30,000 jobs since April. But at its best, crypto also provides a way for young innovators to build the things they think will benefit everyone. Energy and time once spent coding the-next-hated-Gmail update, could be put towards the next open source innovation.

Brendler said Coinbase’s relatively high level of clarity could make it a winner as regulators gun for other industry players, but he cautions that the near-term outlook looks “increasingly treacherous.”  In addition to recent regulatory concerns, said Brendler, there is also worry about Coinbase’s earnings report due Feb. 21, which is expected to show weakness in assets under management and interest income.

Speaking to CNBC, the Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner noted that the conditions could hit housing and Bitcoin particularly hard. However, she added that these sentiments are temporary and will not last long. ""I would say it's more short term to medium term. it's not yet impacting the longer-term gauges, so that does tell us the support levels are still very much realistic,"" the Fairlead Strategies founder said. ""I think 3,200 is probably made less likely by what we saw in January, the 3,800 levels that was tested successfully test still at relevant levels."" Stockton reported that she sees resistance for the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) at around 4,228 (revised from prior 4,020) as support level rises. The S&P 500 was sitting just below 4,130 in Thursday's intraday trading. Stockton highlighted the importance of megacap stocks that have seen a lot of breakouts and pullbacks in January after being pushed down in 2022. In terms of comparing the broader market indexes, Stockton pointed out that Nasdaq 100 has outperformed S&P 500 so far this year. Looking at recent movement in the crypto space, one of the key areas Stockton highlighted, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) jumped more than 9% to $24.95K in Thursday's intraday action. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) rose 9% to $1,719.94. Looking at the broader market action: Nasdaq Composite ( COMP.IND ) -0.6% , S&P 500 ( SP500 ) -0.5% , Dow ( DJI ) -0.4% to 33.926. Meanwhile, take a quick look at the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite index performance so far this year: Crypto stocks have seen a significant run so far in 2023. While its down more than 1% in Thursday's intraday action, Coinbase ( COIN ) has more than doubled so far in 2023, although the stock remains lower by 67% over a 12-month span. Elsewhere in the sector, Marathon Digital ( MARA ), MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) have all more than doubled in 2023 as well, including a rally of more than 150% by HUT.

42414413,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5mXy,1676571140,Flashbots Proposes New Class of ‘Matchmakers’ to Share MEV Gains With Ethereum Users,"Flashbots, a research firm formed to crack down on the unsavory practice of “maximal extractable value” or MEV on the Ethereum blockchain, proposed “MEV-Share” to distribute the gains more broadly.  The new protocol would distribute MEV to Ethereum users, rather than just to validators and data-block builders, according to a blog post on the Flashbots website.  MEV represents the profits made by validators and blockbuilders as a result of reordering or including certain transactions in certain data blocks. Initially seen as an abusive extra tax on users imposed by opportunistic traders wedging themselves into the blockchain process, the practice has become ubiquitous.  Currently, one of the ways that validators on Ethereum earn MEV is through MEV-Boost, a software that Flashbots developed in order to democratize MEV earned by validators and solve some issues of centralization.  MEV-Share aims for more collaboration between searches and users, and the new protocol would introduce an entity in the MEV supply chain called ""matchmakers."" The matchmaker’s job is to match searchers' transaction data bundles with users' private transactions (meaning their wallet addresses won’t be shared). Then the matchmaker returns those transactions to searchers to optimize the transaction bundles for MEV.  Once a bundle is successfully matched, they’re sent on to block builders, who are required to share some of the MEV back to the user’s wallet address.  Flasbots said that MEV-Share would be an early implementation of SUAVE, which is a blockchain that would aim to decentralize the block-building process.

A crypto-fueled experiment in digital media monetization is underway after Access Protocol airdropped tranches of its ACS token to early adopters of the Solana-based content subscription service.  On Wednesday, Access Protocol airdropped 20,000 ACS tokens apiece to members of a sign-up list. Holders can “stake” their ACS with content platforms like CoinGecko and The Block to gain access to paywalled and specialty content.  With the public token airdrop now over, traders have stepped in to juice the value of ACS over 300% since launch, according to CoinGecko, which conducted the distribution. It’s trading around 2 cents with a circulating market cap of $620 million. CoinGecko data shows nearly a third of ACS tokens have been unlocked thus far.  The early airdrops accounted for just 2% of the token’s initial allocation, according to a version of the pitch deck viewed by CoinDesk. Access Protocol has allocated 15% of the token supply towards the project’s team and foundation, 15% towards the project’s treasury and 68% towards “onboarding creators and their existing audiences.”  The pitch deck also revealed the token’s “annual inflation rate of 7% in perpetuity split 50/50 between creators and stakers.” Additionally, creators are encouraged to airdrop their tokens to readers in the hopes that readers will stake the ACS to view their content, thereby generating staking revenue for both the content creators and the consumers.  At press time, CoinGecko was in the lead as Access Protocol’s most popular staking spot, with over 530 million ACS locked.  The pitch materials also highlighted that crypto news outlet The Block (a CoinDesk competitor) would put 20% of their content behind the Access Paywall, while Wu Blockchain (a well-known Twitter account) would publish content on a “Access” Substack product. The news outlets partnering with Access Protocol also received a distribution of ACS tokens, according to people familiar with the matter.  A bevy of exchanges lined up to list ACS at launch including Coinbase. In a tweet, Product Manager Rishi Prasad said ACS is the first Solana-based token that Coinbase listed on its launch day – one sign of the exchange's openness to play ball with the new asset.  However, Access Protocol is reminiscent of past crypto projects that incentivized users to earn tokens by engaging in activities like gaming (play-to-earn) or walking (step-to-earn). While those projects initially saw the value of their tokens soar, those gains proved to be short-lived as inflationary tokenomics failed to support the price pumps. Access advised content creators to “gamify your pool with publicly viewable leaderboards” and “incentivize your loyal supporters through unique offerings (e.g., NFTs).”  Access Protocol’s Mika Honkasalo, who now runs the project’s foundation, did not respond to a request for comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | AIRDROP,"Tracy Wang, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/16/access-protocols-acs-token-rallies-after-web3-paywalls-public-airdrop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7c8f8eec6fbc8af7a70a23c967198290c47118d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414400,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5lLg,1676570581,TrueFi’s TRU Token Rallies Over 200% After Binance’s TUSD Mint Sparks Speculation,"TRU, the governance token of decentralized lending protocol TrueFi, surged 220% on Thursday in an hour, data by CoinMarketCap shows, in a speculative flurry over a Binance stablecoin transaction.  Before the rally took off, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, minted $50 million of TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin, according to blockchain data. The event sparked speculation among crypto traders about TUSD potentially gaining a larger role in trading on Binance after the regulatory crackdown on the Paxos-issued Binance USD (BUSD).  Read more: BUSD Drama Sets Stage for Stablecoin Market Reshuffling  However, the speculation about the TRU token appears to be misplaced because the issuers of the TrueUSD and TRU tokens were separated a while ago.  TrustToken sold TUSD in 2020 to a firm called Techteryx, according to an announcement by TrustToken Chief Executive Rafael Cosman at the time. The post said Techteryx is an ""Asia-based conglomerate with businesses ... in the traditional real estate, entertainment, environmental and information technology industries.""  TrustToken also separated from the TrueFi protocol and was renamed Archblock last year, as TrueFi embarked on a road to decentralize the platform.  ""Archblock is in the final stages of transferring all TrueFi IP and assets to the TrueFi Foundation, the TrueFi DAO’s legal entity,"" a TrueFi spokesperson told CoinDesk, referring to the decentralized autonomous organization.  TRU surged as high as 14.6 cents from 4.4 cents on Binance before later paring some of the gains. The token was trading at around 11 cents at press time.  Earlier this week, Paxos said it would halt minting BUSD on the order of state regulator New York Department of Financial Services. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells Notice to Paxos and reportedly was preparing a lawsuit for issuing unregistered securities.  BUSD is the third-largest stablecoin, with a $14 billion market capitalization in rapid decline, and was responsible for 35% of all trading volume on Binance, second to Tether’s USDT, according to data by crypto research firm Kaiko.

The addition of Tezos follows the recent announcement that Rarible would begin aggregating Polygon-based listings.  Alexander Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, told CoinDesk the company chose to integrate Tezos marketplaces into its aggregation tool in an effort to court crypto-native artists as well as collectors that favor sustainability.  Sign up for The Airdrop Newsletter, Your Weekly Wrap of Web3 Trends and News  Through its aggregation tool, collectors on Rarible will be able to purchase Tezos-based NFTs from marketplaces such as Objkt, fxhash, Teia and Versum.  “Tezos is very big among artist communities, among the exact community that Rarible started with,” said Salnikov. “Tezos landed with the most crypto native culture … it’s a carbon neutral chain, it is decentralized, it is more or less one of the chains that achieved scalability and lower transaction costs without compromising decentralization.”  “Rarible and Tezos also share a mutual respect for artists when it comes to creator royalties,” the company said in a press release, noting that to date, all Tezos marketplaces honor creator royalties, as does Rarible.  In addition to Tezos, Rarible has integrated support for Polygon NFTs listed on leading marketplace OpenSea. Salnikov told CoinDesk that because large-scale brands such as Starbucks are planning to deploy their Web3 initiatives on Polygon, the chain’s popularity is on its way to mainstream adoption.  Rarible has been building out its toolkit for creators for the past several months. In October 2022, Rarible launched its aggregator tool, which pulls NFT listings from competitor marketplaces and bolsters collectors’ access. In January, Rarible deployed its marketplace builder tool on Polygon, to allow creators to build custom marketplaces surrounding their NFT collections.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged as much as 10.7% to $25.21K earlier in the session, now changing hands at $24.80K at 12:21 p.m. ET. That extended its year-to-date gains to sub-50%. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) also rose markedly, up 8.6% to $1.71K. Both tokens, though, still have a lot of ground to cover to reach their respective November 2021 highs, as seen in this chart . At the same time, the two largest tokens by market cap ( BTC-USD ) ( ETH-USD ) both contributed to a 7.1% climb in the total value of the crypto market, standing at $1.12T at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data .

42421371,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuDF,1676567006,Sam Bankman-Fried’s Altruism Wasn’t Very Effective,"There are three things commonly known about Sam Bankman-Fried. The first is he led one of the biggest derivative cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The second is he will be tried for eight counts of money laundering, financial and elections fraud.  Together, these charges – to which Bankman-Fried has pleaded not-guilty – carry a possible penalty of 115 years in prison.  The third thing people often know is that he was a so-called effective altruist. As an industry professional who has been devoted to impactful applications of new technologies for a number of years, this last act of personal branding troubles me greatly.  Lucía Gallardo is the founder of regenerative finance climate project Emerge.  Effective altruism, in case you’ve never heard of it, is a philosophical and social movement that applies reason and evidence to determine, and then act upon, the most effective ways to benefit others. Peter Singer, a major advocate of the movement, said “effective altruism is about doing the most good you can, and that means being strategic and focused in your efforts. It means finding out where you can have the biggest impact, and then doing everything you can to make that impact as big as possible.” And Sam certainly went big.  He signed a Giving Pledge commitment of over $100 million. He supported effective altruism organizations, institutions focused on global catastrophic events and worked with charities such as Charity Science. He was also an advocate of animal welfare causes. How truly effective those acts were is still to be determined, but what is clear is that he was on a mission to be known as philanthropic, altruistic and good.  There is a long-standing debate in moral philosophy about whether actions can be considered moral if they have questionable underlying motivations. Both Socrates and Plato believed that acting morally required considering the broader well-being of others and the common good.  Someone should ask the millions of FTX users how they feel Sam scored on that requirement. But to those paying close attention, Sam’s underlying motivations began way before he could donate $100 million here or there. In fact, to me, Sam’s obsessive emphasis on his altruism was one of the most effective impact washing strategies we’ve seen in recent history.  See also: Is Sam Bankman-Fried Losing His Mind? / Opinion  Impact washing is the practice of misleading customers, donors, investors and/or the general public about the environmental or social benefits of a product, service or organization in order to attract them, as well as to maintain a positive reputation.  Impact washing can take many forms – from making false claims to using vague or misleading language, or even greatly exaggerating claims of impact efficacy. Impact washing misleads people, and it diverts resources and attention from truly impactful and effective initiatives. Worse, it erodes trust in those of us who are genuinely committed to doing good. Impact washing is prevalent across every sector, including the blockchain sector. FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried exemplify the very worst of it.  When adding up Sam’s philanthropic narrative with the actual measures taken to deliver impact outcomes, it becomes clear that the strategy was likely to make FTX, and even Sam himself, too good to be fraudulent. Sam’s narrative attracted investors excited about ESG. It drew in millennials and Gen-Z users, whom Nielsen has found are often willing to pay more for the products or services of companies they believe to be sustainable. And it drew in brand ambassadors like Gisele Bündchen, who is fiercely passionate about environmental causes.  Sam’s allegedly fraudulent donations to political campaigns drew in high-level politicians. And he used a number of donations in The Bahamas – including churches, schools and governmental bodies (including the local police) to build local favor that lingers even after his arrest. Yet, there seems to be little-to-no information on what actual impact outcomes FTX and Sam’s donations had.  See also: FTX Asks Politicians Who Received Bankman-Fried Donations to Return Money  FTX Climate, the company’s major initiative to allegedly build a better future for all of the planet’s inhabitants spent over $1 million on a one-time purchase of 100,000 tons worth of CO2 offsets from BurnStoves and Pachama yet made zero attempts to reduce their own carbon footprint. In fact, they made a statement about how “80% of all deposits and withdrawals on FTX are done using proof-of-stake blockchains, meaning they have no meaningful climate or carbon impacts, they are like sending an email.”  The statement is not only ridiculous, it’s also misleading because it doesn’t factor in the environmental footprint of all the computational power required to maintain their off chain systems and storage. For context, data centers currently consume around 200 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy per year, but we generate about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily which means the energy required by the technology sector increases steadily by 8% annually. Sending email after email has aggregated environmental consequences. And so did FTX.  In other words, for all of his altruism, I can’t for the life of me figure out where the effectiveness was – except in how he used it to mislead investors, users and the public about how he was worthy of their support and money.  See also: Anyone Who Took Money From FTX Ought to Repay It | Opinion  Sam was a strategically precise impact-washer. And industries are riddled with lesser versions of him – effective at crafting narratives about building a better world yet silently lacking in whatever words are supposed to come after that. It’s time we hold ourselves and others accountable to the ways we deliver on the promise of the technology designed to change the world. And if you’re building alongside us, consider the following:  Map the existing positive, negative and neutral impacts of your entire supply chain.  Bring innovative impact experience into your decision-making room. Embed impact into your core business objectives as more than a mission and vision. Turn it into concrete business-aligned strategies, with measurable actions and public transparency and accountability. When thoughtfully designed, impact is effective and profitable (it’s what we do every day at Emerge).  Deliver carbon reduction before carbon off-setting.  Learn about existing measurement frameworks, new updates on ESG reporting requirements in jurisdictions like the U.S. and Europe.  Assess your unintended consequences and then mitigate them.

42421383,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuPd,1676567006,What Fat Tails and Revolutionary Ages Mean for Digital Assets,"Stock market returns are overwhelmingly driven by a small group of winners. We expect the same trend in digital assets.  Between 1926 and 2016, just five out of 25,300 publicly traded companies drove 10% of the entire U.S. stock market’s $35 trillion of total wealth creation: Exxon Mobil (XOM), General Electric (GE), International Business Machines (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Ninety stocks accounted for more than half. Just shy of 1,100 generated the entire gain; the rest collectively returned less than U.S. Treasury bills.  Why so lopsided?  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Stock returns don’t fall along a normal distribution. They skew positively, with a few remarkable ones creating a “fat” right tail. Long-term investors who didn’t own those stocks risked missing out on the market’s average return.  We anticipate a fat right tail in digital asset returns, too. Bitcoin (BTC) is a great example of a wealth creator. We compared its returns to market-cap weighted portfolios of the top 10, 50 and 100 digital tokens (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) rebalanced monthly over the past five years. None of the broader portfolios outperformed BTC. The 50- and 100-token portfolios lost money over the period.  But why? What causes skewness in the first place?  We think a fundamental driver is technological revolutions. In her book “Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital,” Carlota Perez defines these as “a powerful and highly visible cluster of new and dynamic technologies, products and industries capable of bringing about an upheaval in the whole fabric of the economy.”  Perez identifies five technological revolutions since the late 18th century:  Each period begins with disruptive technological innovations that attract talent and risk capital, spawning an explosion of startups. Financial bubbles, corruption and collapse generally follow, eventually bringing regulation, management disciplines and productivity – a golden period of growth and profits. Since the Age of Steel, the golden periods have been dominated by large corporations. The longer the golden period, the greater the opportunity for winners to compound wealth.  Each of the five firms that drove 10% of all wealth creation since 1926 were market leaders of a recent Revolutionary Age:  Notably, each was founded at the beginning of an Age, maximizing the opportunity to compound returns for many years. But just being there wasn’t enough. These winners imagined a future others could not.  We are about 50 years past the dawn of the Information Age. It’s likely a new Age is forming. Will it be the Age of Digital Assets? In our view, digital assets alone are not enough to ignite a revolution. They are, however, a powerful innovation that, together with others such as artificial intelligence, robotics and genomics, have the potential to form a new Age.  If we’re right, the winners of this Age may be among today’s newcomers. Long-term investors would do well to make sure their portfolios include the potential wealth creators that will disproportionately drive market returns in the coming decades. We think digital assets are strong candidates.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jennifer Murphy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/16/what-fat-tails-and-revolutionary-ages-mean-for-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62c435b58a7342312f6008f799cd29f7feff5afc-5401x3265.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Unstoppable, which initially teamed up with Opera in April 2021 to offer support for its .crypto and .zil domains, will now grant users access to Polygon-based domain names such as .nft, .wallet, and .x. In doing so, Unstoppable will expand users’ access to their online digital identities, as well as allow Opera crypto wallet holders to use their domains to transfer cryptocurrencies.  Sandy Carter, senior vice president at Unstoppable Domains, told CoinDesk the partnership will allow it to grow its support of digital identities.  “Opera has over 11 million users, so they're huge, and the fact that they are a Web3 browser really enables us to jointly bring the power of digital identity to all of their users,” said Carter. “We believe that utility is greater than hype, and this enables us to bring yet another form of utility to all of the users of Unstoppable.”  In order to help onboard users in digitizing their identities, Opera is giving away free .nft domains to users that register with their Twitter handles.  After raising $65 million in a Series A funding round in July, Unstoppable Domains has been building its presence as an identity provider in the Web3 space. In December, the company integrated data services Etherscan and Polyscan to allow users to trace blockchain data on Unstoppable’s domains.

42414402,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5lWI,1676563216,Mt. Gox’s 2 Largest Creditors Pick Payout Option That Won’t Force Bitcoin Sell-Off: Sources,"The two biggest creditors of Mt. Gox, the crypto exchange that failed due to a hack nine years ago, have elected to get their bankruptcy recovery paid out mostly in bitcoin (BTC), according to people familiar with the matter.  Defunct New Zealand-based crypto exchange Bitcoinica and MtGox Investment Funds (MGIF) – which together represent about a fifth of all Mt. Gox claims – will, as a result, get paid 90% of their collectable funds (which are calculated at approximately 21% of what they had locked on the platform at the time of the hack in 2014).  Their decision to pick the former option could soothe longstanding fears among bitcoin holders that a wave of simultaneous liquidations tied to Mt. Gox bankruptcy recoveries could drive down the price of bitcoin. Had these two creditors opted to take the payout in fiat, the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy estate would likely have been compelled to sell off a significant portion of Mt. Gox’s recovered bitcoin holdings to fulfill all the fiat requests.  Read more: No, Mt. Gox Payouts Aren’t Going to Torpedo Bitcoin’s Price  The price of BTC jumped after CoinDesk reported this development, topping $25,000 for the first time since June.  Creditors who do choose to wait may have to hold tight for a while – the litigation surrounding the bankruptcy may take another five to nine years, documents reviewed by CoinDesk indicate. The move by Bitcoinica and MGIF removes a significant portion of the total claim from any future battle.  The payouts will come in as part of the early lump sum option offered to creditors, now expected on Sept. 30, though the Japanese trustee overseeing the repayment process has a history of kicking the can on past deadlines.  Creditors have waited nearly a decade to get a portion of their money back after Mt. Gox – one of the first and, at one time, the largest crypto exchange in the world – was hacked in 2014. Hackers made off with 850,000 BTC, a sum valued at $460 million at the time. After the hack, Mt. Gox was left with approximately 142,000 BTC, 143,000 bitcoin cash (BCH), and 69 billion Japanese yen.  Creditors selecting the lump sum option can choose between receiving their payout in a combination of BTC, BCH and yen, or they can request the entire amount be paid in fiat. In opting for the early payout, Bitcoinica and MGIF have also opted to receive the crypto option, where the largest-possible portion of their payouts will be in BTC, sources told CoinDesk.  Opting for Mt. Gox’s 'bird in the hand' payout  If creditors don’t want to take the early lump sum at 90% of the amount owing, the only other option creditors have is to wait for the end of civil rehabilitation litigation (which includes a lawsuit by CoinLab, a now-defunct partner exchange, against Mt. Gox’s estate).  In theory, this option could yield a slightly higher recovery, but creditors have no guarantee that it won’t potentially be lower than the 90% of recoverable holdings guaranteed by the lump sum payout.  A legal analysis by a Japanese law firm suggested it could take many years for holdouts to see their money returned.  Creditors have until March 10, 2023, to decide whether to take the offered early lump sum or keep waiting for a potentially larger payout at an undetermined date in the future.

Starting Thursday, project builders that pre-registered for the the newly-dubbed “zkSync Era” platform will be able deploy their apps onto the network for the first time. The Era chain will be closed to general users, but app developers will be allowed to test their code in preparation for a full launch sometime in the coming months.  “People were expecting zkEVMs to arrive five years from now, but here we are, and it’s actually fully working,” Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski told CoinDesk.  According to Gluchowski, zkSync Era has over “200 projects lined up” to deploy on its platform.  Matter Labs told CoinDesk that it is fully open-sourcing Era’s code, as long-promised, and is re-naming the legacy zkSync 1.0 platform to “zkSync Lite.”  ZK-what?  So-called zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) like zkSync Era represent a new breed of Ethereum rollup projects – layer 2 blockchains that allow users to transact on Ethereum with greater speeds and lower fees.  Layer 2 rollups like zkSync Era bundle user transactions and then pass them down to the layer 1 Ethereum blockchain, where they are “settled” using the main chain’s battle-tested security apparatus. Like other upcoming zkEVMs, zkSync Era uses zero-knoweldge proofs to power its systems under the hood. Unlike earlier ZK rollups (such as zkSync Lite, which could only handle certain kinds of applications), “zkEVMs” like zkSync Era should be able to support any existing Ethereum app.  Matter Labs has raised over $200 million so far to build out its zkEVM platform. Along with other zkEVM builders, Matter is betting that zero-knowledge cryptography will, in the long term, offer a more secure and efficient alternative to “optimistic” technology – the mechanism that powers quicker-to-market rollup incumbents like Arbitrum and Optimism.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  The rollup race  Matter Labs’ announcement comes a day after a major competitor in the zkEVM space, the Ethereum scaling giant Polygon, locked in March 27 as its official launch date. A blog post from Polygon did not specify exactly what features its zkEVM “beta” will include when it deploys on Ethereum’s main network, but the team boasted that the March launch date would officially make Polygon zkEVM the first zkEVM to market.  Matter Labs would not say when its own network would launch in full, emphasizing that the decision will be “dictated by security considerations” and will depend on how the network performs after it opens up to developers.  “We put security above marketing hype,” Gluchowski told CoinDesk.  Gluchowski framed Matter Labs’ “Fair Onboarding” stage as a landmark achievement for the Ethereum ecosystem.  “It's more than just a milestone,” said Gluchowski. “It's the first time in history that projects can actually deploy on a ZK rollup on Ethereum.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | ARB | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/16/matter-labs-says-zksync-20-entering-new-era-with-re-brand-and-developer-rollout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39f8449cad68a0274f938b62f2adf305da498611-5311x3541.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414415,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5mdH,1676559251,"FTX’s Bahamas Unit Commingled Client, Corporate Funds, Liquidators Say","FTX Digital Markets Ltd, the Bahamas arm of the collapsed crypto exchange, appears to have commingled corporate funds with client money, liquidators said in a Feb. 8 document filed in a Bahamas court.  The comments made in the interim accounting report echo those from John J. Ray III, the new boss of FTX’s U.S. entity, who has repeatedly lamented a lack of corporate controls at the company before he took over on Nov. 11.  “It appears that client monies have been commingled such that it may not be possible to clearly identify sums that constitute client monies as opposed to general corporate funds,” said the report authored by Lennox Paton’s Brian Simms and PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) Kevin Cambridge and Peter Greaves. The trio were jointly appointed by a Bahamas court as liquidators on Nov. 10 and Nov. 14.  Bank balances of $137 million labeled as for the benefit of FTX Digital’s customers were subject to only “limited controls and governance”; meaning, in practice, they weren’t segregated, the report said.  Of the $219.5 million total balance FTX Digital held in banks, $21.5 million has been realized by the liquidators, and a further $54.5 million is pending transfer to them, the document said. Another $143.2 million held in U.S. accounts has been seized by the Department of Justice, and other funds have been contested until the Bahamas bankruptcy is recognized in the U.S., the document said.  A Feb. 15 decision by bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in Delaware to grant Chapter 15 recognition to the Bahamas entity is an “important step” in the liquidation, Greaves said in an emailed statement. He added that liquidators “hope now to be in a position to work through the various roadblocks that have prevented us taking full control of FTX Digital's assets and information.”  The judge was informed on Wednesday of a $7.7 billion transfer between FTX’s Bahamas and U.S. arms, a sum that may now become subject to legal dispute.  Former senior executives from FTX have been charged with crimes including wire fraud and money laundering by the U.S. DOJ. While some have entered a plea deal, founder Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.

Davidson on growing regulatory risks,"Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) stock retreated as much as 5.2% in Thursday premarket trading after D.A. Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler downgraded shares of the cryptocurrency exchange to Neutral from Buy on the basis of its outsized year-to-date rally even as regulatory pressures ramp up. Since the start of 2023, COIN has more than doubled ( +106.4% ), coinciding with broader risk-on sentiment towards the crypto market and other risk assets, namely technology stocks. That's despite recent crypto-focused enforcement actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In just the last week, the regulator charged crypto exchange Kraken for failing to register its staking platform, and separately was said to have taken aim at stablecoin issuer Paxos Company Trust for breaching investor protection laws. Also, the SEC on Feb. 14 proposed to make it harder for crypto firms to become qualified custodians. As such, the SEC has indirectly targeted three of Coinbase's ( COIN ) business lines -- stablecoins, staking and custody. The ""SEC is clearly taking a more combative stance on crypto,"" Brendler wrote in a note, following November's multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ). ""While we still agree with mgmt's view that improved clarity and a level playing field should ultimately prove to be good for both Coinbase ( COIN ) and the sector overall, the near-term path looks increasingly treacherous,"" he contended. The slump in COIN shares comes even as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) shot up 7.6% to $24.40K at the time of writing.

42414408,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5m7R,1676556653,BUSD Drama Sets Stage for Stablecoin Market Reshuffling,"The uncertain future for embattled stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD) is stirring discord in the dollar-pegged crypto markets that one analyst says could accelerate into a dramatic reshuffling of the sector’s big winners and losers.  With regulators this week forcing the issuer of BUSD to cease minting new tranches of the coin, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, risks running headlong into the ramifications of its decision in September to give preference to BUSD as a trading pair.  That’s creating an opening for the two other big names in stablecoin markets: Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT. According to Kaiko researcher Conor Ryder, USDT will likely be the short-term winner as market makers ,and perhaps even Binance itself, tap that as the trader favorite over BUSD.  The potential shakeup comes as traders continue to move stablecoins off centralized exchanges. Outbound transfers of coins such as USDC and USDT on the Ethereum blockchain have outpaced deposits for nine consecutive days, according to data from Nansen. It is a ramping-up of the withdrawal trend that began in earnest with FTX’s collapse in early November.  “It’s very possible that after all the exchange fear from last year that holders of stablecoins have moved away from CEXs,” said Ryder, referring to centralized exchanges. He said another downward force has been market makers reducing stablecoin liquidity since the start of 2023.  The drawdown is even more acute when viewed through specific exchanges. In the last week, Coinbase’s stablecoin balances have dropped $411 million, or 53%, while Bitfinex’s balances fell $173 million, 57%.  No one has lost more than Binance, however. Its on-exchange stablecoin trove has shrunk by $1.5 billion in the past seven days. That this figure only represents an 8% decrease is a testament to how much larger Binance is than everyone else.  Some of these funds are landing on decentralized exchanges (DEX), said Dheraz Ahmed, managing director at STORM Partners. “This trend doesn't just stay with stablecoins,"" he said. ""There has been an overall movement from CEXs to DEXs.”  Binance’s stablecoin troubles are more acute than everyone else's. After months of heartily promoting its BUSD stablecoin over competitors including USDC, the trading juggernaut is facing rising pressure from U.S. regulators, who this week ordered partner company Paxos to cease issuing the coin.  Over $2 billion worth of BUSD has been withdrawn from exchanges to be burned – i.e., permanently removed from circulation – in the past week, with Paxos alone destroying $700 million of BUSD held in its treasury.  One other area where the winds may soon shift is in USDC, Ryder said. While USDC was being used less and less on CEXs and more on DEXs lately, that could easily flip if Circle manages to avoid a similar fate to Paxos as the stablecoin market has been blown wide open.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | BNB | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/16/busd-drama-sets-stage-for-stablecoin-market-reshuffle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7cad3cccd12bd05fd6ea6867a010aefeb9d3e86-3027x3784.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company said it expects to pay $32.3 million for 20,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro+ mining rigs, after knocking the price down by 25% with coupons and discounts. That works out at $13.25 per terahash (TH), which is lower than the market price of $15.09 per TH for the S19j Pro+ category recorded on mining firm Luxor Technologies' price index. The price of mining rigs is often measured in dollars per terahash, a measure of computing power, because different machines have different specifications.  The miner started buying assets from rivals struggling to make ends meet during the market downturn as far back as June. Over the past few months, the sector has been hit hard by the slumping price of bitcoin and high energy costs, with major companies including Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ) ending up in bankruptcy courts. Since the start of 2023, the situation has improved slightly along with energy markets.  Once installed, the new machines will add 2.44 exahash/second (EH/s) to CleanSpark’s 6.6 EH/s of bitcoin mining power, a 37% increase. They will be delivered from the manufacturer to CleanSpark in batches by the end of May. CleanSpark plans to install 15,000 of them in its Washington, Georgia facility, which it acquired from Waha Technologies in August, depending on how an expansion of the site pans out.  CleanSpark plans to reach 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of 2023.  Bitmain released the Antminer S19j Pro+ in December. The model's performance was improved by 10% compared with the previous generation, it said. The manufacturer has been offering coupons and discounts since mid-2022 to boost sales, the coupons have ended up up for sale as companies filed for bankruptcy.

The capital will help Salsa expand its newly launched mobile app to brands looking for a crypto-native way to engage their audiences.  The Salsa mobile app, now available in beta, helps users discover and connect with relevant people and brands. Users log into Salsa using their wallet or decentralized ID and the app uses on-chain data to suggest what users have in common, such as a recent event attendance or participation in a Web3 community. The point is to bring users over from Web2 platforms such as Telegram or Discord, which don’t natively understand on-chain data and can provide a fragmented user experience.  “No one wants to message with a wallet address where it’s like '0x something something.' You have no context around who this person is. You’re probably not going to want to say that much to them,” Salsa CEO Helena Gagern, who co-founded the startup last year with Chief Technology Officer Grace Wang, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “[Salsa] gives you a lot of scope in terms of understanding who that real person is behind a wallet address while still allowing them to remain anonymous,” she added.  Salsa is launching its app in partnership with POAP, a “Proof of Attendance Protocol” that lets users mint memories like event attendance as digital collectibles. POAP is used by leading brands including Adidas, Ebay, Goldman Sachs and Vogue. Salsa can be used to create and claim POAPs within its own app and has a direct integration with the POAP mobile app.  Other backers in the round included Superscrypt and a number of angel investors, including Nader Al-Naji, Liam Horne, Dan Romero, Balaji Srinivasan, Henri Stern, Khan Tasinga, Patricio Worthalter and Gmoney.

The assets, which offer a discount of 10%-30% on Bitmain purchases for a limited period, can be sold to any bona fide third party, but with the consent of a committee representing Celsius’ unsecured creditors, bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn said.  Glenn’s order, dated Feb. 16 did not cover a request to sell Bitmain credits, which are accrued when mining rigs are pre-paid, and which Celsius had estimated could raise a further $7 million.  Earlier this week Celsius set out plans to reorganize and sell its assets, sponsored by investment firm NovaWulf.

42414422,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB61x8,1676553451,Only 31% of Staked Ether May Be Profitable: Binance Research,"Analysis by Binance Research has found that a notable minority of ether holders who staked their ETH in Ethereum's Beacon Chain over the past three years are making money, while the rest are underwater.  Ethereum staking involves users locking their ETH tokens to validate transactions in return for a reward paid out in ether. Staking, therefore, is referred to as passive investing – coins lying dormant in self-custody or in an exchange wallet to use. Currently, onchain annualized staking yields are around 4%.  More than 16.5 million ether, worth $27.7 billion, has been staked since Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, of which 31% or 5.115 million ETH are in profit while the rest, 11.385 million ETH, are in loss, according to Binance Research.  The loss here means ether's current going market rate is less than the rate prevalent when they were locked in the Beacon chain.  The analysis comes at a time the market is trying to gauge potential selling pressure following Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for mid-March. The highly anticipated upgrade is set to open withdrawals of staked ETH.  Per Binance Research, those underwater have little incentive to liquidate their holdings after the Shanghai upgrade. Meanwhile, those in profit are likely to keep holding.  ""We note a sizable amount of ETH (around 2M) was staked at prices in the US$400-$700 range – this represents the earliest stakers in [December] 2020 – a group that is likely illiquid given that liquid staking was far less known at the time,"" Binance Research noted in the report published early Thursday.  ""While this is a considerable chunk of staked ETH and is currently at profit, given these were the earliest stakers in the market, we can imagine these are some of the strongest Ethereum believers,"" Binance Research said.  Note that the whole staking balance cannot be withdrawn on the day of the upgrade. Besides, only 43,200 ETH can be unstaked per day. However, the total staking reward earned, which comes to around 1 million ETH, can be withdrawn instantly, according to Saxo Bank.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/16/binance-research-says-31-of-ether-stakers-are-in-profit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6e244bb8010f6c609a5c98d2f72928a2f3d3a23-1491x1160.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest crypto by market cap rose as high as $24,898 early Thursday, its strongest level since Aug. 15. It’s since retreated to just under $24,500. Bitcoin in recent days had dipped below $21,600 amid growing investor concern over regulatory risk teamed with ideas that the U.S. Federal Reserve still had a long way to go to tame inflation. Investors, for now, appear to be shrugging off those concerns.  As U.S. regulators continue to sniff around Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange is prepared to pay monetary penalties to “make amends” for past regulatory violations, according to The Wall Street Journal. The exchange grew quickly and was not initially aware of the myriad laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering, sanctions evasion, and corruption, Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann told the WSJ on Wednesday. Binance expects to face fines, said Hillman, and is “working with regulators to figure out what are the remediations we have to go through now to make amends for [past violations].”  FTX sent $7.7 billion in assets from the crypto company's Bahamian unit to its U.S. counterparts in the period leading up to its bankruptcy filing last year, a Delaware bankruptcy court was told during a Wednesday hearing. Court-appointed joint provisional liquidators in the Bahamas said that $5.6 billion was transferred from Bahamas unit FTX Digital's custodial accounts to U.S. entity FTX trading, while another $2.1 billion was transferred to FTX's U.S. trading arm, Alameda Research. FTX's new management reached a cooperation agreement in early January with court-appointed liquidators in the Bahamas to iron out disagreements and address the assets in dispute.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows increased activity in bitcoin call options or bullish bets relative to puts or bearish options in the past 24 hours.  Per Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm, big call spreads, a bullish strategy, have been traded in the wake of Interactive Brokers' decision to roll out BTC, and ETH trading to professional investors in Hong Kong.  ""Animal spirits waking up in Asia,"" Chu tweeted while noting the bullish options market flows.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Accused Mango Markets Exploiter Wants to Keep $47M in Disputed Funds: Court Filings  Short Trades Make up 90% of $200M in Losses as Bitcoin, Ether Surge  Coinbase, Anchorage Digital Say They'd Be OK Under SEC Custody Proposal, But Risks May Lurk for Others",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/16/first-mover-americas-lido-daos-governance-token-jumps-17,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d27f2a5c22145e08878f6779e26ee4cb72253ebd-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414434,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB62tV,1676552669,Crypto Startups Are Increasingly Postponing Token Launch Plans as Alameda Research's Contagion Effects Linger,"The crypto market is struggling with an ""Alameda gap,"" where several projects are postponing their token launch plans because of a lack of liquidity despite surging bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) prices.  Data from CoinMarketCap shows that new coin applications fell throughout 2022, from 10,264 in the first quarter to 6,350 in the fourth. The drop accelerated toward year's end after crypto exchange FTX and its sister concern Alameda Research collapsed in November. Before going bust, Alameda was one of the largest market makers, providing billions of dollars of liquidity to large-cap and small-cap tokens.  Year to date, the figure is just 3,000 applications.  “Post-FTX we have seen liquidity dry as up to 50% on major coins,” Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of Paris-based market maker and brokerage Flowdesk, said in an email. “On smaller market caps, the liquidity reduction has been even worse because Alameda has closed all their support for token issuers and other big market makers have reduced their exposure and activity.”  Chaumont said he is advising projects to postpone by three to six months. Flowdesk expects the bear market to be around for another 12 to 18 months.  Last month, the recently decentralized exchange dYdX said it was planning to delay its token unlock, which would release more than 150 million tokens to early investors and founders, to December 2023 with hopes that the market will have recovered by then. People familiar with the matter say it is because of concern over market liquidity.  Liquidity in bitcoin and ether markets as measured by the 2% market depth has dried up since Alameda went down, making it harder for traders to execute big orders without affecting the market price and for projects to issue new tokens.  The 2% depth represents a collection of the buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price – the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices being quoted at a given time. Data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko show the 2% market depth for BTC fell to less than 8,000 BTC in January even as the cryptocurrency rallied over 40%.  “Crypto liquidity is dominated by just a handful of trading firms, including Wintermute, Amber Group, B2C2, Genesis, Cumberland, and (the now-defunct) Alameda. With the loss of one of the largest market makers, we can expect a significant drop in liquidity, which we will call the “Alameda Gap,” Kaiko wrote in a November briefing note.  Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that balances at key market makers have dropped. Cumberland currently has a balance of $75 million, down from around $220 million in early December; Wintermute has $122 million, compared with $1.7 billion last February and $4 billion at the end of October 2021, when the bull market reached its peak.  Amber Group, which jettisoned a sponsorship deal with U.K. soccer team Chelsea in December, has been through multiple rounds of layoffs. Arkham says it currently has a balance of $92 million, down from a peak of about $350 million in mid-2022.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, said March Zheng, the co-founder and managing partner of Bizantine Capital.  “Crypto markets are cyclical in nature, but it needs stress test conditions like the last few months to prove its resiliency for the long term,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “New token issuance activity has been down, but it gives more opportunity for incumbent and top projects.”  Zheng points to developments in Hong Kong as bullish sentiments for the market.

42410840,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1eN,1676552462,Tornado Cash Dev’s Criminal Case in Europe May Hinge on Laptop Access,"Dutch prosecutors investigating Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev have recently gained access to his laptop, and are now using the data to probe key features of the case including whether he personally profited from the privacy service.  An otherwise largely procedural hearing held Wednesday – which left Pertsev languishing in a Dutch jail as he awaits a full trial – revealed prosecutors are beginning to make inroads into a controversial case that has drawn criticism from the crypto community.  The Dutch government says Pertsev is guilty of money laundering for contributing to the privacy protocol, which the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control says has been used to process funds for the North Korean missile program. Pertsev denies those charges, and some worry the case effectively criminalizes writing open-source code.  But it appears that the government has yet to gain key evidence it would need to make its case, including whether Pertsev orchestrated Tornado’s development or profited from transactions.  Read more: ‘We Are All F****d’: The Developers of Tornado Cash and the Future of Crypto  After Dutch financial crime service FIOD succeeded in unlocking Pertsev’s computer the previous Wednesday, “it is apparent from the first scan that the suspect still has wallets in various places and nodes,” public prosecutor Martine Boerlage said at the trial in ‘S-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.  It will become “clearer in the short term” whether Pertsev had acted as a relay in the network, Boerlage added, saying she also hoped for more information about the management of Peppersec, the cybersecurity company for which he served as a board member.  Relays are an optional add-on to the Tornado Cash service, offering users an extra layer of privacy in exchange for a fee. Pertsev’s attorney, Keith Cheng, told CoinDesk that there’s no evidence he operated a relay.  The prosecution is hoping to make the case that, by steering proposals and votes relating to the decentralized autonomous organization that governed the protocol, Petsev and others played more than a passive role in Tornado operations.  The defense, meanwhile, wants to ensure the judges understand how decentralized anonymizing systems like Tornado work and, crucially, how they differ from bitcoin mixers on which there is already case law.  A series of expert reports cited in court by Cheng set out that TORN tokens that govern the protocol can be purchased by anyone on the open market, and that a special add-on tool ensures Tornado can be fully compliant with the law – placing the liability solely on the user or receiver of funds.  “It is the person who wields the knife that is responsible for the good or bad outcomes,” Cheng said.  For Boerlage, Tornado’s compliance tool is neither here nor there because it applies only after funds have been processed, while Pertsev is being accused of involvement in “layering,” the central step of money laundering which obfuscates the source of funds, she said.  The trial will continue on April 20.

42414417,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB61RI,1676552400,Startup Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol Completes First Transaction of Clean Mining Tokens,"The Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), a startup that aims to encourage miners to utilize environmentally friendly energy sources using tokenization, has completed its first transaction of a clean bitcoin mining blockchain asset.  The SBP issues the Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate (SBC), an on-chain environmental asset that represents bitcoin mined using clean energy, verified by a third party. Miners that use clean energy can participate in the program at no extra cost. By allowing miners to sell SBC, the protocol hopes to incentivize them to use clean energy as another revenue stream opens up to them.  Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), which primarily uses nuclear power in the U.S. state of Georgia, sold SBC to Melanion Digital, the digital assets arm of alternative investment and asset management firm Melanion Capital, according to a press release sent to CoinDesk.  The environmental impact of bitcoin mining has come increasingly under scrutiny in the past year or so by both legislators and activists.  In the pilot transaction, each SBC was sold for $980, based on the additional costs incurred for a bitcoin miner to mine a single coin, said Elliot David, head of climate strategy and partnerships at SBP, in an email to CoinDesk.  The SBC was sold ""with a discount to the market price because this was the first transaction of its kind. Based on today’s bitcoin energy consumption levels, we estimate that SBC would sell now for approximately $1,150, which is roughly a 5% revenue add to a miner’s bottom line,"" if they're using 100% clean energy, David said.  Under the model, miners can also gain SBC for free by fueling their operations with natural gas that would otherwise be wasted. The protocol may also invest in and retire other renewable energy credits to address the historic energy use of the network.  The transaction is a ""seminal moment for the bitcoin industry,"" said Wu Jihan, one of the co-founders of mining machine behemoth Bitmain, who now runs cloud mining firm BitDeer.

42414421,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB61mW,1676552400,Web3 Communication Stack Sending Labs Raises $12.5M,"Sending Labs, which aims to provide an easier way for developers and users to create and interact with decentralized applications (dapps) built around communication, has raised $12.5 million in a seed funding round co-led by Insignia Venture Partners, MindWorks Capital, and Signum Capital. The company also announced the beta launch of its first two products.  The startup's flagship product is the SendingNetwork, a software development kit (SDK) that helps developers create secure dapps that include in-app or cross-app chats, notifications, wallet or decentralized ID logins and non-fungible token (NFT) transactions. There is also SendingMe, an encrypted, decentralized group chat platform built on the SendingNetwork. Users have full control of their identification, data and assets. Communities have full autonomy on interactions, engagement and rewards.  Decentralized ownership, a key tenet of crypto, has garnered even more attention after the collapse of multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX. Web3 – a vertical often centered around communities – has a particular responsibility to give users control over their assets and identities.  “We firmly believe that Web3 and decentralized group messaging is the first step to return data ownership back to the user,” Sending Labs co-founder and CEO Joe Yu said in a statement. “Closing this funding round and launching our beta simultaneously shows a clear vote of confidence in our products and their potential to spark holistic Web3 growth. This can only be done by creating tools that work for builders creating its architecture and for users harnessing its community-building power.”  The Austin, Texas-based company was co-founded by Yu and Mason Yang, who also co-founded MoboTap, the company behind early Android-based mobile app Dolphin.  Other investors backing the round included K3 Ventures, Lingfeng Innovation Fund, UpHonest Capital and Aipollo Investment.

When Binance started it was run by software engineers without knowledge of laws that deal with bribery, corruption, money laundering, and economic sanctions, Patrick Hillman told the WSJ . While it's striving to address the early shortfalls in it compliance efforts, the company still expects regulators will impose fines for past conduct, he said. The firm is ""working with regulators to figure out what are the remediations we have to got through now to make amends for that,"" he said Wednesday. He expects the result will be ""likely a fine, could be more... We just don't know. That is for regulators to decide."" Binance, which has no global headquarters, started in China in 2017 by CEO Changpeng Zhao. Its executive team, including CZ as he is called, has spent time in Japan after China banned crypto, and with it crypto exchanges. Currently, Binance isn't available to U.S. traders, Hillman said. As crypto has become a bigger business and attracted more traders and investors, regulators have taken notice. The U.S. Justice Department has been investigating Binance for potential violations of U.S. anti-money-laundering law, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into whether the company is offering crypto derivatives to U.S. clients without properly registering the activity, the people said. Earlier this week, the New York Department of Financial Services said Paxos Trust Company, the stablecoin issuer behind Binance's stablecoin ( BUSD-USD ), failed to safely administe r the token.

After DePaolo completes his transition into an advisory role, Howell will also be named as CEO, the bank said. Until then, DePaolo retains the CEO role and his seat on the board. It is unclear how long the transitionary period will last. Signature Bank did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.  DePaolo’s departure comes as Signature Bank continues to grapple with the fallout of crypto exchange FTX, which the bank was involved with, but likely not linked to the resignation, according to Wells Fargo analyst Jared Shaw.  “This is not a surprise at all, it was in process for a while,” Shaw told CoinDesk. “I feel very confident this has nothing to do with any issue or concern.”  While the new CEO Howell isn’t particularly known to push the bank’s crypto strategy forward, his replacement isn't a sign that Signature is stepping away from the industry, Shaw said.  “He’s probably not been the driving force behind crypto [...] I don't think that anyone should read into that that they're not committed to staying in crypto,” he said. “I think it is still a commitment but as we saw this past quarter, they don't want to have a concentration risk with it from the deposit side.”  Under DePaolo's leadership, Signature's Nasdaq-listed shares soared as high as $344.89 a year ago amid the last crypto bull market. By the end of 2022, following the collapse in cryptocurrency valuations and the onset of the crypto winter, the stock had lost 66% of its value, closing 2022 around $113. This year, they've gained about 18%, rising alongside the crypto market. At the time of writing, SBNY shares are down 3.6% to $130 in pre-market trading.  The bank has been attempting to reduce its involvement in digital assets following the market downturn that started last year and came to a head with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November.  Signature said it would be shrinking its deposits tied to cryptocurrencies by $8 billion to $10 billion in December. Last month, Binance said Signature would no longer handle transactions of less than $100,000 for crypto exchange customers.

42414416,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB61Lz,1676546661,Accused Mango Markets Exploiter Wants to Keep $47M in Disputed Funds: Court Filings,"Crypto trader Avraham Eisenberg is seeking to keep some of the funds he is accused of draining from decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Mango Markets in October.  Eisenberg claims he does not need to return any more than $67 million of the $114 million worth of tokens he gained using a complicated trading system, according to a court filing dated Feb. 15.  Mango Markets is taking legal action to seek the rest of the money claiming fraudulent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment among other claims. It also filed an application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  Eisenberg is arguing that the DAO previously decided the matter was closed following a settlement agreement between the two parties. Thus, he is seeking for the restraining order to be dismissed, claiming that Mango should be required to post a bond equal to the present value of the currency restrained.  The disagreement is over the legitimacy of a governance vote that Mango Markets passed in order to retrieve a portion of Eisenberg's exploit funds. Mango Labs, which is representing the DAO in court, says that contract, which let Eisenberg keep much of his haul in exchange for a promise not to sue him, is void because Mango voters agreed to it under duress.  His legal team say the duress argument holds no water and should be discarded. The dueling positions may force the judge in this case to evaluate the particulars of crypto governance – a rare clash between smart contract law and actual law.  Eisenberg also faces legal action by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on market manipulation grounds.

This is despite the finding of a key trend that investors are shifting to noncrypto-based solutions in the wake of the crypto contagion in 2022. The second half of 2022 saw a ""particularly noticeable"" decline as investors digested the falls of Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX, KPMG's findings said.  In Singapore, crypto-related funding fell by 21% from $1.5 billion in 2021 to $1.2 billion in 2022. Globally, investments in the space fell from $30 billion in 2021 to $23.1 billion in 2022.  ""The variance between the first half of the year and the second highlights the rapid shift in investor sentiment,"" said Anton Ruddenklau, global head of Financial Services Innovation and Fintech, KPMG International. ""But the news wasn't all negative. Regtech, in particular, saw incredible investment in 2022.""  The Regtech space attracted a new high of $18.6 billion in investment, well above the previous record of $12.1 billion seen in 2021. The report said this growth is aimed at ensuring that such digital or crypto-related transactions are accurate, transparent, reliable and compliant.  For 2023, KPMG has predicted that it is ""likely investments in crypto-focused firms will remain very slow"" and a potential shift ""in investment to jurisdictions with stronger regulatory frameworks for crypto activities.""  One trend from 2022 is expected to grow in 2023 – the shift of investors from blockchain companies focused on the retail market to startups focused on providing solutions for the SME market.  ""While investment in crypto is expected to be particularly weak in H1 '23 ... the broader area of blockchain-based solutions – including institutional use cases, cross-border payments, gaming, and NFTs – will likely gain additional attention from investors.""  The report also reflected a trend that the fintech sector is expanding access to a broader base of investors by giving the example of the $300 million raise by Singapore-based crypto firm Amber which was the second largest wealth-tech deal of the year.

The FSB will also explore the extent to which its proposed policy recommendations for the crypto sector needs to be enhanced to address risks specific to DeFi, the report said. In collaboration with other international standard-setters, it also plans to explore how to fill data gaps in measuring and monitoring the interconnectedness of DeFi with traditional finance.  “DeFi does not differ substantially from traditional finance in the functions it performs or the vulnerabilities to which it is exposed,” the FSB said in a Thursday press release.  Regulators around the world have been monitoring how interlinked the crypto space has been with the real economy as businesses and banks dove into the sector during the crypto boom that started in 2021. Since then, billions have been wiped out from crypto markets and prompted successive collapses including that of token issuer Terra, crypto lender Celsius Network and crypto exchange FTX. The market turmoil has only encouraged regulators to set up better safeguards for people investing in crypto.  The FSB is no exception. In December it vowed to take a closer look at DeFi-specific risks and vulnerabilities. It also proposed a framework for the international regulation of crypto activities in October. The FSB said on Thursday that it expects to publish its final crypto regulatory framework in July.  “The FSB may consider whether subjecting these crypto-asset types and entities to additional prudential and investor protection requirements, or stepping up the enforcement of existing requirements, could reduce the risks inherent in closer interconnections,” the report said.  Although its findings show that the interlinkages between DeFi, the real economy and traditional finance are limited, “if the DeFi ecosystem were to grow significantly, then the scope for spillovers would increase,” the FSB said.  The body said it will carry out additional work to analyze the implications of asset tokenization which it says could increase linkages between the DeFi market and the real economy.  Operational fragilities, liquidity and maturity mismatches and leverage make the DeFi sector vulnerable, the FSB said.

SoftBank said Oasys' advanced technological capabilities served both users and intellectual property holders.  Bandai Namco Research, SEGA, Square Enix and Netmarble are among the 21 initial validators for Oasys. Softbank added alongside three more companies, taking the total to 25. Network validators are entities that verify transactions on any blockchain network, helping keep it secure.  Softbank was an active investor in crypto projects last year. In April it led a $16 million round into Community Gaming, which looks to bring crypto into eSports. It also backed a $300 million Web3 fund in conjunction with Deutsche Telekom in September.  In just over a year since its formation, Oasys has fully launched its mainnet blockchain protocol, with over a dozen playable games available. Oasys raised $21 million in a token sale that ended mid-December. On Jan. 31, it announced plans to list on the Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank.  In January Oasys announced a plan to gradually shift its Singapore-registered entity into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This phased approach, the company said, will gradually delegate decision-making authority to Oasys tokenholders in a democratic and transparent manner, helping the firm avoid what it calls ""centralization risk.""

42414420,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB61bu,1676534929,Privacy-Focused Gnosis Chain Co-Founder Proposes Plan to Reduce Ethereum Dependency for GNO Token,"The co-founder of privacy-focussed Ethereum sidechain Gnosis, Martin Köppelmann, has proposed plans to reduce external dependencies and increase the security of GNO tokens on Ethereum and Gnosis.  In a preliminary discussion on the Gnosis governance forums, Köppelmann said that while GNO was initially minted on Ethereum, the GNO tokens comes from a bridge contract and represent a claim against GNO on Ethereum – which may open up potential security issues for the tokens if “unexpected events could lead to a difference between the two.”  Köppelmann cited bridge risks as a key factor in his proposal. “Currently, the bridge has the right to mint unlimited GNO tokens on Gnosis,” he wrote. “Of course, it is only supposed to mint GNO tokens on Gnosis if an equivalent amount has been locked on Ethereum (and that should be limited), but bridges are unfortunately still a potential source of hacks and bugs and thus are a risk.”  “Every bridge bug is very dangerous in any case but as GNO is relevant for the consensus of the chain it is especially true for GNO,” Köppelmann added.  Bridges refer to blockchain-based tools that transfer tokens between different blockchain networks. But this important software became a major security risk last year as exploiters managed to find weak points that led to $2 billion lost or stolen from cross-chain bridges, as CoinDesk reported.  Another focal point of discussion is the 10 million supply of GNO tokens on Ethereum. Köppelmann said that 7 million of these tokens are supposed to be burned, there is currently no way for this to be “enforced by code” – or automatically by a smart contract if predetermined conditions are met.  “Changing the “source of truth” for GNO to Gnosis chain would give us the opportunity to enforce the DAO vote in code,” Köppelmann noted.  The proposed solutions include increasing the supply of GNO on Gnosis to 3 million, removing the bridge's right to mint new GNO, and creating a separate system contract to mint new GNO if withdrawals from the Ethereum blockchain occur.  “In practice, those changes should not affect the GNO token on Ethereum or the GNO token on Gnosis. However - those changes are meant to reduce external dependencies of Gnosis Chain and thus make it more resilient and secure,” the preliminary discussion concluded.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/16/co-founder-of-privacy-focused-gnosis-chain-proposes-plan-to-reduce-ethereum-dependency-for-gno-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c43a264475ce007cac3bb53053efae7557aaaf0c-1920x1274.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414435,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB62yo,1676534127,"Bitcoin Primed to Rally to $56K as Nasdaq Breaks Out of Bull Flag, Chart Analyst Says","""Based on the first law of physics, an object in motion will continue in motion until an outside force affects it,"" Wall Street's champion trader Martin S. (Buzzy) Schwartz wrote in his book ""Pit Bull.""  Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied nearly 50% in the first seven weeks of the year, reaching a six-month high of $24,900, with outside forces like the sentiment in traditional markets largely supportive. Recently, the crypto market and Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index have grown resilient to the Federal Reserve's angst and the resulting uptick in Treasury yields.  So one chart analyst expects a continued move higher that could see bitcoin more than double in value in the coming months.  ""Bitcoin is breaking out from a long basing formation. There is a saying, the bigger the base, the higher into space,"" William Noble, director of research at Emerging Assets Group and former analyst at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, told CoinDesk.  ""Bitcoin may move from consolidation to another parabolic move back to $56,000,"" Noble said, having correctly predicted the cryptocurrency's late 2020 surge from $20,000 to $40,000.  ""Going parabolic"" is an expression often used in the crypto market to describe an expected impulsive move higher with limited downticks.  Bitcoin's recent bull revival follows a prolonged period of sideways trading at the depths of the bear market around $18,000, or the basing pattern, as Noble said.  The widely tracked momentum indicator relative strength index (RSI) has diverged bullishly on the weekly chart, confirming an end of the downtrend.  A bullish divergence of RSI occurs when the indicator does not reciprocate the new low on price, as observed in November 2022. That's a sign of bears losing power and bulls gaining strength.  Nasdaq's bull flag  Another good news for crypto bulls is that Nasdaq has broken out of a bull flag, a technical pattern known to accelerate an uptrend. Bitcoin's 90-day correlation coefficient with Nasdaq has increased to 0.75, indicating the two assets are moving in tandem.  ""In Nasdaq, there is a bull flag. There is a saying, 'flags fly at half-mast,' meaning there could be another major run higher in equities to a new all-time high,"" Noble said.  A bull flag forms when a correction follows an initial steep rise. An eventual breakout from the flag is said to confirm a resumption of the broader uptrend.  Nasdaq fell by 37% in 11 months to October 2022. The decline, though severe, looked like a correction in the broader rally from March 2020 lows and represented a flag pattern on the weekly chart that recently ended with a bullish breakout.  ""Said differently, there could be a new bull market in stocks that looks like the last bull market; 2023 could be a surprisingly good year for both crypto and equities,"" Noble noted.  Interestingly, Nasdaq's daily chart also shows a bull flag breakout, as popular analyst Declan Fallon noted.  Potential breakout in ether  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is yet to break out of an expanding triangle, identified by trendlines connecting Jan. 21 and Feb. 2 highs and lows registered on Jan. 25 and Feb. 13.  Per Noble, a potential breakout might bring outsized gains in Ethereum's native token.  ""The expanding triangle in ETH is potentially very bullish. I saw formations like this in 2009 and 2010 when stocks rallied post-global financial crisis,"" Noble said, pointing to the S&P 500's expanding triangle breakout of 2009.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/16/bitcoin-primed-for-parabolic-rally-to-56k-as-nasdaq-breaks-out-of-bull-flag-chart-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/761c64a0e57701307156909766b06c87f5e15ee7-1440x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That contributed to over $200 million in overall liquidation losses. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move – which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Bitcoin-tracked futures saw over $85 million in liquidations alone, the highest among all cryptocurrencies. Ether futures logged $58 million in liquidations, while futures of aptos, solana and solana each saw losses between $3 million to $4 million.  Crypto exchange Binance recorded the most losses among its counterparts at $68 million, followed by OKX at $51 million.  Crypto market capitalization increased 8.8% to reach its highest level since November, erasing losses from the contagion effects stemming from FTX’s collapse and troubles at crypto lender Genesis.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin surged to its highest level since August.  Insights: BLUR, the token of NFT marketplace Blur, surges following an airdrop.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,137 +89.3 ▲ 8.5% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,633 +2511.7 ▲ 11.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,695 +144.6 ▲ 9.3% S&P 500  4,147.60 +11.5 ▲ 0.3% Gold  $1,851 +16.5 ▲ 0.9% Nikkei 225  27,501.86 −100.9 ▼ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin's Surge Takes It Past $24.7  Just when bitcoin seemed likely headed for points south, investors sent the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization upward, largely on the strength of a short squeeze.  BTC was recently trading at about $24,625, up more than 11% from Tuesday, same time. Bitcoin last traded over $24,500 in August.Wednesday's spike followed a tepid Consumer Price Index that had investors feeling less anxious about the U.S. economy's future and the Fed's next monetary policy moves.  But short-selling investors seemed more responsible for the unexpected reversal from recent days. Data from crypto data provider Coinglass at one point Wednesday showed that traders who bet on price shifts liquidated some $65 million of bitcoin over from the previous 24 hours, from which about $60 million were in short positions.  Ether enjoyed an almost equally upbeat day, blasting past $1,700 before settling slightly below this threshold. The second largest crypto in market value was recently up more than 9%. Other major turned bright green over the course of the day with YGG, the token of play-to-earn gaming guild Yield Guild Games, and NEAR, the native crypto of smart contracts platform Near Protocol, each recently rising well over 11%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) a measure of the wider digital asset market's performance, was recently up 10%.  And while equity markets were less adventuresome overall with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 both closing up less than a percentage point, crypto related stocks soared with both exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) increasing 17% and 18%, respectively. Business software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major BTC holder, recently rose more than 9%.  The sad saga of FTX continued as U.S. federal prosecutors asked a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to modify the terms of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's release on bond to ban him from using cellphones or the internet except under very specific conditions. prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried used a virtual private network at least twice, supposedly to watch National Football League playoff games. It's a sharp escalation of previous requests, which mainly saw prosecutors ask that Bankman-Fried only be banned from using encrypted or ephemeral messaging applications.  In an interview on CoinDesk TV, Joey Krug, investor and co-founder of Augur and Eco, said that he believed ""markets had bottomed back in June of last year,"" but also noted: ""There's probably going to continue to be some chop in the markets as inflation doesn't go as fast as people hoped. My view is things got oversold last summer and things are finally bouncing back.""  Krug added: ""The second half of the year is going to be bullish for crypto. Most people who are going to sell crypto have already sold.""

Insights  NFT Marketplace Blur's Token Reaches $500M Trading Volume After Airdrop  (A version of this story appeared Wednesday on CoinDesk's website.)  Tokens of non-fungible token marketplace Blur have already amassed over $500 million in trading volume in less than 24 hours since their much-hyped airdrop.  A Blur airdrop tracking page on Dune Analytics, created by Crypto Twitter user pandajackson42, shows that 320 million of the 360 million total airdropped blur tokens were claimed by users, which represents nearly 90% of the airdrop.  Airdrops are the unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.  BLUR tokens were airdropped to users of the Blur marketplace, with the airdrop amount depending on the total activity, network volume, and transactions made by each user on the platform. There were a total of three airdrop rounds. The first was for everyone who traded in the six months prior to the launch of the Blur marketplace, the second was for traders who actively listed on the Blur marketplace through November, and the third was for traders who placed bids on Blur.  The third type of recipient received the most tokens in the airdrop.  Blockchain data further collated on Dune shows 40% of all users received between 100 to 1,000 blur tokens. Some 22% of users received less than 100 blur tokens, while 30% received between 1,000 to 10,000 blur tokens.  Less than 1% of users received more than 1 million blur tokens – worth over $1 million on Wednesday morning.  Blockchain data shows there are over 33,000 unique wallet holders of BLUR as of Wednesday morning, with a majority of these initially receiving the airdrop before likely transferring the tokens out to other wallets.  Some traders sold the tokens en masse after receiving the airdrop. The tokens were initially listed at $1 on crypto exchange Coinbase, but fell to as low as 48 cents late on Tuesday. However, Asian hours on Wednesday saw buying pressure and the tokens rose to 72 cents as of writing time.  CoinGecko data shows over $530 million worth of BLUR has been traded across exchanges such as OKX, Kucoin and Uniswap.  Meanwhile, the total value of tokens on the Blur marketplace spiked by $10 million in the past 24 hours, DeFiLlama data shows.

42412848,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6dpU,1676512658,Binance Bracing Itself for Fines From US Regulators to Settle ‘Past Conduct’: WSJ,"As U.S. regulators continue to sniff around Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange is prepared to pay monetary penalties to “make amends” for past regulatory violations, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann told the WSJ on Wednesday that the exchange grew quickly and was not initially aware of the myriad laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering, sanctions evasion, and corruption.  Because of that, Hillman said Binance expects to face fines – and is “working with regulators to figure out what are the remediations we have to go through now to make amends for [past violations].”  Though regulatory scrutiny on Binance has intensified following its rival FTX’s collapse in November, Binance has been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington since at least 2018, according to Reuters. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly sent at least two trading firms subpoenas in recent months, requesting records of their past dealings with Binance US.  Reuters reported in December that federal authorities were still discussing a potential settlement with Binance and assessing whether the evidence they have already collected is sufficient to bring charges against the exchange and several individuals, including CEO Changpeng Zhao.  In his interview with The Journal, Hillman said he expected the outcome of the investigation (he did not name which specific investigation he was referring to) could “likely [be] a fine, could be more … We just don’t know. That is for regulators to decide.”  Hillman declined to estimate the size of the fines or a timeline for when the investigation might be settled, the Journal reported.  However, he added that he was “highly confident and feeling really good about where those discussions are going.”  “It will be a good moment for our company because it allows us to put it behind us,” the WSJ quoted Hillman as saying.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/16/binance-bracing-itself-for-fines-from-us-regulators-to-settle-past-conduct-wsj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb3a390b59ce7a27d64b490105993ae0819f45e6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
