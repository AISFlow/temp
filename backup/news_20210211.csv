42433607,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzfJh,1613084641,Nigeria's Senate Summons Central Bank Chief to Explain Crypto Ban,"Nigeria’s Senate has summoned the country’s top financial regulators for a briefing after the central bank ordered local financial institutions to stop providing services to crypto companies and users last Friday.      The Nigerian Tribune reported Thursday the Senate has mandated its banking committee to invite the governor of the central bank (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, and the director general of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission, Lamido Yuguda, to appear at a time to be determined and explain the opportunities and threats of cryptocurrency. The Senate session discussing the issue was live-tweeted on the Senate’s official Twitter page.      Last week’s CBN directive caused an uproar on social media, while local crypto advocates wrote to the bank asking for clarification on the order. In response, the CBN published a five-page statement that included a pledge to protect Nigerian citizens from the risks of cryptocurrencies.      “[The CBN] will continue to do all within its regulatory powers to educate Nigerians to desist from its use and protect our financial system from activities of fraudsters and speculators,” the statement said.      But a number of senators opposed the CBN move and an outright ban on crypto, though they spoke in favor of regulating the industry.      “The next level is cryptocurrency and we can’t run away from it. It is CBN’s responsibility to bring Nigerians to the next level, not discouraging it. It is the simplest way of exchange,” Sen. Bassey Akpan said.      Despite its risks and dangers, crypto has its merits, Sen. Dung Gyang said, adding that the lawmakers want the CBN governor to brief them on the risks and opportunities that crypto offers the nation so that Nigeria won’t “miss out.”      Another senator, Solomon Adeola, said he is “strongly against” the CBN’s outright ban on crypto and that the bank should instead be regulating the space.      According to the Nigerian Tribune report, the Senate will be taking an informed position on the issue after the briefing.      Sen. Adetokumbo Abiru, who co-sponsored the motion, said cryptocurrency is a major transaction tool and an employer of “teeming youths” in the country.      “So I am not sure the CBN can ban it,” Sen. Abiru said.      Nigerian crypto users seemed largely undeterred after the CBN directive took effect, turning to peer-to-peer exchange platforms to continue trading.

A pesar de que los términos de la compra de Quedex no fueron dados a conocer, el CEO de Bitso, Daniel Vogel, dijo a CoinDesk que se trató de un buen acuerdo por varias razones.      Quedex fue la primera plataforma de criptoderivados en recibir una licencia mediante el marco regulador de activos digitales de Gibraltar, la misma jurisdicción y régimen que regula a Bitso, dijo Vogel.

""Hasta ahora sólo hemos ofrecido trading al contado"", dijo Vogel. ""Lo que vemos es que se ha logrado mucha educación financiera a través de cripto. Hace unos años, los clientes preguntaban cuál era la diferencia entre una orden límite y una orden de mercado. Hoy preguntan cómo operar con futuros y opciones en Bitso"".      Vogel explicó que un equipo de 22 empleados, muchos de ellos ingenieros de Quedex, supervisará la integración de la nueva tecnología de trading.

42433621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzfnh,1613078877,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Above $49K While Ether Transaction Fees Surge Again,"Bitcoin set a new record above $49,000 after trading between $47,000 and $48,000 for much of Thursday. Traders and analysts told CoinDesk they remain bullish on the overall market, as institutional investors’ interest in bitcoin is growing “at a staggering pace.”    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $47,174.04 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5.48% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $44,057.64-$48,635.84 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Despite bitcoin’s new historical high price earlier Thursday, the trading volume on the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 remains low compared with earlier this week.      The focus of the market on Thursday was on the news that more big players are embracing bitcoin; Mastercard said it will allow merchants to receive payments in cryptocurrency soon, and BNY Mellon announced it will launch a new digital custody unit.      “To put it simply, it's really hard to be bearish on bitcoin right now ... and you don't even need to look too deeply at all of the fundamental metrics and technical indicators to feel that,” said Adam James, senior content editor at OKEx’s research arm OKEx Insights.      “The market is bullish,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets broker Bequant, said. “There are no immediate fundamental factors that would drive the price down.”      Read More: Mastercard Will Let Merchants Accept Payments in Crypto This Year      That said, bitcoin is struggling to push higher after it briefly went above $48,000 earlier Thursday, according to Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower. He told CoinDesk that in the short term, the resistance level would remain at or just below $50,000.      The nearest upside hurdle will be higher, at around $53,000, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies. She also pointed out that some overbought and oversold activity will support up to two months of price consolidation.      In the longer term, said John Kramer, trader at market maker GSR, it is “realistic” to think that bitcoin’s on a “healthy” run towards $100,000 by the end of the summer.      “Expect more banks to offer custody and additional products, as well as other companies to follow Tesla and MicroStrategy’s lead,” Kramer said. “On top of this, there’s still additional stimulus on the table, which is what kicked off this rally last spring.”      However, in the derivatives market, options traders don’t appear convinced bitcoin will rally to $100,000 anytime soon. Based on current prices, the market has assigned a 12% probability this price be reached before the end of this year, as CoinDesk reported.    Ethereum killers are killing it, as Ethereum gas fee surges    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $1,769.03 and climbing 2.75% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      On the technical side, Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at exchange LMAX Digital, said the initial resistance level would be the earlier all-time high at around $1,840 on Wednesday.      “A break above [$1,840] will open the door for a test of massive resistance at $2,000, which represents a critical psychological barrier and measured move upside extension,” Kruger said. “We see the first level of support at $1,680, with a break below to take the immediate pressure off the topside and open the door for a correction back down towards the $1,500 area.”      Ether’s rally is not just simply following bitcoin’s price trend, according to analysts. It is largely driven by the fast-growing decentralized finance sector.      “As these [DeFi] projects continue to gain in popularity, we will likely see increased interest in ether,” Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at eToro, told CoinDesk. “It would not be surprising to see it make a run at $2,000 soon.”      At the same time, significant growth of the “Ethereum Killers,” including Cardano, Polkadot, Solana, and Algorand, is a reflection of the frustration around the high gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain. Gas refers to the internal pricing unit for running transactions on Ethereum.      Read More: Cardano, Polkadot Market Caps Surpass XRP as Some Bet on Alternatives to Ethereum      “The high gas fees on Ethereum are clearly presenting opportunities to competing layer 1 smart contract platforms,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin. “As Ethereum continues through its multi-year process of launching Eth 2.0 to address its scaling issues, it remains to be seen whether developers will migrate their apps to other platforms.”      Others, however, dismissed any threats to Ethereum.      “The price performance [of “Ethereum killers”] does not necessarily mean there is a real threat to derail Ethereum's dominance,” Vinokourov said. “In fact, the DeFi market continues to grow, and with it so does ether.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Thursday.

42433614,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzfZh,1613078019,Building Black Wealth With Satoshis and Cash App,"In an environment that is proving less secure over time, we’re giving more thought to the preservation and proper allocation of our wealth. But how does one participate in a system that continues to advantage people who are positioned nearest to the financial nucleus? How do you participate when, without apology or consequence, they can shut off a game they are inconveniently losing? How is this possible, and why is it the only system we are “allowed” to opt into if we want to generate wealth for our family?    Ian Gaines is a Media Manager at Erickson Immigration Group. Black Bitcoin Billionaire, an online platform that educates individuals about living a self-sovereign life, is working with Cash App to give Black families one million satoshis by the end of February, which is Black History Month in the U.S.    What makes this possible is that a “nucleus” exists in the first place, a command center that can heavily dictate the flow of monetary energy. It’s powerful enough to disregard the unified will of a majority in favor of protecting the interest of the nucleus.      When we say “nucleus,” we mean a central point of control where an outsider needs permission or equal influence to gain access to use. As a parent, you are the nucleus that controls the access and distribution of allowance to your children. The management team at the Robinhood app is the nucleus that can determine what stock users can buy on their platform. The U.S. Federal Reserve acts as the nucleus that controls the access and distribution of all printed U.S. dollars.      But what comes to those who live outside that nucleus, whose interest may not align or are considered to be opposed to the central power? This phenomenon, no matter how unwarranted, is regrettably routine in the Black community. When the development of a self-sustaining Black economy did not align with the interest of the nucleus, we got Tulsa, Oklahoma 1921. The resentment of Black success drove a mob of 2,000 people to destroy an entire city, burning over 18,000 Black homes. No one was prosecuted.      The nucleus can even reach the level of government. Generations of Blacks were denied wealth with the passing of FHA’s 1934 National Housing Act. This federally funded initiative provided mortgage credit to working-class families to build wealth through homeownership. It was a “success,” but due to strategic redlining and zoning laws that governed where loans were allocated, highly Black-populated areas were all denied.    Bitcoin is the answer that allows all individuals, anywhere on earth, the freedom to validate themselves.    In a 1941 memo, FHA concluded “the rapidly rising Negro population has produced a problem in the maintenance of real estate values.” They determined the only “good neighborhood” that deserved funding was one that prevented “inharmonious racial groups”. The fine print did not give us a chance, and it showed. Between 1934 and 1968, 98% of the $120 billion dollars of federally funded loans went exclusively to white homeowners, a dynamic that has only compounded today.      The problem with any nucleus is that if it has questionable morals, you have to keep monitoring it to make sure it is not acting selfishly. That's draining, unsustainable and ultimately fruitless if your sphere of influence does not match the nucleus. I might not have trusted the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell if it did not live in my own body.      Luckily, an alternative that removes any central point between you and your money now exists. We are able to live a financially self-sovereign life with exclusive authority over your own wealth, without needing permission or acceptance by any central nucleus. Bitcoin allows exactly that. It is a transparent, peer-to-peer, government-resistant, community-run protocol that removes “trusting” any one entity to validate your transactions. No single sphere of influence is more important than another.      See also: Robert Greenfield – The Crypto Community Needs to Stand Up and Fight Racism      From the beginning of American history, the Black community needed validation from a nucleus whose interest actively worked in opposition to ours. We have an opportunity to opt out of that abusive system. Bitcoin is the answer that allows all individuals, anywhere on earth, the freedom to validate themselves. It is pro-Black by design.      Cash App has partnered with Black Bitcoin Billionaires on its campaign to give as many Black families as possible one million satoshis by the end of Black History Month (February). We and many others understand the value of this technology.

42405860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAep9cD,1613073753,These Gaming Studios Are Bringing Bitcoin Payouts to Everyday Esport Gamers,"Gaming developers have begun integrating Bitcoin's Lightning Network into their own games and existing titles to provide players with bitcoin payouts.  The Lightning Network is a payment protocol that facilitates fast, near-feeless transactions on a network that operates with different rules than Bitcoin's primary network.  This in-game rewards economy offers everyday gamers a ""stake"" in the game and an opportunity to monetize their hobby, a privilege typically enjoyed only by the Goliaths of the professional esports industry.    The end of the match was nothing special. From the outside, it looked like any other Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) esport match, until the final results rolled in.      After the winners were announced, a QR code popped up in the corner of the screen with the message: “You have won 8,673 sats!” (sats being short for “satoshi,” a microunit of bitcoin).      This sats reward corresponded with the player’s match points, the in-game scoring system that traditionally only exists as a means to gain experience points to “level up” in the game. Except these points weren’t just in-game currency, they were actual money that could be withdrawn from the game.      A play-for-pay plugin from software developer ZEBEDEE called Infuse makes this possible. It uses Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to facilitate instant, near-feeless payouts to players. Previously in closed-beta, ZEBEDEE’s CS:GO servers are now open to the public.      The release brings Lightning Network compatibility to a mainstream game title for the first time, and it’s something of a milestone for a fledgling industry that uses Lightning-powered games to reimagine how players interact with (and monetize) their favorite pastime.    Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?  Lightning Network gaming    ZEBEDEE is just one of a handful of pioneers in the growing (but still rather niche) intersectional industry of bitcoin and video games. They’re approaching Lightning-integrated gaming a bit differently, though. Instead of building a Lightning game from scratch, they’re bringing the Lightning Network to a game with 28 million monthly active players.      “[An] interesting change in the past year has been the drive to bring bitcoin to already popular games. It’s widely known that developing games that reach any level of success is a monumental task,” Des Dickerson, the VP of business operations at Lightning Labs and a MintGox organizer, told CoinDesk.      “In response, companies like ZEBEDEE are restructuring their approach and making it possible to integrate bitcoin into games that have already reached massive adoption.”      The MintGox esports tournament series (that’s “magic internet gathering,” in playful homage to the Mt.Gox exchange and its roots in Magic the Gathering) is a collective that features games from ZEBEDEE, Mandel Studios and Donner Labs.      The monthly tournament series pays out prize pools in bitcoin, with each game providing its own twist on Lightning functionality. Donner Lab’s Bitcoin Bounty Hunt, the first-to-launch Bitcoin shooter, pays out satoshis per kill like the CS:GO integration. One of ZEBEDEE’s from-scratch games, Bitcoin Rally (a Mario Kart clone), litters the road in sats; players can collect these digital coins and chuck them at opponents to stun them, or they can keep them for payout at the end of the match.      Dickerson told CoinDesk that the tournament series “has grown significantly over the past year with much of the growth happening over the last few months.” MintGox’s viewership was roughly 100 at launch, she said, and the inaugural event saw fewer than 1,000 transactions.      Now, 11 events in and counting, Dickerson said MintGox “regularly [sees] 6,000 viewers ... and around 15,000 transactions” per installment.      The creators driving this growth believe they are at the forefront not only of a new economic standard for the video game industry but of an entirely new dynamic for how you capture attention and engage players and spectators.    Shootin’ caps and stackin’ sats    In ZEBEDEE’s case, the new dynamic is giving esports players skin in the game.      “The idea is that having a stake that has value, rather than just time invested and in-game points, creates a greater connection to the game. It’s the classic theory of having skin in the game. So you have some value that represents your invested time and it’s there, it’s permanent, you can take it out of the game,” ZEBEDEE CEO Simon Cowell told CoinDesk.      And, of course, it works the other way around, too. “When you get shot, there’s actual economic impact,” he said.      In the future, the gaming studio will supply sats from sponsors for some matches, but for now users can front their own money to play in one of three servers: 100 sats, 1,000 sats or 10,000 sats. Each match allows a maximum of 16 players (so a match in a 10,000 sats server would have a total prize pool of 160k sats)      “If your 1,000 points are actually 1,000 sats, you’re going to want to play better or play more matches to recoup anything you’ve lost,” said Cowell.      One of the first first-person shooters to conceptualize Lightning gameplay, Satoshis Game’s Lightnite, is a completely from-the-ground-up, battle royale inspired by Fortnite; it debuted in 2019 at The Lightning Conference in Berlin. Players earn satoshis by eliminating others from the sudden-death, one-player-take-all match. The game uses Blockstream’s Liquid Network to tokenize non-fungible player and weapon skins.    The rewards economy    When ZEBEDEE supplies the prize, it takes a cut from the advertising revenue, Cowell said. Jack Everitt of THNDR GAMES, which makes the Bitcoin Bounce and Turbo 84 mobile games, has used this model to fill prize pools for his own games. In Everitt’s flagship game, Bitcoin Bounce, players collect tickets bounding across Bitcoin’s blockchain. These tickets can be entered into a raffle that pays out sats from THNDR GAMES ad revenue, Everitt told CoinDesk.    Read more: Microsoft and Enjin Bring Cross-Platform Custom NFTs to Minecraft    It’s a way for users to actually monetize their time on the game and earn a share of the related ad revenue. It doesn’t hurt that it’s also a good way to keep users coming back for more, Cowell said.      “You can take the bitcoin that funds your games out of your existing marketing budget. And it’s actually more effective than traditional advertising because by giving users sats rewards in game, you incentivize them to come back,” Cowell said.      This model, a kind of rewards economy that gamifies user attention, is becoming a popular new standard for startups in the Bitcoin realm. Flagship rewards programs like Lolli and Fold, which offer users sats-back rewards for purchases at participating merchants, have evolved into bitcoin-back debit cards (such as Fold App’s own) and sats-back programs at gift card exchanges like Bitrefill.      Sarutobi, a game developed by ZEBEDEE developer Christian Moss, pays out satoshi rewards for collecting in-game coins, all from ad revenue.      THNDR GAMES’ Turbo 84 incorporates a spin wheel for daily prizes, and in Bitcoin Bounce, players collect tickets that are automatically placed in a daily raffle for satoshis, both of which are paid out of THNDR’s ad revenue.      “With the spin wheel [and the tickets], the idea of the spin wheel is to get them to come back. Oh, what have I won today, what have I won today,” Everitt told CoinDesk.      With the Lightning Network, “you can have more direct interaction with users,” Cowell said. For instance, he hypothesized, sponsors or viewers could drop in-game powerups with Lightning payments, in-game ads could feature QR codes for rewards and corporate sponsors could drop a bot in-game that you shoot for sats.    Bitcoin gaming, not blockchain gaming    The Bitcoin gaming community is still small, and a lot of its growth comes more from the bitcoiner side of the track than from the gamer side.      Lightnite has roughly 2,000 users, Satoshis Games COO Carlos Borlado told CoinDesk. Leaderboards for Bitcoin Bounty Hunt show that Donner Lab's shooter has some 1,200 users.      “MintGox and these bitcoin gaming companies have captured the attention of the Lightning and bitcoin communities over the past year. But we haven’t even begun to penetrate the traditional gaming space,” Dickerson said.      She continued that, since “blockchain solutions” were peddled to the video gaming industry in the last market cycle, the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble popped a lot of the video game industry’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrency integrations.      That’s why these builders aren’t building anything “on the blockchain” – they’re just building new payment rails.      Borlado said esports players need to “lose their fear of Lightning wallets” so that adoption of these games increases, but that “once they do, they will never go back.”      For its part, ZEBEDEE built Infuse and its Lightning-gaming focused wallet, which can sync a player’s Twitch streaming accounts to their gamertags for Lightning games and QR codes for payouts.      The Infuse plug-in itself is not limited to CS:GO, and ZEBEDEE is running polls to see which games its users want to see supported next, like Battlefield, Call of Duty, Dota 2, Minecraft, Rust and Team Fortress 2.    Esports meets bitcoin    For Cowell, Lightning Network tips can democratize the competitive gaming industry and give gamers the potential to monetize their skills outside of the professional esports arena. The international esports industry is projected to grow to $1.5 billion by 2023. The winning teams in global tournaments for Dota 2, for instance, have been known to take home $15 million in prize money.      Though only a fraction of gamers ever get good enough to reach the big leagues, any gamer can earn bitcoin playing in public bitcoin matches, Cowell said.      “Instead of having to go to a professional esports tournament, you can play online to earn money. That’s the whole point of it. This isn’t my phrase, but it’s the ‘democratization of monetization.’ Once money is software, any stakeholder in the gaming industry can create mini-businesses in the game.”      It’s too early to say bitcoin has changed the gaming industry. But Dickerson said the real transformation comes when bitcoin sees further adoption into mainstream titles like CS:GO.      There are millions of esports players waiting to onboard onto bitcoin, and gaming is the way to get them a seat on the ride, Dickerson said.    “Exposing those users to the possibilities of bitcoin will change the video game industry as it currently stands. Imagine the potential when integrated into other popular games like Fornite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and more. This is when we will witness mass bitcoin adoption.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TOKEN SALE,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/11/these-gaming-studios-are-bringing-bitcoin-payouts-to-everyday-esport-gamers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42b4929163b883220129571ce4bff7817b9f68f6-2280x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAep9bE,1613066009,"Blockchain Bites: Mastercard, BNY Mellon Embrace Crypto; Amazon Floats 'Digital Currency' Project","Three trends  1. Crypto infrastructure is being laid down across the banking, tech and financial sectors.  BNY Mellon, the world’s biggest custodian bank, will allow customers to custody crypto by the end of the year. It’s working with unnamed outside partners to build out the offering, according to CoinDesk’s Ian Allison.  Mastercard plans to support digital currency transactions directly on its massive network, and allow merchants that opt in to participate directly in the crypto economy, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. “Our philosophy on cryptocurrencies is straightforward: It’s about choice,” Mastercard Executive Vice President for Blockchain and Digital Asset Products Raj Dhamodharan wrote in a recent blog.  Amazon is preparing to launch a “digital currency” project in Mexico, Nelson also reported. The e-commerce giant has posted a number of job offerings, describing the project, spearheaded by Amazon’s Digital and Emerging Payments (DEP) division, as a way for customers “to enjoy online services including shopping for goods and/or services like Prime Video.”  Uber is considering adding crypto payment options, if there is a clear benefit, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on CNBC Thursday. The ridesharing giant is a member of the Diem (formerly Libra) Association, which is developing a payments network. Khosrowshahi shot down the idea of adding bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet.  Enterprise software provider R3 has launched a new computing platform called Conclave to bring privacy to sensitive business data, aimed at financial institutions. “[Conclave] paves the way for a new generation of trusted services that can detect fraud, reduce cost, build high-value multi-party analytics and more – where the owners of the data control how it is processed,” R3 said.  2. U.S. regulators are flexing their crypto knowledge.    They're showing both an appreciation for blockchain technology as well as concern for what these new tools mean for the global economy.      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, for the third time in recent weeks, that there’s a “growing problem” with crypto being used for illicit purposes, including terrorist financing. “I see the promise of these new technologies, but I also see the reality: Cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism,” she said at a financial sector innovation policy roundtable.      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce said the U.S. capital markets are ready for a bitcoin exchange-traded product on CoinDesk TV Thursday. She also pushed back on the idea that crypto is primarily a tool for illicit finance, adding, “There is more illegal activity happening in cash.”      The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) halted trading of Virginia-based Blue Ridge Bank’s stock (BRSB) after a spike in trading activity Wednesday driven by its entrance into the bitcoin ATM game.      Perennial skeptic Nouriel Roubini said yesterday the SEC should investigate people like Tesla CEO Elon Musk for “market manipulation"" after the meme-posting billionaire became interested in bitcoin and dogecoin.    3. What’s going on in altcoin-land?  Centralized exchanges – such as FTX, Binance, Huobi and OKEx – are all seeing breakneck use and appreciation of their native utility tokens. CoinDesk markets reporter Muyao Shen wrote that bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is driving volumes on these crypto gateways. As a result, FTX’s FTT, Binance’s BNB and Huobi’s HT have grown 249%, 238%, and 161% on the year.  Dogecoin developers are pushing out the first network updates in two years as the meme-coin barks at their heels. Dogecoin is now worth over $9 billion after influential handlers – from Elon Musk to rock star Gene Simmons – “endorsed” the joke. CoinDesk’s Colin Harper gives an impressive rundown on the technical fixes in store.  At stake    Larry Flynt Every day brings a new example of the world waking up to the power of decentralized tools. Bitcoin being added to balance sheets, banks announcing custody solutions and payments monoliths like Visa and Mastercard planning to integrate crypto all point to a future where crypto is a major part of the economy. Some would go as far as saying it’s the future of money itself.      It’s not just a financial or technological revolution, but a cultural one. Crypto has a central thesis: There are certain basic services to which everyone should have access. That’s a liberal idea. All men and women are born equal, have equal claims to be heard, to build and to congregate. The difference between crypto and a document like the U.S. constitution, which ensures these inalienable rights, is that crypto is a technological foundation to encode them. It removes the eternal gatekeepers that have historically bent this frame.      Yesterday, Larry Flynt, the renegade publisher and speech activist, passed away from heart failure. The founder of Hustler is a complicated man. He was a purveyor of smut, but also one of the 20th century’s greatest civil liberties champions. His story is fundamentally a crypto one.      In 1983, Flynt was sued for libel by television evangelist Rev. Jerry Falwell after Hustler published a satire in which the Moral Majority crusader was said to have kissed his mother in an outhouse. The case wound up before the U.S. Supreme Court – though not before Flynt graced a district court wearing an American flag as a diaper and a purple heart medal – where the charges and penalties were dismissed.      The meaning of the case, and its legacy for strong U.S. speech protections, is summed up by something Flynt allegedly said: “If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it will protect all of you. Because I’m the worst.” (I think this line was invented for ""The People vs. Larry Flynt,"" the 1996 biopic.)      We’re facing a similar moment in time now with the rise of crypto. In giving anyone access to financial services, or a web platform in the case of the decentralized web, naturally questions will arise about what sort of behavior society should condone. That’s what Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is wrestling with when talking about the promises of crypto as well as its use in illicit finance.      The last time Blockchain Bites covered the porn industry, CoinDesk Executive Editor Marc Hochstein raised questions about PornHub’s privacy policies after the adult entertainment site switched to accepting crypto as its primary payment form. The site also began requiring users to identify their accounts before posting any material. He wrote:      “If this prevents monsters from using the site in abusive ways, all the better. But it will create risks for those who only post lawful content.”      With intermediaries entering into the crypto economy, similar questions will arise. Gatekeepers, such as Mastercard, will once again be required to make decisions about who has access to these novel payment rails. It’s not always so clear.      Flynt may have some wise words to consider: “Hypocrisy is a detriment to progress.”    Quick bites  Someone bought a Tesla Model 3 for 91 BTC in 2013. The car and coin are now at near-parity.

The two-year-old DeFi studio and venture capital firm is now preparing to undergo a company-wide expansion.      Framework emerged from stealth mode in August 2020 with $8 million in seed funding. Now, less than a year later, co-founder Michael Anderson told CoinDesk he aims to double Framework’s headcount – across engineering and project teams – to 30 by the end of 2021.      Recent top hires have begun filling Framework’s c-suite positions. Since October, the firm has hired a finance chief in John DiCerbo, a Numerai veteran; a tech lead in DeFi engineer Ray Pulver; and a Principal in Roy Learner of Wave financial.      Anderson’s tasked Learner with managing a venture fund anchored by tokens SNX, AAVE, LINK, YFI and GRT – “some of the big wins,” he said, that have pushed the fund’s value into the hundreds of millions. Each position is targeted to around 5% of the network, he said.

The only investments came at the start of the fund.      Inside the venture fund is a Labs division, the DeFi studio where in-house engineers build products tailored to Framework’s invested networks. Those projects’ core teams often work directly with Framework, Anderson said, making the whole thing function as a pseudo-incubator of sorts.      “We really need a software first tact at helping provide additional services,” Anderson said. “We’re adding services that help these networks – more so in the way of just dollars.”      CORRECTION (Feb. 11, 2021, 19:00 UTC): Framework's DeFi fund launched with a principal investment of $14 million, not $14.",POSITIVE,AAVE | LINK | SNX | GRT,AAVE | LINK | SNX | GRT | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/11/framework-ventures-defi-fund-booms-as-tech-team-staffs-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b135d1bd6e8eb4b0cd88dfa19f2bfc75477bf93-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAep9VK,1613063247,Banks Likely to Adopt Stablecoins Cautiously Despite Guidance,"Arguably, Brian Brooks has done more than anyone to spur the epic bull run of the last few months. The former head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (he served from May 2020 to mid-January 2021) paved the way for U.S. banks to adopt cryptocurrency, including allowing federally regulated banks to custody digital assets and even act as stablecoin nodes.      Some saw these actions as pivotal for banks to embrace the shift to a decentralized, open-source economy. Brooks envisioned a future with “self-driving banks” in a Financial Times op-ed. However, there are good reasons to think banks will proceed with caution on adopting cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins in particular.    Rafael Cosman is the CEO and co-founder of TrustToken, makers of the digital dollar TUSD and four other global fiat-backed stablecoins.    Firstly, the OCC memo contains several explicit provisions that put significant responsibilities on banks and stablecoin issuers. These include know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and the need for “appropriate systems, controls, and practices in place to manage […] risks, including to safeguard reserve assets,” among others.      Engaging in stablecoin transactions where an existing stablecoin provider issues the assets presents a significant counterparty risk for banks. It will involve relying on a firm outside of the bank’s control to manage client funds.      So the question now is whether banks will be prepared to work with existing stablecoin issuers to establish standards for cooperation, or whether they’ll simply go off and create their own stablecoins or wait for central bank digital currencies to fulfill the same role.    Engaging in stablecoin transactions where an existing stablecoin provider issues the assets presents a significant counterparty risk for banks.    The chances of big banks relying on existing providers seem slim due to the counterparty risk. Imagine if a stablecoin issuer fails to pass a regulatory test or suffers system downtime that affects clients. The bank won’t risk needing to chase down an external firm to make sure that their clients aren’t left out of pocket, potentially leaving it exposed to lawsuits or reputational damage.      Given the glacial pace of development in the area of CBDCs, it also seems unlikely that banks will wait for a digital dollar or equivalent to be issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve. After all, JPMorgan has already made its own foray into issuing a stablecoin for use within its network.      Its competitors aren’t likely to wait for a centralized federal currency that could still be years away from delivery if there’s a competitive edge to be gained.    First movers    The first banks to move into the stablecoin space will also reap the most significant advantages, both in terms of customer adoption and cost savings from reduced fees and dependence on third parties such as clearinghouses. These savings aren’t likely to be passed on to the customer but would make a healthy contribution to the bottom line.      Therefore, it seems likely that at least some of the big banks will attempt to launch their own stablecoins. Like JPM coin, these will probably focus on back-end efficiencies rather than offer direct exposure to the client. Doing so would offer maximum control, data capture, the opportunity to control reserve assets, and deliver long-term cost savings. It would also offer the ability to build value-add products on top of these assets.      See also: Ex-OCC Chief Brooks Calls Tesla’s Bitcoin Buy a Bit ‘Scary’ for Rest of World      However, banks are unlikely to have this kind of expertise in-house. JPMorgan had to hire specialists. Even before the OCC announcement, it was already public knowledge that banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, have been creating job positions for experts in blockchain and digital assets.      Financial institutions could also contract out development, or even operate a stablecoin independent of the bank as a distinct foundation, to insulate their traditional business lines from regulatory scrutiny.      Ultimately, any bank-issued stablecoin will need adoption to succeed, which requires some degree of cooperation between entities. “Walled garden” bank stablecoins are likely to fail as they’ll limit the size of the audience for potential take-up. Similarly, banks will have to ensure they execute on their stablecoins in a similar way to how cryptocurrency projects gain adoption – by building an active community of users and partners.      See also: What Are Stablecoins?      From a position within the cryptocurrency sector and taking into consideration Brooks’ predictions about “self-driving banks,” it seems most likely that banks will succeed in adopting stablecoins as part of their payment rails. They'll want to lower transaction costs and time in moving assets under custody, if they concede to working with existing providers. This will give them the best opportunity to plug into the extensive infrastructure already built in decentralized finance (DeFi).      However, such a working relationship would involve mutual collaboration to ensure that stablecoin providers comply with the requirements of the OCC memo and offer acceptable mitigation of counterparty risk for banks.      From the banks’ side, it would mean they need to be willing to accept some of the risks of being a first mover into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, adopting a mindset of partnership rather than control.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Rafael Cosman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/11/banks-likely-to-adopt-stablecoins-cautiously-despite-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/661c454184768c6f37aa4f45213ad0701af70398-1280x627.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Several backers from its prior round followed on.      If a purely crypto token had an easily conceivable value relative to real products (for example, one token consistently equaled, say, four Snickers bars), that would meet the test of a ""unit of account,"" something that could be used to assess the value of goods.      ""Unit of account"" is one of three facets of the traditional money definition that major cryptocurrencies fail to meet due to their volatility. That's what Reflexer is going for: a crypto-native unit.      The new round comes ahead of its announced launch of its RAI token by early March. RAI tracks longer term gains and losses of ETH without the gigantic movements by taking advantage of control theory from traditional engineering.      ""You don't need to peg to anything in order to be stable,"" founder Stefan Ionescu told CoinDesk in an email. ""The most important thing to understand is that DeFi can and should be detached from the fate of the US Dollar. RAI is a first step in that direction.""      Reflexer Labs ran a demo test of its system from October to January, called Proto RAI. It was largely able to maintain a stable price relative to ETH but with a small amount of gain. The company compares its approach to central banks' use of the managed float, where exchange rates look for general stability over time, despite occasional short-term tumult.      Stablecoins that trace the U.S. dollar have been wildly successful; most agree their success was a necessary ingredient in establishing decentralized finance (DeFi) as Ethereum's killer feature.      ""Many stable assets in use today are pegged to fiat currencies, a design with many limitations. These networks have limited economic incentives that can be used to influence the market price of their native stablecoins,"" Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, said in a press release.      Roderik van der Graaf, founder of Lemniscap, said in the release, ""Reflexer is opening up a completely new design space in the realm of 'stable' cryptoassets.""      The company has work on its user interface and educational materials to do ahead of the release of RAI. A governance minimized crypto asset, it has also published a timeline for winding down parameters that the community can change.

Bitso, backed by Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures and others, was in the news last December, having raised a whopping $62 million to help scale the business into new territories and clearly also to explore new products.    Read more: Coinbase-Backed Bitso Raises $62M to Expand Crypto Footprint in Brazil    The commercial terms of the Quedex acquisition were not made public, but Bitso CEO Daniel Vogel told CoinDesk it was a good fit for a number of reasons.      Quedex was the first crypto derivatives platform to receive a license through Gibraltar's digital asset regulatory framework, the same jurisdiction and regime that regulates Bitso, said Vogel. The Quedex acquisition also allows Bitso to get its hands on some nice cutting-edge tech, he added.      “As the industry grows and trading volumes increase, one of the big challenges is building really high-performance, low-latency trading engines, and the Quedex team has done that,” said Vogel in an interview. “So, the idea is to replace our entire trading infrastructure with Quedex's trading infrastructure.”    Bitso’s growth plans    As well as demand to move into territories like Brazil, customers of Mexico City-based Bitso have also been asking for more sophisticated products such as leveraged trading, crypto futures and options, Vogel said.      “We've only offered spot trading until now,” Vogel said. “What we see is that there’s been so much financial education that's happened through crypto. A few years ago, clients were asking what's the difference between a limit order and a market order. Today they are asking to trade futures and options on Bitso.”      Vogel explained that a team of 22 staffers, many of them Quedex engineers, would be overseeing the integration of the new trading engine technology. At the last count, Bitso had some 200 employees spread over 25 countries.      “That increased to 230 as of this morning,” said Vogel.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/11/bitso-buys-gibraltar-based-crypto-derivatives-platform-quedex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f999edc5db80ba5cdad6ebc1f034b6e8fbbd637-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411935,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhE17,1613055543,"CME Ethereum Futures, Explained","Investors can now attempt to profit from the future price movements of Ethereum’s main crypto token, ether (ETH), on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  On Feb. 8, ether futures went live on the CME – the world’s largest derivatives exchange – 53 days after the first official plans were announced.  What is futures trading?  A futures contract is where the buyer agrees to purchase - and the seller agrees to sell - the underlying asset at a fixed price at a future date. In the case of the ether futures, that underlying asset is the Ethereum cryptocurrency.  But rather than having the seller deliver ether to the buyer on the settlement date, ether futures contracts are settled for cash; if the settlement price of ether ends up being higher than the contract price, the seller agrees to pay just the dollar difference between the contract price and the settlement price. Likewise, if the settlement price is lower than the contract price, the buyer pays the seller the difference.  So what price do they use? The contract tracks the price of ether using the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate (ETHUSD_RR). The system collects price data on ether trades from major crypto exchanges including Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, itBit and Gemini, and works out a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for ether each day.  Each contract is worth 50 ether and priced in U.S. dollars. There is a maximum order size of 100 contracts on CME Globex, the exchange’s electronic trading platform that runs continuously to accommodate traders from all time zones. Whatever the price of ether is at the point of expiry (when the contract is scheduled to be settled) both the buyer and seller have to uphold their promises to buy and sell the contract, respectively.  Example:  At the start of March, Bob is bullish on ether and thinks the price will rise over the next four weeks. Barbara, however, is bearish on ether and believes the price will drop by the end of April. Bob and Barbara both enter into an ether futures trade on the CME.  Bob agrees to buy 1 ether futures contract with an April expiry (Apr. 30). Ether’s current price is $1,800 so the notional value of the contract equals $90,000 (50 x 1,800). Barbara agrees to sell 1 contract worth of ether on Apr. 30.  Bob is hoping by the end of April, ether’s price will have risen so when the contract reaches settlement he will profit from the difference between the initial contract price and the settlement price. Barbara is hoping ether’s price will have fallen so that she can profit from the difference.  Scenario A: Upon expiry, ether’s price is $2,000 per coin which means the settlement price of the ether futures contract is $100,000 (50 x 2,000). Barbara now has to pay Bob $100,000 as part of the futures contract agreement, which leaves Bob with a $10,000 profit.  Scenario B: Upon expiry, ether’s price is $1,600 per coin which means the settlement price of the ether futures contract is $80,000 (50 x 1,600). As per the agreement, Bob has to pay Barbara $90,000 for a contract that is now worth $80,000, which means Barbara has made a $10,000 profit.  CME Ethereum futures FAQs  What are the pros and cons of trading Ethereum futures?  Pros:  Stand to profit from the future movements of Ethereum’s ether cryptocurrency.  Gain exposure to the digital asset market without having to navigate unregulated crypto exchanges and set up digital wallets.  Ability to use leverage to increase capital efficiency.  Cons:  Not eligible for any Ethereum forked coins. Forked coins are produced from ""hard forks"" which is when a blockchain splits to create an entirely new chain. This occurs for a variety of reasons, including when a major change to the protocol needs to be implemented that is not backward compatible with the old chain, if someone wants to create a spin off of an existing open-source project like Bitcoin, or when there's an internal disagreement between miners and/or developers and they decide to part ways. When a new blockchain is created, a new cryptocurrency is also created and distributed to all holders of the original blockchain tokens.  No airdrops. Airdrops are where crypto projects distribute free tokens to people for completing certain tasks, being in certain associated communities, or to encourage adoption.  High barrier to entry for regular investors. The minimum purchase amount is 1 contract which costs the USD equivalent of 50 ether – currently $85,000 as of Feb.10, 2021.  Potential to lose more than initially invested. Futures trading carries an “unlimited liability” risk where traders can lose significantly more than just the initial money they invested. In some extreme cases, traders have even gone bankrupt from trading futures contracts. This is because there is no limit on how high or low the price of the underlying asset can move. For example, Barbara enters into another ether futures trade with Bob for one contract with a notional value of $90,000 and a May expiry. Over the course of May, the price of ether rises dramatically to $4,000 per coin. Barbara now has to pay Bob a whopping $200,000 to settle the contract (50 x 4,000).  How easy is it to trade Ethereum futures on the CME?  In order to trade ETH futures on the CME, you’ll need to set up an account with a registered futures broker. A list can be found here. Once you’re set up, you can place an order through your broker and tell them how many contracts you’d like to buy or sell and select an expiry month.  How much are transaction fees?  A full breakdown of all transaction fees associated with ETH futures can be found on the CME website.  What impact could CME futures have on ether’s price?  The launch of ether futures gives institutional investors an opportunity to hedge against spot market positions – a market where assets and securities are traded with immediate delivery, like Coinbase – which makes the Ethereum native cryptocurrency a much more attractive investment. This has the potential to encourage more big money to enter the crypto market and help improve overall maturity.  There are, however, some instances where ether futures may have a detrimental impact on the underlying price of ether. When futures markets close for the day or the weekend during periods of high market volatility, gaps can appear on futures charts. This is where the price closes at a certain point and then reopens for the new day or week at a completely different price point. For reasons unknown, these CME gaps have a tendency to get filled most of the time, where traders drive the asset back to its original price before the gap appeared. Whenever this happens, it also causes the underlying asset’s price on the spot market to move in tandem as arbitrage traders profit from the difference between the different exchanges.  This means if gaps appear on the ether futures chart it may well have a direct impact on the actual price of ether and cause increased volatility.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/cme-ethereum-futures-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b71d85d0dbb124582f613c69992652b5c286b4-933x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And Bank of New York Mellon (BK), the world's largest custodian bank with some $41 trillion of assets in safekeeping, said Thursday it's moving into crypto.      “Bitcoin and its peers are, quite simply, going to be part of the mainstream financial universe sooner rather than later,"" Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst for the trading platform eToro, wrote Thursday. ""I expect demand to surge and see bitcoin prices hitting at least $70,000 by the end of this year.”      In traditional markets, trading in Asia was muted ahead of Lunar New Year public holidays, with China on break for a week. (The year of the Ox is seen as bullish for bitcoin, of course.) U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as investors focused on the prospect of higher inflation as the economy accelerates and governments and central banks maintain aggressive stimulus policies.

Mastercard too: Card network plans to let merchants receive payments in cryptocurrencies later this year. The news was reported Wednesday by CoinDesk's Danny Nelson and later confirmed by the company in a web post. ""Whatever your opinions on cryptocurrencies – from a dyed-in-wool fanatic to utter skeptic – the fact remains that these digital assets are becoming a more important part of the payments world,"" according to the Purchase, N.Y.-based company.      Yellen's yellow light: U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes are a ""growing problem,"" while adding that she sees ""the promise of these new technologies."" The remarks, made Wednesday at a roundtable on financial industry innovation and published in a Treasury Department press release, could fuel some traders' concerns that the U.S. government might mount a crackdown as cryptocurrencies gain wider acceptance.

It's not clear how much the planned foray relates to “Amazon Coins,” an 8-year old virtual currency initiative that allows holders to transact across web games.    Market Moves    Bitcoin at center of conversations at center of global markets      Inflation has all of a sudden become the biggest issue in global markets. and as with all things involving humans there's a lot of disagreement to go around.      The debate ranges from whether the Federal Reserve has the will power or inclination to snuff out inflation if prices really starts to tick up, to whether bitcoin is really the solution for big investors or corporations looking to protect themselves from the potential debasement of the U.S. dollar.      One thing's for certain: The three most important U.S. officials driving the economic strategy are U.S. President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Fed Chair Jerome Powell. And all three are broadly in alignment that the country's focus at this point should be on a stimulus-fueled recovery that will create lots of jobs. Inflation isn't really a concern right now. Worry about that later, the thinking goes.      ""The Fed will continue to support the devastated labor market with plenty of brrrrrrrrrrrrrr,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Wednesday. That two-consonant word, for those who missed the popular meme last year, is the elongated version of an onomatopoeic rendition of the sound a money printer ostensibly makes.      A big data point on inflation arrived Wednesday from the U.S. Labor Department, which reported that the ""core"" consumer price index, which excludes food and energy items, was unchanged in January from December levels. Over the past 12 months, it's up 1.4%. No big deal, right? That's well below the Fed's target of 2% annually.      The real bogeyman, though, isn't what's happening with inflation now as the lingering coronavirus pandemic continues to take a toll on economic activity, suppressing consumer demand, but what happens when activity resumes in full and people get out and about and start spending all the money they've saved.      So big investors are fixated on bond-market signals showing fast-rising expectations for inflation in the future. The average level implied over the next five years recently ticked above 2%, and the chart shows a steep slope upward to the right:      The U.S. government's budget deficit has totaled $736 billion over the first four months of the year, a record for the period and 89% higher than a year earlier, according to a statement released Wednesday. The figures don't even account for the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that Biden is pushing Congress to pass despite reluctance from the opposition Republican Party as well as influential members of his own Democratic Party.      It goes without saying that any fresh stimulus would follow a lot that's already been done, both on the fiscal and monetary sides: The Federal Reserve has created about $3.3 trillion of new money since the start of 2020, pushing the size of its balance sheet to nearly $7.5 trillion for the first time.      ""With no hints of scaling back the Fed’s massive asset purchases, Powell is a super dove,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote Wednesday after reviewing a speech Wednesday by the Fed chair.      Bitcoin over the past year has become one of the most popular ways for big investors to play the ""reflation trade,""and there's no shortage or diversity of opinions on the cryptocurrency. It's a digital version of gold or it's a scam benefiting from a tulip-like mania, with a lot of space in between. Here's a quick rundown of comments that emerged Wednesday.    Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane: “The recent spike in their prices looks less like a trend and more like a speculative mania.""  David Rosenberg, former chief economist for Bank of America, now at his own firm: ""You’re buying bitcoin on the assumption that some bigger fool is going to buy it at a higher price.”  Three Morgan Stanley analysts, in a slide presentation. ""Central bank policies could be setting up for accelerating inflation. Investing in bitcoin provides a hedge against that risk, especially if supply chain payments can be migrated from fiat to bitcoin.""  Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal: ""We've done a lot of the upfront thinking to consider how we might pay employees should they ask to be paid in bitcoin, how we might pay a vendor, if they actually pay in bitcoin, and whether we need to have bitcoin on our balance sheet should that happen.""  Morgan Stanley Chief Global Strategist Ruchir Sharma: ""Even if bitcoin’s price pops, as it has before, the rush of 2020 can’t be dismissed as an irrational mania. Cryptocurrencies are still young, they still face growing pains. But they also promise speed, transparency and low fees that traditional payment channels cannot match. They satisfy a growing demand for a digital alternative to gold, an asset likely to protect investors from massive money printing and the threat of inflation. To younger investors, 'crypto' already evokes digital, stable and good, not shadowy and sinister. The rest would be well advised to recognize that the currency world is changing, or risk being left behind.""  Bank of America's research investment committee: ""As a long-term store of value, cryptocurrencies might be attractive, but only for investors who can tolerate substantial volatility.""  Nouriel Roubini, economics professor at New York University, appearing on Wednesday's ""First Mover"" show on CoinDesk TV: ""In the case of bitcoin, it doesn’t have any income, it doesn’t have any use, it doesn't have any utility. So what's the value of it, based on what? Based on no intrinsic value, and purely a speculative bubble.""  Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for global wealth management at Swiss banking giant UBS: ""The basic function of a modern currency is to store value. By contrast, the diminishing incremental supply of bitcoin has made 'bubbling' one of its basic functions.""    To sum up: The prospect of future inflation has become a central topic for investor conversations about global markets and the economy, and bitcoin is at the center of those.      With prices for the cryptocurrency up 55% already in 2021, outperforming almost everything in traditional markets for the third straight year, Wall Street analysts and mainstream corporate executives are no longer shrinking from the discussion.    Bitcoin Watch    ""Rich list"" grows; options market sees low odds of $100K in 2021      Bitcoin's ""rich list,"" consisting of blockchain addresses with at least 1,000 coins, continues to grow, a sign of sustained accumulation by large holders also known as whales, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole writes.    Tally hits fresh record high of about 6.1 million on Wednesday, surpassing the previous peak around 5.75 million reached Jan. 8, according to data provider Glassnode.  The data, coupled with the persistent positive Coinbase premium, a sign of institutional demand, suggests the path of least resistance for the cryptocurrency is to the higher side. NOTE: Coinbase premium is the gap between Coinbase's BTC/USD pair and Binance's BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, according to the South Korea-based on-chain data site CryptoQuant.  Options market, however, is pricing low odds of a rally into six figures this year.

42405863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAep9aF,1613047302,Bitcoin Options Market Sees Low Odds of Sky-High Rally in 2021,"Bitcoin's options market is assigning a low probability of prices rising above $100,000 this year despite widespread expectations for a meteoric rally in the wake of Tesla's recent purchase of the top cryptocurrency.      At press time, the options market is pricing 12% odds of the cryptocurrency trading in seven figures before the end of December, according to data source Skew. The probability of a break above $70,000 is around 21%.      ""With the extreme volatility of the past two months, the market isn't showing a lot of conviction on how bitcoin will trade for the rest of the year,"" Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk.      Option probabilities are calculated using the Black-Scholes formula based on critical metrics such as call options' prices, strike prices, the price of the underlying asset, and the ""risk-free"" interest rate on investments as U.S. Treasurys and the time to maturation.      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents a right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.      One may argue that the options market is underpricing prospects of a strong rally, given that Tesla's bitcoin purchases have bolstered bullish expectations.      ""Prices can fly very high. I expect other heavyweights to follow suit,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk, referring to Tesla's (TSLA) $1.5 billion bitcoin investment made earlier this year.      Further, if history is a guide, the cryptocurrency looks primed for a big move this year, having undergone its third reward halving or programmed 50% cut in daily issuance in 2020.      In the past, bitcoin has scored staggering gains in the year following the halving year. The cryptocurrency underwent its first and second halving in 2012 and 2016, respectively, and prices rallied by 5,000% and 1,300% in 2013 and 2017.      As of now, the options market doesn't appear to be concerned with history repeating itself. The market focus has turned to other large-cap coins, according to Chung.      ""Positioning is very bullish in the ETHUSD futures on Ether futures, which saw more than $30 million traded on day one.""      Also, option probabilities are not perfect indicators and merely represent traders' expectations, which can often be wrong. The probability of prices rising above $20,000 by December 2020 stood below 10% through the first ten months of the year. However, the cryptocurrency ended up rallying as high as $39,000 by the year's end.      Traders may begin pricing higher odds of a move to $100,000 by the end of 2121 if more corporates copy Tesla's decision to invest in bitcoin, leading to a convincing breakout above the psychological level of $50,000.      Bitcoin is currently changing hands near $46,200, representing a 3% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The cryptocurrency is stuck in a minor descending channel on the hourly chart.      A breakout would signal a continuation of the rally from $40,000, exposing the psychological hurdle of $50,000.

42405858,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAep9ZG,1613046200,BNY Mellon Announces Crypto Custody and Spies Integrated Services,"BNY Mellon (NYSE: BK), the world’s largest custodian bank with some $41 trillion in assets in its safekeeping, is moving into crypto.      Announced Thursday, BNY Mellon will roll out a new digital custody unit later this year, to help clients deal in digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.      Banks exploring digital assets, or large app providers like PayPal offering crypto, tend to start out with the usual suspects: bitcoin, ether and other top coins.      “The platform we have built would service any of those assets,” Mike Demissie, head of advanced solutions at BNY Mellon, said in an interview. “It will be driven by client interest and demand, and we also stayed tuned to regulatory activity to make sure we are supporting assets that are allowed in a particular market.”      There’s a similarly short list of crypto-native custody tech firms that a bank like BNY Mellon would likely draw upon to build out a custody solution. Demissie confirmed the custody offering relies on outside partners but said the bank is “not ready to disclose any names yet.”      “We are certainly not building it entirely from scratch,” said Demissie.      The custody giant’s move into crypto was also given the blessing of Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, who pointed out a state-chartered banking institution like BNY Mellon is authorized to custody digital assets without needing to obtain a BitLicense.    Banks rush in    There has been some discussion among large crypto exchanges, trading desks and custody businesses about which financial institution will provide white-glove prime brokerage services, currently lacking in crypto. BNY Mellon’s plans would seem to be looking in that direction.      “We are starting with the anchor in this space, which is custody,” said Demissie. “Then it comes down to what our clients need from us. So that’s not just safekeeping of these assets, they want to leverage them for lending purposes, they want to leverage them for collateral. Then we are also looking at issuing digital assets like tokenized securities, real assets.”      Whether BNY Mellon’s plans meet the official prime broker definition is yet to be determined, added Caroline Butler, head of custody at BNY Mellon. “But I think the fact that we have such a fantastic collateral offering here, we should be leveraging an ability to connect across those product suites for digital assets as an asset class.”      Butler added: “And whether clients want to borrow or lend bitcoin versus the dollar, that's the level of interoperability that we need to be able to provide.”    Nuts and bolts    There are some nuanced differences when it comes to crypto custody, said Butler. “Being able to actually custody the key that represents the asset means effectively custody of code,” she said. “It leans in more on emerging technologies than our traditional custody software would naturally lend itself to. An important part is making sure it's all interoperable with our existing custody platforms.”      So which way does the bank’s crypto custody unit lean? Is it toward the kind of air-gapped cold storage sometimes associated with bunkers buried inside Swiss mountains, or more in line with math-powered multi-party computation (MPC), plus perhaps a hardware security module (HSM) component?      “All of the above,” said Butler. “Clients who are actively trading are going to need a level of accessibility to the assets that maybe cold storage can’t provide. But for security purposes, a portion in cold storage plus MPC, as an example, may be favorable to them.”    Read more: Goldman Sachs to Enter Crypto Market ‘Soon’ With Custody Play: Source    BNY Mellon says it is proud to be the first of the large U.S. custodian banks to come out with a service for digital assets. (JPMorgan and Citi are also said to be working on custody solutions for digital assets and crypto, as is Goldman Sachs.)      However, in terms of being the first, Northern Trust, with over $10 trillion in assets under custody, announced a partnership with Standard Chartered to extend custody services to digital assets back in December. (BNY Mellon was unable to say roughly when this year the service would go live.)      “We would like to highlight that it’s not just the custody aspect of it, but the integrated offering that’s a differentiating factor,” said Demissie.      Butler pointed out that Standard Chartered is a sub-custodian for BNY Mellon in some markets.      So could the banks’ respective digital custody units be connected when these services go live later this year?      “Not right away,” said Butler. “But further down the road, who knows?”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/11/bny-mellon-announces-crypto-custody-and-spies-integrated-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc9c8c56d42f44fbe748ba8703a493311e794af2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzUNh,1613039837,Crypto Mining Farm Spotted Using Nvidia RTX 30 Gaming Laptops: Report,"Rows of latest-model laptops, highly sought after by the gaming community, have been spotted in China being used to mine cryptocurrency.      In tweets posted on Wednesday, images show a room filled with ""several hundred"" gaming laptops said to be kitted out with Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics processing units (GPUs). WCCTech, a computer and gaming publication, said the laptops shown in the tweets come from the Chinese manufacturer Hasse and are being used to mine crypto using the in-demand Nvidia cards.      Like something from a gamer's nightmare, some laptops appear to be stripped of their housing to offer optimal cooling for the hard-at-work GPUs.      High-end GPUs are preferred by cryptocurrency miners because of the cards' greater processing power for crunching the mathematical tasks needed for mining. While bitcoin mining requires specialized processors called ASICs, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum's ether can still be mined on GPUs.      Gamers desire such top-of-the-range cards, too, however, because they provide a boost to graphics performance and are generally the easiest component in a computer to upgrade in order to to keep up with the latest gaming titles.      Typically, tech retailers and distributors place buy limits on the number of highly sought after products in order to distribute evenly. The tweets indicate a deal may have been struck between either retailer, distributor or laptop manufacturer and the mining entity for a bulk order, per WCCTech's report.      See also: Nvidia May Restart Production of Crypto Mining GPUs if Demand Sufficient      The entry-level laptops retail for $999 while the high-end models are expected to hit shelves for a recommended retail price of $1,999, according to the report. If the images and video are indeed authentic, the value of the newly established mining operation could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars at high street prices.      Nvidia recently said it could potentially restart production of dedicated GPUs for cryptocurrency miners, if demand is there.

42433598,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzUjh,1613029800,Microsoft and Enjin Bring Cross-Platform Custom NFTs to Minecraft,"Microsoft has launched a browser game that rewards players with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for use inside Minecraft, one of the world’s most popular games.      According to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday, Azure Space Mystery is a text-based interactive and educational puzzle game set aboard the International Space Station.      There, players encounter prominent female scientists, including German astronomer Caroline Herschel and Scottish scientist Mary Somerville, the first two women to join the Royal Astronomical Society; Alexandrian philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician Hypatia; and French pilot Raymonde de Laroche, world's first licensed female pilot.      NFTs acquired by playing the game will allow players to unlock a new “quest” inside the MyMetaverse Minecraft server. Users can then spawn Microsoft Azure heroes via the EnjinCraft plugin into the popular game.      “Education is key to empowering the next generation of innovators. Enjin is proud to work alongside Microsoft to generate innovative opportunities for merging virtual worlds, bringing digital communities closer together and celebrating powerful women in science and tech,” said Bryana Kortendick, VP of Operations & Communications at Enjin.      Microsoft says the new initiative demonstrates a viable interoperability between multiple platforms, applications and games.      “Enjin’s platform powers innovative projects across the gaming and wider blockchain ecosystem,” said Sherry List, Azure developer engagement lead at Microsoft.      List added the collaboration between Microsoft and Enjin has allowed her department to integrate “cutting-edge technology” with educational tools while simultaneously recognizing developer communities.    Minecraft + NFTs: How it works    On the first leg of the journey, a user embarks on a quest to explore and repair a failing international space station – the text-based part of the quest.      Upon successful completion, the user is then forwarded to a web page where they are asked to scan a QR code. The code provides an NFT that drops automatically into a user’s Enjin wallet, from there they can link their wallet to cross-platform gaming network MyMetaVerse.      NFTs are digital assets that represent a wide variety of physical goods as well as intangible assets, in the case of Microsoft's initiative, digital badges.      Key characteristics of an NFT include the fact they are non-interoperable, indivisible, indestructible and verifiable.      Built on Ethereum's ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards, they contain information that makes them distinct from other NFTs. Because they are easily verifiable, no two are the same and are unable to be traded with each other, differing from typical cryptocurrency standards.      It's important to gamers because they can access forms of value that unlock perks and benefits across multiple platforms, games and apps, creating integrated experiences that can potentially travel with them across the internet.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    On the final leg, a user needs to link up MyMetaVerse to Minecraft enabling access to Microsoft’s NFTs within the blocky 3D world.      Once inside Minecraft a user can type a directive /wallet that will spawn collectible “companions” who follow the user around the server and protect them.      “NFTs are important because they provide irrefutable proof of digital scarcity,” said Simon Kertonegoro, vice-president of developer success at Enjin. “With over 126 million users, the ability to spawn blockchain assets inside a Minecraft server is a huge step towards NFT adoption,”      Finally, completing the quest in Minecraft will enable players to unlock fungible tokens that provide benefits in Telegram and Discord. The “XX & XY Certified Equal” token can be used to unlock exclusive chat groups in the popular social messaging apps.

Musk has been tweeting about bitcoin and dogecoin in recent weeks, at one point updating the bio of his popular Twitter profile to ""#bitcoin."" Tesla filed its annual 10-K report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Monday, saying it purchased about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in January.      The New York University economics professor similarly criticized MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor's ""irresponsible behavior"" for converting a significant portion of the business intelligence firm's cash reserves to bitcoin considering the cryptocurrency's volatility. MicroStrategy currently holds 71,079 BTC, according to an SEC filing last week.      In an interview on CoinDesk TV's First Mover, Roubini warned bitcoin could ""collapse"" if Tether, the issuer of the tether (USDT) stablecoin, and crypto exchange Bitfinex are indicted this year. Tether has an eye-popping $31 billion market capitalization, and is subject to multiple ongoing investigations, including from the U.S. Department of Justice and the New York Attorney General’s office. At the center of the DOJ’s criminal investigation into Tether as an organization is whether or not USDT is used to inflate the cryptocurrency markets.      Bitfinex claimed last Friday it repaid the remaining balance of a $550 million loan to its sister firm, Tether. In 2018, the exchange borrowed over $600 million from Tether, with which it shares executives and ownership. The transaction was made public in April 2019 after the New York Attorney General’s Office alleged Bitfinex lost $850 million in customer and corporate funds to payment processor Crypto Capital Corp., and used funds from Tether’s reserve to secretly cover the shortfall.      Roubini predicts the world will eventually ""phase out cash"" and the U.S. will create an ""e-dollar."" Central bank digital currencies will allow central bankers to swiftly maneuver monetary policy, he said, and normalize negative rates in times of economic crisis.

42433581,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzUDh,1613016306,"Crypto Use in Terrorism 'a Growing Problem,' Yellen Says","Cryptocurrencies used for illicit purposes are a ""growing problem,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday.      Speaking at a financial sector innovation policy roundtable, the former Federal Reserve Chair warned that cyberattacks and digital currency-related crimes were on the rise.      ""I see the promise of these new technologies, but I also see the reality: Cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism,"" she said in her opening remarks.      She referenced the Anti-Money Laundering Act passed into law by Congress last December, a part of the National Defense Authorization Act that requires the U.S. government to update its anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws. Yellen said the existing regulatory framework was created in the 1970s and has not been updated much since.      ""The update couldn’t have come at a better time. As this group knows very well, we’re living amidst an explosion of risk related to fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, and data privacy,"" she said.      This is the third time Yellen has spoken in public about crypto this year. During her confirmation hearing in January, she told the Senate Finance Committee that crypto use in terrorism was ""a particular concern."" In later, written, remarks, she softened her tone, saying cryptocurrencies could be beneficial to the existing financial system as well.    Read more: Senate Confirms Janet Yellen as US Treasury Secretary    Yellen's remarks come a week after the United Nations published a report saying cryptocurrencies have been used to finance ISIS and Al-Qaeda.      That report referenced law enforcement actions in France and the U.S. Last September, French police arrested 29 individuals accused of facilitating a complicated scheme to fund terrorists using cryptocurrency coupons.      Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had dismantled three separate campaigns to finance Al-Qaeda, Hamas and ISIS that used cryptocurrencies.      A different U.N. report said North Korea-linked criminals might be using or stealing cryptocurrencies to fund the nation's nuclear weapons program.      Federal law enforcement officials are also investigating whether or not bitcoin was used to fund domestic terrorism in the U.S., after a now-deceased French blogger sent $522,000 in bitcoin to far-right figures who may have been present at the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6.      U.S. lawmakers are also asking whether crypto streaming platform DLive, a subsidiary of BitTorrent and the Tron Foundation, was used to facilitate crypto donations to individuals present at the insurrection.      The Treasury Department, alongside regulatory agencies in its umbrella, ""can better stem the flow of dark money,"" Yellen said on Wednesday.
