The donations will go towards funding grants and programs that pay Bitcoin Core developers to write and maintain code for the world’s dominant blockchain – an open source decentralized project that is completely reliant on such voluntary donations.  Earlier this year there were fears of a drop-off in the Bitcoin funding landscape from the current market downturn – crypto winter, in the industry lingo. Marathon’s pledge, which could raise $1 million when third party donations are included, shows one vested corporate entity's willingness to financially support the Bitcoin funding ecosystem.  “We believe it's really important that these developers get paid,” said Marathon CEO Fred Thiel in an interview with CoinDesk. “They operate out of their own pockets and the only way they can get funding is through grants like what Brink does.”  Brink was founded in 2020 and supports Bitcoin protocol development via a fellowship mentor program as well as a developer grant program. Brink co-founder and executive director, Mike Schmidt joined Thiel on stage at the conference to announce the campaign.  Almost $280,000 has been donated at the time of reporting, according to Brink’s donation page.  “As a miner, the most important thing is global adoption of Bitcoin,” Thiel said. “Our primary priorities are making sure that Bitcoin Core development and maintenance is properly funded. We're going to work with a lot of the industry partners that we have, to get them to also contribute.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | RESEARCH,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/21/crypto-miner-marathon-pledges-500k-in-matching-funds-to-brink-for-bitcoin-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99d0f12cd82ac0e975dcdbd04d41727aa241d1db-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a recent note to clients. Although the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world’s largest digital token by market cap, jumped over 61% year-to-date, it’s still down around 60% since the November 2021 peak and 11% from a year ago, amid increased regulatory scrutiny of the industry and the fallout from a slew of high-profile bankruptcies that triggered a $2T wipeout. Similarly, the largest altcoin, ethereum ( ETH-USD ), surged more than 50% YTD and dropped over 60% from the November 2021 all-time high and roughly 10% Y/Y. Panigirtzoglou argued that the YTD crypto recovery might not turn out to be as sustainable as some have suggested as the stablecoin universe dwindles. He explained that stablecoins, whose value is tied to a reserve asset, “are the equivalent of cash in the crypto ecosystem,” essentially serving as a means of payment for various crypto transactions. For instance, traders use stablecoins like tether ( USDT-USD ) and USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) to swap in and out of various cryptos without having to use fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. “Headwinds from the US regulatory crackdown on crypto, the unsettling of banking networks for the crypto ecosystem and the reverberations from last year’s FTX collapse are weighing on the stablecoin universe which continues to shrink,” he said. The market cap of the largest stablecoins, Panigirtzoglou noted, has declined by nearly $60B since topping out at $186B in May 2022, before the multibillion-dollar collapse of the Terra ecosystem ( LUNA-USD ) ( UST-USD ). As such, the slump accounted for a little more than one-third of the Terra downfall. Still, the stablecoin market share stood at less than $30B at the start of 2021 and just around $5B at the start of 2020, underscoring how quickly such tokens have gained popularity. Likewise, the crypto market cap of $1.14T as of Friday afternoon compared with the ~$3T peak in November 2021, $833.3B at the start of 2021 and $193B at the start of 2020, according to CoinMarketCap data . “The expansion of the stablecoin universe can be thought of as a proxy for the amount of money that has entered the crypto ecosystem from fiat and vice versa,” the note said. In other words, cryptos and stablecoins are interdependent. More trouble ahead in the wake of U.S. debt-ceiling impasse? The analyst explained how reserves of major stablecoins have increasingly consisted of Treasury securities, ""implying a big challenge by stablecoins to maintain their pegs in an adverse scenario of a US technical default."" Such an issue under this adverse scenario ""could reverberate to the whole crypto ecosystem given the vital role stablecoins play in the crypto ecosystem in facilitating access to trading and decentralized finance and as source of collateral,"" he contended.

In a recent series of tweets, Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, sparked a wave of Ethereum discussions by presenting a compelling case for Ethereum’s token, ETH, to potentially surge to as high as $457,081. Revealing The Analysis Cochran addressed skeptics who questioned the feasibility of ETH experiencing a 20x increase, comparing it to the market capitalizations of tech giants like Apple and Amazon. He emphasized that Ethereum should not be viewed as a traditional company, but rather as a groundbreaking blockchain-based infrastructure that transcends conventional boundaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Confluence Of Bearish Factors and At Risk of Another Decline Cochran’s analysis took inspiration from the sheer magnitude of securities processed through clearing houses, reaching an astounding $2.5 quadrillion last year. Contemplating the possibility of conducting this process on the Ethereum blockchain with a meager 0.05% gas fee, Cochran envisioned an annual burn of $1.25 trillion worth of ETH, equivalent to 5.7 times the current market cap. Building upon this foundation, he extrapolated a forward-looking multiple that projected Ethereum’s potential value to approach $35 trillion. Cochran’s projection gained more momentum as he introduced the concept of a compounding burn rate. Assuming an annual compounding burn rate of 2% or more over a 20-year period, the value per ETH could potentially skyrocket to $457,081. Moreover, Cochran acknowledged that achieving a scenario where 100% of global securities settlement occurs on Ethereum within two decades might be unlikely, but settling 10% within a decade appeared feasible. Ethereum Value And Market Reach Beyond the securities market, Cochran proposed that Ethereum could capture additional value-based markets, further propelling its growth. He argued that settling 10% of global securities and tapping into other value markets could realistically lead to a 30x-35x increase in value within the next decade, even accounting for a 33% margin of error. Notably, Cochran’s analysis sheds light on Ethereum’s potential to disrupt traditional intermediaries, offering reliable and affordable settlement solutions. With trillions of dollars in annual turnover up for grabs, the prospect of eliminating trusted intermediaries become increasingly enticing for various markets worldwide.

Ethereum’s unique position as a blockchain infrastructure opens doors to innovation and disruption, ultimately challenging the status quo of trusted intermediaries. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price hasn’t made any significant movement in the past week but a slight upward trend, up by 0.6%. ETH has surged from a low of $1,805 seen last Friday to trade at $1,815, at the time of writing. Ethereum market capitalization has also recorded little gains in the past seven days. ETH’s market cap has surged nearly 1% from a cap low of $217 billion to a high of $218 billion on Friday. Meanwhile, ETH’s daily trading volume has also plunged throughout the week from a high of $7 billion last Monday to $3.6 billion in the last 24 hours. -Featured image from Shutterstock, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/crypto-expert-predicts-ethereum-eth-to-reach/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

This show of strength by the metaverse cryptocurrency coincides with a busy week dominated by the bulls. However, it appears that the RNDR price increase is not a result of general market sentiment. So, what could be driving up the value of Render? Related Reading: Cardano Surpasses 500 Million ADA In TVL – How About Its Impact On Price? RNDR Gains 32% In One Week – Price Overview After a period of sideways movement, the price of RNDR has chosen to go upward to become one of the biggest gainers this past week. According to CoinGecko data, this coin has ballooned by more than 32% in the last seven days. It is worth noting that most of this price increase happened in two days – on the 17th and 18th of May. In an almost vertical rise, RNDR surged in value by more than 20% on Wednesday, May 17. This price rise is understood to be a reaction to the news of Apple launching its VR headset. RNDR, the utility token of the Render Network, didn’t have a great market performance in 2022, sinking as low as $0.325 at some point in the year. However, the cryptocurrency has been on an excellent recovery, gaining nearly 500% since the turn of 2023. As of this writing, the RNDR token changes hands at $2.36, with a 2.8% price increase in the past 24 hours. That said, price data reveals that the coin has not made any significant movement since Thursday, consolidating around the $2.50 price level. RNDRUSD trading at $2.367 | Source: RNDRUSD chart from TradingView How Apple’s VR Headset Will Affect RNDR Price As earlier mentioned, the price surge experienced by RNDR in the past week was primarily due to the rumors of Apple launching its highly-anticipated VR headset next month. In fact, most metaverse tokens, including MANA, ICP, SAND, etc., enjoyed a bullish run as a result of the news. The Render Network offers decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions. Meanwhile, RNDR is the utility token used to pay for motion graphics, animation, and VFX rendering on the network. The RNDR token basically powers all products released by the network’s parent company. And, with the recent release of Render’s OctaneX app on M1 and M2 iPads, there is speculation that the developers of the new VR headset will use the Render network. OctaneX is an app that offers real-time, photo-realistic 3D rendering in M1 and M2 iPads. Considering this potential development, there is rising demand for the RNDR token – and we are very likely to see a further increase in its price.

12822897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534227,1684666721,Conflux Token (CFX) Retraces After 39% Gains In Seven Days,"Conflux (CFX), the token powering Conflux’s high throughput, Tree-Graph powered layer-1 blockchain, experienced a rollercoaster ride in a whirlwind of price fluctuations. Last week, it tumbled to a low of $0.20 per token, leaving observers on edge. However, it managed to climb back up over the course of the week, reaching a level of $0.330. However, the token has faced a downward trajectory in the past four days, resulting in a decrease of over 19% in price. CoinMarketCap data shows that CFX has dipped around 2% in the last 24 hours. Despite this recent dip, optimistic projections for its future price persist. While it may have encountered some setbacks, Conflux has remained one of the top performers in the past seven days, impressively gaining over 30% during this period. Maintaining a position above the key support level of $0.295, which aligns with the previous week’s high, provides some stability amidst the turbulence. What’s Driving Conflux (CFX) Growth? Conflux (CFX) has been making waves with its remarkable on-the-year gains of approximately 1,700%. Naturally, observers are curious about the role of whales in this upward surge, speculating whether they are driving the buying and pumping of the token. While it’s a possibility, we can’t say for certain. The impressive performance of Conflux coincides with the optimism surrounding China’s renewed interest in cryptocurrencies. As the country seemingly shifts its stance towards the crypto industry, there are hopes that Conflux will reap the benefits. The project has been actively fostering partnerships with various regional enterprises, positioning itself as a potential frontrunner in meeting regulatory requirements.

This collaboration opens up exciting opportunities as Little Red Book’s massive user base of 180 million individuals can now showcase Conflux-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on their profiles. Additionally, Conflux has forged a partnership with China Telecom, further enhancing its presence and potential within the Chinese market. Conflux, China Telecom Introduce Blockchain SIM Card Conflux Network and China Telecom have unveiled the world’s first Blockchain SIM (BSIM) card, a mobile user identification card based on blockchain technology. The BSIM card, resembling traditional SIM cards, is compatible with Android and iOS systems and offers significantly larger storage space and computing power than traditional SIM cards. The BSIM card goes beyond standard communication functions by generating and storing users’ public and private keys within the card itself. By employing a “private key never leaves the card” approach for digital signatures enhances security and reduces the risk of malware or virus attacks on mobile terminals. Additionally, the card provides encrypted storage and key recovery features and integrates traditional U-shield functions, making it a highly secure Web3 user terminal entry solution. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Surges By 19% Following ‘Surprise’ NFT Announcement This collaboration between Conflux Network and China Telecom showcases their innovation in merging blockchain technology with mobile user identification, introducing a robust and efficient solution for users in the ever-evolving digital landscape. What Next For Conflux (CFX)? As long as renowned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to thrive in the face of global banking system concerns, Conflux (CFX) might also benefit from these favorable market conditions. Additionally, the prospects of significant financial easing from central banks, including the Federal Reserve, could further bolster CFX’s performance. Hong Kong’s recent decision to legalize certain cryptocurrency trades is a noteworthy development to monitor. This move is seen by many as a testing ground for potential crypto legalization on the mainland. Considering Conflux’s growing popularity and adoption in China, CFX stands to gain as a key beneficiary of this trend. The recent collaboration with a Chinese SIM card company further strengthens the optimism within the crypto community. These factors collectively contribute to the positive outlook for CFX, as it rides the coattails of established cryptocurrencies, anticipates favorable monetary policies, and capitalizes on potential crypto legalization in China. At press time, Conflux was trading at $0.2962. -Featured image from iStock.com, charts from CoinMarketCap and TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,CFX,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | TRADING | CFX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/conflux-token-cfx-retraces-after-39-gains-in-seven-days/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Tornado Cash is down 28.25% in the last 24 hours, albeit this only represents a retraced value. Following news of TORN’s attack, the token initially dropped by over 60% before finding support around the price region of $3.86. Since then, TORN has made some upward movement, however not sufficient to cover up the earlier loss. Related Reading: LUNC Burn Tax Set To Rise To 0.5% As KuCoin Proposal Receives Approval TORN Governance System Breached: $2M Stolen Through a malicious governance proposal, a hacker gained control of Tornado’s Cash Governance, allocating 1,200,000 votes to themselves. According to Chinese reporter Colin Wu, the hacker used their newly gained control to move a total of 483,000 TORN out of the Tornado Cash governance vault worth about $2 million at the present market price of $4.5. The hacker then proceeded to deposit 6,000 TORN on the Bitrue exchange and swapped the remaining 379,300 TORN on-chain for 375ETH. Currently, there has been no official statement from Bitrue on this development. Meanwhile, all TORN investors have been urged to withdraw all their governance-locked funds from the project developers. In addition, the Binance exchange has suspended TORN deposits pending a solution to the governance issue. For now, it remains unknown how long it may take for TORN developers to regain control of the governance system and perhaps recover the stolen loot. Thus, TORN investors are advised to keep a close watch for any latest development. At the time of writing, TORN is trading at $4.5, with a 1.5% gain in the last hour. Looking at its broader performance, the DeFi token leaves much to desire, with 30.6% and 48.9% losses in the last 14 and 30 days, respectively.

The TORN protocol operates as a decentralized, non-custodial cryptocurrency tumbler that mixes “potentially identifiable or tainted cryptocurrency funds with others” so as to cover the original trail of such funds. Due to this service, the DeFi project served as a “money laundering” tool in a couple of crypto heists, most notably the $625 million Ronin exploit in 2022. About 2000 ETH – valued at nearly $2 million then- of the loot were moved to Tornado Cash following the heist. Following this event, TORN was blacklisted by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), banning all U.S. citizens from engaging with the protocol. Other popular heists involving the use of Tornado Cash in moving part of the stolen funds include the recent $200 million theft from Euler Finance and the $28 million Derbit hack in 2022. -Featured Image: Forbes , Chart from Tradingview",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/tornado-cash-suffers-27-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12822009.jpeg

DAOs, short for decentralized autonomous organizations, allow token holders to lock up their holdings as votes for proposing changes to a project. These changes can range from deploying treasury funds to purposes that benefit the project to expansion on other networks.  At the start of the weekend, the attacker floated a malicious proposal that hid a code function that granted them fake votes that can now be used to handle some aspects of Tornado Cash, such as torn (TORN) tokens held in the main governance contract or withdrawal of locked torn tokens.  This was done by putting forth a proposal that imitated an earlier version – except with some malicious code that allowed for the update of logic that gave the attacker access to all governance votes.  “Now that they have all the votes, they can do whatever they want,” security research @samczsun tweeted on Sunday. “In this case, they simply withdrew 10,000 votes as TORN and sold it all.”  As such, this attack does not impact the actual Tornado Cash protocol – which allows users to pass funds through the service to mask or obscure the movements of funds and crypto addresses. This attack was not an exploit of any smart contracts or technology related to the working of Tornado Cash.  Meanwhile, the Tornado Cash community has put up newer proposals that seek to revert changes made to the code. One community member observed that the attacker had maliciously minted over 1 million torn for themselves, worth over $4 million at current prices.  Others suggested making a new contract altogether and airdropping new tokens to holders.
