42427182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0BLh,1480719051,Ether Prices Plunge To 7-Month Low,"Ether (ETH) prices struck a seven-month low on 2nd December, extending the losses suffered earlier in the week. ETH fell to as little as $7.60 at 15:55 UTC, according to Poloniex figures. The last time the price dropped to this level was in late April.  The price of ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – managed to recover later in the session, reaching $7.88 at 17:10 UTC, additional Poloniex data reveals. In spite of this improvement, ETH followed a steady, downward movement during the day, peaking when it opened the session at $8.40.  Ether prices have been encountering headwinds recently as their platform has dealt with a series of technical challenges. The ethereum network has undergone a series of forks, the latest of which was unintentional and resulted in the network being split between two transaction histories for a brief period of time.  Since the Thanksgiving fork, ethereum developers say they have moved to improve existing practices in order to prevent a similar situation from occurring.

42427165,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Avh,1480701269,Coders Named After Harry Potter Characters Join Bitcoin’s 'Mimblewimble',"One of bitcoin's more forward-looking projects has attracted a group of developers who are using some obscure names from the Harry Potter book series.  Bearing the names of the book series' invisibility cloak inventor (Ignotus Peverell), its leading wand maker (Garrick Ollivander) and the mother of its main antagonist (Merope Ripple), the developers are now working on the first version of Mimblewimble.  First proposed by a cryptographer who uses French version of Tom Riddle (better known as Lord Voldemort), Mimblewimble describes a unique way of solving some of bitcoin’s more pressing problems.  By rearranging bitcoin’s transaction structure in such a way, the proposal helps with two things: scaling the bitcoin network to a greater number of transactions and increasing the privacy of user's transactions. The downside of Mimblewimble is that its alternative transaction structure doesn’t work with the existing bitcoin network, so this code may ultimately come to form the basis for future implementation as a sidechain or an altcoin.  In an effort to bring the theoretical project to life, bitcoin experts such as Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra and Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop have taken an active interest in the project, with Poelstra putting forth a white paper that refines the idea and offers ideas for further scalability improvements.  While Lord Voldemort disappeared after debuting his paper, pseudonymous developers bearing the names of Harry Potter characters went on to take the reins and begin working on an implementation based on the original concept.  According to Poelstra, the jury is still out as to the true identities of these developers.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There isn't any publicly available info about who these people are.""  New 'wizards'  Shortly after the paper's debut (and its author's departure), Ignotus Peverell took the role of ringleader, putting Lord Voldemort’s theory into practice in a project called grin.  He or she described the open source project as ""very far from complete"" upon publishing it in the bitcoin-wizards IRC channel, a popular place to chat about technical bitcoin details.  On 29th October, Garrick Ollivander joined ranks to ""fix a merkle tree malleability"", among other updates, sparking a new round of excitement for at least one developer.  ""And sure enough here was yet another Harry Potter character showing up doing Mimblewimble stuff which was super exciting. I was super jacked. I went for a long run around Austin to let my excitement out,"" Poelstra said at a recent bitcoin meetup. The entry of Ollivander was followed by Merope Riddle, who made several contributions in late October.  Despite the attention from more ""wizards"", Poelstra noted that the project is not yet usable, but that it's ""making steady progress"".

42427167,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Axh,1480697252,Smart Contracts Startup Hires Cryptographer Lisa Yin,"Smart contracts startup Symbiont has hired a cryptographer best known for her work in detailing how to break the SHA-1 hashing algorithm as its new chief security officer.  Dr. Lisa Yin, who will also serve as chief cryptographer, was one of three academics to publish a 2005 paper outlining an attack on SHA-1. In the eleven years since, further research has been published highlighting attacks on the hashing algorithm, and in recent years tech firms have called for its retirement.  Yin also served as chief editor of the IEEE P1363 project, which develops and publishes standards for public-key cryptography.  According to the startup, Yin will focus primarily on privacy and security issues related to its blockchain projects. Symbiont unveiled its flagship blockchain initiative, dubbed Assembly, in October.  Yin said in a statement:  ""I am very excited to join the team, and I look forward to keeping Symbiont ahead of the curve on developments in cryptography, which is a critical building block for distributed ledger technology.""  Yin's appointment represents the second high-profile talent grab the startup has made in the past month. In November, Symbiont tapped former SEC commissioner Dan Gallagher for its board of directors. At the time, Symbiont also added former T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services CEO and president Todd Ruppert to the board.

42427161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Alh,1480694109,R3's Corda Code Debut Draws Mixed Response,"R3 released the code for its Corda distributed ledger platform earlier this week, and market observers were quick to weigh in.  The Corda codebase launched Wednesday to public consumption is an early-stage distributed ledger platform designed to record and automate legal agreements between various business entities, with a particular focus on financial institutions.  R3 has pitched the release as a way to open the code up to outside comment – and thus far, reaction to the effort has been mixed, drawing both praise and criticism from market observers.  A director at PricewaterhouseCoopers' fintech and digital practice, said his company welcomes the release, given the potential educational contribution it could make to blockchain developers. Ajit Tripathi said that PwC plans to work with its clients to help them use the software if they express an interest.  Tripathi acknowledged that the open sourcing of the code is certainly good for publicity. At the same time, he added, other code publications from both established companies and startups have demonstrated that it's exactly this kind of publicity that can spark interest from potential contributors.  Given the importance of developer adoption, Tripathi said they have have little choice ""but to open-source their platforms."" But that doesn’t mean they aren’t also seeking to protect those ideas even as they share them. In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that R3 had filed a patent application for a distributed ledger financial platform, dubbed Concord, upon which others might build.  Tripathi went on to remark:  ""It's also entirely commercially sound to look to preserve their IP through patents where appropriate, although R3 would need to be careful not to ever use any patents in a way that would make developers or institutions wary about using Corda.""  Corda criticism  Following the release, some skeptics on social media and at industry conferences moved to voice doubt over the distributed ledger’s value proposition.  In a lengthy explanation on Twitter, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd expressed confusion over what problem Corda is designed to solve. He also argued that, without a clear explanation of who authorized changes, there would be a lack of accountability to partners.    Not once do the Corda docs talk about who actually is supposed to have access to keys; whole point of crypto is to know who did what!        — Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) November 30, 2016    Addressing a panel hosted earlier this week by the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, blockchain researcher and analyst Tone Vays took aim at the Corda release. In conversation with CoinDesk, he argued that R3 is primarily focused on selling its consulting services, and that there is little distinction between Corda and existing approaches to shared databases.  ""But getting all the banks in a room and discussing a shared database is I guess impressive,"" said Vays.  'Overwhelmingly positive'  For its part, R3 says that the debut has been a success. According to managing director Charley Cooper the response to the open-sourcing of Corda has been ""overwhelmingly positive"".  If the startup was hoping to get developers involved, early signs suggest that the effort is working. Within two hours of blockchain banking consortium R3CEV’s launch of its open-source platform, its first meaningful contribution was received.  Currently, there are about 350 members on the Corda Forum and 18 contributors to the Github page who collectively have made a total of 17 pull-requests, nine of which have been merged with the codebase. The first substantial pull-request, to factor out the webserver into a separate process, has sparked a lively conversation between R3’s lead platform engineer Mike Hearn and other contributors.  In addition to the changes to the codebase that have already been implemented, Cooper says the consortium has heard from ""top-level contacts"" around the industry offering ""constructive feedback"" and expressing a desire to get involved.  In the near future open-source blockchain group Hyperledger is expected to incorporate Corda into its growing suite of tools. In a conversation yesterday Cooper expressed excitement over Corda’s reception so far, and for some perspective, a comparison to Hyperledger itself.  Cooper concluded:  ""We’re still at a fraction of the users and active participants that they have. But they’re a year into this and we’re 24 hours into this.""

42427164,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Ath,1480686697,Coinbase Seeks Patent for Bitcoin Private Key Security System,"Bitcoin and ether exchange startup Coinbase is seeking a patent for a security system for bitcoin private keys.  According to an application published on 24th November by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Coinbase is aiming to patent a “security system forming part of a bitcoin host computer”. Coinbase submitted the application in May of last year, with software engineers Andrew Alness and James Hudon listed as inventors.  The startup, which has raised more than $116m in venture capital to date, has sought other patents in the past. The last few months have seen a flurry of activity on the patent front, as the USPTO has released applications from startups like Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, as well as major firms like AT&T and Nasdaq, that are related to the tech.  Coinbase explained in the application:  “It may be a security concern for users that the private keys of their Bitcoin addresses may be stolen from their wallets. Existing systems do not provide a solution for maintaining security over private keys while still allowing the users to checkout on a merchant page and making payments using their wallets.”  When reached for comment, the company pointed to a blog post from September of last year penned by co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong detailing its plans to seek patents “to keep them out of the hands of bad people”.  “We support innovation and development in the space and hope to facilitate through sharing of IP,” Coinbase said in an emailed statement.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

42427168,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Azh,1480683971,Bitcoin Loan Platform BitLendingClub to Shut Down,"Peer-to-peer bitcoin lending platform BitLendingClub has announced that it is shutting down next year.  First detailed in an email to users and later a blog post on its website, BitLendingClub said that ""regulatory pressure"" in Bulgaria, where the site is based, had driven the site to close.  While the platform's operators weren't clear on exactly when the site would begin to shut down, the team behind the service said that it would disable registrations and loan requests ""sometime next week"". Full closure is expected sometime in August of next year, before which time the ability to repay loans and withdrawal funds will remain active.  In an email, CEO Kiril Gantchev said that the site had been contacted by regulators in Bulgaria, but declined to comment further on the exact nature of those discussions.  Gantchev told CoinDesk:  ""We've been contacted by regulators in Bulgaria and the regulatory requirements posed to us make it unfeasible to operate the platform, we can't comment anything beyond that.""  Launched  in May 2014, BitLendingClub would go on to raise a €200,000 seed investment from European VC fund LAUNCHub in October of that year. The service is one of several aiming to provide peer-to-peer loans denominated in the digital currency.
