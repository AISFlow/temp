Cheers  pairs a mobile platform that enables bitcoin tips to be sent to musicians with a social network structure that allows users to share information, send messages to friends and search for new artists to support.  The company's co-founder Justin Womersley told CoinDesk that he believes Cheers could reinvigorate an industry that has seen falling revenues for performing artists.  Cheers, he says, offers a way for music-lovers to connect with artists in a way that is becoming more difficult in the era of digitised relationships:  ""The streaming model, while great for the consumer, is not that great for the artist. And in addition, for the consumer, there’s a lack of an emotional connection between [them] and the artists they’re enjoying. From that side, we wanted to create a tool that really connected people in the digital age.""  Beyond music, the platform may one day see use as a way to reward and generate income for all kinds of artists, from filmmakers to bloggers to graphic designers.  Behind the concept  Cheers allows you to send money to musicians whether you’re watching them play at a local bar or you happened to catch one of their tracks on Facebook. Currently, the company is working on an iOS app that is expected to be available sometime in the next few weeks, Womersley said.  One of the most intriguing aspects of the Cheers app is its ability to “listen” and recognize live music as it is being played. According to Womersley, Cheers leverages The Echo Nest, a music database that boasts more than 35 million known songs and artists and counts services like Spotify and the BBC among its customers.  After the app recognizes the song and identifies the artist, the user then has the chance to write a personalized message and donate bitcoin to the artist. Once complete, the user sends the 'cheer' and broadcasts this action to his or her network of friends.  Womersley added that Cheers will leverage the power of community to enhance the service. Artists who aren’t already included in the system can be crowdsourced by the Cheers community, who he said will act as information-gatherers for new and exciting artists.  Notably, the service doesn’t require an artist to sign up to receive any bitcoin tips that come their way. Cheers handles the outreach process, and by doing so aims to create an organic network of musicians brought together by grassroots efforts.  ""We really want to use the community and let everyone contribute to what they want Cheers to be. Obviously we have a vision for what we want to build, but really, it’s the community that will help direct where we’ll go,"" said Womersley.  He added that ""more than one high-profile band"" has got in touch with Cheers, and although he couldn’t share which bands have contacted the company, Womersley indicated that the level of enthusiasm surrounding the project is on the rise.  Rewarding creators  Ultimately, he said, Cheers is designed to eventually become a platform for people to tip all kinds of artists:  ""Online there’s lots of creators. For a lot of the time, it’s difficult to monetize and grow your fans. So, what we really wanted to build was a way to easily reward people who make things that you love.""  Cheers opted to focus on music because of the strength of grassroots music communities throughout the world. Eventually, however, the goal is to cover all creators, ""whether it’s a song or a blog post or a painting or a picture on Instagram, anything,"" Womersley said.  He added that while development is focused on the Cheers app, integration with other services and platforms is also possible. He suggested that social networks like Facebook and Twitter could be leveraged to send cheers, as well as physical means to broadcast cheers during performances, showings and other artistic events.  Currently, the Cheers development team is not actively seeking investors; instead, the focus is on delivering a consumer-ready product, Womersley said.  A community of trust  Womersley acknowledged the concerns among some consumers about the risks of transacting in bitcoin. He stated that Cheers is placing a high priority on ensuring users that their money is being delivered to artists, saying:  ""What’s really important is building trust with our customers. So, we’re really committed to keeping open and transparent about where your money is, what stage it is, if it's gotten to the artist or not. We don’t want people to have any concern about tipping.""  He added that after two months, if a tip is unable to be delivered, Cheers will refund those tips to users at no cost. The platform doesn’t charge any transaction fees outside of the normal operating costs of the bitcoin network.  With its musical focus and creative use of social media capabilities, Cheers stands to impact the way that both consumers and artists engage with one another while potentially tackling a serious problem plaguing a once highly profitable industry.

42425742,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjXh,1401823272,Gallery: Arnhem Sets Bitcoin Acceptance Record With Bitcoincity Event,"Arnhem's Bitcoincity event took place on Wednesday 28th May, with the organisers hailing the one-off Dutch bitcoin extravaganza as ""a great evening, where the atmosphere got even better after more bitcoins were traded for beers and wines"".  Inspired by The Hague's 'Bitcoin Boulevard' – two canal side streets that took the decision to adopt bitcoin on an ongoing basis, the event was planned to encourage wider acceptance of the digital currency in the Dutch city.  According to the organisers, around 15 cafes, bars and restaurants took part in the event, accepting 96 bitcoin payments and receiving around 4.749769 BTC (1,977 euros) through the course of the evening.  ""Although not everyone was able to stay that long, I do believe everyone who showed up had a fantastic time,"" said Patrick van der Meijde, one of the organisers.  To ensure people had enough bitcoin to pay for a merry evening, a euro-accepting Lamassu ATM was also installed at Café De Koopman on Korenmarkt.  While the majority of the 70 or so people that took part were Dutch, a few foreigners also grabbed the chance to spend some bitcoin in the real world. Even a few local bank employees showed up to find out more about bitcoin and how it works, the organisers said.  To encourage a little extra enthusiasm, the event also hosted a competition with a €150 prize for the person who managed to make most bitcoin transactions over the evening. In the end, Dutch bitcoiner Wouterwalked off with the voucher for food-delivery website Thuisbezorgd.nl after making bitcoin payments at eight different establishments.  Going forward, at least 10 of the restaurants and cafés plan to keep accepting bitcoin as a payment method following the event's success. Furthermore, the organisers said, other establishments – which did not accept bitcoins at the event – have indicated some interest in starting to accept bitcoin.  This may mean that, in one fell swoop, Arnhem has overtaken Bitcoin Boulevard to become the Dutch city with the greatest number of bitcoin-accepting restaurants and bars.  The organisers indicated that they hope more such initiatives will take off so that ""we will be able to pay with bitcoins everywhere we go"" and offered their support for other cities interested in organising their own bitcoin event.

42425722,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfj7h,1401820280,How BlockCypher's Latest Update Could Deliver Gyft to Litecoin Users,"Everything is moving to the cloud these days, and for good reason — cloud-based services offer reliability, scalability and support to a degree that is unattainable for a company without an experienced IT team.  In short, the cloud lets companies focus their efforts on their products, and leave the hosting to professionals.  In the digital currency space, many application developers have experience in IT, but for mainstream development, it makes sense for block chains to move to the cloud. Enter BlockCypher, which offers cloud-based solutions for on-block chain applications.  Founded by a team of software veterans, BlockCypher’s goal is to be the infrastructure for the next-generation of block chain applications, providing users the ability to host multiple block chains on a single infrastructure that gives users a consistent interface across multiple coins.  With the recent addition of litecoin to BlockCypher’s platform, for example, Love Will Inc, the creator of the Pheeva wallet, is already working on a new wallet, potentially opening up Gyft card purchases to litecoin users.  Potential applications    Building and managing a high-volume, data-driven application can be challenging. Introducing one or more block chains into the application then adds a whole new array of complications: each block chain requires its own dedicated infrastructure for processing, storage and peer-to-peer protocols.      BlockCypher says it can collapse all of that into a single intuitive interface that is both reliable and scalable across multiple block chains.      What sort of applications require multiple block chains running simultaneously? Take an exchange, for instance, which must maintain a full node for each coin they offer trading for and they must support a wide range of capabilities, from the latest price to algorithmic trading.      A service such as BlockCypher's gives the ability for their developers to focus on the exchange business without the additional burden of running the back-end for multiple block chains.      Another example is a gaming casino application with a web front-end leveraging the bitcoin and litecoin block chains. As users place their bets, communication must occur between the game's back-end and the block chains. To achieve this, developers must host full nodes to get block chain data and broadcast new transactions.      For both the exchange and gaming examples, they have to decide whether they want to host multiple full-node block chain infrastructures themselves or use web APIs.    Need for APIs    Clearly there is growing market demand for APIs that can process and store block chain data in convenient forms and broadcast transactions on a user’s behalf, as the bitcoin ecosystem has seen a number of API companies emerge recently.      APIs offer major benefits for application developers because they greatly simplify having to build out the necessary infrastructure. However, APIs raise concerns for reliability and privacy. If everyone uses the same API and it goes down, the whole ecosystem takes a serious blow. Also, if all your requests travel through a single company’s servers, that company can maintain a lot of behavioral data. That being said, those concerns have been largely addressed by cloud solution providers in other industries.      While a low-volume app can get away with free APIs that may or may not work consistently, more serious applications cannot afford to bet their business on such services. Both reliability and performance are required for high transaction applications and are complicated to achieve.      In the case of BlockCypher, Catheryne Nicholson, CEO and founder, says their primary focus is scalability and performance:      ""We run in multiple data centers with redundant servers for low-latency and failover prevention. This means that requests are fast and that there is no single point of failure in our architecture […] We could literally lose more than one-third of our servers with no outage. We can easily handle several 100,000 requests/hr and it doesn’t matter if you make 100,000 requests on one block chain or 1,000 requests on 100 different block chains.""            Challenges and opportunities  BlockCypher’s founders, Catheryne Nicholson and Matthieu Riou, are software veterans with a long history of building platforms in finance, defense, CRM, energy and education.    In rebuilding the Bitcoin client, they generalized it across multiple digital coins and block chains to isolate the different roles outlined in the original Satoshi white paper. Their architecture has modular and separated components which allows them to scale linearly, distribute their software onto multiple sites and support many use cases.      Nicholson explained:      ""We can build APIs that range from the basics (e.g. balance and unspents for an address, basic transaction WebHooks) to advanced capabilities (e.g hosting your own custom coin - we incur no overhead by hosting an additional block chain) to very advanced capabilities (e.g. multi-sig transactions) to future capabilities (e.g. transactional cross-chain transfers with pegs).""              Their infrastructure also takes into account the accelerating size of the Bitcoin block chain (it’s nearly 18Gb, growing over 2.5 times in the last year):      ""We use multiple instances of a distributed database, so the block chain can grow to whatever size, and we can support it. If you want to visualize the entire block chain or run analytics on it, we can help you do that.""              BlockCypher’s initial targeted users are wallets and exchanges, but its service could be useful for any application that leverages the block chain.    BlockCypher will offer a tiered pricing system, based on usage and data volume, which will include a free tier for low-volume users and an extended free plan for early adopters. It will also offer custom solutions and specially purposed APIs that can be licensed to businesses to accelerate and support those applications.  Future plans will permit integration of their software into enterprise architectures.

42425746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjZh,1401816556,Why Did the Lloyd's Bitcoin Insurance Deal With Elliptic Vault Break Down?,"The relationship between Lloyd’s of London and bitcoin storage service Elliptic Vault broke down just weeks after Elliptic's launch in January, it has emerged.  Elliptic Vault  was the first insured bitcoin storage service in the world and was widely hailed as a milestone for the industry.  The exact details of how the relationship between Lloyd’s and Elliptic broke down are unclear, with Elliptic COO Tom Robinson saying his impression was that Lloyd's pulled out ""due to the high level of publicity"" around the deal.  In turn, a Lloyd’s spokesperson claimed Elliptic never actually finalised the deal with the insurer to begin with, telling CoinDesk: “Enquiries were made about a policy, but the policy was not taken out.”  When shown a copy of a certificate between Lloyd’s and Elliptic, the spokesperson attempted to retract their previous comments, instead issuing the statement:  ""Elliptic are not insured by Lloyd's. We will not comment on speculation from Elliptic regarding other matters.""  Elliptic has strongly rejected suggestions it was not fully insured, telling CoinDesk: “Elliptic has insurance in place and always has done since we first began offering the Elliptic Vault service.”  ""We did have insurance from Lloyd's, absolutely,"" Robinson stressed.  A milestone for bitcoin businesses  Elliptic Vault’s launch in January 2014 was seen as a sign of maturity for bitcoin. The association with Lloyd’s of London gave the service credibility and coming soon after the widely-reported story of one bitcoiner losing millions in a discarded hard drive, it seemed to answer the question of whether bitcoin could be held securely.  Elliptic’s press release on 9th January proudly declared that Elliptic Vault had “insurance underwritten by Lloyd's of London”. But by early February, the relationship was dead.  The Internet Archive shows that by 15th February references to Lloyd’s of London had been removed from Elliptic’s website.  Since then, Elliptic has made no announcement that its relationship with Lloyd’s had ended, or that by 3rd February it had engaged new insurers.  CBC Insurance  , who brokered Elliptic's new insurance coverage, confirmed the new arrangement. Elliptic COO Tom Robinson said there was no gap between the two coverages.  In blogposts on 13th March and 1st May, the company refers to its insurance offering, noting that it pays out in bitcoin as well as sterling, and boasting that Elliptic “uses a large, multinational insurance company with extremely strong financial backing and a diverse risk portfolio”, but neglecting to mention that the company was no longer linked with Lloyd’s.  Robinson said his company “made the switch clear to those enquiring about our insurance, including in media interviews”.  Underwriters and insurers  A key part of this story is the difference between an underwriter and an insurer. An underwriter determines the risks around insuring a company, for example, and could be said to be doing the 'legwork' on an insurance offering. That offering is then presented to an insurer, who actually takes on the risk and provides the insurance.  Insurance companies may do underwriting themselves, or they may hire underwriters operating within the Lloyd’s of London marketplace, for example.  The phrase ""insured by Lloyd's of London"" is sometimes used as shorthand, but it's not the most accurate way to describe deals done through the Lloyd's of London marketplace.  The progression of bitcoin insurance  Since Elliptic Vault launched in January, other bitcoin companies have also insured customer deposits, notably Circle and Xapo. More recently, the Great American Insurance Group announced it would begin offering coverage for bitcoin.  Robinson says the problems Elliptic has faced were partly “a symptom of the young nature of the bitcoin ecosystem”.  “This is something that a lot of bitcoin businesses are experiencing, they launch bitcoin services in partnership with big brands and then those big brands have second thoughts when they receive a lot of publicity around it and then aren't so keen.”  Robinson's colleague, Elliptic CEO James Smith, said the company is ""enjoying fast-growing interest from financial institutions and other businesses both in the US and Europe"".  ""We are currently completing a funding round which will enable us to rapidly scale our team and customer base over the next couple of years, and look forward to helping many more companies engage with the digital currency ecosystem,"" he added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | SPONSORED,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/03/why-did-the-lloyds-bitcoin-insurance-deal-with-elliptic-vault-break-down,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a6a9ba4f2a17343c22a74d8700809a1b74bdb71-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425737,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjTh,1401815235,Erik Voorhees Faces $50k Fine Over Unauthorized Securities Sale,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally charged and settled with serial bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees for the public offering of securities without registering with the federal government.  The settlement bans Voorhees from making a bitcoin security offering for the next five years, according to an official SEC release. He must also relinquish profits totalling $15,843.98, as well as pay a penalty of $35,000.  The case stems from Voorhees’ solicitation of shares in two of his bitcoin-related ventures, SatoshiDICE and FeedZeBirds, which according to the SEC took place between 2012 and 2013. The SEC began investigating SatoshiDICE earlier this year.  SEC Division of Enforcement director Andrew Ceresney reiterated that entrepreneurs need to remember that the agency’s regulations still apply to bitcoin-related ventures, saying:  “All issuers selling securities to the public must comply with the registration provisions of the securities laws, including issuers who seek to raise funds using bitcoin.”  Ceresney added that the SEC will “continue to focus” on targeting companies that illegally offer securities for bitcoin investments.  Findings point to unsanctioned securities offering  According to the SEC, Voorhees was found to have violated sections of the Securities Act of 1933. He was accused of using online forums and social media platforms like Facebook to solicit investors between 2012 and 2013.  Voorhees raised more than 50,000 bitcoins from investors, although he later conducted a buy-back transaction in July 2013 which returned 45,500 bitcoins to investors.  It was during this period, the SEC reported, that Voorhees actively engaged in unlawful securities activity without federal approval.  The SEC findings noted:  “The first unregistered offering was explicitly referred to as the 'FeedZeBirds IPO'. Despite these general solicitations, no registration statement was filed for the FeedZeBirds or SatoshiDICE offerings, and no exemption from registration was applicable to these transactions.”  Notably, Voorhees agreed to cease and desist without conceding or denying the SEC’s findings. He later released a statement on reddit, saying that he plans on continuing his work in bitcoin:  ""As you may have seen, it was announced today that I have entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC. With this matter resolved, I look forward to helping to build the bitcoin industry and the future of finance.""  SEC sharpening tone against bitcoin?  The SEC charges against Voorhees represent one of the most high-profile cases against a bitcoin entrepreneur for securities violations to date.  Previously, the SEC had hinted that it was only investigating bitcoin and companies in the ecosystem in a bid to warn investors about the dangers of investing in digital currencies.  In May, the federal agency released an investor alert, citing the high risk of investment fraud and the prevalence of bitcoin-related scams that target unsuspecting consumers, saying:  “Potential investors can be easily enticed with the promise of high returns in a new investment space and also may be less skeptical when assessing something novel, new and cutting-edge.”  Image via Wikipedia",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/03/erik-voorhees-faces-50k-fine-over-unauthorized-securities-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97aba9a19d12b1c9e4f5193b87bfa479a0d55eea-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjbh,1401811521,Rapper 50 Cent Accepts Bitcoin for New Album 'Animal Ambition',"Business mogul and hip-hop star Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson has joined the growing number of musicians and entrepreneurs who are embracing bitcoin by accepting the digital currency as payment for his new album, 'Animal Ambition'.  50 Cent’s Shopify store will accept bitcoin payments for the new release, with BitPay acting as the payments processor. Shopify first integrated payments for its network of merchants in November 2013.  The development brings a prominent face to the bitcoin community. In addition to being a successful rap artist and producer, Jackson is a notable entrepreneur, having invested in Glaceau – the makers of Vitaminwater – in a deal that would eventually propel his net worth toward $140m.  Tony Gallippi  , BitPay’s executive chairman, hailed the announcement by saying:  ""We are excited to see high profile independent artists use bitcoin and 50 Cent's trail as an innovator is outstanding.""    Jackson has also sold more than 30 million records to date, with hit albums including 'Get Rich or Die Tryin’', 'Curtis' and 'Before I Self Destruct'.      The release follows Jackson's decision to leave longtime label Interscope Records in February to work with distributor Caroline, part of the Independent Services division of Capital Records.    Bitcoin's latest entrepreneur  Most famous for his investment in Glaceua, which later sold to beverage conglomerate Coca-Cola for $4.1bn, 50 Cent has also engaged in other notable investments over the years.  In 2013, he took another chance on the beverage market, launching Street King energy shots, which currently holds the number two market share in the $2bn annual industry.  Given Jackson's noted activism as an investor, it’s possible that the move signifies the rap star’s larger interest in digital currencies. For example, by accepting bitcoin as payment for copies of 'Animal Ambition', the venture provides Jackson with an interesting way of accruing BTC.  BitPay’s relationship with Shopify allows merchants to receive dollars, bitcoins or a combination of the two. It isn’t clear which direction Jackson plans on taking the store in this regard.  CoinDesk reached out to Jackson’s representatives for more details, but was unable to receive immediate comment.  More artists embracing bitcoin  Jackson isn’t the only music artist to embrace bitcoin for record sales.  In December 2013, Snoop Dogg (also known as recently as Snoop Lion) expressed interest in taking bitcoin for his next record, though to date he hasn't taken an formal steps toward this decision. At the time, he hinted that the record would be ""available in bitcoin and delivered in a drone"". Later, Snoop had a public exchange with Coinbase via Twitter about the idea, saying that ""I want to make it happen"".  Former Spice Girl Mel B followed suit later that month, expressing interest in the digital currency for her then-upcoming single. She remarked that she was excited about the possibilities contained in consumer-leaning innovations like bitcoin, saying:  ""I love how new technology makes our lives easier, and to me that’s exciting. Bitcoin unites my fans around the world using one currency. They can just pay using bitcoins!""  At the time, Donald Glover, a comedian who goes by the hip-hop moniker Childish Gambino, also suggested that he might accept bitcoin for his upcoming music project.  Beyond payments, other hip hop groups have experimented with the digital currency as a means of generating income. In March, Ain’t No Love launched their second EP, 'Tears of Joy', and paired the release with a bitcoin-friendly torrent publication on the FrostWire platform.

42425723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfj9h,1401809527,Missouri Secretary of State Halts Mining Business Over 'Deceptive Tactics',"Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander has ordered a local bitcoin mining hardware company to halt operations, citing a number of concerns.  The mining company, Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC), is headed by CEO Kenneth E. Slaughter and has been involved in the bitcoin space since 2009.  VMC’s parent company, AMC, is currently developing 28nm ASIC mining chips of its own, and it is this side of the business that has caused Kander to act.  'Deceptive tactics'  Kander claims that Slaughter used ‘deceptive tactics’ to raise money for the development of bitcoin mining rigs, with the Secretary of State's office pointing out that Slaughter used Bitcoin Talk forums to solicit potential investors for his products. The funds raised in the online effort would be channelled into AMC and VMC, both controlled by Slaughter.  “In exchange for purchasing stock in Virtual Mining Corporation, investors could see a two-year return on their investment as high 2,812%, Slaughter stated on Bitcoin Talk. The offering brought in more than $200,000 in Bitcoins,” Kander’s office stated in a press release. “Peddling shares of Active Mining Corporation, Slaughter also told potential investors that his company had offices in London and that investors would receive '100% return' from the 'global profits' of his technology sales.”  Slaughter took no steps to inform investors of the potential risks involved in the venture and told investors that bitcoin was “highly regulated” at both the state and federal level, the office says. Slaughter also allegedly failed to inform investors of relevant complaints against his previous company, Active Internet Communications.  Slaughter and his companies now face the prospect of multiple penalties from Kander’s office, the press release states.  Watching bitcoin  This is not the first time Secretary Kander felt compelled to act on bitcoin-related issues. Back in April, his office issued an investor alert for Missouri residents.  In the release, Kander said the safest approach to digital currency is to be cautious and to recognise that not even supposed digital currency experts know enough about the product to help investors make an informed decision.  ""Investments that are sold as a way to make a quick profit can also lead to a quick loss,"" Kander said. ""I encourage Missourians to be wary of any investments that promise an unusually quick return.""  Kander warned that many people were drawn to bitcoin as a way to make a speedy profit, but due to volatility and security issues, some investors have lost substantial amounts of money on digital currency markets.  Kander has called on all Missourians to contact his office before investing in a business, to check the status of the person and the product involved in the potential investment, warning:  ""If somebody isn’t registered, that’s a major red flag.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/03/missouri-secretary-of-state-halts-mining-business-over-deceptive-tactics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69a8af0025175016b036f4d0ed8f0fa38dc8b9a1-1024x658.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjHh,1401806057,Bitcoin Smart Meters Could Revolutionise How South Africans Pay for Power,"Johannesburg energy management company Invirohub is giving consumers new a way to buy prepaid electricity: bitcoin.  Smart meters manufactured by the company will integrate wallet addresses, 3G SIMs and a server connection to compute an up-to-the-minute bitcoin price. Customers simply send their bitcoin to their meter's wallet address and Invirohub will credit them with a commensurate amount of electricity.  “All this came together in my mind a few weeks ago where I realised that it wouldn't take much effort at all to integrate bitcoin into our current software,” said Technical Director Lorien Gamaroff. “I set to work and quickly put it all together.”  Warming up to bitcoin  Invirohub currently has pilot schemes operating in and around the Johannesburg area; several of which will have established an online presence in the coming months.  Demand for bitcoin payments among his existing clients – municipalities and property companies – is low, Gamaroff said. Few of them comprehend either the concept or the advantages of the digital currency to the extent of actually using it, and therefore haven’t offered a bitcoin payment option to their clients.  However, he is confident that that apathy will change with greater bitcoin awareness and education:  “The fact is that bitcoin is now built into the software and if any of their clients choose to pay with bitcoin then they may do so. Also, as the cost benefits become clear to them – negligible costs as compared to the several percent that banks charge – they will warm to the idea.”  Business has been especially successful with municipalities in rural areas where residents find it difficult, if not impossible, to recoup the expenses of unmetered electricity use.  Gamaroff said that occupants in one such town could only afford to spend a few South African rands at a time, with many purchasing US$2 of electricity every few days. For such customers, a technology like bitcoin would be comprehensible since most, he asserted, are aware of payment methods like M-Pesa, the Kenya-based mobile payments system with at least 14 million active users.  Growing presence in Africa  Interest in the digital currency is building in South Africa and the continent as a whole.  Two weeks ago ZAbitcoinATM announced a forthcoming Lamassu bitcoin ATM in Johannesburg, the first ever in Africa. Another in Cape Town is on the horizon.  Broadening the ATM presence is a step to getting non-experts acquainted with the digital currency. Many regions of Africa are unbanked, and thereby without access to payments services like Visa or PayPal. Now, however, services allowing consumers to pay bitcoin for everything from basic utilities to taxes have taken off worldwide.

42425721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfj5h,1401802635,Netherlands Issues Bitcoin Warning to Financial Institutions,"The Dutch central bank (DNB) has issued a warning on bitcoin aimed at banks and other financial institutions in the country.  Unlike most warnings issued by regulators and central banks across the globe, the Dutch warning does not address end-users of digital currency. Instead, the central bank clearly states that banks and payment institutions should be aware of integrity risks derived from processing transactions related to digital currencies.  Anonymity bad for business?  The warning (dated 5th June 2014) points out that digital currencies offer a high degree of anonymity so financial institutions should tread carefully, as digital currencies are classified as financial products “with a very high risk profile”.  The bank notes that digital currency transactions seem very transparent at first glance, due to the use of a public ledger. However, the bank warns:  “Transactions are hardly reducible to physical persons. Because virtual currencies may additionally be used as means of payment they are attractive as a link in a money laundering process.”  The relatively high degree of anonymity carries implications for banks and payment institutions open to digital currencies. Because they are anonymous, there is no direct link between the parties trading digital currencies or making purchases in said currencies.  Involvement is risky  The central bank warns that the act of accepting business from a bitcoin operator could have an indirect effect on the reputation of a bank or payments service.  It expressed doubts over the ability of financial institutions to keep track of questionable transactions carried out using digital currencies before they process them, outlining the risk:  “DNB banks and payment institutions that do decide to get involved with virtual currency companies or invest themselves into virtual currency in any way involved (require) rigorous tests to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.”  Still open to bitcoin  The bank also announced that it will determine whether banks and payment institutions involved in the digital currency space can assess these risks.  There is no specific date for the control measures, but the bank says it will begin rolling them out this year in an effort to improve customer experience and monitor “new and innovative” companies.  For the time being, Holland is one of the more liberal countries in Europe when it comes to bitcoin. It has attracted a number of bitcoin startups and some established companies are getting involved, including local payments processors.  In turn, bitcoin businesses are booming in the country despite the fact that the central bank still insists digital currencies are not a viable alternative to fiat currency.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/03/netherlands-issues-bitcoin-warning-to-financial-institutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bbce1a3cb717bc5bb3d62a839a9f9d4d8eb248f-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLiM,1401796995,Poland Gets First Bitcoin ATM with 30 More Planned,"Poland's digital currency scene continues its rapid expansion with the country's first bitcoin ATM freshly launched in the capital Warsaw and many more soon to follow, according to the operators.  Located at Bitcoin Embassy Warsaw, which opened this May, the new machine is manufactured by Lamassu and works in partnership with bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  The Bitcoin Embassy was set up to act as a hub for the Warsaw’s rapidly expanding bitcoin scene, Piotr Hetzig, the company's chief executive, told CoinDesk. Launching the bitcoin ATM in the heart of Warsaw was aimed to boost the visibility of the cryptocurrency in Poland, he explained.  However, the company’s plans go even further than that. A second ATM is to be made available shortly in the Polish capital, with a network of bitcoin vending machines eventually to be rolled out across the country.  ""By the end of this year, as many as 30 bitcoin ATMs enabling [people] to purchase and sell bitcoins are expected to appear in various parts of Poland,"" the operator said.  Bitcoin Embassy Warsaw aims to offer a wide range of services tailored for bitcoin enthusiasts, as well as for those who want to make their first step in the world of digital currencies, according to Hetzig.  These will include training sessions, consultancy services, meetings and events, as well as sales of hardware for bitcoin mining. Initiatives to raise public awareness of the cryptocurrency are also planned.  The new Lamassu ATM is now open for business and can be found at Bitcoin Embassy Warsaw on 46 Krucza street. Opening hours are currently Monday to Friday, 10am to 6pm, but may become available 24/7 in the near future.  Denmark gets its first bitcoin ATM  Meanwhile, the first publicly available bitcoin ATM in Denmark has been launched at Irish pub The Dubliner, located on Copenhagen's famous 'walking street'. Also a Lamassu machine, the ATM accepts Danish krone and is operated by local bitcoin broker Sirius Money.  Thorkil Værge, founder and chief executive of the company, said ""Denmark is one the countries where bitcoin is the least regulated. The financial authorities have stated that [anti-money laundering and know your customer] laws do not apply to bitcoin, and that bitcoin is [...] considered a private non-taxable asset”.  As a result, ""earnings on bitcoins bought in Denmark are not taxed. On the flip side, losses are not tax deductible”, he explained, adding:  ""The Dubliner is an excellent place to [site] a bitcoin ATM, since they have a lot of customers and long opening hours. The pub is also located very centrally near the Stork Fountain, which is the center of Copenhagen's shopping district.""  Værge further indicated that the company is in the process of opening a subsidiary in the Spanish market, to be called Sirius Iberia.  Bitcoin centre and ATM launch in Prague  In another example of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity in Central Europe, a bitcoin centre launched in Prague, Czech Republic, on 28th May  The centre, which has already launched a two-way Robocoin ATM for its customers, was opened in the Czech capital’s Smíchov district, according to The Prague Post.  The establishment is operated by local bitcoin business wBTCb.cz, and was set up to provide face-to-face services for those unfamiliar with digital currencies, as well as consulting services to registered clients.  The firm says it wants to become one of the main traders in the country’s digital currency market, with workshops and seminars designed to increase bitcoin’s visibility in the Czech Republic.  Martin Stránský, the company’s owner, ordered three bitcoin ATMs from US manufacturer Robocoin Technologies in December 2013 under a contract worth some 1,500,000 CZK ($74,200).  The centre is located on the corner of Arbesovo náměstí and Elišky Peškové street, with the Robocoin ATM available from Monday to Friday, 10am to 7pm, with a single transaction limit set at 25,000 CZK ($1,200).",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/03/poland-gets-first-bitcoin-atm-with-30-more-planned,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b901921fb5f19b053e3293d4f817edb04785088-986x713.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425738,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjRh,1401790989,UK Financial Regulator's New Initiative Encourages Bitcoin Innovation,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced a new initiative that could help bitcoin businesses in the UK. The move could mark a shift in approach for the regulator, which has steered clear of digital currency until now.  The FCA’s hands-off approach has not had a negative effect on the UK's bitcoin companies, however. The nation remains one of the most attractive jurisdictions for bitcoin businesses, with the continent's biggest financial hub at its heart.  Project Innovate is launched  The new fast-track initiative, Project Innovate, was announced by FCA Chief Executive Martin Wheatley in London last week.  The authority now says it wants to ensure “positive developments” like bitcoin are supported by the nation's regulatory environment.  Project Innovate is designed to promote innovation in the financial sector and the FCA wants to create room for “the brightest and most innovative” companies to enter the space.  Wheatley reflected on a number of questions relevant to digital currency businesses, namely innovation and novel business models. He also recognised that some developments managed to transform finance in “improbable timescales”. These developments include crowdfunding, digital currencies and peer-to-peer technologies.  COINsult  's regulation, compliance and risk consultant Sian Jones believes the FCA’s initiative could provide digital currency businesses with much-needed regulatory certainty and crystallise the UK’s status as the go-to digital currency jurisdiction.  However, Jones points out that it remains to be seen if and when the FCA plans to announce its official position on digital currencies, or whether or not Project Innovate results in “light touch” regulation or no regulation at all.  “Then, if Britain’s banks would only open their doors to Bitcoin businesses or a Fidor-like challenger bank were to emerge in the UK, that really would be something.”  UKDCA and UK’s stance on bitcoin regulation  Jones is also a founding member of the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA), which launched last March.  The Association has consulted Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on bitcoin-related issues and it has hosted a number of events in an effort to raise awareness and discuss regulatory issues. The UKDCA board includes Bullion Bitcoin owner Adam Cleary, Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson and BankToTheFuture.com co-founder Simon Dixon.  The UK’s position on digital currencies is relatively ambiguous, but this has not stopped multiple bitcoin operators from incorporating in the UK.  Technology lawyer Eitan Jankelewitz has explained how UK regulation applies to digital currencies and what makes the nation so attractive for bitcoin businesses. However, he also concluded that the lack of regulation has caused more problems than opportunities for bitcoin businesses.  In late October the British Government launched a programme to support so-called Challenger Businesses (ie businesses based on new technologies) with vigorous models and innovative products.  Following meetings with members of the FinTech community, the Challenger Business team published a set of conclusions, identifying the same disruptive and innovative trends mentioned by FCA’s Martin Wheatley.  These included peer-to-peer loans, crowdfunding, digital currencies, as well as new payment schemes and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

42425739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjVh,1401775662,Apple’s Virtual Currency Policy Update: Good or Bad for Bitcoin?,"Amid the excitement surrounding Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, there were a few updates made to Apple's App Store Guidelines – some of which concerned the use of 'virtual currencies' in the iOS ecosystem.  While it is intriguing that additional information regarding the use of virtual currencies was added, it doesn't necessarily mean acceptance. In fact, it might actually mean more pronounced and detailed rejection.  Purchasing and currencies  One new addendum commonly being cited is the rule under “purchasing and currencies"", specifically rule 11.17. It states:  ""Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.""  The wording of this means that Apple still has authority to reject bitcoin apps. And bitcoin wallets, by Apple, are generally rejected when they include sending functionality.  The idea of ""approved virtual currencies"" suggests that Apple is keeping tabs on such currencies in order to permit specific use.  Also, the use of the word ""compliance"", and the regulatory situation many bitcoin companies operate in, many of them without regulatory approval, affords Apple additional scrutiny.  Yet some bitcoin companies might dispute this.  Gliph is one such firm, and late last year its messaging app had its bitcoin-sending features abruptly removed. In a blog post regarding the policy updates, Gliph stated:  ""Gliph has been on the front line of getting bitcoin sending into the App Store. Our company maintains that it is acting within existing state and federal regulations around the transmission of bitcoin currency.""  Hope for app developers  The wording of ""virtual currencies"" in Apple's guidelines may send some people's emotions aflutter for bitcoin wallets on iOS.    Super excited to see that Apple is now (apparently) allowing bitcoin wallets in the app store! A small wrong has been righted in the world.      — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 3, 2014    But Apple might just be laying down the law with this statement, rather than loosening up.  ""I think they just put a very specific policy on it. It seems like they updated so that they could be clear to all potential bitcoin companies,"" said Lamar Wilson, who owns iPhone wallet app, Pheeva.    Wilson uses a sign-up process that puts users into a private cooperative, thus enabling him to skirt Apple's rules on actually sending bitcoin funds from within apps.  ""We’d love to launch a full app in the store, at some point. But launching the app would not negate our relationship with the cooperative at all,"" he said.  Blockchain.info, one of the largest wallet providers, had its bitcoin app removed from the App Store earlier this year. Yet the company is hopeful that there will be positive developments related to the policy updates.  Dan Held, Director of Product at Blockchain.info, told CoinDesk:  ""The language used doesn't clearly define what requirements Apple sees as 'approved virtual currencies' or what they may stipulate as fully compliant. We are fully exploring this opportunity and sincerely hope that Apple will be lenient in their interpretation.""  No change?  Gliph, which had bitcoin sending functions on iOS removed at the behest of Apple last year, continues to keep watch over the situation.  Rob Banagale, the company's CEO, makes note of another update to the policy that most people are perhaps overlooking.  Under Use of the In-App Purchase API, in Section 2.2, the Apple policy states that there are restrictions on currencies.  ""You may not enable end-users to purchase Currency of any kind through the In-App Purchase API.""  This policy includes, ""Currency for exchange, gifting, redemption, transfer, trading or use in purchasing or obtaining anything within or outside of Your Application.""  It goes on to add a definition of currency as follows:  “'Currency' means any form of currency, points, credits, resources, content or other items or units recognized by a group of individuals or entities as representing a particular value and that can be transferred or circulated as a medium of exchange.”  It will be interesting to see how this shakes out. Many developers seem optimistic about the clarification, yet, at the same time, those who have to deal with repeated rejections from Apple seem to think little has actually changed.  The company is well-known for believing it can curate an experience that users cannot get anywhere else. But users can get one thing elsewhere – a fully functional bitcoin wallet. And the latest announcement may be, at least, some recognition that there is demand for that.  iPhone maze image via Canadapanda / Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/03/apples-virtual-currency-policy-update-good-or-bad-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c5019cd0d68ac1a28557322d4f339fc418b213a-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
