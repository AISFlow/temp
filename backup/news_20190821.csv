42430885,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOPh,1566417633,New Flexa Tech Will Let You Spend Bitcoin From Other Apps Too,"The merchant payments startup Flexa will soon allow any other app to run payments in crypto just like its own SPEDN app has since May.  Staking with the company's Flexacoin (FXC) will enable apps to trustlessly provide payments to merchants without any danger of malicious apps reversing a transaction after Flexa has transferred funds. The company raised $14.1 million in a private sale of FXC tokens in April.  It's the last piece of the puzzle for Flexa to simplify spending crypto throughout the economy. Now, CEO Tyler Spalding told CoinDesk, Flexa's full business model should be clear to everyone.  ""Here's how this is going to work,"" he said. ""Here's how people can participate. Here's what our token is for. Here's what we believe in.""  With staking enabled, any application will be able to offer payment services – but the most obvious initial use-case will be wallets. So apps that already hold crypto for users will be able to stake FXC and then enable direct-to-merchant payments.  Not only will the apps themselves be able to stake, but their users can contribute to the stakes as well. The advantage of doing so will be that all stakers will share in the fees charged for using Flexa's payment rails.  Said Spalding:  ""Flexa is not going to be another fee-taking entity where all we do is provide the service and extract these fees.""  Instead, it will actually return the fees to all stakers. Users who contribute to an app's stake will receive a cut of the fees proportional to how much of the stake they added.  Flexa created 100 billion FXC at its token-generation event and that supply is permanently fixed. As major holders of the token, it's seeking to increase the value of FXC.  ""We think that good token economics are way better than a business model,"" he said. ""All the value we are providing to the community is in the token.""  What staking does  Staking creates a sort of trustless bandwidth for payments from a given app.  So, for example, if a wallet provider had set up a stake of $1,000 in FXC, then its users would be able to make payments of up to $1,000.  When a payment is made to a merchant using Flexa's system, the merchant needs to get paid right away but it takes time for the blocks to finalize. Flexa makes the payment immediate, which presents an opportunity for a malicious app to reverse a transaction after Flexa had delivered payment.  If it attempted to do so, though, the smart contract would detect that the payment hadn't been delivered and simply take the same amount from its collateral of FXC.  ""Our intent is that it will never ever not process,"" Spalding said, that's because everyone knows they will have something to lose. But it's essential to build-in this disincentive to bad actors.  Flexa's SPEDN app itself will open up a stake at the end of September.  Merchants want privacy  Spalding noted that it's not enough for Flexa to provide functional payment rails: merchants also don't want to reveal details about their businesses to competitors.  Blockchains present a number of small problems along these lines. Flexa is finalizing technology now to move much of this activity off-chain so that payouts can be made in batches.  ""By using a zero-knowledge proof we can ensure that you are getting paid appropriately as a staker, but without knowing how much money is going through the system,"" Spalding said.  While its specific application of zero-knowledge proofs probably won't be ready at launch, it is built into the larger roadmap.  Another piece of the larger roadmap: enlisting more merchants to finalize purchases in crypto rather than fiat.  For now, Flexa delivers final payment to most merchants in fiat, working with exchange partners to provide liquidity to trade tokens used in payment for the final currency. But the Flexa system defaults to paying merchants in the cryptocurrency used by the customer, and it hopes to nudge more to do so.  Spalding said Flexa's initial partners have been large companies (Barnes & Noble, GameStop, Jamba Juice, etc.) that need to take traditional payments, but it's moving into small and medium-sized business relationships now. He said:  ""We have quite a few coming on board soon who actually are going to accept crypto, but they are much smaller.""

According to a statementhttps://www.travelport.com/company/media-center/press-releases/2019-08-20/travelport-ibm-and-bcd-travel-develop-blockchain released on August 20, the blockchain was designed with input from IBM, travel management company BCD Travel, and three unnamed hotel chains. The system aims to “put the lifecycle of a booking on the blockchain,” to reduce the amount of payment disputes.  In 2018, Travelport processed over $83 billion of travel spend over $2.4 billion in net revenue.  “Traveler modifications at property, no shows, and complimentary room nights are just a few examples that drive commission discrepancies which in turn generate escalations, cost, and revenue loss,” said Ross Vinograd, Travelport’s Senior Product Director.  “The traveler can modify their booking multiple times, leaving room for information to go missing. For example, if a traveler arrives and then extends a hotel stay, that information might not make its way back to us as booking data,"" said Marwan Batrouni, Vice President of Global Hotel Strategy, BCD Travel. Additionally, blockchain will help close the ""gaps"" made by different payments systems.  The blockchain will track, manage, and account for commissions owed to booking agents on behalf of hotel chains. Blockchain tech will ensure that payments are more accurate and quicker than the current, manual method.  If successful, this may improve business for travel agents, who currently wait 60 days after their clients check out to earn their commission. Thirty-four percent of travel agents find commission reconciliation and collection difficult, according to Travelport industry surveys, as reported by Ledger Insights.  Still in the proof-of-concept phase, during the coming pilot testing IBM will host the nodes. If the project gets off the ground, hotels will be able to host their own nodes.  In a separate statement anticipating the official announcement, Vinograd said:  “With travelers having endless options for accommodations, a booking alone is not enough to provide a commission to an agency...

OFAC named Xiaobing Yan, Fujing Zheng and Guanghua Zheng as narcotics traffickers under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, freezing any property they own within the U.S. and listing a number of email aliases, citizen numbers and passport information for the three.  The agency also listed  a number of bitcoin addresses, as well as one litecoin address, that the agency claims belong to the Chinese citizens.  According to a press release, Fujing Zheng is a ""significant foreign narcotics trafficker,"" who received support from Guanghua Zheng. Yan has separately been designated ""as a significant narcotics trafficker.""  In addition to naming the three individuals, OFAC listed Qinsheng Pharmaceutical Technology Co. Ltd. and the Zheng Drug Trafficking Organization in Wednesday's update.  OFAC coordinated with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and local law enforcement agencies, said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelkar in a statement.  The group specifically coordinated Wednesday's designations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi, the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) Cleveland and Gulfport offices and DEA’s Special Operations Division, the release stated.  ""The Chinese kingpins that OFAC designated today run an international drug trafficking operation that manufactures and sells lethal narcotics, directly contributing to the crisis of opioid addiction, overdoses, and death in the United States,"" Mandelkar said, adding:  ""[Fujing] Zheng and Yan have shipped hundreds of packages of synthetic opioids to the U.S., targeting customers through online advertising and sales, and using commercial mail carriers to smuggle their drugs into the United States.""  Second action  Wednesday's action marks the second time OFAC has sanctioned digital currency addresses specifically, having last done so in November 2018 when a pair of Iranian nationals were added to the Specially Designated Nationals list.  At the time, Mandelker said the agency was ""publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space.""  Individuals who violate the Kingpin Act might face civil penalties of a $1.1 million fine per violation, in addition to possible criminal penalties of a $5 million fine and up to 30 years in prison.  Drew Hinkes, general counsel at Athena Blockchain and an attorney with Carlton Fields, told CoinDesk that any property or interests in property that the three have in the U.S. must now be blocked and reported to OFAC.  ""U.S. entities need to comply with OFAC requirements and need to shut down any accounts that are listed,"" he said.

42430891,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOZh,1566407102,Tether to Issue Stablecoin Backed by Yuan in Belgian Bank: Insider,"Tether is planning to issue a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese renminbi, according to a trader with ties to the company.  Zhao Dong, an over-the-counter (OTC) trader in China and a shareholder of crypto exchange Bitfinex – which shares managers and owners with Tether – revealed the move on WeChat on Wednesday, saying Tether plans call the stablecoin CNHT.  His peer-to-peer crypto lending business, RenrenBit, will support trading and deposits for CNHT when it is launched, he said.  He added in a later post:  ""Personally, I think the offshore yuan stablecoin could boost the circulation of offshore renminbi and internationalize it. Regulators may be happy to see it proceed and succeed.""  Tether, best known for issuing the U.S. dollar-pegged USDT, did not respond to requests for comment.  Zhao told CoinDesk that he believes the new stablecoin will be ""launched very soon, possibly within weeks."" He said the stablecoin's reserve is expected to be held in a bank in Belgium.  In his view, the token would have two main benefits: it would make Tether less dependent on the U.S. dollar for its stablecoin business while boosting the circulation of renminbi held offshore.  Zhao said he did not know if Tether has buyers lined up for the new stablecoin.  It is unclear which blockchain the CNHT would be built on top of. Tether's USDT has been issued on top of the bitcoin blockchain, as well as the ethereum and tron networks.  Offshoring RMB  The Chinese yuan has traditionally been just a domestic currency, but that changed in 2003 when the People's Bank of China signed agreements allowing banks in Hong Kong to provide offshore renminbi deposit, remittance, exchange and other services, according to the South China Morning Post.  The offshore trading market for renminbi took off. Hong Kong is now one of the largest hubs for offshore renminbi, holding as much as 604 billion yuan ($85 billion) in customer deposits as of June 2019, according to data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  However, China still imposes a cap on an individual citizen's annual foreign exchange volume at $50,000 or an equivalent amount in other foreign currencies.  The news of Tether's plan for CNHT comes while Bitfinex and Tether are under investigation by the New York Attorney General (NYAG) for an alleged cover-up. According to the NYAG's office, Bitfinex borrowed funds from Tether's U.S. dollar reserve to fill a shortfall in funds after losing access to $850 million of its own funds held by a third-party payment processor.  On Monday, the New York Supreme Court denied Bitfinex's and Tether's claim that the NYAG lacks jurisdiction to conduct the investigation, saying the companies must cooperate with the agency.

Group Chairman Chairman Son Tae-seung made the announcement on the 21st at the company's headquarters in central Seoul, some reports said. Further detail appeared in Shin-A Ilbo, CoinDesk Korea, and other publications.  Under the agreement, the two will codevelop relevant services. Few specifics were reported, and group officials were quoted as saying that details are still being worked out, but Woori Card payment and settlement were mentioned in some of the stories. Woori Card is a credit card subsidiary of the group.  The group did say that the agreement does not involve the use of cryptocurrencies.  Ground X, which was formed in 2018, is a subsidiary of Kakao, a messaging-to-mobility tech company and Korea's 36th largest conglomerate. Ground X and the parent company, which has $8.8 billion in assets, earlier this month quietly introduced Klip, a crypto wallet that will utilize Klaytn, Ground X's public blockchain.  Ground X is becoming increasingly popular with major companies in South Korea as they rush to build out their blockchain offerings and race to lead in the technology. It has been used by the SK Group, the third largest chaebol, in developing a blockchain-based donation platform, while Terra is using Klaytn in the development of its payment platform. Just last week, Ground X teamed up with Shinhan Bank and Hexlant to develop a private key management system for the financial group.  Woori has been reasonably busy in terms of blockchain-related development. Last month, it was announced that Woori along with KEB Hana Bank, the country's three telephone companies, Samsung Electronics and Koscom, would be jointly developing a blockchain platform for personal identification. In early 2018, Woori Bank tested Ripple for overseas remittances.  But compared to Shinhan, which has been pursing blockchain initiatives from gold bar verification to securities lending, Woori has been much less active.

42430886,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyONh,1566403210,Crypto Asset NYM to Fuel Test of Tokenized Facebook Login Alternative,"Privacy-focused Nym Technologies unveiled new code this week for its decentralized identity system. It's slated for testnet launch this fall.  On Tuesday at the Web3 Summit in Berlin, Nym CEO Harry Halpin said the technology represents ""the next generation of privacy infrastructure"" not just for blockchains but for the entire web. Indeed, one of the key features of the Nym network, according to Halpin, is that it is blockchain-agnostic.  “We’re open-sourcing our implementation, which has [built-in] communication with the ethereum blockchain,” said Halpin. “We’re allowing the value of particular tokens from the ethereum blockchain to be transformed into Nym credentials.”  If successful, the move could bring Nym's data-masking features to privacy-minded users of virtually any blockchain platform in the world.  In doing so, Halpin believes Nym can rival Facebook, and its single login application, Facebook Connect, to place user data privacy back into the hands of users.  “The briefest way to describe what Nym does with Coconut-enabled credentialing is it allows there to be a decentralized, privacy-preserving version of Facebook Connect,” said Halpin.  Coconut-coded  Outside of Nym’s interoperability with the ethereum blockchain, Halpin noted the code, written in the programming language Go, leverages a novel cryptographic signature scheme called Coconut.  “The novel thing about Coconut is that it provides privacy and decentralization that no other signature scheme provided thus far,” said Nym's lead developer, Jedrzej Stuczynski, adding:  “You can transform your [identity] credentials into something that is valid and perfectly able to use but in no way linkable back to what you already have.”  Coconut, according to Halpin, was originally developed by blockchain startup Chainspace before it was acquired in February by Facebook. Former employees of Chainspace who left before the Facebook acquisition – such as Chainspace co-founder Dave Hrycyszyn – have now joined Nym to help build its identity platform.  In addition, former investors in Chainspace such as Lemniscap and KR1 contributed to Nym’s private token sale in May, which raised $2.5 million.  “[Nym] ended up in the center of our venn diagram in terms of what technology we wanted to support,” said KR1 CEO George McDonaugh, adding:  “There are lots of projects talking about privacy but ignoring the elephant in the room, which is the network layer. You can build privacy applications but unless they're built on a private network, you’re only going halfway. What Harry [Halpin] and his team are doing is ... using blockchains to incentivize and create network-level privacy.”  Nym Technologies CEO Harry Halpin speaks at Web3 Summit 2019 (photo by Christine Kim for CoinDesk)  Correction: Nym CEO Harry Halpin clarified lead developer Jedrzej Stuczynski studied under Chainspace co-founder George Danezis, but did not work for Chainspace directly.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/21/crypto-asset-nym-to-fuel-test-of-tokenized-facebook-login-alternative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02d7aaab1ef259e773cd2807a04b2b6c8bb6ffd9-1500x1025.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOhh,1566402030,Ether's Bull Run from December Lows Appears to Have Ended,"Ethereum’s cryptocurrency, ether, is losing altitude, with signs suggesting the asset has ended a bull market from December lows with a drop below $200 last week.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $183 on Bitfinex, representing a 7.3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Prices fell 10.18 percent last week and closed (Sunday, UTC) at $194, the first under-$200 weekly close since mid-May.  More importantly, with the weekly close at $194, ether violated the uptrend from December lows as represented by the trendlines connecting December and February lows and December and May highs.  Essentially, the eight-month rising channel has been breached to the downside, a sign of bullish-to-bearish trend change, as per technical analysis theory.  So, the cryptocurrency could remain under pressure in the near-term, more so, as bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, is looking south.  Weekly chart  Ether bottomed out at $83.00 in mid-December, as the bitcoin bear market ran out of steam near $3,100.  The cryptocurrency then charted its first bullish higher low at $102.50 in the first week of February, before breaking into a bull market with a move above $167 in the first week of April.  Notably, prices rose by almost 57 percent in May – the biggest monthly rise since April 2018 – extended gains to hit a ten-month high of $363 at the end of June.  The cryptocurrency pulled back in July, but the correction did not damage the bullish structure.  However, the latest dip below $200 has violated the bullish higher lows and higher highs setup represented by the rising channel from December lows. Further, ETH made a failed attempt to retake the rising channel earlier this week, reinforcing the channel breakdown.  The downward sloping 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) also indicate a bearish setup.  Meanwhile, the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) has dropped into the bearish territory below 50 and the moving average convergence divergence has crossed below zero for the first time since December, confirming a bearish reversal.  So, support levels lined up at $170 and $150 could come into play in the near term.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Announced Wednesday, the registration means Securitize can now act as the official keeper of records about changes of ownership in securities. While that might sound redundant given that blockchains are supposed to track asset transfers, the San Francisco-based startup says it's expedient.  ""We can increase the amount of securities issued on the blockchain and give comfort to people that this is a regulated space,"" said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize. ""The SEC has also started approving other types of exempted securities like Reg A+ and down the road those people will need transfer agents.""  As a further enticement, the company is offering to record transfers for free, which would normally cost around $150 per transfer for regular, SEC-registered securities, Domingo said. Securitize will still charge for the management of securities and corporate actions, such as dividend and interest payments, shareholder votes and redemptions and share buybacks.  While SEC approval after its official submission took only 10 days, Securitize worked for around six months to make sure the regulator understood how the company's smart contracts would keep a record of transfers, Domingo said.  Securitize claims to be the first SEC-registered transfer agent with a working blockchain protocol, active securities issuers and integrations that allow digital securities enabled by its protocol to be traded on SEC-registered alternative trading systems (ATSs), including OpenFinance Network, tZERO and Sharespost.  $200 million issued  Recently, Securitize announced its eleventh issued and outstanding digital security running on the platform under its protocol. The total value of those securities is nearly $200 million, and five of them are traded on a regulated, SEC-registered ATS.  In two funding rounds, the company has raised $15 million. It has 43 customers, 11 of which have issued securities on the public ethereum blockchain. Securitize has also integrated with tezos but has no customers using that chain yet.  Securitize also bills itself as a one-stop shop for token services with its Securitize Ready Program, an advisory network that launched in April and includes Coinbase Custody and OpenFinance to assist in issuance, management, and compliance.  In May, Securitize open-sourced the code behind its in-house protocol.

42430881,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOFh,1566389556,CommBank Develops Blockchain Market to Boost Biodiversity,"Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) has co-developed a blockchain marketplace that it says could support sustainable development and reward landowners for protecting the environment.  Created in partnership with BioDiversity Solutions Australia (BDS), the prototype platform uses digital tokens, dubbed BioTokens, to facilitate trading of biodiversity credits for the New South Wales Government’s Biodiversity Offsets Scheme.  The scheme requires developers to obtain the credits to offset the impact of development. Biodiversity credits can be generated by landholders that set up biodiversity-protection schemes on their land on their land ""in perpetuity,"" according to an announcement from CommBank on Wednesday.  As such, there's a need for a transparent market for the trading of the biodiversity credits between these parties, while others – such as environmental groups or government agencies – could purchase the credits as an investment, the bank says.  BioTokens can be programmed with complex rules to automate compliance and administration, according to Sophie Gilder, CommBank’s head of experimentation and commercialisation for blockchain, AI and emerging technology. Trades on the marketplace are also ""transparent and real time,"" she said.  Rod Barnaby, managing director at BioDiversity Solutions Australia, explained:  “Developing a digital marketplace is part of a broader project we have been working on to help stakeholders participate in the NSW Biodiversity Offset Scheme. Our vision was to help facilitate the protection of precious environmental ecosytems, while also creating an alternative source of income for landowners and rewarding them for preserving biodiversity on their land.""  So far, no ""transparent"" marketplace exists to allow developers and landholders to trade biodiversity credits, according to the announcement.  Barnaby indicated that BDS and CommBank are now seeking partners to take the platform toward a commercial launch, as well as examining other use cases for the tokenized asset technology.  “Our vision is that by digitising biodiversity credits and building a marketplace where they can be bought and sold, we can invest in and protect our natural environments,” Gilder said.

Professional services firm Grant Thornton New Zealand was assigned to oversee the liquidation process in May, after the exchange had failed to recover from a major hack in mid-January.  In its latest update on Wednesday, Grant Thornton provided some good news, saying that it had managed to retrieve Cryptopia data that was stored in a third-party data center in Arizona. The liquidator previously filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in order to protect that data, as the Arizona firm was in dispute with Cryptopia and was seeking $2 million in compensation.  Grant Thornton also provided an insight into the way the exchange had been managed, listing two primary reasons it has taken so long to find out which and what amount of cryptocurrency customers held with Cryptopia.  Firstly, the firm says, customers were not assigned individual wallets. Instead, ""the crypto-assets themselves were pooled (co-mingled) in coin wallets. As a centralised exchange, users' trades would occur in the exchange's internal ledger without confirmation on the blockchain.""  As such, Grant Thornton says it's not possible to determine individual ownership using the keys in users' wallets. Cryptopia did keep records of customer holdings and ""reported these on the exchange,"" however.  The second reason for the delay is that Cryptopia never reconciled its customer databases with the cryptocurrencies actually held in its wallets, according to the liquidator. As such it must undertake the mammoth task of manually comparing the database with the wallets to ascertain customers' holdings.  Grant Thornton said:  ""We are hopeful this process will show us the holdings of individual account holders. This process is well underway but will still take some time to complete. We are working to reconcile the accounts of over 900,000 customers, many holding multiple crypto-assets, millions of transactions and over 400 different crypto-assets. These must be reconciled one-by-one.""  The update added that, as a precaution, Grant Thornton it's continuing to move the remaining crypto assets held by Cryptopia into a secure environment, as it's still not clear how the exchange was hacked.  It's also still working with the New Zealand Police and ""other authorities internationally"" to pinpoint the source of the January hack and retrieve the funds.  The New Zealand Courts must yet direct the return of Cryptopia's crypto assets to its former users, Grant Thornton said.

42430895,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOfh,1566382221,Bitcoin Miners Halt Operations as Rainstorm Triggers Mudslides in China,"A prolonged rainstorm in China's Sichuan province has caused land- and mudslides, forcing some local hydropower plants and bitcoin miners to halt operations.  Heavy rain has been drenching Sichuan's mountainous Aba prefecture since Monday, with landslides now affecting 17 counties in the area, according to local government social media posts on Tuesday.  Among them, the Wenchuan county appears to have suffered the most. A China Daily report further said the mudflows have disrupted local power supply and communications infrastructure, and have also resulted in at least seven deaths.  Some mining facilities in Wenchuan have been destroyed, with bitcoin mining machines now being covered by mud, according to an on-site video clip shared with CoinDesk by one mining farm operator that did not want to be named. Mining pool Poolin also posted similar clips on Twitter.    2/2 clip of personnel digging out miners from the mud: pic.twitter.com/QebXEqBjrN        — Poolin (@officialpoolin) August 21, 2019      The mining operator added that the rainstorm has led to excessive levels of water in reservoirs used by local hydropower plants, forcing many stations in Aba to stop generating electricity and creating a power shortage that may affect mining farms in the short term.  For instance, Sichuan Minjiang, a hydro-energy company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said in a statement on Wednesday that three of its power plants in the area have already halted operations, while another one is flooded with water.  It's not clear at this stage how many bitcoin miners in total may have been affected as they are widely scattered. Wenchuan county, with a size of about 2,000 square miles, is one small part of the prefecture.  Based on data from mining pool btc.com, bitcoin's 24-hour average hash rate has dropped from around 78 exahash per second on Monday and Tuesday to about 73 exahash on Wednesday, while its three-day and seven-day averages have both remained steady around 74 exahash since Monday.  The cheap hydroelectricity resulted from the summer rainy season in Sichuan has been attracting bitcoin miners, which recently pushed bitcoin's total hashing power to a new high, although excessive rainfall now appears to be also an operational risk.  Mining farms are mostly located across a vast area made up by the prefectures of Aba (32,000 square miles), Garze (57,000 square miles) and Liangshang (23,000 square miles).  It's not yet clear at the moment when the situation and power supply will return to a normal level as local weather forecast indicates the rainfall is likely to continue in Wenchuan in the coming days.  Bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure on how hard it is to compete for mining rewards – is currently at about 10 trillion. The estimated percentage increase at the next adjustment cycle has dropped slightly from about three percent on Tuesday to now about 1.5 percent.  Bitcoin mining difficulty is designed to adjust every 2016 blocks, approximately 14 days, based on the participating mining power during each cycle. It remains to be seen how it will change at the next cycle, which is due in about 11 days.

42430898,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOjh,1566379812,Bitcoin Risks Slide to $9.5K After Sudden $700 Price Drop,"View  Bitcoin quickly fell from $10,842 to $10,082 earlier today, confirming a rising wedge breakdown on the hourly chart. The bearish reversal pattern has opened the doors for a retest of $9,467 (Aug. 15 low).  On the way lower, prices may find support at the 100-day moving average, currently at $9,882. The average served as strong support earlier this month.  The bearish case would be invalidated if prices rise above $11,000 with high volumes in the next 24 hours. As of writing, that looks unlikely.  A convincing move above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish setup, as per the weekly chart.  Bitcoin (BTC) risks falling back to recent lows below $9,500, having strengthened the short-term bearish case with a $700 drop earlier today.  The top cryptocurrency fell from $10,843 to $10,082 in the eight hours to 07:00 UTC, confirming an end of the bounce from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467.  Prices slipped into four digits on Aug. 13 and extended gains to levels above $10,900 on Monday. That was bitcoin's fourth quick recovery from sub-$10,000 levels since the beginning of July.  As a result, some observers are convinced that a new base has been established under $10,000 and the cryptocurrency could soon resume the rally from April's low near $4,050.  While that seems logical, the latest bounce from $9,467 lacked volume support, as discussed yesterday, and was expected to be short-lived.  Hence, the price drop seen today is not surprising and could be extended further, as it marks a downside break of a rising wedge pattern, a bearish reversal setup, created by the recent price rise from $9,467 to $10,956.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,132 on Bitstamp, representing a 5.46 percent loss on the day.  4-hour chart  The rising wedge breakdown seen on the 4-hour chart indicates the bounce from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467 topped out at $10,956 on Monday and the sellers have regained control.  It's worth noting that, as per technical theory, the price seen at the beginning of a rising wedge formation becomes the minimum downside target once a breakdown is confirmed. So, a drop to $9,467 could be seen over the next couple of days.  Supporting the bearish case are a below-50 reading on the relative strength index and a bearish reversal on the the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram.  The outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $11,000 in the next 24 hours, although as of writing, that looks unlikely.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the RSI remains in the bearish territory below 50.00. The MACD is also holding bearish below zero.  Bitcoin has also found acceptance below the 5-, 10- and 50-day moving averages.  So, a drop to the 100-day MA at $9,882 could be seen – a level that served as strong support on Aug. 15 and Aug. 16.  A UTC close below the 100-day MA, if confirmed, would bolster the bearish setup.  Weekly chart  BTC's rejection near $11,000 and the subsequent drop to $10,100 has reinforced a bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-week moving averages, currently located at $10,506 and $10,638, respectively.  The MACD histogram continues to produce lower highs and is currently reporting the weakest bullish momentum in six months.  With the path of least resistance to the downside, support at $9,049 (May low) stands exposed.  On the higher side, a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish setup.

A document seen by Bloomberg indicates that the European Commission is ""currently investigating potential anti-competitive behavior"" by the Libra Association. The report describes the document as a questionnaire suggesting the commission is concerned that Facebook's planned digital payment system could unfairly lock out competitors.  The governance structure and membership of the Libra Association is apparently under scrutiny. A number of major companies including Mastercard and Visa have already signed loose agreements to partner with the Libra Association on the project.  The European Commission is also concerned that Libra could give rise to ""possible competition restrictions"" on the use of information including user data. It's also looking at the possible integration of apps into Facebook services such as WhatsApp and Messenger that use Libra.  This type of questionnaire is generally issued early on EU information-gathering inquiries, says Bloomberg..  The European Commission is the executive arm of the EU, which proposes and enforces legislation, and implements policies and the budget. Bloomberg said the commission and Facebook both would not comment on the document.  Facebook has faced a wave of concern from the world's regulators over its digital currency plans. Lawmakers in the U.S. have even called for the project to be stopped until the issues can be examined and discussed.  A delegation of U.S. lawmakers led by Congresswoman Maxine Waters is set to discuss Libra with the Swiss data privacy chief when it visits the country this week.  With the Libra Association incorporated in Switzerland, Facebook has said it expects the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner to be its data privacy regulator. However, the commissioner, Adrian Lobsiger, has previously said Facebook has not in fact been in touch about the project and has called for more information.  As per a Reuters report on Wednesday, Lobsiger's office said yesterday it expects to be provided specific details on Libra by the end of this month.

42430897,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyOdh,1566360058,Vitalik Buterin: Increasing Transaction Costs Risk Limiting Ethereum Adoption,"The increased cost of transacting on the ethereum blockchain is hurting the software's adoption, says project creator Vitalik Buterin.  Speaking with the Toronto Star this week, Butertin suggested projects that are considering whether to build on the technology will likely be butted out as the blockchain is overloaded with transactions, or in his words ""almost full."" (While a blockchain cannot ever be technically 'full,' Buterin's comments indicate his current sentiment on the severity of the problem.)  Still, Buterin's comments speak to his understanding of the difficulties ahead for the project, with major planned upgrades including Ethereum 2.0 and a switch to proof-of-stake consensus ahead.  He told the newspaper:  ""If you’re a bigger organization, the calculus is that if we join, it will not only be more full but we will be competing with everyone for transaction space. It’s already expensive and it will be even five times more expensive because of us. There is pressure keeping people from joining, but improvements in scalability can do a lot in improving that.""  Ethereum's seven-day transaction fee average, a measure of demand on the network, actually sits at a 50-day low, falling since July 1 to sit around $0.11 ether per transaction currently.  Ethereum's seven day mean transaction fee image via Coinmetrics  Buterin, following past arguments and his current work, presented PoS as a potential solution to the problem, stating that altering transaction verification could lower fees by a factor of 100 per transaction, freeing space for organizations to build on the blockchain.  More broadly, the comments show how public adoption of ethereum is a growing concern.  Earlier this month, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) appointed the Ethereum Foundation's Aya Miyaguchi head of its Mainnet Initiative, a working group to connect enterprises with ethereum's services.  Discussing governance and adoption, Buterin said price volatility and cybersecurity remain leading issues as well. He concluded that the government has a role in regulating the space:  ""Governments do have a role and one of the roles in regulation. The usual concerns are about cryptocurrency exchanges where the basic idea is to do fundraising for a new project by directly selling tokens on the blockchains. There are debates whether specific kinds of ICOs [initial coin offerings] are legally categorized as securities.""  Buterin pointed toward low-risk uses of blockchain, such as identification of certifications, as adoption-leading technology.

The crypto exchange announced support for two autonomous loan making vehicles, the infamous MakerDao and a similarly open-sourced Compound protocol, according to an August 19 statement.  Both ethereum-based protocols serve as “market-makers” by allowing borrowers to take out liquid loans against a pool of assets.  ""Decentralized, transparent applications are the future of finance, and will lead to a wealthier, more connected world. But so far, DApps have been difficult to access and use. Huobi Wallet is making decentralized finance more accessible — which has the potential to change society,"" said Robert Leshner, Founder and CEO of Compound.  Huobi will enable access to Maker’s autonomous, collateralized loan service through integrating the protocol's CPD Portal, as well as Compound’s lending service.  ""We think blockchain technology has great potential not just for cryptocurrency but also in providing better overall financial services and products to the public,"" said Livio Weng, CEO of Huobi Global.  The move will ensure that MakerDao’s stablecoin, DAI, as well as its MKR governance token receive wallet support. This is true for Compound’s cTokens, as well.
