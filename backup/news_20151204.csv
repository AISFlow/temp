42378434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCcd,1449273566,Blockchain Startup Joins Allianz Backed FinTech Accelerator,"Blockchain startup Everledger has joined a startup accelerator owned by insurance and financial services company Allianz France.  Announced on 3rd December, the class of six startups will move to workspace located at the Allianz Riviera stadium in Nice, France. Participants in the acceleratorhttps://www.allianz.fr/accelerateur/en/index.html will have access to the firm’s network of advisors and investors, with Bpifrance and Idinvest Partners cited specifically. According to the program's website, the program will last for five months.  London-based Everledger uses a blockchain implementation as a diamond verification registry, which, as described by CEO Leanne Kemp in an August interview with CoinDesk, is akin to ""putting bling on the blockchain"".  Other startups involved in the class include Dreamquark, Finsquare, Qualisteo, Wever and Wicross. Allianz said that the selection process began in October and drew applications from more than 100 startups.  Everledger joins the Allianz accelerator months after a three-month stint with the Barclays Accelerator in London. That session was completed in June.  The addition of a new batch of startups to its financial tech accelerator comes amid a time of change for the Munich-based company.  Allianz Group, of which Allianz France is a subsidiary, recently announced a plan to shake up its business in a bid to boost productivity, according to Reuters. Allianz, which reported €122bn in 2014 revenue, is seeking to shave productivity costs by as much as €1bn euros over the next three years.  Everledger did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for Allianz was not immediately available when reached.

Roger Thomas Clark was charged with conspiracy to traffic narcotics and conspiracy to launder money. He was arrested in Thailand on 3rd December, according to US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which characterized Clark as a ""senior advisor"" to the site who operated under the alias ""Variety Jones"", among others.  The charges were originally filed under seal on 21st April, according to the filing. The government alleged that Clark provided material support to Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht and the site, assistance that including hiring programmers, promoting sales and offering operational advice. The Silk Road was taken offline in October 2013.  Clark has been tied to the aliases Variety Jones and ""Cimon"", both of which are included in the unsealed indictment along with ""VJ"" and ""Plural of Mongoose"". WIRED's Andy Greenberg wrote earlier this year that Variety Jones was deeply involved in the management of the site and acted as a sort of mentor to Ulbricht on various matters, based on evidence gleaned by journals kept by the dark market operator.  The arrest and unsealing of charges comes months after Variety Jones, whose identity was linked to the names Roger or Thomas Clark during an investigation by Motherboard, alleged that a rogue federal agent was seeking to blackmail Ulbricht. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year.  Reports  of Clark's arrest surfaced earlier today, when the website for the alternative cryptocurrency Rimbit posted screenshots of an extradition request said to be sourced from Clark's legal representation. The letter was addressed to Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the local US Embassy.  In a press release, the US Attorney's Office said that Clark's extradition is pending.  The full unsealed complaint can be found below:    US v.

42378431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCbN,1449263758,Ponzi Allegations and Patent Applications: Bitcoin Headlines,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of industry media coverage and its impact.  This week's coverage is a testament of just how varied things in the bitcoin space can really get.  On the one hand, many mainstream media sources ran stories on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's indictment of the now-defunct cryptocurrency mining firm GAW Miners for alleged securities fraud.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs – which participated in Circle's $50m funding round earlier this year – made headlines after a patent application for its own cryptocurrency came to light.  SEC action  As reported by CoinDesk  , the SEC charged GAW Miners, ZenMiner and CEO Josh Garza with the fraudulent sale of unlicensed securities and the operation of a Ponzi scheme. The indictment comes months after the collapse of the firm, which floundered under growing scrutiny of its mining operations and the launch of its own cryptocurrency, paycoin.  The news of the SEC action spread quickly in the mainstream media, including Reuters, Fox Business and the BBC.  Writing for Ars Technica, Cyrus Farivar wrote a piece entitled 'Over 10,000 People Were Duped By Bitcoin Mining Startup, Feds Say'.  ""The implosion of GAW Miners marks yet another example of incompetence and possible criminal behaviour associated with companies selling bitcoin mining hardware. Previously, CoinTerra, Butterfly Labs, and HashFat also faced similar legal battles,"" he noted.  In early 2014, the journalist continued, GAW Miners was first introduced to the bitcoin community by reselling mining rigs sourced from outside the United States. The company then pivoted to hardware hosting, cloud-based mining and, later, the launch of paycoin.  The journalist added:  ""For over a year now, there has been active speculation among the Bitcoin community that GAW may be a scam or at least that it could be engaged in illegal behaviour.""  The BBC also ran a piece about the allegations facing Garza. It said:  ""Bitcoins are ""mined"" when computers solve equations that verify user transactions made with the currency. But it is claimed that Hashlets did not have enough processing power to carry out the number of verifications required to properly reward investors.""  The outlet then went on to state that fraud in the bitcoin world was on the rise, citing a lawyer from London-based Selachii, a law firm that works on digital currency issues.      ""There are several high-profile bitcoin exchanges I am aware of which appear to be Ponzi schemes,"" attorney Richard Howlett told the BBC. ""On occasion, a rogue exchange might shut down overnight and claim it was hacked,"" he added.  Howlett went to claim that more than 1,000 people affected by both rogue exchanges and mining companies have submitted complaints.  ""Until the industry is regulated, this pattern will continue to increase,"" he said.          Goldman's coin  Although it is not the first bank to have applied for a patent in the crypto space, Goldman Sachs' patent application for a securities settlement system based SETLcoin, a new cryptocurrency, also made headlines this week.  Dated 19th November, the application submitted to the US Patent & Trademark Office application, outlines a ""Cryptographic Currency For Securities Settlement"" that would enable peer-to-peer participants to exchange cryptographic tokes representing securities, with near-instant settlement.  The Financial Times covered the submission, saying:  ""Goldman Sachs has made a patent application for a cryptocurrency settlement system in a move that underlines bank hopes that the architecture behind bitcoin can revolutionise global payments.""  Quartz ran a piece titled 'Goldman Sachs Wants to Create Its Own Version of Bitcoin', which noted the lack of speed in the current settlement process, whilst addressing financial institution's increasing fascination with blockchain technology.  It added:  ""While SETLCoin is a virtual currency, it isn't bitcoin, which adds to the growing evidence that financial institutions are less interested in bitcoin itself and more intersted in the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain.""

42378419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCRJ,1449254776,Deutsche Bank: Blockchain Tech Will Go Mainstream in Next Decade,"Deutsche Bank believes that blockchain technology will become more widespread over the course of the next ten years.  The comments come after the German banking giant carried out a blockchain-based experiment that focused on programmable bonds.  While declining to disclose the two providers that worked with the bank during the experiment, Deutsche Bank told CoinDesk in an email:  ""The test [a proof-of-value] is successfully completed. The corporate bond was ideal to test blockchain on the lifecycle of an asset (issuance, coupon payments, redemption), hence why we chose it; at this stage, we will not pursue the smart bond route as a first commercial product of the Bank.""  ""We do not say what we are looking into now,"" spokesperson Nicolas Nonnenmacher added.  According to the bank, the test resulted both compelling answers as well as fresh questions that will inform future explorations of the technology.  Deutsche Bank's recent test focused on programmable bonds because the institution wanted to explore ""the smart contract front to back lifecycle concept"", the spokesperson said. This process involved running simultaneous investigations on different kinds of blockchain-based rails.  Nonnenmacher explained:  ""The result was that the blockchain technology achieved all that we set out to test in at the PoV [proof-of-value] scale, however, this would need to be taken further in respect to sufficiently testing scalable or stability on these use cases.""  Deutsche Bank began to research blockchain applications last year, it said, later becoming part of a consortium of banks that are collectively looking at the technology. One of the key results of this process, the bank told CoinDesk, is that the the technology ""will alter the business model of many financial businesses"" and will likely see many different iterations.  ""There will be many permissioned blockchains ... and it will be important to be able to move between them,"" the bank said.  Deutsche Bank said that it expects to see examples of commercial-scale products involving the blockchain hit the market in the next two years.

42378441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iClR,1449232207,Bitcoin Mining Giant BitFury is Being Sued By its Former CFO,"UPDATE (11th December 4:30 BST): This piece has been updated with a statement from former BitFury CFO Mikhail Golomb.      Bitcoin mining firm BitFury is being sued by its former chief financial officer (CFO), according to court documents obtained by CoinDesk.  First filed in April in the Superior Court of California County of San Francisco, former BitFury CFO Mikhail Golomb is alleging he was terminated improperly by BitFury so that the company could avoid awarding him 2% of the business in equity compensation.  Court documents suggest BitFury is currently valued in excess of $500m, meaning the shares are potentially worth $10m.  Further, Golomb asserts that he was denied bonuses, contractual severance and payment for unused vacation time. The former CFO, who earned $240,000 in the position, is seeking a jury trial to obtain damages of up to $10,000 and attorney’s fees as a result of the alleged breach of contract and violations to California Labor Code.  The filing reads:  ”Throughout his employment with defendants, plaintiff demanded defendants comply with the Employment Contract and make the required grant of equity to the plaintiff. Defendants terminated plaintiff’s employment in retaliation therefore in order to avoid their obligations to plaintiff under the Employment contract.”  During his time, Golomb served on BitFury’s board of directors and was head of its San Francisco office, according to court documents.  BitFury has since moved to demur the lawsuit through a series of filings by its law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP dating back to June.  ""As a company, we intend to fight this case vigorously. We think it without merit,"" BitFury legal counsel Varun Gupta told CoinDesk.  Since June, BitFury has also moved to strike portions of the complaint and push for discovery to be limited due to the fact it could lead to “confidential, proprietary or private information” being disclosed. In addition, it has argued that certain stipulations, such as the disclosure of all company communications with Golomb present an undue burden.  Golomb's statement  In a new statement, Golomb has offered new comments on the lawsuit, maintaining that he was fired under ""false pretenses"".  ""I accepted employment and worked tirelessly to grow the company in part because I believed BitFury's CEO, Valery Vavilov, would live up to his end of the bargain,"" Golomb said. ""Unfortunately, it turns out that my belief was misplaced. Because Valery and BitFury reneged on its promise to give me equity, I was forced to bring a lawsuit to vindicate my rights.""  Golomb further called allegations that he was abusive to colleagues ""outrageous"", contending that he displayed ""flawless conduct"" during his tenure.  ""These allegations amount to nothing more than ill-advised litigation tactics coming from a desperate company,"" he said.  Compounding the situation, Golomb said, is that BitFury has since grown to become a leader in the bitcoin space, a position he argues he helped the company achieve.  Golomb added:  ""When I joined the BitFury in early 2014, it was just another brand new startup in Ukraine and in the crowded bitcoin space that wanted to become an internationally recognized leader.""  The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 9:30am on 30th December.
