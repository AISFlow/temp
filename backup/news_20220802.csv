The altcoin had managed to grow so rapidly that it is now about half the market cap of bitcoin despite being more than 5 years younger. This outperformance had continued through the bull market and now even into the bear market. Ethereum has taken one step further to overtake bitcoin in yet another metric, and that is the amount of open interest in the asset. Open Interest Flips Bitcoin New data from Glassnode has shown an interesting development when it comes to the open interest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Bitcoin had naturally dominated this metric due to not only being the first cryptocurrency in the market but also the digital asset with the most interest from investors, both retail and institutional investors. Ethereum had quickly surpassed bitcoin in this regard as its open interest had surged to $5.6 billion across all Put and Call options, accounting for more than a 47% increase in the last month. ETH&apos;s popularity during this time and price recovery has obviously helped in its domination. Bitcoin, on the other hand, continues to trend around normal levels with $4.3 billion in open interest. This puts Ethereum ahead more than 30.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: The U.S. Federal Reserve is nowhere near finished in its fight against inflation, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan puts a damper on investor sentiment. Suddenly, the market for risky assets from bitcoin to stocks is under pressure again.  Insights: Sam Reynolds takes stock of the once-thriving market for non-fungible tokens, now apparently suffering through its own soft patch.

Bitcoin Trades Lower on Renewed Macro Fears; Ether Gets Little Relief From Merge Optimism  By Helene Braun  U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday reiterated plans to keep ratcheting interest rates higher to tamp down soaring inflation. The comments proved enough to push prices for bitcoin and other risky assets lower.  Bitcoin (BTC) slid below $23,000, dropping for a fifth straight day, diminishing hopes embraced as recently as last week that a fresh rally might be in the offing.  The decline in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mimicked similar movements in global markets.  Speculation was mounting last week that the Fed would ease off its inflation-fighting campaign after a report showing the U.S. economy had contracted for a second straight quarter, viewed by many traders as a sign of a recession (even though that’s not actually the definition).  Also Tuesday, there was further evidence of that weakness: The U.S. Labor Department published its Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), a report closely watched by Fed officials, showing that job openings fell by 605,000 in June, the largest monthly decline since April 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hit businesses.  However, the jobs markets remained strong, and there were still 1.8 jobs for every unemployed person in June, suggesting the labor market is still at full employment – ostensibly giving the Fed the green light for another rate hike in September.  Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve’s San Francisco branch, said Tuesday the U.S. central bank is “nowhere near” finished with its efforts to combat inflation, according to a Bloomberg News report. Just like that, downward pressure was back on prices for risky assets.  Another factor in the bitcoin market was the reported visit by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to Taiwan on Tuesday. Some traders were fearful that the trip by this high-ranking official could ratchet up tensions between China and the U.S. and have negative effects on global markets.  “This is going to bring some some tension in the market but I don't believe that the market itself is gonna react too strong,” Daniel Muvdi, head of markets at Quantfury, said Tuesday on CoinDesk television’s ""First Mover"" program.  Ether (ETH) traded slightly higher during afternoon hours, up 2.19%, but the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin continues to search for direction after the Ethereum “shadow fork” went into effect one week ago.  “The Merge narrative on [Ethereum] has been getting a little cloudier,” said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Trading. “The complications around a proof-of-work fork could create some market dislocations and the geopolitics of Pelosi's Taiwan visit are weighing on price.""

By Sam Reynolds  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) had quite the dreary July as data from crypto aggregators show that most NFT exchanges had a sharp downtrend in active traders and dollar volume.  According to DappRadar, OpenSea lost 35% of its dollar volume and 15% of its traders during the month of July. Overall, the world’s largest NFT exchange by volume posted $517 million in volume during the last 30 days.  Nansen, another digital asset tracking service, reports that overall NFT volume on the month is down 17% to 448,000 ETH (or around $704 million).  Removing wash trading, where a trader buys and sells an asset to feed misleading information to the market (a practice infamous for inflating the NFT market) from the equation – thanks to Nansen’s wash trading filter – and the 30-day volume shoots up over 2.5 times.  “It’s not just the [U.S. dollar] volume traded that has fallen. This is also the case for the number of buyers and sellers as well as the number of sales. These decreases come mainly from collectibles that have lost interest since the beginning of the year except for the 'blue chip' collections,” wrote NonFungible, an NFT analytics firm, in a recent report.  NonFungible believes that there’s a “centralization of the market” taking place around CryptoPunks, Meebits and Bored Ape Yacht Club, all owned by Yuga Labs.  The one exception appears to be Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which issues .eth domains for crypto wallets. As CoinDesk previously reported, there seems to be a mini-boom happening with tens of thousands of ENS registrations per day as opposed to thousands in May and June. Some analysts point to a mini gold rush for .eth domains the way there were for .com domains in the late 1990s and 2000s.  Hard to support a market for $1M JPEGs  Despite claims otherwise from the NFT community, the market is having a tough time supporting valuations that made headlines at the height of the bull market.  When trying to value Three Arrows Capital’s “Starry Night” wallet, which was targeting a $100 million NFT collection, CoinDesk reported there wasn’t a universally accepted way to get a number for its current valuation. Results came back across the spectrum from $19.7 million to $1.6 million. If a portfolio of assets could have such a variance in pricing, or drop so precipitously, is it possible to expect investor interest to be maintained?  Where are GameFi’s wings?  One observation in the NFT market in the last month has been the floundering of art NFTs while high-profile utility NFTs like ENS has found legs.  Surely GameFi NFTs must have momentum?  While Axie Infinity has seen an uptick in volume, per DappRadar’s data, another data point looks to throw some shade on the market.  According to a survey of 2,400 GameFi investors conducted by ChainPlay, there’s still some hesitation in the market; most have lost money.  According to the survey, 89% of crypto investors worldwide saw their GameFi profits decrease in the last six months. Some 62% of respondents lost more than 50% of their profits from GameFi.  More concerning for stakeholders, perhaps, is that ChainPlay’s survey shows 73% of the respondents shy away from GameFi investments because they are afraid of rug pulls and Ponzi schemes.  Stats like these help explain why investor sentiment in NFTs is waning.

He founded the company in 1989 as a software developer, but in recent years began buying billions of dollars of bitcoin with MicroStrategy's money -- much of it borrowed through debt sales. Phong Le, who had been the company's president, is the new CEO, according to a statement Tuesday.  “I believe that splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO will enable us to better pursue our two corporate strategies of acquiring and holding bitcoin and growing our enterprise analytics software business,"" Saylor said in the statement. ""As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations.""  Meanwhile, during the earnings conference call, Le said he doesn't expect any imminent strategy changes for the company and he's been aligned with Saylor on the enterprise and bitcoin strategy throughout their time together. He also applauded CFO Andrew Kang's handling of MicroStrategy's financial division, and said the overall changes will free up time for Le to run the company while Saylor focuses on corporate strategy, innovation and the bitcoin strategy.  ""I would sort of see this as a business as usual transition,"" Le told analysts and investors during the conference call.  Saylor is handing off the CEO job at a time when his bitcoin bets have led to major losses at the company. In its second-quarter results also released Tuesday, MicroStrategy posted an impairment charge of $917.8 million on its bitcoin holdings, reflecting the sharp decline in bitcoin's price in the quarter. The company now owns approximately 130,000 bitcoin worth roughly $3 billion; they were acquired for a total of about $4 billion.  Le has served as MicroStrategy's president since July 2020 and has also served in various other senior executive positions since joining the company in 2015, including chief financial officer and chief operating officer.  MicroStrategy shares fell 1.2% in after-hours trading Tuesday. The stock has lost about half its value this year, roughly mimicking bitcoin's plunge.

Earnings  Second quarter results included transaction-based revenue falling 7% sequentially to $202 million, with a 19% decline in equities revenue and an 11% drop for options. Crypto was a modest bright spot, with revenue up 7% sequentially to $58 million.  Monthly average users (MAU) suffered another sizable drop, to 14 million from 15.9 million in the first quarter. MAUs peaked in the second quarter of 2021 at 21.3 million.  Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $80 million in the second quarter, improving from a loss of $143 million a quarter earlier. ""We continue to challenge ourselves to reach a positive run-rate for Adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2022,"" said the company.  The company expects to occur about $30 million-$40 million in cash restructuring and related charges from employee severance and benefits costs.

42411758,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgsP,1659473805,Trust Wallet vs. MetaMask,"Trust Wallet and MetaMask are digital wallets where you can store, send, receive, exchange and purchase cryptocurrencies. They are both simple and beginner-friendly platforms that traders can use to easily and confidently get into the markets.  Both wallets have mobile apps, and yet they differ in several ways as explained below.  Trust Wallet overview:  Trust Wallet has been the official decentralized wallet of the Binance crypto exchange since it was acquired by Binance in November 2017. Trust Wallet is widely considered to be a user-friendly, secure and easy-to-use wallet. It supports more than 4.5 million different kinds of digital assets on more than 65 blockchains.  Trust Wallet provides many more features than simply storing your digital assets. You can easily access more than 60 blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon and use popular decentralized applications (dapps). Its dapp browser acts as a bridge so that you can get access to popular decentralized platforms such as PancakeSwap and SushiSwap.  You can also buy, swap and stake your crypto within Trust Wallet.  Regarding security, Trust Wallet is a hot wallet, meaning it is directly connected to the internet. Trust Wallet, however, is a non-custodial wallet that gives you complete control of your private keys and your assets on a blockchain.  Read more: Trust Wallet 101: How to Get Started  MetaMask overview:  Like Trust Wallet, MetaMask is compatible with iOS and Android, but unlike Trust Wallet, MetaMask can also be used on your computer, letting users interact with various blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain and the Ethereum network through their desktop browser. Simply put, it's a web browser extension that can connect to dapps such as different decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.  Read more: How to Connect MetaMask to Different Blockchains  By default, MetaMask is designed to access the Ethereum network to connect to platforms such as Uniswap and Compound. It supports ERC-20 token standards so that you can store almost any token on the Ethereum network.  One noteworthy feature of MetaMask is its simple interface for swapping cryptocurrencies. From the web browser extension or app, you can click on the “Swap” button. This enables you to swap a wide range of cryptocurrencies quickly and easily.  With MetaMask, you will enjoy a seamless experience regardless of the platform you are using. The security measures built into the application are equally strong compared with Trust Wallet because it is both non-custodial and a hot wallet.  Which to choose: Trust Wallet or MetaMask  Consider your needs for a crypto wallet in general. Trust Wallet and MetaMask differ in benefits, features and operability. You will need to compare and contrast the two wallets. The list will help you analyze and decide which wallet fits you.  Trust Wallet  This wallet is suitable for you if you need the following functionalities:  You need the flexibility of being able to store more than 4.5 million kinds of digital assets and having access to more than 60 blockchains  You would like the option to purchase cryptocurrency with a credit card.  You would like access to a wide variety of decentralized applications directly through the app itself.  Limitations to consider  There is no desktop or browser extension available.  MetaMask  This wallet is suitable for you if you need the following functionalities:  You’re primarily interested in Ethereum-based dapps and transacting with the Ethereum network.  You need it to be compatible with most browser and mobile devices based on iOS and Android.  Easy connection to the platform and a quick and simple way to send ether to any address within the app in a few seconds.  Limitations to consider  The MetaMask extension works on most, but not all, web browsers. It is compatible with Chrome, Edge, Brave and Firefox.  It doesn't have a dapp menu to browse through.

The first crypto by market cap has been recording its best month in 2022 but is still far from the monthly average return from these tokens. According to Arcane Research, altcoins have seen an average of 40% performance over the past month as the crypto market experienced a &apos;classic relief rally&apos;.

During this period, the nascent asset class has seen the expansion of two critical sectors, decentralized finances (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As seen below, the rally has been particularly positive for mid-cap cryptocurrencies. This market rally has translated into a reduction of Bitcoin and stablecoins market share, suggesting an increase in risk appetite for crypto investors, and more strength for Ethereum. Arcane Research noted: Ether&apos;s lack of strength relative to bitcoin last week has been reversed this week, as ether has increased its market share by 0.43 percentage points, while bitcoin has lost 0.22 percentage points.

42422587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nQFh,1659473348,Ethereum Developers Address Potential Glitch Ahead of the Merge,"During Ethereum’s 92nd Consensus Layer Call, developers discussed some solutions to a potential wrinkle in the smooth execution of the network’s impending Merge, when Ethereum moves from its current proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.  Alex Stokes, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, raised concerns over a possible MEV-Boost failure. The vulnerability could affect the way that relay operators, which are intermediaries between block builders and validators, communicate with each other. As a result, the orderly addition of blocks to the blockchain could be disrupted.  However, Stokes told CoinDesk that this complication should have no effect on the timeline of the Merge.  What is MEV-Boost?  MEV-Boost is an important component of “maximal extractible value” (MEV) for Ethereum. MEV refers to the income that miners (under PoW) and block builders and validators (under PoS) receive as a result of inserting or reordering of transactions within a block.  MEV-Boost, which is designed to avoid MEV centralization, is a middleware component that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders. After the Merge, those interacting with the network will send their transactions over the blockchain to block builders. The MEV-Boost feature will then collect these blocks and offer them to validators. Validators will select and propose the most profitable blocks to the Ethereum network.  If there is a malfunction in MEV-Boost, it will disrupt the entire PoS blockchain. A glitch with a relay operator could fail to release a block at the right moment. Then a series of blocks from validators running MEV-Boost would be missed. That would happen if the validator fails to propose a block because of a relay that didn’t have a way of signaling malicious behavior to validators.  The next set of validators could then be compromised, and if they were to propose a block that has dealt with the malicious relay, the same issues would continue on, preventing the production of blocks indefinitely.  Read more: The Problem With MEV on Ethereum  Options on the table  During the call, one proposal addressed the possibility of introducing a circuit breaker. This could be as simple as writing code that tells the validator to automatically turn off if there are missed blocks. This would be a risky move because validators could deliberately withhold blocks from being proposed. There is incentive to do that, and by duping other validators, the person could monopolize MEV earnings.  Other developers also suggested that a third-party dashboard could watch over the relays. The Flashbots team, the developers behind MEV-Boost, are already working to create some kind of public monitoring system for MEV-activity. Ben Edgington, the lead product owner for Teku at ConsenSys, who is involved in the Merge development, told CoinDesk that there are several options for achieving the right solution for the MEV-Boost issue. “It’s just a question of choosing a good approach,” he said.  Read more: Are Block Builders the Key to Solving Ethereum’s MEV Centralization Woes?  Christine Kim, a research associate at Galaxy Digital who took notes on the meeting, said that “MEV-Boost already does place inherent trust in relay operators. The trust in relay operators for earning MEV has always been known but what wasn’t known before Thursday’s call was the ability of a relay operator to potentially cause network downtime in this process.”  After the call, Stokes told CoinDesk that developers are exploring options that would have users wait for the Merge to be completed before attempting to use the builder, or to introduce some kind of circuit breaker. Stokes said that the chances of an MEV-Boost failure are very low, but he is pushing to get some kind of solution implemented in the event that it does happen.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | RESEARCH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/ethereum-developers-address-potential-glitch-ahead-of-the-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6628b1aeebf9d61a523cd3f2b456c63e809c7535-4096x3072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422573,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nPth,1659473070,MicroStrategy Reports $918M Impairment Charge on Bitcoin Holdings in Q2,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) took a non-cash digital asset impairment charge of $917.8 million on its bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the second quarter, up from $170.1 million in the first quarter and $424.8 million in the second quarter of 2021, according to its latest earnings report.  The business software firm also announced that it had named Phuong Le, the company's president, to replace Michael Saylor as its CEO. Saylor, who had served as MicroStrategy's CEO and chairman of the board since he founded the company in 1989, and took it public in 1998, will continue to serve as chairman of the board and will also take on the new role of executive chairman.  While Tesla (TSLA), another prominent company with bitcoin on its balance sheet, sold roughly 75% of its holdings in the second quarter to raise cash, MicroStrategy has continued to hold on and even add to its position, despite bitcoin’s sharp decline over the last few months. During the period from May 3 to June 28, MicroStrategy bought an additional 480 bitcoins for about $10 million – an average price of $20,817 per coin.  The business software firm secured a $205 million term loan in March from Silvergate to potentially purchase additional bitcoin, but Saylor, a bitcoin maximalist, has noted that the company has thousands of bitcoin it can pledge as additional collateral if needed.  MicroStrategy's CFO Andrew Kang said during the earnings conference call that the company has about 85,000 unpledged bitcoin available, giving the company more than enough collateral to meet ongoing requirements of its Silvergate term loan through ""any foreseeable price volatility.""  The company's digital asset impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired. Under standard accounting rules, the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reported unless an asset is sold.  The company's 129,699 bitcoins held at the end of June 30, 2022, were acquired for approximately $4 billion, reflecting an average cost per bitcoin of approximately $30,664, the company reported. At bitcoin’s current price of about $23,000, the value of those holdings is approximately $3 billion. MicroStrategy's entire market capitalization is roughly $3.2 billion.  MicroStrategy shares were flat at $278.01 in after-hours trading Tuesday, after initially falling 2% to 3%. Shares have tumbled around 46% year to date, just shy of bitcoin’s roughly 50% drop over the same time period.  On the company's earnings call with analysts, Saylor reiterated the advantages of the change in management structure.  ""The three of us make a great team,"" Saylor said, speaking of himself, Le and CFO Andrew Kang.

July has been good for most crypto projects, with the price of Matic surging to over 80% gains in just one month, although Matic price faces steep resistance at the $1 mark. Matic Weekly Chart Analysis The price of Matic moved from the low of $0.33 to a high of $1 before seeing a rejection to a region of $0.80. Matic saw a relief bounce when it met its all-time high (ATH) of 2021; this became a good support for Matic to build more buy pressure for a good relief bounce. From the strong support built around $0.33, Matic has been able to form weak support on the weekly chart at around $0.589.

Should prices by the end of Tuesday in negative territory this would mark the fifth consecutive day of declines, with each coming on below average volume (based on the 20-day moving average).  The average true range (ATR) of BTC movement has been in decline over this period as well, indicating that bitcoin is trading fairly tightly.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Low trading volumes in conjunction with narrowing trading ranges can indicate a lack of conviction, whether bullish or bearish. At the very least they can signal that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach.  In traditional markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9% on the day, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indices decreased 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.  Bitcoin-heavy company MicroStrategy (MSTR), which reports earnings after the close of U.S. stock markets on Tuesday, was up 3% during intraday trading.  Ether (ETH) increased 1.4% on the day, reversing its 3% decline from a day prior, and ending a streak of four consecutive down days.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Prices Decline on Lower Volume; Bond Markets Still Signal General Market Concern  Bitcoin prices fell again on Tuesday as markets appear to be taking a breather following the prior week’s move higher.  On a technical basis, bitcoin breached its 10-day exponential moving average (EMA), indicating short-term weakness. The 10-day EMA is a moving average of the most recent 10 days of bitcoin prices. A movement in price below an asset’s EMA can be interpreted as a bearish signal. Worth noting, however, is the downward moves have come on below average volume. Moves in either direction on low volume are often interpreted as showing a lack of conviction in the direction of the move.  Prices now sit between the 10- and the 20-day EMA, which could signal a buying window for traders holding a bullish outlook. Prices for BTC remain 28% below its 200-period EMA and less than 1% below its 50-day EMA of $23,211. For context, BTC last closed above its 50-day EMA in April.  The relative strength indicator (RSI) has retreated from the level of 69 reached on July 19, to a current level of 56.22. The RSI indicator is often used as an indicator of price momentum, and measures both the speed and magnitude of price movements. Levels above 70 indicate overbought conditions, while levels below 30 imply oversold conditions. Levels close to 50 (the current situation) are interpreted as “neutral.”  This often goes hand in hand with a “range-bound” environment, where prices trade relatively flat and the range of price movements compresses.  Fixed income markets continue to signal overall concern  As referenced in Monday’s edition of “First Mover,” the yield between the 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasury notes is at its most inverted level in over 20 years. The significance of the inversion is that historically within the U.S., yield curve inversions have often come 12-18 months prior to economic recession.  A counterpoint is that the flattening of the curve is a possible precursor to the U.S. Federal Reserve departing from its current schedule of tightening, while pivoting to more accommodative measures (i.e., lowering interest rates).  Another item of note is the potential inversion of the 10-year Treasury bond and the three-month Treasury. As evidenced below, the spread between the 10-year and three-month Treasurys has been in steep decline since May. While not currently inverted, the current spread of 0.04% is also at a 20-year low. The significance of this being that markets are essentially pricing the risk of loaning capital for three months higher than they are the risk of loaning capital for 10 years.  Bitcoin supply in profit gradually moving higher  While the spread between the 10-year and two-year relates to all risk assets, the BTC percentage supply in profit is connected to the cryptocurrency alone. Given the recent increase in BTC prices, it should come as no surprise that the Percent Supply in Profit indicator for BTC has moved higher as well. What also bears mentioning is the extent to which the metric has coincided with BTC market tops and bottoms in the past.  Historically, readings in excess of 95% have signaled market tops, while readings below 50% have signaled bottoms. As it stands, the BTC percent supply in profit is 61%, up from 50.3% on July 18. BTC prices are up 22% over the identical time frame.

42411779,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfh8w,1659471482,Exodus Wallet: How to Get Started,"Exodus is a simple, free-to-use cryptocurrency wallet that provides storage for your coins from exchanges or NFTs (non-fungible tokens) from marketplaces. Because the wallet is connected to the internet, it is classified as a hot wallet.  What is the Exodus wallet and its key features?  The Exodus wallet is a desktop-based digital asset management system that allows users to store, manage and exchange cryptocurrencies. The software is free to download on Windows, macOS and Linux systems.  The wallet was created in mid-2015 by entrepreneur and software developer J.P. Richardson and Daniel Castagnoli, and Exodus was officially launched in July 2016. The wallet is considered to be one of the most user-friendly digital asset management platforms because of its clean interface and simple design.  Exodus provides several features that are attractive to users, including the following:  Support for more than 225 different kinds of cryptocurrency assets.  Fully integrated with the FTX crypto exchange, allowing users to trade directly from their wallet.  A mobile app that allows users to manage their assets on the go.  The ability to place a custom maximum amount to pay in gas fees.  Ability to buy cryptocurrencies with the U.S. dollar, euro or the British pound.  24/7 customer support.  Its most notable feature is its 24/7 support and can be found through different channels:  Chatbot – You can access the chatbot by clicking on the icon on the homepage. You can either search through its help documents or speak to a representative.  Discord – This channel has more than 11,000 members. You can access Exodus' official Discord channel here.  Reddit – This an active community where members post technical issues, feature requests and crypto-related content.  There is also a comprehensive library of support documents in the “support” tab that includes general education on blockchain topics as well as information in Spanish.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It  How to get started  Before you begin, you should be familiar with the assets Exodus supports, which you can find here. For demonstration purposes, we will guide you with the desktop installation because it is similar to that of the app on iOS and Android.  1. Download the Exodus wallet from the official website, which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.  2. Click the drag-down arrow to choose the appropriate installation file for the operating system. Exodus won't require you to fill in your full name, email address and country of residence, which is part of a “know-your-customer” (KYC) process.  3. Upon completion of the installation, the Exodus Wallet app will pop up on your desktop as seen below:  4. Next, you need to secure your wallet, which is not part of the installation process. To do that, you need to click on the gear icon (third icon from the top right) to bring up settings.  5. Click on either the security or backup tab to begin creating your password. You will need to choose a strong password to protect your account.  Remember: Never lose or forget this password, because it will be required to access your Exodus wallet in the future.  6. Exodus will automatically generate custom recovery phrases chronologically from one to 12. You will need to hover your mouse to unveil each phrase.  Important: These phrases are essential, because they will be required to access your Exodus wallet if you lose access or have to reinstall the program on your computer or another device.  7. Store your recovery phrases or private key in a safe place, because it cannot be recovered if lost or forgotten. Exodus doesn't store a copy of the recovery phrase.  8. You will have to verify your recovery phrase. Exodus will randomly ask which word comes from a specific number to confirm them.  9. Once you have entered the words correctly, click “confirm” words.  You have now successfully created an Exodus wallet on a desktop. You can now use it to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies.  How to receive crypto in your wallet  After the installation, there are a few steps to complete to get your assets into Exodus.  1. First, click on “Assets.""  2. On this screen, you will need to click on the asset or assets that you want to receive. In this case, we will use dogecoin (DOGE) as an example. You will need to click on the checkmark to enable it.  3. After enabling it, you can click on “Dogecoin."" This will bring you straight to the wallet specifically for dogecoin. Now you can press the “receive” button.  4. You have the choice to either copy the address or use the QR code to transfer your dogecoin.  Things to consider to decide if Exodus wallet is right for you  When choosing a crypto wallet, you need to know and weigh a few things before committing to it:  Exodus is a hot wallet, which means it is directly connected to the internet, and yet it is non-custodial, which means you are responsible for keeping your private keys or recovery phrases safely.  Read more: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets  Exodus is a solid choice for those looking for an easily accessible crypto wallet.  It is user-friendly and provides a high degree of security for your coins. Those looking for a long-term storage solution, however, may want to consider a cold wallet instead.  Although you won't need to complete a KYC registration to open an Exodus wallet, the “buy crypto” functionality will funnel you to a third-party platform, MoonPay, to fund your wallet. That will require you to give your address and other personal information.  The available apps and dapps are very limited. There is only one option to access an exchange (FTX), an NFT marketplace (internal Solana marketplace) and a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform (Compound).",POSITIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Mike Antolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/exodus-wallet-how-to-get-started,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe8d6eb22c90be01dd29a7bdd38794aff2925341-1080x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421148,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWST,1659469497,"Here’s How $200M in Crypto Was Drained From Nomad Protocol, According to a Security Expert","A function irregularity on cross-chain messaging protocol Nomad gave leeway for upward of $200 million to be siphoned off the platform, according to one security expert.  Steven Walbroehl, chief information security officer at blockchain security firm Halborn, told CoinDesk TV that a recent update to Nomad’s smart contracts backfired, prompting transactions on the protocol to be automatically approved.  The result, although unclear, created a domino-like effect. “Once one person found out about it, it was a crazy mad rush of people who [could] go in there and copy the transaction and say, ‘Hey, I guess I’ll pay myself too, out of the bridge,’” Walbroehl said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program.  Nomad, which primarily serves as a bridge for users to send and receive tokens among different blockchains, told users Monday evening via a tweet that it was “aware of the incident involving the Nomad token bridge.” By then, the protocol had lost $45 million.  Two hours later, the protocol told users it was “aware of impersonators posing as Nomad and providing fraudulent addresses to collect funds.” By midnight on Monday, the protocol had lost nearly $200 million.  Walbroehl said that a user did not need to have extensive knowledge of such things as Merkle trees (the way data is handled) or the Solidity programming language to engage in the hack. In fact, “all you had to do [was] find a transaction that worked and then replace that address with your own.”  In Nomad’s case, however, all transactions were given the green light, whether or not they were legit. The protocol uses Merkle trees to validate transactions. They are primarily “used to provide blockchain data more securely and efficiently by proving a transaction is valid.”  Walbroehl said that bridges such as Nomad are likely prone to exploits because “most often this is where all the value is stored” – and thus bridges are enticing to hackers.  “You’re going to the vaults to rob the bank, rather than trying to go out and pick everybody's wallet,” he said. “Just go right for the bank.”  The second reason Walbroehl points to is complicated programming, especially when it comes to “two different protocols.”  “If you combine high value with complicated programming and lots of errors happen, that’s where hacks come from,” he said.  Walbroehl believes that the best way to prevent future hacks “is to put defense in depth – do security audits.” In addition, he said that developers should get others to look at their code, as well as testing it on their own.  For users, Walbroehl emphasizes “being aware of the bridges or the bridges that you’re investing in.”  Nomad told CoinDesk that an ongoing investigation is underway and that law enforcement officials have also been notified.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform – which recently raised upward of $22 million in a seed round led by big crypto players including Coinbase Ventures and OpenSea – is the latest protocol to face a heavy-handed hack. Back in April, the gaming-focused Ronin Network faced a hack of more than $600 million.

In an uptrend, each successive peak and trough is higher than the ones found earlier in the trend. The uptrend is therefore composed of higher swing lows and higher swing highs.

42422571,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nPrh,1659461011,Web3 Development Remains Strong Despite Crypto Downturn: Report,"Telstra Ventures, a data-focused venture capital firm, released a new report showing that Web3-developer interest has remained strong despite the crypto bear market driven by the implosion of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin, the bankruptcy filing of crypto-lender Celsius and the liquidation of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Titled “Blockchain Open-Source Developers Signal Strength of Web3 Community,” the report examined developer activity on the Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana blockchains. The data analysts looked at 1,000 active organizations contributing to more than 30,000 open source projects across the chains, collating data from a number of sources, including code repository GitHub.  “When we looked at the number of monthly active contributors to their GitHub repositories, we saw that despite pretty significant downturns in price over the last few months, [contributions] generally stayed pretty strong,” Telstra Ventures general partner Saad Siddiqui told CoinDesk in an interview. “Ethereum and Bitcoin held onto the most active contributors. Solana declined a little bit more but not nearly as much as would be indicated by the decline in price.”  Web3 contributor growth  The firm outlined growth in the contributor communities of each chain in terms of a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR), then examined the change in monthly active contributors since last year’s price peaks for the native tokens.  Ethereum’s contributor community grew at a nearly 25% CAGR, Solana’s at 173% and Bitcoin at 17%. Monthly active contributors were down 9% for Ethereum and 21% for Solana since the November 2021 price peaks for ether and SOL, respectively. Bitcoin monthly contributors increased more than 8% since bitcoin's trading high in October.  Why did Solana have the largest monthly active contributor decline?  “My sense is that, purely anecdotally, the communities for bitcoin and Ethereum have been around for a long time and they’ve seen downturns like this before,” said Jonathan Serfaty, who heads Telstra's data science group. “They’ve got the core set of developers and contributors that have stuck with it through hard times and continue to build out.""  Developer trends  The report didn’t break out the most popular verticals among Web3 developers, but Siddiqui noted the strength in tooling projects, which help developers build applications.  “I think, generally, we’re seeing three kinds of applications that are being built in the blockchain universe,” concurred Serfaty. “The first is reinventing the existing systems. The second one is incumbent and traditional companies utilizing blockchain for their internal use case and finding new revenue streams. And the third is blockchain applications for crypto-native folks.”  The Telstra Ventures report noted that venture and corporate investors have backed seven of the 10 most active projects across the three blockchains. Last month, Crunchbase data showed that while VC investments in crypto companies dropped 26% year over year, the number of smaller deals increased.  Along similar lines as the Telstra study, Andreessen Horowitz – which launched a record-setting $4.5 billion crypto fund in May – has a price-innovation cycle thesis that declining digital asset prices tend to usher in periods of developer innovation.

But with the Ethereum “Merge” still at least a month away, some analysts are already sharpening their pencils on various strategies to profit from any revolt in the ranks.  According to Decrypt, Chinese crypto miner Chandler Guo has started a campaign to fork the Ethereum blockchain and create a spinoff, hewing to the “proof-of-work” (PoW) system that Ethereum uses now.  The story was based on a Chinese-language tweet from Guo: “Ethpow will be coming soon,” the post reads. “I fork ethereum once, I will fork it again!”  The cryptocurrency wouldn't be ETH post-Merge. With the fork, or code change, Guo would create a new cryptocurrency called ETHPOW, according to Decrypt.  Investment research analysts at BitMEX published a blog post arguing that a new chain might generate some interest from investors and traders.  ""Although there are many technical challenges that ETHPoW faces, as long as the chain survives, it looks likely that there could be positive narratives around the coin and leading centralized exchanges are likely to list it,"" the analysts wrote.  As outlined by BitMEX:  “Doing the above trade, you have potentially got more USD for free with almost zero risk! Well, zero risk when only considering certain types of risk, such as price movements,” the BitMEX post states.  “ETHPoW may generate a lot of excitement, and we predict that ETH vs ETHPoW will be a popular trading pair post-split, at least until another interesting dynamic comes along,"" BitMEX analysts said.  But others are dismissing the effort almost entirely.  According to Will Harborne, founder of Rhino.fi, there is likely little profit to be made from trading ETHPoW.  “What little there might be from the strategy in the article will get taken by 'miner extractable value' (MEV) bots automatically before regular people get a chance,” Harborne told CoinDesk. “In reality, there will be bots ready to do that, trading every token they have for ETH (since all the other tokens on ETHPoW will be worthless after the Merge).”  The bots will use direct access to miners to make sure their transactions get included, instead of transactions sent by regular people, Harborne predicted.  “Even if a regular person tries to do it as fast as possible manually, you probably won't manage it,” he said. “ETHPoW if it happens will be a big mess and everyone will forget about it within a week.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,ASIA | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/02/as-china-miner-contests-ethereum-merge-bitmex-offers-strategy-on-potential-ethpow-split,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec62b7678efd74a8ac2958d5b3e2c91422886df9-4680x3510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is due to its performance on a year-over-year basis compared to other financial markets over similar time frames.

That is, until a bear market where bitcoin&apos;s performance as an inflation hedge starts to shake. An example is the bear market that is currently being experienced in the market. This decline has seen the digital asset lose about 44% of its value during this time and inflation continues to hit 40-year highs.

42411108,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC99v,1659458457,To Unplug or Double Down? Crypto Mining in Crypto Winter,"Think crypto winter is painful? Try being a bitcoin miner. If you’re an investor who bought bitcoin when the price was north of $50,000, it can cause heartburn to stare at the screen and see your balance dwindle. But these are just paper losses. Unless you sell, no blood is drawn.  Miners play a different game. As I explored in my recent deep dive into home bitcoin mining, generally speaking, there are three main variables that go into a miner’s cost-benefit analysis: the price of bitcoin, the cost of energy and the hashrate – or “difficulty level” (the mining competition) – of the network. For most of the 2021 bull run, home miners could find juicy profits with a do-it-yourself approach.  Now the math has changed. “When bitcoin dipped below $36,000, I actually unplugged my bitcoin miners,” says one of the leaders of the home mining resurgence, a man who goes by the pseudonym @econoalchemist. His cost of electricity was relatively high, and after the price drop, he was mining at a loss. Because he had no fiat as a cushion (he’s a purist), this hardcore miner had to stop mining.  The long-bearded Econoalchemist wears dark sunglasses and camouflage ball cap on our Zoom call. He looks like a younger member of ZZ Top.  Bitcoin mining “has changed a lot” in the last few months, Econoalchemist acknowledges, but perhaps surprisingly, he shares that many miners are still “holding strong” and continuing to crank out bitcoin – even if it’s at a loss.  It’s easy to get whiplash from the daily twists and turns of crypto, but a conversation with Econoalchemist gives a wider lens at what’s really happening in the mining business – and perhaps a glimpse of the future. Could a further price drop cause a mining crisis? Would the network itself be at risk? Econoalchemist has the answers (or at least solid guesses), and he now expects to emerge from the bear market in better shape than before, as “tough conditions force you to start making tough decisions.”  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Hello sir! When we last spoke, the price of bitcoin was around $44k. Today … it is not. (The price of bitcoin was roughly $20,000 during our conversation.) How have things changed for home miners since then?  Econoalchemist: The thing you need to keep in mind about home miners is that usually they've got a day job.  And their hobbies are usually funded out of pocket, with whatever disposable income they have.  So if they can afford to spend 300 bucks a month on bitcoin, instead of using Cash App or whatever, they’ll use that 300 bucks to pay their electricity bill and get bitcoin that way, right?  Most of these home miners have other sources of income. So what I've been seeing is that they’re still going to work every day, and they're still paying their electricity bill – because their energy costs aren't going up that much. And they're just continuing to mine and stack bitcoin.  Read more: Is Miner Concentration Once Again Jeopardizing Bitcoin? Not Exactly  Even at the lower prices?  Even though there's a bitcoin price dip and even though they might technically be “mining at a loss” (he uses air quotes on the Zoom), they’re still continuing to do it.  Wait, so bitcoin miners are actually sometimes mining at a loss, and they continue to do it?  Yeah. The amount of money they're spending on electricity is more than the value of the bitcoin that they're earning for that day, but they can afford to do it. They've put all this time and effort into getting the infrastructure and learning the technology and setting up their home mining system. They're holding strong.  Now, a lot of home miners were running S9s (the oldest, cheapest and least efficient of the mainstream application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs), and I have seen a lot of people unplugging those. At the beginning of the year, 30% of the overall bitcoin network hashrate was held up with S9 ASICs, and fast-forward to today, it’s more like 5%.  The bitcoin price drop made S9s unprofitable?  Yeah. If you go back to the beginning of the year, if bitcoin is trading at $50,000, then it makes sense to run any ASIC you can get your hands on. Even the most inefficient ASICs are still going to be profitable at those prices. Today, with the price at $20,000, those ASICs just aren't cutting it anymore.  What else has changed?  When the price of bitcoin went down, a couple of things happened. ASICs prices started to go down.  To clarify, you mean the cost of the mining equipment? The S19s and the S9s?  Yeah. In December and January, you were seeing brand-new S19 Pros that would sell for like $12,000. Now you’re seeing them sell for $4,500. This became a lot more feasible for people. Twelve grand is a lot of money for a lot of people, but four grand can make a lot more sense.  So it might actually be easier to start mining. Interesting. How about you? Are you still mining, or did you unplug?  Here's some irony for you. When bitcoin dipped below $36,000, I actually unplugged my bitcoin miners.  I wouldn't have guessed that. You’re not holding strong?  Here's the thing about me. My situation is a little bit different than most [home miners]. When I was saying most people have a fiat job and they're paying their electric bill out of pocket, you have to remember I was fired from my job in October last year. (He was fired after a dispute with his employer over COVID-19 vaccines, and then used that as a trigger to work on bitcoin full-time. More in my mining story.)  Right, right.  I have just been working for bitcoin ever since. And my electricity prices are like 20 cents per kilowatt hour. That’s really high. And when bitcoin dipped below $36,000, I had to sell more bitcoin, because I don’t have any fiat.  No fiat at all?  My bank account is $0. All my money is in bitcoin. When I earn money for my content, it's paid in bitcoin. When I want to pay my bills, I have to sell bitcoin to do that. And so my electricity bill is one of them.  I was having to sell more bitcoin to pay the electricity bill than my miners were generating. When we continued to go down below $36k, I was like, ""Dude, I can't be selling a million sats (satoshis) a month to earn 750,000 sats."" You know what I mean? So I unplugged my miners.  That sounds devastating. What’s your plan for the future?  I've got that shipping container in my [backyard]. And I have arbitraged a very favorable electricity rate. I published a guide with Braiin's that shares how to do this. My new setup is going to be at a commercial rate, and it’s going to come out to around five cents a kilowatt hour.  And you were at 20 cents before, so with my crude math … that lowers your operating costs by 75%, right?  Right. But dude, it took me seven months.  What’s the new magic number for you, the price of bitcoin where it’s profitable for you to mine?  (Here he consults an online mining calculator and punches in some inputs, such as the current hashrate difficulty of the network.) Just below $13,000 is my break-even point.  How common would you say your situation is?  There are a lot of people who are now getting commercial meters installed in their backyard or getting a shipping container like I did. Even though we're in a bear market, you'd be surprised how many people are out there trying to step their game up to this next level of home mining.  Let’s pivot to the larger miners. I imagine they’d face similar challenges as you?  The large mining companies that have been in this game for a while, like Foundry or Slush Pool, they're going to be totally fine. Those aren't the ones that are going to be unplugging. Those aren’t the ones scrambling to try and figure out their balance sheets.  But at the end of 2021, you saw this huge infusion of capital into bitcoin mining. And it was happening with bitcoin mining companies that were publicly traded, selling equity, or getting debt or raising capital in some way.  There were a lot of commitments made, but they haven’t been able to follow through. There have been supply chain hiccups. Logistics issues. A lot of that is related globally to the pandemic; it has made building out infrastructure extremely difficult. These companies have to get the permits, get the titles and get the electrical infrastructure in place.  I’m kind of surprised by your answer. I would have thought the big issue for the larger miners is the price drop?  For the large mining companies, I don't think it's so much an issue of the bitcoin price drop. The main issue is that they're overleveraged, and then they're not able to deploy that hashrate and get it up and running. A lot of them signed contracts with ASIC manufacturers to spend billions of dollars on hardware throughout 2022, and then they don't have a place to plug that hardware in.  A lot of them have loans on their ASICs. They're overleveraged, they've got these loans, and now the price of ASICs – of a brand-new ASIC – has fallen from $12,000 when they took out these loans to $4,500 now. And it's now aged seven months and hasn't even plugged in.  Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market  The companies that are in trouble are the ones who were trying to get off the ground, they overleveraged. The value of the hardware – which is their collateral for them – has now been cut in half, or even more. Now they're really in trouble.  But I’m guessing the price crash has to be an issue too, right? Just as you had to unplug at $36k, if the price gets even lower, at some point, they’d have to shut down. What’s your guess for that price?  It really depends on what their power agreements are. If you look at companies like Riot, they've got these power purchasing agreements behind the meter. And I have no idea what they pay for their electricity, but, dude, they could be paying like two or three cents a kilowatt hour.  If that's the case, the price of bitcoin could drop to like $10K or $7K, and they're going to be fine.  Interesting. Just as a thought experiment, what happens if the price drops even below $7k and stays there? Wouldn’t most miners need to shut down? And isn’t that a systemic, existential risk to the Bitcoin network?  Look at what happened in the summer of last year, when there was the Chinese mining ban. Fifty percent of the overall network hashrate went offline like within a couple of weeks, right?  Right.  Then the bitcoin network corrected itself. When the hashrate went offline, the difficulty corrected. The difficulty went down to match the new perceived hashrate. And when that happened, for any of the miners that were still online, their hash value – the number of sats per terahash per day – went through the roof. So for anyone who was home mining at the time, we all looked like geniuses.  Read more: Crypto Carbon: Can Blockchain Networks Fix Carbon Offsets?  And that's what would happen again. If big companies do unplug, the bitcoin network difficulty will change accordingly. And for anyone who's still on the network, it's still going to be profitable.  But what about the overall network security? How would that be affected in this scenario?  Let's say there was an attack on bitcoin. You know, what we saw during the Chinese mining ban, with all the hashrate going offline – that's what an attack would look like. Where the hashrate drops very quickly, and therefore, it becomes easier for an attacker to come up with that 51% it needs to do a hashrate attack.  Lemme see if I’m getting this. If the price drops below $7k and stays there for a while, a lot of the bigger miners might be forced to unplug. The network would stay running because the hashrate “difficulty” would lower, enticing smaller miners to stay plugged in. But because the difficulty is so much lower, the network is more vulnerable to an attack?  The barrier to carrying out an attack like that is lower. They would have to expend less resources in order to get to that 51% mark.  For some historical context, how did this play out after the price drop in 2018?  If you look at 2018, bitcoin came off the $19,000 peak of 2018, and the price dropped to $6k and then it fell off a cliff to $3,500, right?  Oh, I remember.  And then it just kind of stayed under $4,000 for months and months and months. All throughout that period, if you look at what was happening to hashrate, more and more hashrate was going online at that time.  You’re saying that even in a dark and frosty crypto winter, the network took care of itself?  It's almost like a self-correcting mechanism. If the price did crash to $6k for an extended period of time, there are a lot of people out there who would absolutely thrive while there's blood in the streets. They would thrive because they're doing smart things. They’re arbitraging very good electrical rates, like what I did. Or they’re finding very cheap energy sources. They're going to places where energy is being generated that doesn't have a large demand. You're seeing a lot of bitcoin miners flock to Texas, for example, to access the power being produced by these windmills.  It almost feels like the price crash has a silver lining? It’s forcing miners to be more efficient.  Yeah. Tough conditions force you to start making tough decisions. For me, it's been a lot of grueling work, trying to get all the infrastructure in place and do it right.  Predictions for the future of mining?  I think you're going to see energy producers leapfrog these large bitcoin mining companies.  How so?  The business model of these large bitcoin mining companies is to play the fiat game, right? They're selling equity in their company, they're raising debt, they're raising capital, they're becoming overleveraged. The price of bitcoin crashes, and then suddenly they're in trouble, they can't get their hashrate deployed. That business model isn't sustainable.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Don’t Call It a Comeback: The Unlikely Rise of Home Bitcoin Mining  What we're going to see is large power-generating assets, like coal mining power generation stations, they're going to start using bitcoin as a tool. They're going to use it as a tool to stabilize the demand on their power-generating assets. (He recently gave a speech at a coal mining conference about this very possibility.)  Last question. What has it been like having to sell bitcoin – after the price crashed – to pay for things?  Let me put it this way. I have never regretted actually using bitcoin to transact. Money is meant to be circulated. Yeah, it's great when bitcoin is trading for $69,000, and I can kind of daydream about what I'm going to do with my bitcoin.  But at the end of the day, I approach it as more of a tool, a tool that can be used to transact without permission, to continue interacting economically with the world around me without having to rely on any sort of third party.  Look at what happened with the Canadian trucker Freedom Convoy. If your political views can get you in a situation where you're cut off from basic financial services, then we're living in a pretty scary world. And it's in your best interest to learn how to transact with bitcoin today, when you are not in an emergency situation.  So it doesn't really bother me that the price of bitcoin crashed. Yeah, it kind of sucks watching larger and larger chunks of your savings get broken off to pay the bills each month, but I would not have it any other way. Because the alternative is that I'm at the mercy of someone else's permission.  You’re walking the walk. Best of luck to you going forward.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/02/to-unplug-or-double-down-crypto-mining-in-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d79ab070ae777885919a7d71262a344feafe516f-4859x3644.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422586,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nQDh,1659456214,NFT Exchange Magic Eden Expands to Ethereum,"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden is going multi-chain, on Tuesday integrating Ethereum-based NFTs into its previously Solana-only platform.  The marketplace said it will offer the same “go-to-market” benefits for Ethereum NFT creators as it does for its Solana users, including its popular minting toolkit, whitelisting tools and marketing support.  The company is also prepping a “cross-currency trading product” that will allow users to purchase both Ethereum and Solana NFTs in either blockchain’s native currency, along with its own cross-chain analytics dashboard.  “We don’t think winning on ETH will happen overnight. We are entering the market with humility and are prepared to build for a long while,"" Zhuoxun Yin, co-founder of Magic Eden, told CoinDesk. ""With that being said, we have a strong conviction for our hypothesis on what NFT creators and collectors need from their marketplace.""  Marketplace rivalry  The integration marks the company’s latest push for the top spot in the growing kingdom of NFT marketplaces. Magic Eden is the current kingpin of Solana digital collectibles, hosting more than 90% of the ecosystem’s trades, according to data from DappRadar.  OpenSea is Magic Eden’s Ethereum counterpart, touting a similar dominance within its respective ecosystem. Though OpenSea is most known for its ETH trading, its marketplace also supports Solana, Tezos and Polygon blockchains.  Magic Eden raised a $130 million Series A in late June at a $1.6 billion valuation, on par with OpenSea’s $100 million Series B at a $1.5 billion valuation raised in July 2021.  Despite its funding timeline being behind OpenSea’s, Magic Eden has at times topped OpenSea’s marketplace in total transactions and sales volume.  Whether the integration will move the needle for ETH communities looking to jump ship from OpenSea remains to be seen. NFT communities typically remain loyal to individual marketplaces despite invitations from new platforms, as seen with Magic Eden’s community only growing after OpenSea announced Solana support earlier this year.  A Magic Eden representative told CoinDesk the company has ""more than two chains planned in the long run,"" though no new integrations will be announced in the near future.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/03/nft-exchange-magic-eden-expands-to-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82975f096baaea6a574aab29f93c110f931739b0-4684x3513.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nQ5h,1659456000,Bits Crypto Raises $1.2M to Facilitate Gradual Investments in Crypto,"Fintech startup Bits Crypto has raised $1.2 million in pre-seed funding to build out its mobile crypto-investment application. The round was led by HOF Capital, the investor in such crypto companies as MoonPay, Stripe and Kraken, the company said Tuesday.  Bits allows users to invest their spare change in cryptocurrencies through automatic dollar roundups. Each user’s credit card transaction is rounded up to the next dollar and that difference is invested in cryptocurrency. Similar to investment platform Acorns, which automatically invests in a portfolio of stocks, Bits caters to users who want to dollar-cost average small amounts to build their portfolio of crypto investments over time.  “Everybody knows that crypto is hard. There's extreme market volatility, and that’s intimidating to first-time investors or wannabe investors,” Bits founder Jameson Rader told CoinDesk. “Fortunately, there is dollar-cost averaging, which is a proven financial strategy to minimize exposure and risk to market volatility.”  Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy in which investors put money into assets incrementally over time. It can be beneficial to those who want to spread their investment out, with a likelihood of seeing higher returns as opposed to a one-time, all-in investment.  Bits Chief Design Officer Nick Bembenek told CoinDesk that to start investing, users download the app and connect their credit cards. They then choose a basket of up to three currencies to allocate their investments across. Users spend money as usual, and with each transaction, the spare change rounded up to a dollar is deposited into the app. From there it’s invested across the basket in $25 increments to avoid heavy gas fees.  Bits also lets users select amounts for daily, weekly and monthly automatic investments.  Differentiators  Financial services companies such as Robinhood and Cash App currently offer crypto-roundup features. However, these require the use of these platforms’ native credit cards.  Rader calls this a “major product differentiator,” as Bits utilized banking software Plaid to allow users to plug in any debit card, credit card or bank account to begin roundups and scheduled investments.  Bits has integrated Coinbase for users to invest in tokens listed on the exchange as well as withdraw their profits via Coinbase wallet.  According to Chief Operating Officer Alex Poscente, the integration of Coinbase and Plaid allows the product to operate across all 50 states in the U.S.  It’s also building out educational content, called Tidbits, to educate and onboard users new to the crypto space on what tokens are available to purchase. After trending twice on Reddit as the top thread in the 5.1 million-member large cryptocurrency community for its beginner descriptions of every coin available on Coinbase, it's making an effort to make its application not only user-friendly but also educational for beginners.  An early user of Bits told CoinDesk that she likes the app’s orientation toward onboarding users new to the crypto space.  “It definitely has changed my view [of investing in crypto] in the sense that one, I'm not scared and two, I'm actually able to act and be active in this space as well, as an investor,” the user told CoinDesk.  The funding round also saw participation from venture capital funds Founders Inc. and Founders Committee.  Bits plans to launch its app for the public in September. Eventually, the team hopes to make a fully decentralized, on-chain custodial Bits wallet by early 2023.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/02/bits-crypto-raises-12m-to-facilitate-gradual-investments-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe5bfd0e9dd2c423643ee3493ecb5257e9945832-2880x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422591,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nQNh,1659454002,Ether's Failure to Break Through 100-Day Price Average Clouds Bullish Outlook,"On Tuesday, ether (ETH) was on the defensive, approaching an uptrend line representing the recent recovery rally.  At press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency traded 3% lower on the day at $1,575. The decline follows late last week's buyer failure to establish a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average, then placed at around $1,750.  A breakdown of the rising trend-line support would imply an end of the corrective bounce from under $1,000 and shift focus to $1,356, the support of the higher low printed on June 26. Below that, $1,000 could be the level where buyers may step in, putting a floor under prices.  A drop to $1,000 could be seen if the daily-chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram drops below zero, indicating a bearish shift in momentum, according to Katie Stockton, a chartered market technician and founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies. Traders use the MACD histogram to identify trend changes and trend strength. Currently, the MACD is barely holding above zero.  A case for an extended relief rally will strengthen if prices retake recent highs above $1,700 and the weekly chart MACD histogram confirms a positive crossover. While the weekly MACD teased a so-called buy signal or crossover above zero as of this writing, the indicator needs to hold the same through Sunday's UTC close to confirm a trend reversal higher.  ""If ether clears $1,733 decisively and confirms a weekly MACD 'buy' signal, that would support an extended relief rally, with secondary resistance near the 200-day MA,"" Stockton wrote in the weekly market note shared with CoinDesk on Monday.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/02/ethers-failure-to-break-through-100-day-price-average-clouds-bullish-outlook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1115bed6f1593ad2cbbf070fb668e01b5826ab27-1979x1485.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency still holds some of its gains from last week but might be poised for a re-test of lower levels. At the time of writing, BTC&apos;s price trades at $22,900 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours and an 8% profit over the past week. This Bitcoin Bear Market Might Not Be Like 2020 Crypto market participants seem to be in pursuit of a quick and persistent uptrend, like the one seen in 2020. At that time, BTC&apos;s price drop to a low of $3,000 and then began an ascend to its current all-time highs. However, trading firm QCP Capital believes the price of Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies might see more sideways movement and downside pressure before reclaiming lost territory. This price action might be more like the 2018 bear market. The firm believes BTC&apos;s price will benefit during Q3, 2022. During this period, the cryptocurrency might attempt to reclaim higher levels, but with a potential to break above critical resistance areas capped by increased selling pressure from the Bitcoin mining sector and crypto companies suffering due to the bearish trend. BTC&apos;s price action might continue to operate on uncertain grounds with &apos;choppy moves&apos; with an alternative narrative between bullish and bearish with a critical resistance at $28,700 to the upside and critical support at $10,000 to the downside.

As of this writing, the AVAX/USD pair dipped to a new low that registered at $23.33 following a bearish overturn.

42411418,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeKt,1659451532,What Is Crypto’s Downfall? Its Complexity,"As in many financial markets, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen their value plunge so far this year. A handful of projects like Terra have imploded before our very eyes. This sequence of events has led many investors and onlookers to question whether there's a viable future for the asset class that was so bullish just a year ago.  The pandemic brought an influx new bitcoin and other asset investors, many of whom lost big this summer. Most didn’t understand the risks partially because of naivete, but also due to the increasingly complex crypto ecosystem making it harder to understand.  Jameson Lopp is the co-founder and chief technology officer of bitcoin security provider Casa. He previously served as a software engineer at BitGo, and has written extensively about cypherpunks and bitcoin.  The warning signs were there for those of us who have been around for more than one market cycle. The reality is that each project is its own unique animal, and not all of them are built to withstand the myriad threats that lie ahead.  While it will take some time for sentiment to recover, it’s premature to dunk on bitcoin and the like right now. There may still be some potential to be found out there. In the meantime, there are several red flags to watch out for when vetting other projects.  Experiments, pipe dreams and scams, oh my!  When Bitcoin began in 2009, it was in a league of its own. Since then, it has emerged as a store of value and censorship-resistant network with a market cap that has exceeded $1 trillion. Even with the recent crash, I believe Bitcoin’s potential remains as bright as ever. I can’t say the same for all of the projects that followed.  Today, there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies, digital assets, tokens and projects – all promising to be the future of finance. Each takes some elements of Bitcoin’s design – blockchain, decentralization, economics, mining, cryptography – and alters them to fulfill some other use case. As a technologist, I appreciate the experimentation that takes place in crypto. I’m less interested in the hype.  New projects are always risky, regardless of if the people behind them are well-intentioned. Deadcoins.com tracks projects that have folded and currently lists over 1,700 in its catalog. Remember that half of all startup businesses fail within 5 years; it’s not surprising that we see even higher failure rates in this cutting edge technology sector. Many projects will be unrealistically optimistic, but the only way to test if an idea works is to try to build it and see what happens.  Looking at the bigger picture of risks, a 2018 report by Satis Group concluded that 80% of ICO projects launched in 2017 were outright scams, while 7% had failed and about only 10% looked promising for long-term success.  See also: Timothy C. May: Enough With the ICO-Me-So-Horny-Get-Rich-Quick-Lambo Crypto | Opinion (2018)  When people get interested in cryptocurrency, they often feel compelled like they missed the boat and are thus to find “the next bitcoin.” Entrepreneurs quickly wised up to that fact and began issuing altcoins and tokens with so much as a poorly-written white paper. This has created a vicious cycle of pump-and-dump scams that do not reflect the hard work of many of us in the industry.  If you’ve been the victim of one of these schemes, I suggest using this bear market as a time to reflect and learn about the underlying technology and its merits, beginning with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a proven track record, but I don’t rule out the possibility that some value will emerge from the many attempts at crypto innovation. Scientifically, you can’t prove a negative. Moreover, the market will continue to hone in on other valuable use cases developed through the successes and failures of other cryptographically-secured protocols.  The siren song of centralization  A large part of engineering is about managing trade-offs, like the need for convenience, speed and security. Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized network that processes blocks of transactions every 10 minutes, give or take.  Over the years, many parties have sought to improve upon this design in various ways. Some have tried to increase the number of transactions in every block. Others went after faster transactions. A number of projects have tried to plug other data from the real world into a blockchain to create sophisticated markets like derivatives.  These efforts have struggled to overtake Bitcoin as the dominant store of value because they usually introduce some form of centralization. Centralization is highly efficient, but it undermines your efforts if your goal is to democratize finance and empower individuals.  See also: Bitcoin and the Rise of the Cypherpunks | Opinion (2016)  Centralization hurts projects because it tends to corrupt incentives for their respective communities. For instance, an altcoin project might make it hard for everyday users to run a node and participate in the network, or they could create an inner circle of validators as gatekeepers of transactions. If a validator is curating data to feed into a blockchain, it could be a single point of failure through bribery, collusion or outright attack.  Bitcoin’s success has been predicated on its decentralization. Users can participate in the network without having to trust one another. They only have to trust the network protocol rules, which they can verify with whatever software they choose. This decentralization is why bitcoin has grown as a form of money.  Too complex to complete  Complexity is the enemy of security. The more moving parts you add to a system, the more potential points of failure. It doesn’t necessarily do a lot of good to create a magical smart-contract platform if you can’t prevent abuse or denial of service. Sometimes impressive white papers fail to translate into effective projects. Perfect can be the enemy of good.  According to SlowMist, the most common forms of loss after scams are flash loans, congestion attacks, and contract vulnerabilities. All of these are a result of systems that have created fragility due to their complexity. It is more challenging for developers to write robust code when the total number of possible interactions users can have with the code increases exponentially.  Discipline is underappreciated in technology. It’s hard to create a system that works as well as Bitcoin. It’s designed to do one thing and only one thing well: Be sound money.  A grandiose vision needs grandiose implementation, and that’s hard to provide in a decentralized fashion. Building an open, permissionless network is the equivalent of building a plane while you’re flying it, and developers have to be careful not to tilt economic incentives in the wrong direction. Each step in building something needs to be checked for stability and security from both internal and external threats.  Furthermore, complexity increases risk for users. Plenty of private keys have been lost due to user error. As co-founder and chief technology officer of Casa, a bitcoin security provider, I strive to find ways to accommodate users from all walks of life. Simplicity is king.  Bitcoin is changing the world as a tool for individual empowerment. As for crypto, the unknowns grow every day with each new project. The space has grown to an extent where no individual can vet the technical nuances of every project, so it’s reasonable to maintain some curiosity along with a healthy dose of skepticism. As you venture into the crypto verse, strive to balance optimism with realism and you’ll be on your way to finding vires in numeris (strength in numbers).

42422622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naVh,1659449046,"First Mover Americas: BTC, ETH Drop Amid Geopolitical Tensions","Price Point: The correlation between crypto and stock markets is strong, as global markets take a hit amid heightening geopolitical tensions. Both bitcoin and ether are down.  Market Moves: ETH and BTC trading volumes converge for the first time. Will there be a change in market dominance?  Chart of The Day: The U.S. yield curve is at its flattest level since 2000.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were both down on Tuesday as global markets fell on fears that the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) planned visit to Taiwan could heighten tensions between Beijing and Washington.  The prospect of escalating geopolitical tensions led to a fresh risk-off sentiment among investors, and cryptocurrencies are seen as risky assets.  In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite dropped 2.3%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.4%.  BTC was down by 1% over the last 24 hours and ETH dropped 5%.  “The larger dip in ether is just ETH taking a profit trade from investors after a 50% rally in July,” said Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a systems provider for the crypto industry in Europe.  In July, ETH rallied by 56% and BTC rose 16%, according to data from TradingView.  “It’s important to recall the difference between the two tokens’ rally last month,” Jodar said. “It’s normal to see a bigger dip in ETH now.”  The correlation with stocks remains strong for cryptocurrencies, which signals that the Hang Seng Index's drop on Tuesday hurts the momentum, Jodar said.  “The support for ETH now sits at around $1,500,” Jodar said. “If ETH manages to keep that level, it will be a positive signal for the market and the bullish trend could continue to $1,700.”  Tokens trading in the green Tuesday included Crypto.com’s cronos (CRO) and chilliz (CHZ), which is a digital currency for sports and entertainment, powering the Socios.com platform. They were up by 7% and 13%.  Elsewhere, Coinbase Prime has added ethereum to its expanding list of staking options for U.S. institutional clients, according to a blog post Monday.  According to a report from CoinShares, crypto funds saw a fifth consecutive week of inflows, with net inflows of $81 million in the seven days ended July 29. July’s $474 million of inflows were the largest monthly amount this year and reversed June’s outflows of $481 million.  User activity on the Aave lending platform rose to a 2022 high ahead of the launch of its yield-generating stablecoin, GHO. Read more about that here.

It was previously around 45% to 50%.  “This could be because of FOMO from investors of ETH 2.0 or because there is already a change in tendency,” Jodar said, using the acronym for ""feat of missing out"" and referring to an upcoming software update on the Ethereum network.  “In the next bull market, maybe we will see a change in market dominance,"" he said.  Chart of the Day: U.S. Yield Curve Flattest Since 2000  By Omkar Godbole  The U.S. 10/2 yield spread, measuring the difference between yields on 10- and two-year Treasury notes, is now at its most inverted level since September 2000.  The flattening indicates that even as the Federal Reserve raises rates and puts upward pressure on the two-year yield, market participants are buying the 10-year note, pushing its yield lower.  That reflects investor belief that the Fed's tightening cycle will be over soon and rates will fall again, perhaps to support economic growth. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction.  The flattening, therefore, could be considered bullish for risky assets, including bitcoin. It's the classic case of bad news being good news for markets, especially since risk assets seem to have priced the Fed's tightening since November.  The 10-year note often attracts demand for safe haven assets and could do so if tensions between the U.S. and China escalate over Pelosi's visit to Taiwan – a self-governed Island claimed by Beijing. In that case, risk assets will likely dip alongside the continued flattening of the yield curve.

42422596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nZth,1659448800,Lending Platform Vires.Finance Gets Go-Ahead for Repayment Plan,"Waves, a blockchain used to create custom crypto tokens, will implement a user-approved plan to navigate the liquidity crisis on its primary lending platform, Vires.Finance.  More than three-quarters of Waves’ governance token holders voted in favor of the “DeFi Revival Plan,” which allows account holders with balances of more than $250,000 (in both USDT and USDC stablecoins) to choose whether to withdraw their money from Vires.Finance or keep their funds on the platform until market conditions improve.  The hope is for the platform to slow user withdrawals, easing liquidity pressures that have made it difficult for the lender to keep up with requests for funds to be returned.  Waves founder Sasha Ivanov says the agreement is a testament to the power of democratized finance.  “Amid the ongoing crypto winter, it is essential to remember and highlight the core values of decentralization, immutability, freedom from institutional greed and inclusivity that underpin the blockchain sector,” Ivanov said in a press release. “Unlike other platforms, Vires.Finance and Waves keep weathering this storm – largely thanks to the loyal and decisive community that always has the last word in the matter.”  The “DeFi Revival Plan” is the latest of several community-focused initiatives aimed at resuscitating Vires.Finance. The early April de-pegging of its Waves-based USDN (USD neutrino) wiped out nearly $200 million in USDN market capitalization, leading to a prolonged bank run that triggered the platform’s liquidity crisis. Although Ivanov took on about $500 million of overextended loans into his own wallet, the platform still has debt outstanding to its users.  According to the plan’s terms, users who choose to get repaid now will be able to exchange their positions for USDN with a 365-day vesting period and an additional 5% liquidation bonus. Those who opt to keep their funds on the platform will have a 0% annual percentage yield on all funds above $250,000 in USDT or USDC and will receive repayments for their loans as market conditions allow.  In a bid to prevent another liquidity crisis, Vires.Finance will also adopt a dynamic limit system that will react to the platform’s conditions.  Insolvency issues have plagued many crypto lenders and exchanges over the past several months after the crash of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its sister token, LUNA, sent shock waves throughout the crypto ecosystem. The rattled investor confidence in the market triggered a sudden rush of withdrawals that blindsided trading platforms. Since then, major players such as Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital have filed for bankruptcy while many more platforms have struggled to avoid a similar fate.",NEUTRAL,LUNA | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | SPONSORED | USDC,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/02/lending-platform-viresfinance-gets-go-ahead-to-implement-repayment-plan-amid-liquidity-crisis,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42422614,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naNh,1659448800,Ankr Introduces Token-Staking Tool Kits for Yield-Hunting Communities,"Crypto infrastructure provider Ankr has released a line of software development kits (SDK) allowing developers to offer token staking and yield farming to users of their projects and platforms.  The SDKs will be offered on the Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Fantom networks at first. Once integrated, developers can allow users to stake tokens and earn rewards in return for a liquid staking token.  Liquid staking allows users to, in effect, earn a yield on their locked tokens by issuing new tokens with an equivalent value to the locked ones. This frees up capital and makes such products attractive to users. Products such as ether-staking service Lido hold $6.2 billion in locked value. Annualized yields offered by popular protocols, such as Compound and Aave, range from 3% to 10%.  More than $86 billion in cryptocurrency is locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects across multiple blockchains. To encourage users to participate, the protocols generate their own tokens, which are generally traded on the open market and have a total capitalization of tens of billions of dollars.  The staking tool kit connects to Ankr’s staking platform, which delegates tokens to validators and mints new liquid staking tokens that the stakers can claim for their personal wallets. They can then be used on other DeFi platforms to bolster earnings.  Ankr will charge developers a cut of staking fees for providing the SDKs, and the staking revenue that comes to Ankr staking will be partially shared with all Ankr token stakers once it becomes possible to stake Ankr in August.  Yield farming and value locked on DeFi projects peaked in November 2021, when some $230 billion was locked on various protocols. That’s fallen more than 62% amid a decline in the broader crypto market, DeFi Llama data shows.",POSITIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/ankr-introduces-token-staking-toolkits-for-yield-hunting-communities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5adbb53f5fcd97a018889b0c437bca916550b4a1-5096x3822.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422609,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naDh,1659448311,Bitcoin Brokerage River Financial Drops Fees for Recurring Trades,"River Financial, a San Francisco-based bitcoin technology and financial services company, has eliminated trading fees for recurring bitcoin (BTC) orders. The move comes less than two months after crypto-exchange Binance began rolling out zero-fee trading of the currency on its platform.  “I think [zero-fee bitcoin trading] is somewhat in reaction to the bear market, but I do think that it's inevitable,” River Financial co-founder and CEO Alexander Leishman told CoinDesk during an interview.  Financial institutions are increasingly offering bitcoin brokerage to allow clients to buy and sell the asset, and the increased competition is bringing in a new era of price margin compression for brokerages, Leishman said.  “The long-term trend is fees going to zero for bitcoin, and we’re really just leaning into it,” he continued.  River Financial’s zero-fee trading becomes effective one week after a customer sets up the first recurring BTC order, and there’s no order size limit. The underlying trading strategy is dollar cost averaging (DCA), where an investor purchases assets on a set schedule rather than in reaction to market movements.  Read more: Dollar Cost Averaging: Build Crypto Wealth on a Budget  “The benefit of DCA is removing your emotions from accumulating bitcoin. It’s easy to get caught up and stressed about price movements,” Leishman said.  Leishman added that the DCA side of the business was a starting point for River Financial’s zero-fee trading. The company currently feels its brokerage product provides value for one-time orders and justifies a trading fee. He noted that River Financial has lowered and simplified its fee structure across its products.  River Financial continues to roll out its River Mining program, unveiled last October. Customers can purchase bitcoin-mining machines and leave the setup and maintenance in River’s hands. The near-term road map also includes the Lightning Network, which allows users to send and receive BTC quickly and with lower fees by moving the transactions off-chain.  “We are spending a lot of time investing in our Lightning Network Infrastructure, which we think is going to be a huge opportunity down the road for various financial products to be built and delivered to our clients,” said Leishman.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/02/bitcoin-brokerage-river-financial-drops-fees-for-recurring-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36229f83a19e6cce31c5ba76c89fbc6619bd106c-3495x2621.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422602,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0na5h,1659447616,Deepak Chopra-Involved DAO Project Taps Coinshift for Treasury Management,"Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) tooling startup Coinshift has partnered with EarthFund, a crypto crowdfunding company that creates decentralized, philanthropic communities, to manage its ecosystem of treasuries.  EarthFund describes itself as a “DAO-as-a-service” platform that helps social cause organizers crowdfund using cryptocurrency as well as launch their own tokens.  As part of the tie-up, Coinshift will “secure and help manage the treasuries for all projects in the EarthFund ecosystem,” according to a press release.  EarthFund currently has two initiatives listed on its site, the most notable being “Mental Health and Wellbeing,” a project started by famed naturopath Deepak Chopra dedicated to funding mental health projects.  “We became interested in cryptocurrency and Web3 a few years ago as a platform for philanthropy and doing good,” Chopra told CoinDesk in a statement. “Our partnership with EarthFund allowed us to easily set up our own decentralized community with its own governance token.”  Mental Health and Wellbeing has so far built a treasury of $2 million between donations and the value of the “NeverAlone” token, according to a release.  Earthfund says it has over 235 projects waiting to be approved to join its ecosystem. The organization’s current focus is on its back end and accessibility, with partnerships like this one with Coinshift being targeted at its non-crypto-savvy users.  “As well as creating a platform that helps people make the world a better place, one of EarthFund’s core missions is to make crypto accessible and simple by placing a premium on user experience and usability,” Adam Boalt, co-founder of EarthFund, said in a statement.  The idea of using DAOs as a means of crowdfunding is far from novel, though the infrastructure around the concept remains early stage. The first major grassroots DAO funding effort came in November when a group of crypto enthusiasts pooled their money to try to buy one of the original copies of the U.S. Constitution. In February, UkraineDAO, a DAO started by the Russian art collective Pussy Riot, raised $3 million to donate to the Ukrainian military in its war against Russia.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on the fine on Tuesday.  “As its business grew, Robinhood Crypto failed to invest the proper resources and attention to develop and maintain a culture of compliance – a failure that resulted in significant violations of the Department’s anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations,” saidNYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris in a statement.  In addition to the fine, Robinhood will also be required to retain an independent consultant to evaluate its compliance with NYDFS regulations.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the fine against Robinhood is the NYDFS's first crypto enforcement action.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Robinhood's associate general counsel of litigation and regulatory enforcement, Cheryl Crumpton, wrote that ""we are pleased the settlement in principle reached last year and previously disclosed in our public filings is now final. We have made significant progress building industry-leading legal, compliance, and cybersecurity programs, and will continue to prioritize this work to best serve our customers.""  According to Robinhood's first-quarter results, crypto constituted about 25% of the company's transaction-based revenue.  Robinhood Crypto said last year that it expected to be fined $30 million by the New York regulator.

Additionally, Luno plans to move toward being licensed by the AMF, which no DASP has yet attained.  While registration allows a firm to provide services to French consumers, licensing provides benefits such as engaging in direct marketing.

Spurred by private-sector initiatives like the now defunct Facebook-backed Libra, regulators are looking at how to tighten up the clunky payments networks that can leave people waiting days for their money, but central banks would rather be in the driving seat themselves.  “The holy grail of cross-border payments is a solution allowing cross-border payments to be immediate, cheap, universal and settled in a secure settlement medium,” said the study, which was co-authored by Ulrich Bindseil, the ECB's director-general for market infrastructure and payments.  “Bitcoin is least credible” of the visions to achieve that, the report continued, and stablecoins – crypto assets that seek to tie their value to other assets such as fiat currencies – come in a close second given concerns over their market power.  The report says a bitcoin-based system wouldn’t work because of its “inherently inefficient” proof-of-work consensus mechanism, the “widespread” use for criminal purposes and the volatility of the asset. It also described the fervor of the cryptocurrency’s supporters as “quasi-religious.”  Read more: How Big Is Crypto Crime, Really?  There’s more mileage in linking together individual jurisdictions’ central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs), Bindseil wrote. although few CBDCs exist yet.  Those developing CBDCs – presumably including the ECB, which is considering a digital euro – should “discuss at a relatively early stage the related interoperability issues” to ensure they can work together with other currency zones, the study said.  They should also try to make existing domestic instant-payment systems operate with each other, despite questions over how to vet dirty money, and deal with counterparties who might default, it added.  Fabio Panetta, a member of the ECB’s executive board, has previously called crypto a “Ponzi scheme"" that regulators should be ""less tolerant"" toward.

The MAS is looking at potentially regulating reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, Shanmugaratnam said, referencing the recent collapse of terraUSD (UST) a stablecoin that lost its U.S. dollar peg in May.  ""The recent chain of high-profile failures in the cryptocurrency markets, starting from the collapse of the terraUSD and luna tokens, illustrates the high risks involved in investments in cryptocurrencies that MAS has warned the public about repeatedly,"" Shanmugaratnam said.  The central bank plans to consult the public on possible rules for stablecoins in the coming months, according to Shanmugaratnam.  Regulators around the world, including those in major economies like the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S., are working to set up regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, particularly ones that are at risk of hurting the stability of broader financial systems.  Although Shanmugaratnam said that the spillover from the crypto market crash to mainstream financial systems is limited and that banks in Singapore have ""insignificant exposures"" to crypto, MAS officials have vowed to crack down on crypto firms behaving badly in the country.

Cardano's ADA joins Ethereum's ETH, Internet Computer's ICP and Tezos' YTZ in the firm's staking offerings, which are integrated with its banking platform.  Like Ethereum, Cardano offers smart contract functionality with the hope of making the tokens more accessible so that any anyone can use them to create decentralized applications.  Staking is the process by which users of a blockchain lock up – or ""stake"" – their coins in order to participate in running a network. Stakers then receive rewards calculated in percentage yields. In this way, it works very much like putting fiat money into a savings account, only with generally much higher yields.  Sygnum is aiming to offer that within the framework of a regulated financial services firm, with institutional-grade security.  In June, the bank started offering custody and trading across a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens. DeFi refers to financial activities carried out on a blockchain without third-party intervention.

In addition to that, we will touch briefly on the specifics of each implementation. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency protected by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to forge or double-spend. Blockchain is a distributed ledger enforced by a distant network of computers that underpins many cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and litecoin. One of the distinguishing characteristics of cryptocurrencies is their decentralization, which makes them potentially impervious to government intervention and manipulation. As the decentralized ledger that underpins bitcoin transactions, blockchain was originally presented to the public in 2008. Since then, the technology has taken on a life of its own, and there has been continued interest in it from a variety of sources. Research and implementation of blockchain technology are being conducted by businesses, governments and other organizations to address a wide range of challenges, the vast majority of which have nothing to do with virtual currencies. Over a decentralized network, blockchain can provide security, traceability, immutability and transparency. Because of this, it is ideally suited for use cases that can no longer be supported by conventional infrastructure.

42422611,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naJh,1659438990,Aave Wallet Activity Reaches 2022 High on GHO Stablecoin Decision,"User activity on lending protocol Aave rose to a 2022 high ahead of the launch of its yield-generating stablecoin, GHO, while remaining below levels reached last year spurred by growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Active addresses – or wallets that made transactions – on Aave climbed above 1,860 last week, IntoTheBlock data shows. The heightened activity likely came as users voted on a motion to introduce GHO.  The proposal was passed by the community over the weekend. The token will be released soon and will allow users to mint the tokens against a diversified set of cryptocurrencies.  On-chain activity on Aave has been increasing since the proposal, IntoTheBlock said in a tweet. Similar activity was previously seen in the last week of March, data shows.  The protocol’s native aave (AAVE) tokens experienced volatile trading during the past week, rising from $77 last Tuesday to over $105 over the weekend before dropping back to about $90 at writing time, CoinGecko data shows.  GHO will work in a similar way to existing algorithmic stablecoins, which mint exactly $1 worth of tokens when users provide $1 worth of cryptocurrency collateral. Users, however, will continue to earn interest on the supplied collateral.  According to the now-passed proposal, GHO will send all the interest received on loans to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), generating revenue for the community and allowing the DAO to bolster its treasury for funding future products or tools. Such factors have generated community interest in the GHO token.  Last year, as many as 6,200 wallets were active in February and transactions involving Aave touched a record 1.1 million daily figure in May. The number of transactions slumped to as few as 96,000 a day earlier this year amid a market-wide price decline, IntoTheBlock data shows.",POSITIVE,AAVE,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/aave-wallet-activity-reaches-2022-high-on-gho-stablecoin-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25c2518cf21b37ae3fb7a3d68043dec056e0c87d-4501x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cohen, founder of hedge fund Point72 Asset Management, was set to invest in Radkl in a personal capacity, continuing his forays into crypto that began in 2018.

Key Technical Points: The SAND prices are down by 3.39% in the last 24 hours. The price action shows a support trendline struggling to keep the uptrend in motion. The 24-hour trading volume of Sandbox is $364 million, indicating a hike of 4.55%. Past Performance of SAND As warned in our previous analysis, the SAND prices fail to exceed the overhead resistance of $1.45, leading to a bearish retracement to the 50-day SMA. Currently, the price movement is within the consolidation range but faces opposition from the 100 SMA, resulting in multiple higher price rejection candles.

Word-of-mouth promotion seemed to have worked well for these. What are Play-to-Earn games in the true sense?

Key Technical Points: The GALA prices reach the $0.070 mark. The price action shows a bullish breakout of the falling channel pattern. The 24-hour trading volume of Gala Games is $776 million, indicating a hike of 73%. Past Performance of GALA As teased in our previous analysis, the GALA prices avoid a downfall below the psychological mark of $0.050 and display an early bullish reversal. The bullish reversal breaks about the resistance trend line of the falling channel and hits the overhead resistance of the $0.070 supply zone. After that, however, the buyers lose trend control due to excessive supply at $0.070, resulting in a retracement that may soon test the broken resistance trendline.

42422618,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naRh,1659430126,"Bitcoin, Ether Slump as US House Speaker Pelosi's Taiwan Trip Weakens Risk Sentiment","The crypto market wilted on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions zapped investor risk appetite and excitement around Ethereum's Merge began to deflate.  At 07:00 UTC, bitcoin (BTC) traded at $22,870, down 1.8% on a 24-hour basis. While Ethereum's ether (ETH) nursed a 5% loss at $1,586, alternative coins FIL, EOS and ICP each fell by at least 10%. Total market capitalization was down 3% at $1.09 trillion, according to CoinDesk data.  Traditional markets were equally risk averse, with the dollar gaining ground against major fiat currencies except the yen, alongside losses in the equity markets. The futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, hinting at a downbeat start on Wall Street.  The source of market unease was Beijing's warning to the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi against visiting Taiwan – a self-ruled island claimed by China – during her tour of four Asian countries that began on Monday. As House Speaker, Pelosi (D-Calif.) is third in line for the U.S. presidency after incumbent Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, making her an important U.S. official.  ""There will be serious consequences if she insists on making the visit,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian warned. ""We are fully prepared for any eventuality. The People's Liberation Army [PLA] will never sit by idly. China will take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.""  Per local media in Taiwan, Pelosi was rumored to arrive at Taipei Songshan Airport on Tuesday at 10:20 p.m. local time (14:20 UTC).  ""We might see [ether falling to] $1,500 today, with Nancy Pelosi stopping over in Taiwan,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management (IDEG), said in an email. Geopolitical tensions are hard to predict and often trigger knee-jerk reactions in risk assets. While markets were down, losses were moderate, perhaps on belief that central banks would slow down or abandon tightening if the geopolitical tensions escalate.  Thielen cited the fading enthusiasm about the Ethereum Merge as another catalyst for the expected price drop in ether and the broader market. Merge, the supposedly bullish upgrade, combining Ethereum's current proof-of-work blockchain with a proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain, is projected to happen in September. Ether picked up a strong bid, lifting the battered crypto market higher after Ethereum developer Time Beiko announced September as a tentative date on July 14.  ""ETH moves appear to lose momentum and google trends indicate that 'searches' for Ethereum merge have flattened out. So the positive newsflow is taking a backseat,"" Thielen said.  Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 71 for the worldwide search query ""Ethereum Merge"" run over the week ended July 31. That's significantly lower than the peak value of 100 observed during the preceding week.  Google Trends provides a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.  While the so-called merge trade powered a double-digit recovery in both ether and broader market capitalization last month, the move supposedly lacked fundamental support – yet another reason for bulls to be cautious.  ""During the last 1 month, ETH price [jumped] +68% while [Ethereum's] total revenue [fell] -47% (minus !), the higher market cap doesn't justify the negative growth in revenue,"" Thielen noted.  From a technical analysis standpoint, both ether and bitcoin were losing ground owing to overbought conditions and faced the risk of a more profound decline.  ""Our short-term [bitcoin] indicators are mixed, but a greater loss of short-term momentum would support a retest of support (~$18,300-$19,500), below which secondary support is near $13,900,"" Katie Stockton, a chartered market technician and founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a weekly analysis published Monday. ""Intermediate- and long-term momentum indicators are still pointing lower, increasing risk of another significant downdraft in the months ahead.""  Stockton mentioned $25,000 in bitcoin and $1,733 in ether as levels to beat to revive the bullish bias.

A blog post published today by the firm said, &apos;Clients can create a wallet, decide how much to stake, and initiate staking from the ETH asset page on their Coinbase Prime account.&apos; Staking Lets Investors Earn a Yield on Cryptocurrencies Staking enables investors to commit their cryptocurrencies to a pool of assets and receive a return on their investment, supporting the liquidity and operation of a blockchain ecosystem. Investors can make up to a 20% yearly income on some platforms, which is frequently equated to a high-yield savings account. However, the procedure is not without risks.

Investors lost billions of dollars earlier this year as custodians like Voyager and Celsius filed for bankruptcy in response to TerraUSD&apos;s demise.

42422610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naHh,1659411319,Crypto Bridge Nomad Drained of Nearly $200M in Exploit,"The cross-chain token bridge Nomad was exploited Monday, with attackers draining the protocol of virtually all of its funds. The total value of cryptocurrency lost to the attack totaled near $200 million.  Nomad, like other cross-chain bridges, allows users to send and receive tokens between different blockchains. Monday’s attack is the latest in a string of highly publicized incidents which have drawn the security of cross-chain bridges into question.  The Nomad team acknowledged the exploit in a statement to CoinDesk. ""An investigation is ongoing and leading firms for blockchain intelligence and forensics have been retained,"" the team said. ""We have notified law enforcement and are working around the clock to address the situation and provide timely updates. Our goal is to identify the accounts involved and to trace and recover the funds.""  What happened?  Bridges typically work by locking up tokens in a smart contract on one chain and then reissuing those tokens in “wrapped” form on another chain.  If the smart contract where tokens are initially deposited gets sabotaged – as happened in Nomad’s case – the wrapped tokens no longer have any backing, which can render them worthless.  On Twitter, @samczsun, a researcher at crypto investment firm Paradigm, explained that a recent update to one of Nomad’s smart contracts made it easy for users to spoof transactions. This meant users were able to withdraw money from the Nomad bridge that didn’t actually belong to them.  Unlike some bridge attacks, where a single culprit is behind the entire exploit, the Nomad attack was a free for all.  “... [Y]ou didn't need to know about Solidity or Merkle Trees or anything like that. All you had to do was find a transaction that worked, find/replace the other person's address with yours, and then re-broadcast it,” @samczsun explained.  Nomad: A 'secure' alternative?  Bridge attacks have become more frequent in recent months as crypto users have demonstrated an increased appetite for swapping assets between different blockchains.  While cross-chain bridges have made it possible for upstart blockchains to proliferate, bridge failures can be devastating for smaller chains that rely on them for a large amount of their total liquidity.  Evmos, one of the newer blockchains serviced by Nomad, tweeted that it would be “brainstorming community solutions” to the Nomad attack given that it “significantly impacts initial Evmos [total value locked].”  The largest decentralized finance (DeFi) attack in history, April’s Ronin bridge attack, saw over $600 million worth of crypto siphoned out of the bridge that powers the blockchain-based game Axie Infinity.  Just a few months before that, over $300 million was drained from the Wormhole bridge, wreaking havoc across the Solana blockchain community and the wider decentralized finance ecosystem.  Nomad sold investors on the vision that it would be fundamentally more secure than alternative platforms.  Just last week, it revealed that crypto heavyweights Coinbase Ventures and OpenSea were among those that participated in an April seed round that valued the company at $225 million.

42422598,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nZxh,1659407866,Marathon Doubles Loan Borrowing Capacity to $200M as Mining Rigs Sit Idle,"Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) refinanced an existing $100 million line of credit from Silvergate Bank (SI) and added another one of the same size from the same lender, the miner said Monday, despite having thousands of bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs sitting idle.  Marathon's ability to refinance stands out because crypto prices have fallen so much this year, putting the company and other bitcoin miners on shakier financial ground. The lending market has also dramatically cooled down as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates. The Silvergate credit line gives Marathon flexibility to navigate the market volatility.  Marathon noted on Monday that it hadn't drawn any of the initial Silvergate credit line, which was set to expire in October. The two facilities are secured by bitcoin and will expire in June 2024. The new term loan includes a delayed draw facility, meaning Marathon can draw $50 million at the time of closing and another $50 million 270 days after closing, the press release said. The term loan comes with a variable interest rate, which is currently set at 7.25%, the firm said.  When Marathon announced its initial revolving credit facility from Silvergate in October 2021, its active fleet of miners stood at 25,272. At the end of June, it counted only 6,300 active miners, according to its June operational update.  The firm has 29,640 bitcoin mining rigs waiting energization in in West Texas, it said in the update. This is largely because hosting firm Compute North's energy provider is waiting for federal regulators to approve its tax-exempt status, Marathon said. Compute North hosted about 20,000 of Marathon's machines as of the end of June and is set to host 68,000 by the end of Q3. About 4,200 of these rigs were scheduled for activation on April 17, according to a previous press release.  However, Marathon said in July that it secured around 254 megawatts (MW) in new hosting agreements, which could increase up to 324 MW. That includes 200 MW, or about 66,000 mining rigs, signed with Applied Blockchain for sites in Texas and North Dakota. Marathon ""believes it has now secured ample hosting arrangements to support the Company’s previously stated goal of approximately 23.3 exahashes per second (“EH/s”)"" of bitcoin mining computing power in 2023, the firm said.  In addition to the Texas energization delay, about 75% of Marathon's active fleet was left without power after a storm damaged its energy supplier in Hardin, Montana, in June. The approximately 30,000 miners in Hardin were mostly undamaged, the company said.  ""The ground crew at Hardin continues to make progress as they work to bring the power plant and our miners back online in a reduced capacity,"" the firm said in its June update.  Asked about updates on Texas and Montana on Monday evening, a Marathon Digital Holdings spokesperson pointed to the company's upcoming second-quarter earnings and call, set to take place on Aug. 8. The firm “may have additional information to share at that time,” the spokesperson said.  Marathon also stands out among the industry as it has yet to sell any of its bitcoin holdings. Other mining firms have converted their mined bitcoin to U.S. dollars to fund operations and pay off loans.  Last week at the Mining Disrupt conference in Miami, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel revealed an analysis that showed miners stand to benefit in the long term from selling half of their mined bitcoin, compared to ""hodling"" all of their production or selling daily.
