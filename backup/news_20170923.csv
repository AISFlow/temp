42427806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vdh,1506164459,Welcome to Bitcoin Country: Silk Road and the Lost Threads of Agorism,"Dr Paul Ennis is a research assistant at the Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organisation at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.  In this opinion piece, Ennis takes a dive into the kinds of sub-cultures bitcoin and cryptocurrencies enable, tracing their origins in libertarianism – and beyond.      Not everything is tameable – that's a truism that might apply to bitcoin above all.  Recently, researchers from City University and Stockholm University introduced the concept of the ""bandit organization,"" calling it ""a form of association or 'band' (frequently led by a charismatic individual) that occupies a space outside national and/or international credibility but inside the everyday practical and moral organization of specific audiences.""  Bitcoin, as we all intuitively seem to sense, is not quite a community in any usual sense.  For this reason, I've started to describe it as a land of bandits, ""Bitcoin Country,"" a term that denotes a semi-autonomous lawless region full of bandits, some noble, some not, and most certainly not cohesive.  Too formless to be a country, too amorphous to be a company, you can think of Bitcoin Country as a kind of digitally decentralized frontier.  The outlaws  Historian Eric Hobsbawm provided an early model of outlaws as social bandits that, although often violent, were celebrated by the local community as heroic or defiant.  In this way, the origin story of bitcoin is deliciously outlaw, essentially one of the individual who, through an amazing feat, harangues the evil king. It's all the better if the king has devolved into vice and avarice to the point of financial ruin.  The other, slightly more contentious hero, operated on the edge of the edge, is the black market within the black market, the bayous of Bitcoin Country.  ""The fascists always use the narrative of 'We are the white knights in shining armor protecting against the threats. We come here and we move out the dark with pure whiteness.' That's a false narrative because there is corruption in those castles. The real base of power lies with us. We are the darkness.""  In the above quote, anarchist bitcoin developer Amir Taaki sets out, in the context of a documentary about the original darknet marketplace, Silk Road, a common theme within digital libertarian culture: the establishment, broadly construed, is corrupt.  Not just corrupt, its corruptness is clouded in ""whiteness,"" traditional forms of organizational legitimacy, and it uses narratives of fear to ensure we place our trust in them.  We need police to stop crime, we need armies to stop invaders and intelligence services to stop terrorists. Taaki's rhetoric is hyperbolic, but it contains, implicitly, two important insights. The first is that the organizational legitimacy of central authorities is connected to our placing our trust in them in exchange for protection from threats (Taaki calls this ""babysitting"" a little later in the speech).  The second, a cypherpunk view, is that a powerful response to this situation, in the context of the digital world, is the creation of technological systems that subvert this power relation, ""the real base of power lies with us.""  Radical dimension  These systems Taaki discusses would strive to be trustless, having no central authority and, strikingly, they would not require legitimacy. It is crucial to remember that digital libertarians do not propose a counter-legitimacy belonging to them.  They do not claim to be the truly legitimate position. Rather they revel in being ""the darkness.""  Their ideal systems necessitate no ""babysitters,"" no trusted third party, no ""legitimacy"" in any traditional sense. Given such an anarchic spirit, it is no surprise that digital libertarians are drawn toward those areas deemed off-limits by authority, such as the shadow economy.  Silk Road was never just an exercise in deviant entrepreneurship, but was ""presented as a means to dismantle the state."" University professor David Golumbia notes that in the wider bitcoin discourse ""the idea that government itself is inherently evil"" appears with ""particular force.""  It was a form of activism involving a political ""prefiguration"" that sustained the community.  Prefiguration  is a concept found in the left anarchist and autonomist Marxist traditions and developed in relation to cryptomarkets. Like most forms of political radicalism, libertarianism relies on envisioning a world that does not yet exist. Aware that this is the case, radical activists often must discover methods that justify their faith in the project.  For the anarchist and autonomist traditions, this tension has emerged quite visibly in movements such as Occupy Wall Street.  As Mathijs van de Sande explains, prefigurative politics need to be seen in terms of the ever-evolving act of bringing into being the world its adherents wish to see, but without any mainstream engagement. Crucial to prefiguration is a subtle inversion within leftist thinking.  In traditional Marxism, the relation to the state is directly antagonistic; one is against the state.  In the anarchist and autonomist view, this becomes inverted. There, to borrow from the Spanish Indignados, ""We are not against the system. The system is against us.""  This redefines the nature of defiance as a focus on how best one can build new worlds despite state ""interference."" It manifests as a process of instantiation of abstract ideals to come through practices occurring in the here and now.  The overriding aim is to act ""as if one is already free.""  Exit over voice  The state is to be escaped rather than replaced. In other words, ""exit over voice.""  According to economist Albert Hirschman, the two options open to all dissatisfied members of an organization are exit or voice. One can either exit the organization or voice dissatisfaction.  Libertarians are infamous for their preference for exit or, at least, the option of exit and, as journalist Brian Doherty charts, there have been many attempts to escape what they perceive as the ultimate closure of options, the state.  The concept of exit has even led to attempts to establish entirely new countries, known as micro-nations, their failures documented in an obscure libertarian classic ""How to Start Your Country."" Arguably the most successful forms of exit have occurred by simply moving out to sea, as encapsulated in our romantic vision of anarchistic pirates, but also in the most successful micro-nation of all time, the Principality of Sealand, an offshore oil platform located not far from the coast of Suffolk, England.  The Dread Pirate Roberts name evokes this pirate outlaw status quite explicitly (Ross Ulbrich, who ran Silk Road under that name, even notes this in discussion with Variety Jones). He had not just prefigured the world his community wanted to see, but had generated a space, a micro-nation located off the coast of the clearnet, where the law (seemingly) no longer applied.  In effect, what Ulbricht achieved was a quite unique marriage of high-minded digital libertarian ideals with the routine process of buying and selling narcotics.  For most participants, their engagement with Silk Road operationalized a sense of freedom to consume their drug of choice in the context of doing no harm to others, aligning participants with the cyber-libertarian philosophy of DPR.  Konkin's influence  In more formal terms, organizational legitimacy on the Silk Road was ensured by reimagining the ""mundane"" act of buying and selling narcotics as an act of liberty.  For Ulbricht, the success of Silk Road was precisely in line with the teachings of his most important intellectual influence, Samuel Edward Konkin III. A relatively obscure figure, Konkin developed a strand of libertarianism known as agorism in the early 1970s. In his exceptionally detailed and thorough-going history of American libertarianism, Doherty references Konkin a mere five times and not once in any especially important manner.  Indeed, Konkin seems to have ""fallen"" out of the tradition, but this is consistent with his rejection of the Libertarian Party as inherently paradoxical, preferring instead to promote black market activism where one might ""commit civil disobedience profitably."" It is not clear how Ulbricht first came across Konkin, but perhaps there was something of the kindred spirit to them, both had studied chemistry to an advanced degree.  Konkin proposed a dual course to bringing agorism into being: (1) a theoretical position known as ""counter-establishment economics,"" or ""counter-economics"" for short, and (2) the practical dimension of ""counter-economic activity."" For Konkin only a small handful understand agorism, in the theoretical sense, but this does not mean that counter-economic activity does not occur.  Konkin was keen to celebrate the unconscious agorists that populate our world: tax-dodgers, black market operators, prostitutes and so on. This is where Konkin can be considered explicitly radical.  The creation of black markets was for Konkin an agorist act where small ""pockets"" of outlaw culture create markets more efficient than the state can provide. The more efficient these pockets the more people in the white economy will turn to agorism.  Konkin died in 2004, but he had foreseen, as early as the middle of the 1980s, that the internet opened up agorist possibilities. His remarks are worth quoting in full, given his influence upon Ulbricht:  ""The internet explosion has led the American State – for now, at any rate – to throw up its tentacles at regulation of the information industry. Every legislative session, however, brings up new attempts to tax and control the World Wide Web. But consider this well: should the counter-economy lick the information problem, it would virtually eliminate the risk it incurs under the State's threat. That is, if you can advertise your products, reach your consumers and accept payment (a form of information), all outside the detection capabilities of the State, what enforcement of control would be left?'""  This is, to be direct, quite simply what Silk Road was.  Even more prescient is that Konkin recognized the importance of encryption around the same time.  Noting that encryption meant the state ""cannot reach the invoices, inventory lists, accounts and so on of the Counter-Economist,"" Konkin's proto-conception of the cryptomarket means he arrived at the idea before even the cypherpunks.

42427800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vbh,1506160842,Better in Byzantium? Ethereum Takes Baby Steps Toward a Privacy Boost,"Ethereum users may soon be getting a much-needed privacy boost.  Long a shortcoming for all public blockchain networks, the world's second-largest blockchain is nonetheless aiming for big improvements in its upcoming Byzantium release. For most buy-and-hold users, these limitations might not be apparent, but that's not to say there aren't potential implications that could affect the wide variety of users the network is trying to attract.  As an example, the software upgrade comes at a time when regulation is putting a strain on the network – at least one government has already taken aim against what has emerged in 2017 as its biggest use case. In the past month, China issued not only an all-out ban on ICOs, but ordered exchanges (including those that buy and sell ether) to hand customer data to the authorities.  This added attention is just one of the things that has shone a light on the limitations of the network. Currently, every transaction is permanently visible on the ethereum blockchain, meaning that investments made by individuals – including those that might be illegal – can be widely observed. Not quite a bug and not quite a feature, this availability of user information is still something that many developers have set about to correct.  Complicating matters, however, is that ethereum hasn't been known for its privacy features to date.  While zcash helped pioneer the use of zk-snarks and monero popularized ring signatures and stealth addresses, ethereum has perhaps struggled to find a similar value-add when it comes to anonymity.  But the upcoming Byzantium hard fork, currently expected to occur in October, will introduce two new cryptographic procedures which should eventually pave the way for increased privacy.  Ethereum's first major upgrade since 2016, Byzantium is actually one-half of a much larger upgrade designed to enhance the usability of the platform, named Metropolis. It will also be the first major technical upgrade since the network has been valued in the billions, a development that could add drama to the proceedings.  Looking ahead, the second part of Metropolis, Constantipole, has been postponed indefinitely, meaning users will have to wait before they can enjoy maximum privacy on the platform.  Still, that’s not to say there aren’t substantial efforts toward that goal.  Where are we now?  Privacy on ethereum is a notoriously complex endeavor, as it contradicts some basic methods of how a blockchain functions.  Transparency on a blockchain is vital such that it protects its users from the risk of double spending, which is when a malicious user sends the same coin to two different places at once. This risk is resolved by rendering the details of each transaction visible and storing them in a widely distributed ledger.  As this procedure is fundamental to the technology, rewriting it requires high-level mathematics which have never before been attempted.  As such, ethereum's developers are taking that attempt seriously and are reaching out to peers in other blockchain platforms for new ideas and features. For example, ethereum's team has been working together with the privacy-centric currency zcash on zk-snarks, which could make it possible for ethereum users to make their transactions more private.  By using that technology, a statement can be verified without requiring any information to be revealed beyond its validity. As an encryption method, zk-snarks work by translating what you want to prove into an equivalent form – without anyone knowing the solution to the algebraic equations that produced it.  Notably, the upcoming Byzantium hard fork introduces new elliptic curve primitives and a pairing function for a specific curve which will make the cryptography possible and toughen the security of a zk-snark computation. The larger the curve, the more secure it is, but it does bring higher costs for each operation.  As a result, these heavy mathematical procedures are now far too expensive to run on the ethereum platform.  In principle, prior to Byzantium, a zk-snark could be completed by the ethereum virtual machine, but it would be too expensive to fit inside a single block. However, the Byzantium hard fork will introduce a gas-subsidized pairing check that makes a zk-snark less costly to compute. If you're unsure, ""gas"" is a unit used to measure the computational effort that goes into a transaction and is used to calculate fees.  What needs to be done?  Due to this new feature, the first zk-snark transaction was verified on the Byzantium testnet earlier this week. The transaction, which is viewable on the test network here, cost a total of 1,933,895 gas. To put this in some context – a non-private transaction currently costs far less, around 21,000 gas.  Still, aside from this costliness, and beyond the verification itself, there's nothing in ethereum that today can support the tech.  As explained by ethereum's lead zk-snark researcher, Christian Reitwiessner, the ""missing piece"" is the part of the system that would communicate with the ethereum virtual machine, which translates instructions and relays them to network nodes.  ""We need practical implementations of all the other components of a zk-snark system (apart from the verification),"" he told CoinDesk.  Some of these features might be figured out soon. For example, work needs to be done to translate a computational task from source code into the form required by a zk-snark. Reitwiessner said this is currently in heavy development, and will likely be released by the ethereum developer conference in November.  However, other milestones still need extensive research before they can be reached.  At present, regardless of whether an ether transaction is private, it will always be visible to the person who pays for the gas.  Eventually, new features released in the second ethereum upgrade, Constantinople, will aim to provide a newly flexible ether wallet, allowing users the option to pay for gas in tokens instead of ether. According to Reitwiessner: ""This could include paying for gas with tokens which might be zk-SNARK tokens.""  Postponing this feature until Constantinople also gives ethereum developers some time to tease out other complex challenges.  For one, ethereum must counter a security problem within zk-snark tech itself, known as the trusted setup. When zcash launched its zk-snark-powered currency back in October 2016, it corresponded with an elaborate performance, whereby each member of the z-cash development team set fire to the computers they had used to bring z-cash to life.  This was to prove that there was no backdoor into the technology that could potentially allow developers the ability to manipulate the network. The catch now is that ethereum must develop something equivalent to this, but one that can scale to thousands of participants.  Alongside this, solutions need to be developed so that mathematical proofs are generated alongside a zk-snark. And, more programming is needed to establish the possibility of zk-snarks occurring off the blockchain.  In light of this, it could be that a smoother alternative to zk-snarks is developed in the meantime.  Reitwiessner hinted at this, adding:  ""Furthermore, we are not tied to a specific zk-snark or even zk-snarks themselves.""  As such, his statements hint that, for ethereum, the privacy conversation is only just beginning.
