42385870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmBv,1612308222,Why a GameStop-Inspired Mania Is Unlikely in China’s Stock Market,"Could GameStop-style short-selling speculation show up in China’s stock market?      Last week’s market frenzy in the U.S. may have inspired China’s crypto community to make more bets on dogecoin (DOGE) and bitcoin (BTC), but even the boldest traders are unlikely to try stirring up that kind of short-selling speculation in Chinese stocks.      “The Chinese financial regulators are closely monitoring who are trading what in the Chinese stock market. Retail investors involved in large-scale malicious shorting could be put in jail,” said Jason Wu, CEO of crypto-lending firm DeFiner.      “The market cap of the crypto market in China is extremely small compared to the Chinese stock market, so all the authorities’ eyes are on the disruptors of the stock market,” Wu added.      The China Security Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the top financial watchdog in the country, has been closely monitoring short-selling activities since a massive crash in 2015.      On the Shanghai exchange, one-third of the value of A shares, which are stock shares of mainland China-based public companies, was wiped out within a month back then, and more than half of the listed companies filed for a trading halt to prevent further losses.      While the cause of the historic drop remains unclear, some of the most prominent economists blamed short-sellers for the crisis. Short sellers bet a stock they sell will drop in price.      “It is the margin trading and short-selling that killed the bull market before the [2015] market crash,” Shuwei Liu, researcher at the Finance Research Institute of Central University of Finance and Economics, said in a July 7, 2015, op-ed titled, “Chinese Stock Short Shellers Should Be Heavily Punished.”      “The A shares are still an emerging market. The CSRC does not have the ability to get the leverage tools under control,” Liu wrote then. “Under these conditions, we are giving the illegal A shares short-sellers a weapon by opening up short-selling.” The CSRC allowed the margin trading and short-selling system in March 2010.      The central bank accused foreign financial institutions of market manipulation by shorting large quantities of Chinese stocks, implying the U.S investment bank Morgan Stanley caused some of the troubles in the Chinese stock market.      “While Chinese retail investors could technically carry out shorting stocks on a small scale, there is no way the financial regulators would let anything like the GameStop short squeeze happen to the Chinese stock market,” DeFiner’s Wu said.      It would be logistically challenging for Chinese retail investors to organize a GameStop campaign. A key player in the GameStop story is the social media platform Reddit, where anonymous users can meet and discuss shorting strategies on undervalued stocks.      The majority of 177 million Chinese retail investors, who hold 28.6% of the total Chinese stock market value, communicate with each other in groups on domestic social media platforms like WeChat, QQ or Weibo, where moderators can censor “illegal content” on the platforms.      “Unlike many tech-savvy crypto traders, many retail stock investors do not have VPN or any other kind of access to encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram or Signal,” Wu said. “I can’t imagine a large group of people would be allowed to talk about shorting stocks on a public forum such as Zhihu,” the Chinese answer to Reddit.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,ASIA | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/02/why-a-gamestop-inspired-mania-is-unlikely-in-chinas-stock-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f78775e5c262b9c09323a73cfe09a5ae5ff9addb-1200x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOmSH,1612302806,"Crypto Long & Short: GameStop, Dogecoin y un nuevo paradigma de mercado","Es difícil ser justo con el significado e importancia que ha tenido el escándalo de Reddit-Robinhood-GameStop ocurrido la semana pasada.      Con esto no quiero decir que no haya sido sobreestimado en algunos lugares. He oído comparaciones con los disturbios del Capitolio. Y no es lo mismo: aquello se trató de una sedición; esto es rebelión, algo muy diferente. He visto peticiones para que los reguladores intervinieran y cerraran las plataformas de trading minorista, a pesar de que no haya sido clarificado si un delito fue cometido. Y he leído críticas que trataron a los líderes de este movimiento como “inadaptados”. Esa condescendencia es en sí misma parte del problema.      Los protagonistas no son unos inadaptados: son inversores minoristas que hacen uso de su fuerza colectiva, la misma que el “establishment” alimentó.    Estás leyendo Crypto Long & Short, un newsletter en inglés que analiza detalladamente las tendencias de los mercados de criptomonedas. Escrito por la jefa de investigación de CoinDesk, Noelle Acheson, se publica todos los domingos y ofrece un resumen de la semana —con ideas y análisis— desde el punto de vista de un inversor profesional. Puedes suscribirte aquí.    Se les animó a invertir sus ahorros en el mercado de acciones, se les ofrecieron aplicaciones móviles que lo facilitaban. Se les bombardeó con consejos e ideas desde los medios de comunicación dominantes. Se les dio dinero para gastar. Y los bajos rendimientos les impulsaron a subir la curva de riesgo.    To read this in English, click here.  Abriendo camino    Aunque la atención se ha centrado en un puñado de acciones que han registrado retornos astronómicos por el entusiasmo de inversores minoristas, el origen y el resultado —sea el que sea— de este fenómeno están estrechamente relacionados con los mercados de criptomonedas.      No pretendemos quitarle el protagonismo a nadie. El canal de WallStreetBets que movilizó a las masas y lideró la avanzada no dio la bienvenida a los traders de criptomonedas. Sus motivaciones no son la descentralización ni el acceso justo, sino el malestar y el disfrute de su nuevo poder.      El enojo es profundo. La posición corta del 139% contra GameStop reveló una fuerte participación de los fondos de cobertura —en inglés, hedge funds—, pero se trataba de una consecuencia, no una causa. Tal rebelión parece una expresión de frustración reprimida ante las reglas sesgadas de los mercados de capitales que afianzan el poder de una “élite”, sumada al resentimiento residual por los rescates de 2008, la falta de transparencia del mercado y una larga lista de agravios generacionales. Una dinámica similar de “viejo” contra “nuevo” que también impulsa a los mercados de criptomonedas.      Muchos de nosotros nos sentimos atraídos por bitcoin debido a nuestra preocupación por el impacto que decisiones en defensa de intereses concentrados tienen en nuestra prosperidad. Otros se han sentido atraídos ante la concepción de las finanzas descentralizadas como antídoto contra el daño potencial del poder consolidado. Y existe un fuerte voto a favor de la soberanía financiera y la libertad comercial.      Todos nosotros advertimos cómo las finanzas tradicionales rechazaron inicialmente la idea de que un token programable pudiera tener valor o que el código pudiera producir rendimientos. El éxito de los mercados de criptomonedas ha obligado a gran parte de la “vieja guardia” a reconocer gradualmente que las cosas están cambiando. Los acontecimientos de la semana pasada, sin duda, harán que este mensaje sea entendido.      Aún hay más: las mismas plataformas que se vendían a sí mismas como democratizadoras de las finanzas finalmente restringieron el acceso de usuarios a ciertas operaciones durante la semana pasada, mientras el mercado se encontraba en plena actividad. ¿Podría existir una llamada de atención más notoria sobre las vulnerabilidades de la infraestructura actual del mercado? Google Trends muestra que las búsquedas de “defi” (NdT: abreviatura en inglés del término ‘finanzas descentralizadas’) están aumentando.      Existe el riesgo de que la nueva administración de Biden en Estados Unidos utilice la rebelión de los inversores minoristas como excusa para aplicar una sobrerregulación. Sin embargo, la opinión pública parece estar con los rebeldes, algo de lo que los legisladores están al tanto (no recuerdo haber visto antes al senador republicano de Texas Ted Cruz de acuerdo con la representante demócrata de Nueva York Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).      Por su parte, la nominación de Gary Gensler — conocedor y en general a favor de los mercados de criptomonedas — para el puesto de presidente de la Comisión de Valores de Estados Unidos podría significar el comienzo de una reforma estructural en pos de un acceso más “democrático”.      Esto también podría modificar la concepción que inversores tienen sobre algunas de las cualidades subyacentes de activos que funcionan en blockchain y sus mercados. Es cierto que el acceso a estos mercados presenta algunos obstáculos, como la jurisdicción y la familiaridad con la tecnología. No obstante, la libertad de elección para los inversores y la experiencia de los usuarios nunca han sido mejores; y continuarán desarrollándose, con algunos grandes actores de la infraestructura de mercado buscando salir a bolsa durante este año.    Volver a las bases    Tras los eventos de la semana pasada no solo se volverá a examinar la estructura del mercado, sino también su comprensión necesitará ser replanteada. Esto también se encuentra en estrecha relación con las criptomonedas.      A lo largo de la semana pasada he perdido la cuenta del número de comentaristas que se han mofado acerca de los “fundamentals” y de cómo el precio no debería moverse en gran manera dado que la situación de GameStop (GME) no ha cambiado. Se equivocan: ya sea que las acciones estén sobrevaloradas o no (no tengo opinión al respecto), la situación de la empresa y sus fundamentos sí han cambiado.      En primer lugar, se debe tomar en cuenta la publicidad masiva. Dos: además de los posibles ingresos futuros por la venta de juegos, probablemente exista una oportunidad de merchandising mediante la venta de tazas y horquillas de marca. Y, en tercer lugar, hay un movimiento de apoyo al precio de las acciones, sólo que esto no se considera tradicionalmente relevante a la hora de evaluar activos. Debería serlo.      Investopedia define a los fundamentals del negocio como la “información sobre rentabilidad, ingresos, activos, pasivos y potencial de crecimiento”. Yo añadiría a esa lista “el apoyo del público”. Sí, los críticos de esta idea dirán que el sentimiento es efímero, difícil de ser estimado y, por tanto, imposible de ser valorado, mientras que los fundamentos tradicionales son tangibles y pueden descontarse.      Sin embargo, en la actualidad incluso los tangibles son meras estimaciones, las cuales —como hemos visto— pueden variar salvajemente y ser obsoletas a causa de acontecimientos imprevistos. También hemos notado cómo los sentimientos mueven a los mercados, y no sólo a corto plazo. Ningún analista puede ignorar razonablemente su poder; e insistir en que las decisiones de cartera “se limiten a lo básico” es suponer que las cosas volverán a ser como hace 50 años, cuando los inversores mantenían su dinero en títulos seguros y se olvidaban de ellos hasta la jubilación.      A los más veteranos, la fuerza desatada la semana pasada puede traernos a memoria al año 1999, cuando la fiebre del mercado alcanzó su punto álgido antes de estrellarse. Pero en ese entonces no teníamos el poder de las redes sociales, una generación todo el tiempo en su casa y el dinero de helicóptero del gobierno federal (NdT: referencia a la política monetaria a través de la cual las distintas administraciones distribuyeron dinero directamente a la población ante la pandemia). Tampoco nos enfrentábamos a un nivel sin precedentes de conflicto social, pérdida de confianza en las instituciones y una creciente confianza en la fuerza de la comunidad. Los mercados de hoy en día pueden dar un vuelco en cualquier momento y, cuando lo hagan, es probable que sea desagradable. No obstante, a diferencia de lo que ocurría a principios de siglo, es poco probable que la participación de los pequeños inversores desaparezca: este cambio cultural va más allá de ganar dinero.      El nuevo poder de los inversores individuales ha demostrado que el sentimiento no sólo está por encima de las previsiones de ganancias, sino que también puede influir en ellas. Los mismos inversores que invierten en las acciones pertenecen al mismo grupo demográfico al que se dirigirá el futuro negocio de GameStop. El poder colectivo demostró que el estado de ánimo de los mercados es una característica fundamental de estos, ahora más que nunca. Los fondos de cobertura, que entienden este fenómeno y colocaron órdenes de compra en consecuencia, pudieron haber impulsado algunos de los saltos de precios de la semana pasada.      Aunque es probable que la volatilidad acabe por calmarse y el análisis de los negocios desempeñe un papel importante en las decisiones de inversión, ya no podemos negar que el sentimiento no es un componente fundamental en las perspectivas de precios de un activo.      Esto es especialmente relevante en los criptoactivos. Los críticos han acusado a menudo a bitcoin de no tener “valor intrínseco”; es decir, de no tener flujo de caja, balance o crecimiento potencial de sus ganancias. Es cierto que no posee estas cualidades, pero sí cuenta con una creencia generalizada en su utilidad, política monetaria y eventual adopción por una comunidad aún más amplia. Eso debería considerarse una característica fundamental, ya que es obvio que impulsa la apreciación de precios.      Bitcoin no es el único ejemplo claro de ello. La semana pasada, el precio de dogecoin se multiplicó por diez en un momento dado (hasta un 500% al momento de escribir este artículo), lo que hizo que la criptomoneda entrara brevemente en la lista de los 10 principales criptoactivos por capitalización de mercado. DOGE no hace nada especial. Tiene un bonito perro como isologotipo. Su fundador renegó del proyecto hace años. Algunas personas lo han publicitado como una broma, la cual luego se convirtió en parte de su narrativa. O dicho de otra manera: su falta de fundamentos se ha convertido en parte de su valor. Podemos burlarnos de la gente que invierte en un activo impulsado puramente por el sentimiento, pero ese sentimiento ha mantenido vivo a DOGE durante más de seis años y ha atraído a un puñado de seguidores de alto perfil.    Un nuevo idioma    Como analista formada en las técnicas de valuación y asignación de carteras de la “vieja escuela”, comprendo la reticencia a abandonar la cómoda heurística; personalmente, echo de menos los flujos de caja descontados, tan agradables y limpios. Pero como los componentes y los participantes del mercado cambian, también debe hacerlo el análisis del mercado. ¿Alguien siquiera recuerda cuándo fue la última vez que los value stocks fueron favorables?      Los mercados de criptomonedas llevan algún tiempo ampliando los límites de lo que significa la palabra “valor”. La nueva generación de inversores nos está mostrando que las viejas reglas deben ser reevaluadas.      También están permanentemente difuminando los límites entre el “dinero inteligente” institucional y el “dinero tonto” individual. No solo eso: están demostrando que la reforma puede ser iniciada por aquellos que antes tenían poca influencia en la forma de obtener beneficios.      Este es el origen y el ethos del mercado de criptomonedas, en pocas palabras: nuevas reglas para un nuevo tipo de inversor. El mercado de criptoactivos nació en el mundo minorista y se alimentó desde la base. Atrae a los inversores que buscan una alternativa al sistema tradicional. Ha dado lugar a nuevas métricas y paradigmas de valuación.      Quienes trabajamos en este sector hemos observado el cambio de poder ocurrido la semana pasada con la sensación de que lo que esperábamos, finalmente, comenzó a suceder: un nuevo tipo de inversor insistiendo en nuevas reglas y en un nuevo lenguaje, y los mercados principales empezando a tomar nota de ello. Este nuevo tipo de inversor —ya sea enfadado con las élites y las reglas desiguales, fascinado por la aparición de un nuevo tipo de activo; o ambas cosas— obligará a reescribir algunas reglas de inversión establecidas tiempo atrás; y, al hacerlo, empujará al término “valor” hacia una definición más flexible para nuestros cambiantes tiempos.    CHAIN LINKS    Los inversores hablan.      Ray Dalio, fundador de Bridgewater Associates, el mayor fondo de cobertura del mundo, publicó un documento en el que expone su opinión sobre bitcoin. Es algo llamativo, dado que no hace mucho tiempo atrás expresó públicamente su escepticismo de que tuviera éxito.      Algunos extractos:    “Creo que el Bitcoin es un gran invento”.  “No hay muchos activos alternativos similares al oro en este momento de creciente necesidad de ellos”.  “Creo que el Bitcoin ha conseguido cruzar la línea de ser una idea altamente especulativa, que bien podría desaparecer en poco tiempo, a estar probablemente presente y poseer algún valor en el futuro”.  “El nuevo paradigma en el que vivimos — donde muchos bonos del Estado ya no ofrecen las mismas características de rentabilidad o diversificación, y donde las divisas se enfrentan a un mayor riesgo de depreciación — podría impulsar el desarrollo de depósitos alternativos de riqueza más rápidamente de lo que podría haber ocurrido en otras circunstancias”.  “Hasta ahora, la capacidad de Bitcoin de ofrecer alguna ventaja de diversificación parece más teórica que real”.    Elon Musk escribió ""bitcoin"" y su logotipo en su biografía de Twitter, y lo señaló con este tuit: “En retrospectiva, era inevitable”.      Scott Minerd, director de inversiones de Guggenheim Partners, declaró la semana pasada al canal de televisión Bloomberg que no cree que la base de inversores institucionales de bitcoin sea “lo suficientemente grande” o “profunda” como para justificar su valor actual.      En una entrevista con Yahoo Finanzas, la directora general de ARK Investment Management, Cathie Wood, reveló que las recientes conversaciones con grandes empresas le llevan a creer que más firmas seguirán el ejemplo de Square (SQ) y asignarán una parte de sus fondos a bitcoin. También dijo en el evento ETF Big Ideas de la semana pasada que duda de que se apruebe un fondo de inversión cotizado en bitcoin hasta que la capitalización de mercado del activo alcance los USD 2 billones.      El Banco de Singapur, brazo de banca privada del OCBC Bank —el segundo banco más grande del sudeste asiático por activos totales—, afirmó en una publicación de research que las criptomonedas tienen el potencial de sustituir parcialmente al oro como depósito de valor si logran superar los obstáculos de alta volatilidad, el riesgo de reputación y la falta de aceptación regulatoria.      Conclusiones:      Según fuentes, algunos de los fondos de dotación — endowment funds, en inglés — de las universidades más grandes de Estados Unidos —como Harvard, Yale, Brown y la Universidad de Michigan— han comprado sigilosamente criptomonedas desde 2019. Conclusión: esto es importante, dado el perfil inversor tradicionalmente conservador de los endowments. Lo más probable es que las asignaciones sean relativamente pequeñas, pero aun así los activos bajo gestión de los endowments universitarios son de cientos de miles de millones de dólares; lo pequeño puede llegar muy lejos. También vale la pena mirar de cerca esta actividad: algunas universidades, especialmente Harvard, han sido criticadas por sus inversiones en empresas de combustibles fósiles. La (malinterpretada) reputación del Bitcoin como algo malo para el medio ambiente podría atraer su atención.      Según el último informe trimestral de Genesis Capital, su volumen total de préstamos activos en circulación aumentó más de 80% en el cuarto trimestre, hasta llegar a los USD 3.8 billones. Las originaciones de préstamos aumentaron un 46%, hasta los USD 7.6 billones; el tamaño promedio de los préstamos se duplicó, pasando de USD 2 millones a USD 4 millones; y el promedio de los préstamos para primeros prestamistas aumentó de USD 0.6 millón a USD 3.2 millones. Conclusión: estas cifras de crecimiento ponen de relieve la creciente atención entre los inversores institucionales de los potenciales rendimientos de los criptopréstamos. Y mientras los rendimientos continúen siendo bajos en los mercados tradicionales, el aumento debería seguir siendo fuerte. Esto apoya una liquidez saludable en los mercados de criptomonedas, que a su vez debería contribuir a fortalecer la infraestructura del mercado y podría mitigar gradualmente la volatilidad de los activos. (Nota: Genesis Capital es propiedad de DCG, relacionado con CoinDesk).      En la última presentación de resultados de la empresa de business intelligence MicroStrategy (MSTR), su director general, Michael Saylor, se comprometió a seguir invirtiendo el exceso de caja de la compañía en bitcoin y dijo a los inversores que su equipo también “explorará varios enfoques” para realizar compras adicionales. Conclusión: realmente están trabajando para convertirse en un ETF de bitcoin (un fondo de inversión cotizado o Exchange Trade Fund, en inglés).      La empresa de minería de criptomonedas Marathon Patent Group (MARA) compró USD 150 millones en Bitcoin durante la reciente caída del precio de esta criptomoneda. Conclusión: aquí tenemos a una empresa minera de bitcoin comprando BTC en el mercado con el fin de convertirse aún más en un jugador especializado en el activo. Sin embargo, un ETF de bitcoin es aún considerado demasiado arriesgado.      La ciudad de Miami publicó el miércoles una copia del libro blanco de Bitcoin en su sitio web, y se unió así a la creciente masa de gobiernos y empresas que ya lo hicieron. Conclusión: un sitio web del gobierno municipal de Estados Unidos alberga el libro blanco de Bitcoin. Deja que esto cale hondo.      En los últimos meses, Grayscale Investments (propiedad de DCG, grupo relacionado con CoinDesk) ha solicitado el registro de más de 10 nuevos fideicomisos basados en criptoactivos de menor capitalización como aave, chainlink, polkadot y otros. Conclusión: Grayscale gestiona actualmente un conjunto de fideicomisos líderes en el mercado, incluyendo GBTC (bitcoin) y ETHE (ethereum), así como algunos más pequeños sobre horizen, litecoin, stellar y otros. Si bien Grayscale no está necesariamente revelando una intención de actuar en estas nuevas presentaciones, sí insinúa con una creciente amplitud de opciones para los inversores institucionales en los próximos meses.      El fondo de bitcoin de la empresa de inversión canadiense Ninepoint Partners (BITC.U y BITC.UN) comenzó a cotizar la semana pasada, tras completar una oferta pública inicial de 230 millones de dólares canadienses (USD 180 millones) en la Bolsa de Toronto. Conclusión: la considerable cantidad recaudada no sólo convierte a este fondo de criptomonedas en el más grande de Canadá y el segundo en dos meses en salir público (el CI Galaxy Bitcoin Fund comenzó a cotizar en la TSX tras levantar USD 72 millones en diciembre), sino que también apunta a una demanda significativa y creciente por parte de los inversores de ese país.      El parlamento de la India está estudiando un proyecto de ley respaldado por el gobierno que prohibiría las criptodivisas “privadas” y proporcionaría un marco para crear una moneda digital oficial del Banco de la Reserva de la India. Conclusión: el impacto potencial del proyecto de ley propuesto aún no está claro. Por ejemplo, ¿qué se entiende por criptodivisa “privada”? Bitcoin y otras son criptomonedas públicas. Esto sentaría un precedente preocupante, aunque también sería un interesante caso de estudio sobre la eficacia de las prohibiciones gubernamentales sobre criptoactivos.      Si quieres tener una perspectiva rápida del rendimiento mensual del mercado, mi colega Shuai Hao ha elaborado esta tabla de rendimientos. Si prestas especial atención, podrás ver que los meses de verano son tradicionalmente más débiles y que el final del año suele ser más fuerte.

42385866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOi8J,1612301795,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises to $35.8K, Ether Hits New High and DeFi Crosses $28B Locked","Bitcoin reversed several days of sideways trading to head higher, ether broke $1,500 for the first time and DeFi’s ecosystem has a record amount of value locked in dollar terms.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $35,824 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $33,459-$35,824 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but below the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price is gaining Tuesday, going as high as $35,645 around 10:00 UTC (5 a.m. ET) before dipping somewhat.      “I think we’ll see more interest in bitcoin again if we move solidly above $35,000,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “On the support side for bitcoin is institutional buying in the low $30,000s.”      Read More: MicroStrategy Adds to Bitcoin Trove With Another $10M Purchase      Some exhaustion recently in the bitcoin market may have been caused by speculative activity in the stock market.      “So much attention has been on U.S. equities markets as of late, a lot of the mainstream and crypto outlets have been much less focused on driving the formation of opinions of traders and hodlers,” said John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritum.      Equities on major indexes were all up Tuesday.    The Nikkei 225 index in Asian ended the day in the green 0.91% as traders expressed optimism Japanese corporate earnings would be better than expected.  Europe’s FTSE 100 closed climbing 0.71% as investors were hopeful the global economy would recover from the coronavirus pandemic.  The United States’ S&P 500 gained 1.7% as investors showed increased confidence the recent period of wild stock speculation is settling down.    In addition to the bullish sentiment keeping stocks buoyant, it should be noted the price per 1 BTC has been able to stay above $30,000 for quite a while.      The last time bitcoin’s closing price was under $30,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data, was on New Year’s Day, when it closed at $29,333. It hasn’t looked back since.      “More than anything else, we should all take the long-term sustained price levels above the 2017 high of $20,000 now over a month as the best possible endorsement of bitcoin being a long-term bullish asset,” added Tritum’s Willock.      Read More: Bullish Bitcoin Fundamentals Point to Renewed Price Rally Ahead      “Generally speaking, I think that the market is accepting higher prices while trying to digest the volatility,” noted Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at crypto liquidity provider Blockfills.      Bitcoin’s gyrations seem to have subsided somewhat, helped by a very flat weekend into Monday. As of Feb. 1, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has trended downward; but it is still above 100%, which is quite high. The S&P 500, by comparison, has a 30-day volatility below 20%.      In the options market, traders are expecting a 62% chance of BTC over $32,000, based on their positions for February expirations. They seem to expect a 53% chance of trading over $34,000 and a 44% probability of bitcoin moving higher than $36,000, according to data collected by Skew.      “We have seen good signs in the option markets that participants are still valuing and pricing the market for higher in the near term,” added Blockfills’ Van Huis.    Ether hits new price zenith, crypto locked in DeFi at all-time high    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped Tuesday, trading around $1,526 and climbing 14.4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) – a fresh all-time high, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read More: Ether Cryptocurrency Reaches Record High, Briefly Tops $1.5K      The total value locked, or TVL, of crypto in U.S. dollar terms within decentralized finance (DeFi) is also hitting a brand-new high, going over $28 billion locked and at $28.8 billion as of press time, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      The amount of ether locked in DeFI is up, at over 7.3 million ETH as of press time. The rise in the price of ether locked in DeFi doesn't hurt.      Meanwhile, the amount of bitcoin locked is heading upward, with the TVL at 45,632 BTC as of press time.      Jun Dam, a smart-contract developer who has written code on the Ethereum and Tron platforms, noted that many decentralized exchanges have numerous pairs with ETH, and speculates traders may be selling some of their stash for DeFi tokens. “It seems like total DEX volume has increased significantly in 2021,” Dam told CoinDesk.      “DeFi is definitely the flavor,” concurred Swissquote’s Thomas. “There’s still good value out there if you consider the possibility that more people will move to DEXs in the next 12 months [and that] arguably the DEXs are still undervalued.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday.

The increase may be a bullish indicator for the crypto market as a whole if it reflects buyers' plans to use the two stablecoins to buy more crypto assets.      The balance of dollar-pegged USDC on exchanges reached over $915 million Friday, while the amount of decentralized stablecoin dai on exchanges went above $81 million on Sunday, according to Glassnode.      USDC on exchanges ""represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets"" such as bitcoin, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter dated Feb 1. “This high figure should increase investors' confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.”      As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, some analysts see several on-chain metrics for bitcoin's price pointing in a bullish direction in the coming weeks. For example, a decreased amount of bitcoin held on exchange addresses indicates less pressure on the sell side.      Read More: Bullish Bitcoin Fundamentals Point to Renewed Price Rally Ahead      In crypto trading, traders and investors often use stablecoins to put money into riskier cryptocurrencies; in such cases, buying stablecoins backed by government-issued currencies is seen as the first step necessary before buying other cryptocurrencies.

He noted that USDC issuance in January saw “record levels.” Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase are behind USDC’s governing Centre consortium.      The circulating supply of USDC, which is valued 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has grown to over 5 billion from just below 4 billion in the beginning of the month, sharp growth after slowing in October, according to data from Glassnode.

42385863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOi3H,1612294314,Bitcoin Miners Saw Revenue Rise 62% in January From December,"Bitcoin miners generated an estimated $1.1 billion in revenue in January, up 62% from December, according to on-chain data from Coin Metrics analyzed by CoinDesk.      The surge in revenue came as bitcoin's price climbed from $29,000 to just below $42,000 in the first half of the month before levelling off through the last two weeks.      Revenue estimates assume miners sell their BTC immediately.      Measured by per terahash per second (TH/s), miner revenues bounced between $0.20 and $0.27 for most of the month after peaking near $0.32 early in the month, per data from Luxor Technologies.      Network fees brought in $116 million in January, or over 10% of total revenue, a slight percentage increase from the 9.8% of revenue represented by fees last month. Fee revenue hit its highest mark since January 2018, per Coin Metrics data.      Fees measured in dollars were quite volatile in January, with average transaction costs bouncing between $5 to above $16 throughout the month, per Coin Metrics.      Notably, fees as a percentage of total revenue continues a strong upward trend since April, prior to the network’s third-ever block subsidy halving in May. Increases in fee revenue are important to sustain the network’s security as the subsidy decreases every four years.

42421783,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXq0D7,1612291804,A Big Year for Decentralized Identity and Infrastructure,"This year has been off to a notable start for crypto and blockchain. On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.      At the same time, the challenges of 2020 continue, including the global pandemic. COVID-19 dominated the recent Davos agenda, with the need for digital solutions and real-time multi-party access to consistent information highlighted across multiple sectors.      At the World Economic Forum, we will continue to work with hundreds of experts from governments, business, civil society and academia to bring together the seemingly disparate worlds of crypto and long-standing institutions.    Sheila Warren is the head of data, blockchain, and digital assets at the World Economic Forum. She's also the co-host, along with Michael J. Casey, of CoinDesk's Money Reimagined podcast.    Here are some of the top trends we are watching this year:    Identity    All eyes are on digital identity for COVID-related needs – but long-term strategies and implications remain to be seen.      The COVID-19 crisis has increased consumer demand for identity solutions that don't compromise individual privacy and freedoms. Of course, ideas of what constitutes the ideal level of privacy preservation vary widely around the world, with China and the U.S. taking deeply divergent perspectives. As the travel industry and various governments continue to explore ideas like “immunity passports,” which would maintain vaccination and/or testing records, the creation of a global standard around digital credentialing seems both necessary and elusive.      See also: Strange Bedfellows: The World Economic Forum and Crypto (podcast featuring Sheila Warren)      In addition, what does it mean to anchor on digital identity as a reaction to a very specific set of circumstances (namely an unprecedented global pandemic)? Digital identity systems are relevant for everything from financial services to re-skilling workforces, which each have distinct requirements. Focusing on one sector without taking a longer-term view can mean that we lose out on opportunities, duplicate efforts and create more complicated user experiences.      As it stands, there are very few regulations or industry standards to prevent fragmentation of technical solutions, protect privacy or promote inclusivity, interoperability and portability – all essential principles – for digital credentialing beyond time-sensitive use cases. As global society struggles to return to “normal,” there is a need to ensure potential solutions that embrace the use of digital credentials, leverage the experience of the digital identity community, consider a longer-term and holistic view, and create strong partnerships with public authorities.    Institutional adoption    Last year was the year of “institutional investment” in bitcoin – a buzzy phrase that was seen across pundit analyses of the crypto rallies, referring to large-scale investments of players such as MassMutual and Square (SQ). It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.      In some instances, they are also being used for improving internal processes. For example, in a Davos agenda panel Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union, cited the company's use of a stable “WU Coin” to exchange different currencies, done “21 times every second.”      COVID-19 also raised the profile of the conversation around central bank digital currencies’ exploration of blockchain technology. We saw the launch of some of the first national-level blockchain-based systems, including in the Bahamas and Cambodia. At the same time, progress around China’s DCEP (Digital Currency/Electronic Payment) continued in the background, with the People’s Bank of China having completed pilots in Shenzhen, Xiong’an and Suzhou, processing RMB 1.1 billion across 3.1 million transactions.      Still, many governments and central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, continue to research whether central bank digital currencies (CBDC) hold potential but have maintained they do not see value in issuing one at this time. Many are also watching the growth in the stablecoin space – with total value now surpassing $25 billion – fueled by decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional interest. This has corresponded with increased attention from regulators, for instance the controversial STABLE Act in the U.S. and the recent letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We can expect continued regulatory interest and activity in this area from around the world.    NFTs boost inclusive wealth    We have come a long way since CryptoKitties, yet relatively little progress has been made in realizing the potential of non-fungible tokens (a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique) outside of the gaming context.      But we are already seeing shifts around the dialogue of inclusion. Previously, there was talk of democratizing access to high-value assets, such as art. While there still might be potential here, it’s important to consider the implications for creators as well. For instance, some have spotlighted black artists and the role that crypto art can play in allowing for greater ownership and wealth creation within the space, as well as art exchanges. We’ve also seen early signs of how this may translate to music or writing.    Decentralized infrastructure    Awareness of the power that centralized platforms and service providers wield over our lives is moving beyond the crypto and blockchain community to the mainstream. Take, for example, the recent mass exodus from WhatsApp to Signal following a (relatively minor) change in Facebook’s data-sharing policies.      This may create an increase in demand for decentralized service provision. In 2020, we saw the highly anticipated launch of Filecoin from Protocol Labs and continued growth of Web 3.0 projects such as Keep, Oasis and Polkadot. The public cloud market is among the most highly concentrated in existence, with four providers controlling 80% of the market. Decentralized cloud storage is currently the only alternative that could pose a challenge to this status quo. Along with advances in AI, this transition could lead to significant expansion of the scope of human and machine interaction, and an acceleration of the transition to Web 3.0.      See also: CoinDesk 2020 Year in Review and Look Ahead      Even as we have been wrestling with the consequences of the greatest social and economic disruption of our lifetimes, the pace of work across the blockchain ecosystem has been accelerating. The great news is that awareness of the potential of decentralized systems now lives beyond the minds of a tiny minority and is slowly gaining awareness among a larger audience (although the bitcoin price index remains the biggest reason most people pay any attention to the space).      As a result, it’s likely that we will see continued interest from regulators and policymakers around the globe, especially around digital currencies. We’re already starting to see increased market consolidation, which may be a sign of increased market maturity. Regardless of what happens in 2021, it’s sure to be a wild year and one for the books.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Sheila Warren,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/02/a-big-year-for-decentralized-identity-and-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdbd19cd0ebb8a8e87d12ebca1c3dcc530b54840-1420x944.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOhzV,1612289551,Yearn Finance Votes to Inflate YFI Token Supply by 20%,"The Yearn Finance community has been discussing expanding the supply of YFI as a way to compensate the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform's de facto staffers. The vote went live on the web app Snapshot on Jan. 28 and ended today at 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).      Yearn Finance is a collectively designed robo-advisor for yield that is fast becoming a portal into all of DeFi. It's governed by the token YFI, which is worth slightly more than $30,000, as of this writing.      There's a total of 30,000 YFI in existence, per the project's original ""fair launch."" If the new tokens were minted right now and had no impact on the market capitalization, then one would expect the value of YFI to drop to something like $25,000 (meaning the new tokens would be worth $167 million), but these things are not predictable.      The final vote to increase the supply was 1,670 YFI for versus 331 against.      To participate in a vote, YFI holders have to stake to the governance contract in advance of a vote by a specified Ethereum block number. The total amount of YFI staked to vote on YIP-57 was 4,089.    Read more: ‘Let’s Not Be Bitcoin’: Yearn Finance Considers Minting $200M in New YFI Tokens    Final changes are approved by six of the nine members of the Yearn multisig, which is something like the DeFi equivalent of a board of directors.      Under the proposal, 33% of the new tokens would be set aside for key contributors. Which contributors the allocation would be for and how much each would get is unknown. There will be some sort of staking set up so contributors only get their allocations for sticking around, but none of that has been decided.      The other 66% will be set aside as a treasury, for everything from protocol acquisition to further development.      The decision marks a clear shift for the team, which accrued a unique amount of buzz for eschewing the convention of setting aside governance tokens for insiders.      The authors of the newly passed proposal wrote:    ""Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities.""    The community remains somewhat divided on the initiative. As the vote indicates, though, most YFI holders are for it.      On the supporter side, user zkwaffles wrote:    ""This seems to be the equivalent of an equity raising round. In these rounds an early-stage venture will issue equity and in effect dilute current shareholders. ... The overarching idea being that the cash raised will increase future value enough to offset any dilution.""    On the opposition, user laur_science argued the proposal wasn't specific enough:    ""I don't like it, so I voted against. It doesn't even specify what type of vesting we're talking about. I want it to be for 5 years, equal amounts per year.""    UPDATE (Feb. 2, 18:43 UTC): A prior version of this story reported that quorum for a vote to pass was 20% of the YFI staked to governance, based on Yearn's documentation.

42385865,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOi4X,1612285681,"Blockchain Bites: IBM Blockchain Bleeds, Exchange Tokens Pump, ETH Hits New High","Happy Groundhog Day. Bitcoin is ticking up, though still rangebound. XRP continues to bleed after a semi-successful orchestrated pump. Exchange tokens are seemingly benefiting from GameStop-style gamesmanship.    Three stories    1. IBM Blockchain has reportedly missed its revenue goals by a wide margin two years running. The legendary computing giant’s enterprise blockchain unit has atrophied to approximately 10% of its peak size, according to anonymous sources close to the matter.    Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”  Big Blue is most notable for its work on Hyperledger Fabric, a network of networks that supports the IBM-incubated FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart, and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk.    2. A Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director spoke publicly for the first time regarding the controversial wallet rule floated late last year.    FinCEN Deputy Director Michael Mosier said the rule, which would increase reporting requirements for exchanges, seeks to align crypto with standing regulations related to cash. “It’s a proposal, it’s not all or nothing. Tell us about what works” and what doesn’t on the technical and conceptual front, Mosier said.  Others have pointed out that increasing the amount of identifiable information tied to specific accounts on the blockchain would actually diminish crypto’s cash-like qualities.    3. GameStop drama is spilling out into the land of decentralized exchanges, according to CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen. New data suggests that CEX and DEX trading volumes have risen over the past week, bringing exchanges’ tokens to new highs, with at least some action coming from disaffected traders temporarily blocked from trading meme-stocks on Robinhood.    Binance’s BNB token hit a new all-time high at $50.27 during early U.S. trading hours on Monday, while FTX’s FTT token logged a record price of $12.95 on Friday, according to data from Messari.  Meanwhile, volumes on DEXs hit $55.8 billion in January, up from a previous high of $26.5 set in September 2020. Uniswap saw approximately 45% of total DEX volume, with rival clone SushiSwap reaching 22%.  At stake    Outliers and developers Outlier Ventures, a fund and accelerator dedicated to Web 3.0, released its latest blockchain developer report, with findings that hew close to previously reported estimates. According to Outlier’s data, Ethereum was the most actively developed blockchain in 2020, followed by Cardano and Bitcoin. The venture firm relied on the number of code commits.      It might seem odd that Bitcoin is only considered the third-most active blockchain (with 441 commits to Ethereum's and Cardano’s 866 and 761, respectively). But Cardano went through a major upgrade last spring, bringing proof-of-stake consensus to the interoperable network. By contrast, Bitcoin developers have chosen a slow and steady approach towards development, with several rounds of discussions about discussions around upgrading.      Last December, Electric Capital, another venture firm, measured developer activity by counting the number of actual people building these protocols. They found that 2,300 average monthly developers worked on Ethereum across Q3 2020, with Bitcoin in second at a bit under 400. Development was up across the ecosystem.      Outlier’s figures are a bit different, measuring monthly estimates rather than quarterly. They write: “Ethereum also leads the monthly active developer count, with 220 monthly active core developers on average, followed by Hyperledger, Cardano and Bitcoin having 149, 144 and 103 active core developers on average, respectively.”      But not all chains are seeing increased activity. A class Outlier calls ""Ethereum killers,"" including Tron, EOS, Komodo and Qtum, “[is] seeing a decrease in core development metrics and developer contribution.” Though other protocols many view as Ethereum competitors, like Polkadot and the aforementioned Cosmos, saw an uptick in dev contribution.      It’s hard to put too much stock in reports like this – Outlier readily admits the potential pitfalls in scraping GitHub for determinative data – but they do function as a kind of map of the crypto territory. With the launch of Filecoin, for instance, a much-awaited decentralized file storage network, the protocol jumped into the “top five” of most actively developed projects.      Like all else in crypto, hype begets hype. While it’s easy to get lost in the dazzling amount of capital flowing through this nascent economy, it’s important to remember the human sacrifice, too.    Market intel    BTC and ETH The upside is looking bright for both bitcoin and ether, according to CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics show demand continues to outstrip supply while the number of coins on exchanges slides – a sign that people expect the price to rise. Grayscale, a CoinDesk sister company, acquired 40,000 BTC in a period when only 26,000 BTC were mined.      Meanwhile, ether hit a new record high on Tuesday, amid expectations the recent GameStop trading saga would accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).

42385859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOhyF,1612284576,Why Crypto Markets Aren't 'All-to-All' Either (and How They Can Be),"Like just about everyone last week, we were watching the news about GameStop (GME) and the role Robinhood traders played in the market. In light of Robinhood’s disabling of buying in a number of stocks, there is a lot of fury about potential conflicts of interest that are not new but now suddenly in the spotlight.      The situation emphasizes the need for transparency in markets and why certain marketing that appears beneficial – “Trade stocks for free!” – may have deleterious characteristics under some circumstances.    Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues. Prior to ErisX, Matthew was most recently co-founder and president of Tradewind Markets, an electronic trading platform and blockchain-based post trade system for physical precious metals.    In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” or PFOF, brokers sell their clients’ order flow to professional trading firms called “internalizers.” This practice has been covered by the media many times over the years, more recently by Institutional Investor and MSN. Brokers send individual investors’ orders, e.g., to buy stock in GameStop, to the internalizers that pay to trade against this “dumb flow.” The internalizers then net-offset the retail trades, keeping the spread, or offset trades on the national stock exchanges, presumably at a profit that exceeds the cost of their payments made to Robinhood and other retail brokers. The majority of retail equities orders never execute on an actual stock exchange.      So, retail traders trade for “free” and the brokers and professional internalizers still make lots of money. Not all market makers support PFOF. The question retail traders should be asking is, how much in hidden fees are they paying? If the non-transparent markups, spreads, or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then “free” may be pretty misleading. How fees and conflicts are disclosed and managed, or not, is pretty important. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to agree.      Well, good thing this only happens in equity trading. Crypto must be free of these conflicts, right?      Not exactly.      There is a lot of lip service paid to “democratizing access.” Call us fundamentalists, but when we envision a “democratized market” we envision an exchange where all members can trade with all other members according to a common set of rules and standards.    If the non-transparent markups, spreads or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then 'free' may be pretty misleading.    It’s a market where price discovery and liquidity are available to all on equal terms, and where the commingling of order flows from many different participants with diverse market outlooks and time horizons produce a better market quality. A central limit order book (CLOB), the model most typically found on regulated futures and stock exchanges such as the CME and Nasdaq, provides such a market structure (as we discussed here and here). On a CLOB, with a published price schedule and displayed quotations, the full cost of a trade is explicit and transparent: the price at which investors can purchase or sell a quantity of an asset plus the transaction fee. It is really pretty simple.      See also: Jill Carlson - The GameStop Stop Is Not a Technology Problem      It does not strike us as very “democratic” when order flow gets channeled to exclusive liquidity providers that gain an informational advantage as a result of that exclusivity, particularly where that conflict is not well disclosed. Almost without fail, if a trading or pricing arrangement is not fully transparent there is, at worst, a problem or conflict. Or, as may be the case with unregulated/offshore markets, something untoward may be happening. At best there is an arrangement the parties would rather keep quiet from their products, er, customers.      As a new asset, crypto has had the opportunity to learn from the market structure examples of traditional markets. Unfortunately, some of the lessons that have ported over are sub-optimal arrangements rather than best practices.      An apparently significant part of the crypto market structure involves brokers sending client orders to over-the-counter “trading venues,” in that model a synonym for internalizing dealers. Or, in some cases, the broker is the dealer. (It is worth noting that in traditional markets there are strict rules that generally prohibit or restrict exchanges and brokers trading against their own clients.) OTC liquidity provision is a variation on the PFOF model. Instead of all-to-all trading with the explicit and transparent fees CLOBs enable, the OTC liquidity model replicates the implicit costs, informational advantages, opacity and potential conflicts of interest that have been problematic in equities and FX trading.      See also: Preston Byrne - ‘The Squeezening’: How the GameStop Backlash Will Curtail Freedom      The Robinhood saga also exposes another risk of the exclusive liquidity provider model: counterparty risk. There has been a lot of speculation about why Robinhood disabled the buying of certain stocks. We will not wade into that discussion, but it does beg the question of what happens when the liquidity providers cannot or will not provide the liquidity, or cannot or will not settle trades. A CLOB diversifies counterparties and a clearinghouse eliminates settlement risk. These are proven market infrastructures that were designed in response to past market failures and disruptions.      In summary, while it has been both exciting and disheartening to watch the Robinhood and GameStop spectacle, we have yet again been reminded of the importance of well-designed market structure, understanding the risks and potential conflicts, and aiming to remove them explicitly and transparently. Crypto markets can be all-to-all, which is, in our view, closer to the democratized access that so many claim to want and/or offer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Matthew Trudeau,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/02/why-crypto-markets-arent-all-to-all-either-and-how-they-can-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4d12d9b35593fba3f8bd7a843716f56af6d7053-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385856,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOhtD,1612282893,One Big Pool: Balancer's New Version Cuts Down Transactions and Gas Fees,"It doesn't take a software engineer to understand why the new version of Balancer marks a cool innovation in on-chain trading for Ethereum tokens.      Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault. This should dramatically reduce gas fees for decentralized finance (DeFi) trades because users can swap as much as they want, only paying gas for going into and out of Balancer.      The team had considered building it this way from the start but decided initially to be conservative and separate out each pool for added security, CEO Fernando Martinelli told CoinDesk.      ""We are today ... comfortable enough with having a big vault that holds a lot of money. We put a lot of effort into making this as safe as if the assets were siloed,"" he wrote in an email. ""Many other protocols (not AMMs) already do this: lending protocols, collateral in MakerDAO, etc.""      Balancer works much like (and can serve the function of) an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap or Curve but it allows users to create pools of multiple tokens, weighted as they see fit. The pools automatically rebalance as needed in order to stay in line with the market.      This requires making a lot of transactions, which in turn require a lot of Ethereum gas fees. That is not capital-efficient for traders nor for liquidity pool providers, especially as gas prices tick upward.      In this new version, the accounting for those pools will just be done in smart contracts separate from the big custody pool.    One big pool    With Balancer v2, no matter how complex a trade or trades, ""only the final net token amounts are transferred from and to the vault, saving a significant amount of gas in the process,"" Martinelli wrote in an announcement post. Balancer can keep track of all of the assets entrusted to it in one vault and just move allocations around on people's accounts.      ""Now, token management and accounting is done by the vault while the AMM logic is individual to each pool. Because pools are contracts external to the vault, they can implement any arbitrary, customized AMM logic,"" the team wrote.      In fact, the new version will even take it a step further. Active traders can set up an individual account so they can make lots of trades. Then they will only be charged gas fees when they want to withdraw.      Of course, that may sound more like a centralized exchange to some traders, which is somewhat fair. The key difference here is it's all being kept on smart contracts that can be reviewed by the public; and, as an Ethereum project, its functionality can be easily integrated into others.      It does raise a security concern. To oversimplify it, think of it this way: If someone had a large treasure of gold, it would be trickier to steal it all if it were locked away in multiple vaults in different places rather than one big vault.      Martinelli does not dispute this, but he also notes that the more-complex logic in Balancer doesn't touch the assets, which should be reassuring.      ""Since the operations the vault will be doing are very low-level (add to a user balance, remove from a pool the user traded with), we will make everything (including formal verification) to make sure the vault is safe and sound,"" Martinelli said via email.    Other developments    Balancer is adding some other features in version 2.0 that may be of interest to more advanced users. Crucially, it wants to make it easier to experiment with composition pools.      ""Balancer v2 pioneers customizable AMM logic: [I]t effectively creates a launch pad for teams to innovate with different AMM strategies without having to worry about low level token transfers, balance accounting, security checks [and] smart order routing,"" the announcement says.      It will go live with the familiar weighted pools that Balancer users know already. It will also have stable pools that work more as Curve does, so big trades on stablecoins can see very little slippage. Soon, Balancer will launch smart pools, whose logic can change on the fly.      Balancer will also introduce asset managers, external smart contracts that can be used to put some of a liquidity pools' underlying value to work elsewhere in DeFi. This should be good for liquidity providers, because as the team notes, ""in normal trading conditions, most of the assets in an AMM are not actually used.""      Balancer will also introduce trading fees that can be controlled by holders of its BAL token. It will offer fees on trades, withdrawals and flash loans. Only the final fee will be active at the start of version 2.0, however. BAL holders can use the fees either to pay for further development, for a dividend or some combination of both.

Monthly revenue has not reached this level since the previous record from January 2018 near ether’s previous all-time high, according to data estimates by CoinDesk.      Revenue estimates assume Ethereum miners sell their ether immediately.      On-chain data reviewed by CoinDesk, however, shows network fees in January 2018 only represented 9% of monthly revenue. Last month, nearly 40% of revenue came from network fees, totalling more than $504 million in revenue.      Notably, fees consistently represented a low, single-digit percentage of monthly revenue every month from ether’s previous record high until May 2020, when the Ethereum-centric decentralized finance (DeFi) craze gained momentum.      Since May, fees have represented an average of 30% of miner revenue per month.      Growth in fee revenue isn’t surprising given the network’s consistently high transaction costs. Average transaction fees priced in dollars hit record highs on Jan. 11 passing $19, according to data from Blockchair. The previous transaction fee record was set just five months ago at $10.33 per average transaction on Sept. 1 during the peak of DeFi’s red-hot summer.      Eager to not miss out on soaring revenue, mining activity has seen a marked increase, with the network’s hashrate following in step and reaching an all-time high Tuesday above 360,000 gigahashes per second (GH/s), per Etherscan.

According to a press release issued Tuesday, the company has filed a 211 form with the U.S.'s Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund.      Aiming to compete with bitcoin investment vehicles from the likes of Grayscale Investments and Galaxy Digital, the firm plans shares of its fund to be publicly traded on the New York-based OTCQX marketplace. Fidelity Investments would oversee the custodianship of the fund's bitcoin assets.      OTCQX is designed for both U.S. and international companies, which are required to meet strict financial standards to qualify for the market.      If verified, shares in the Bitwise fund would be available for trading in traditional brokerage accounts and could be held with traditional custodians, according to the release. The company is yet to announce a ticker for the fund.      ""There is significant growth in interest from professional investors in accessing bitcoin as a tool to hedge their portfolios against rising inflationary risk,"" said Bitwise's chief investment officer, Matt Hougan.      Hougan added that increasing numbers of financial advisors are ""taking note"" of large allocations to bitcoin from hedge funds, institutions and insurance companies, and may move to make their own investments.      See also: Bitwise’s Crypto Assets Under Management Rise Fivefold in Just 2 Months      The company told CoinDesk the fund offers a 1.5% expense ratio, which is lower than Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at 2.0%.

42385861,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOi0l,1612279858,State of Crypto: How Will the Government React to GameStop?,"Welcome to State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. I’m your host, Nikhilesh De.      Yeah, of course we’re talking about GameStop (GME) today. Here are my questions: What can the U.S. government do, what might the government do and what impact could that have on the crypto space?      Click here to sign up for State of Crypto.    Free-for-all  The narrative    I’m assuming you’ve heard that Gamestop’s stock price rose, like, a lot last week. In fact, it rose so much that individuals and hedge funds that shorted it lost billions of dollars. Except not really, and I’ll touch on that, but what I’m more interested in is how the U.S. government (and other nations) will react.    Why it matters    Retail investors coordinating a massive share price pump for a public company seems like a pretty big story. The White House is monitoring it, newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is looking at it, the Securities and Exchange Commission published not one but two brief statements saying it was monitoring the situation, and both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives plan to hold hearings.      It all started with a subreddit called r/WallStreetBets, which showed how a dedicated decentralized community can take on traditional finance. Though this initially had little to do with crypto, the mania quickly spread to cryptocurrencies including DOGE and XRP. But the implications for the industry could be much more far-reaching.    Breaking it down  What happened?    Let’s just recap what happened, in case this is the first time you've been on the Internet in over a week. For the past few months, users of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (a subreddit is a community on Reddit.com) have been buying shares of GameStop and propping up its price.      This really entered the mainstream when people realized some large hedge funds, including Melvin Capital, had heavily shorted $GME and needed to buy up the stock to ensure they could cover the short. This pumped $GME by a lot.      People went nuts. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has now fielded multiple questions about how President Joe Biden’s team might respond. The SEC has published multiple statements saying the same. Jimmy Kimmel is, for some reason, saying “Russian disruptors” are behind the price boom.    What will the government do?    So we have to split the U.S. government into two groups here: Congress and regulators.      Let’s start with Congress, which is already planning on holding hearings about market volatility. The House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is holding a hearing on Feb. 18 with Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, while the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) will hold its own hearing.      Beyond Robinhood’s chief executive testifying at a hearing, there aren’t a lot of details available right now about what Congress might do. Part of this may be because the situation is still fairly new and the committees need to organize these hearings on top of their other tasks, which include confirmation hearings for the new administration and an impeachment trial for the old one.      That brings us to the regulators. And ... it’s unclear what they can actually do. The GameStop pump was coordinated among a huge number of individuals on a public forum. It doesn’t look like a traditional pump-and-dump scheme, one attorney told me.      The SEC could look at whether the participants were acting in concert and coordinating as part of a pump-and-dump, but this seems unlikely.      Other attorneys seemed equally skeptical about whether the SEC has any real jurisdiction over matters like GameStop.      The attorney above, who requested anonymity due to the general lack of clarity around this issue, said the GameStop saga might be great for decentralized communities and the general idea of decentralization, but could also lead to more market volatility that would scare investors (and therefore draw the SEC’s attention, given its mandate on investor protection).      A bit of a mea culpa here: Last week I tweeted that “r/WSB has scared hedge funds more in a week than bitcoin has in a decade changemymind.jpg.” But then, after doing more research, I’ve changed my mind. Twitter isn’t great for nuance but I now think a better take would have been along the lines of “r/WSB has gotten hedge funds’ attention more effectively.” It turns out plenty of Wall Street firms are making out like thieves by selling their now-highly valued shares on the open market (or could if they actually sold their shares).      The chief takeaway seems to be that regulators can’t actually stop this kind of thing because it’s not clear if any laws have been broken. They can say they’re monitoring the situation but that’s probably what they have to say. (Imagine the SEC saying, “Hey, we saw the GameStop thing but it’s not really something we’re keeping an eye on.”)      In other words, this drama suggests a properly decentralized entity might be able to operate without fear of an SEC shutdown. This, in theory, should be good for the cryptocurrency industry.    When will the Ripple lawsuit end?    I should also mention Ripple’s response to an SEC lawsuit alleging it violated federal securities laws by selling XRP since 2013. The company filed a response Friday in federal court, denying XRP sales were securities transactions and saying XRP isn’t a security. It also announced filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the SEC asking how the agency determined that bitcoin and ether are not securities.      As I said in a previous edition of this newsletter, it’s still early days. Ripple looks like it’s still fighting in the realm of public relations as much as it’s fighting in court. What Ripple does not appear to have done is file a motion to dismiss the case. It does appear to be following Kik’s playbook in responding to the SEC’s complaint paragraph by paragraph.    Changing of the guard    We’re still waiting on confirmation hearings and votes for most of President Biden’s nominees for financial regulatory positions. The second-week president has yet to officially confirm that Chris Brummer will be nominated to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or that Michael Barr will be nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.    Elsewhere:  Bitcoin and Inflation: Everything You Need to Know: My colleague Sandali Handagama explored the relationship between inflation and bitcoin’s value proposition. She found that while the cryptocurrency is seen as an inflation hedge, there hasn’t been a whole lot of inflation to hedge against. Indeed, Fed Chair Powell said he’d “welcome higher inflation” at this juncture.  Harvard, Yale, Brown Endowments Have Been Buying Bitcoin for at Least a Year: Sources: Let me take you behind the curtain for a minute here. This is actually a story CoinDesk has been quietly investigating for maybe 18 months now. Ian Allison is exceedingly great at reporting, and he was finally able to confirm this story: University endowments are investing in bitcoin. Put another way, crypto is seen as a mature and regulated enough market that typically cautious investment vehicles are comfortable putting funds into it.  Judge Rejects Virgil Griffith’s Motion to Dismiss Charges of Aiding North Korea: A federal judge has rejected Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith’s motion to dismiss a federal criminal case alleging he violated U.S. sanctions law. District Judge P. Kevin Castel wrote Griffith doesn’t necessarily need to have been compensated for his talk at a North Korean crypto conference to have rendered “services,” which is what he’s being accused of doing. There will be a telephone conference on Feb. 11 next.  FinCEN’s Wallet Rule Aims to Close Crypto-Cash Reporting Gap, Official Says: FinCEN Deputy Director Michael Mosier provided the first public comments on the proposed counterparty surveillance rule on wallets in a talk with TRM Labs. According to Mosier, the rule was a response to a perceived discrepancy between the reporting requirements for cash and crypto. He encouraged commenters to file specific, technical and practical feedback about the implications of the rule. (Need a refresher? Click here).

42385854,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOhrx,1612278000,DeFi Privacy Is Getting a Boost From Polkadot Parachain Manta Network,"A new survey by Manta Network, a privacy-preserving decentralized finance stack built on Substrate, has shed further light on the need for privacy in the rapidly expanding DeFi space.      “We think one of the biggest problems that need to be tackled exists on decentralized exchanges,” said Shumo Chu, CEO and co-founder of Manta Network, in an email.      “The volume is large and increasing on decentralized exchanges, but DEXs are also a hotbed for front-running opportunities due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. Someone can see your transaction before it gets written and confirmed, and make the same transaction with a higher fee to get priority and pass that transaction before you do.”    Privacy in DeFi    According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of the 404 respondents (73.2%) “have either hesitated or completely avoided making a transaction in the past because they were worried about the privacy implications of that transaction.”      Additionally, 84% of respondents expressed concern about their wallet addresses being linked to their real identity. Part of this concern was caused due to the fact that the nature of blockchains allows people to see address balances.    Read more: New Research Sheds Light on the Front-Running Bots in Ethereum’s Dark Forest    In fact, over 90% of survey respondents said they’d looked up someone's wallet address to view that person's holdings and/or transactions.      The survey adds further weight to the notion that privacy is a central concern in the cryptocurrency space, and the Manta Network is one of a number of different projects in the DeFi space working to increase privacy functionality.    The Manta Network    The Manta Network aims to bolster privacy in DeFi, in part, by obfuscating wallet addresses, but with the overall aim of letting users transact and exchange privacy. A parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, Manta Network’s first major project is a privacy-preserving automated market maker (AMM) DEX called MantaSwap.      The Manta Network is working to implement ZkSNARKs on the blockchain level. ZkSNARKs are a cryptographic technique that allows two entities to verify information with each other without having to share the underlying data related to it.      Think about it in the context of logging into a website, for example. The site verifies who you are without sharing your password, geolocation data or other information that can be used to figure out additional details about yourself that you aren’t aware you might be giving up.    Read more: Startup Aleo Wants to Help You Use the Internet Without Sacrificing Data Privacy    According to Chu, Manta’s use of ZkSNARKS can bring privacy to transactions and user identity.      “While you are still able to monitor your own transactions, no one else can do so anymore,” he said. “By taking this and applying it in an interoperable manner (through Polkadot), we’re able to provide a plug-and-play solution for the entire ecosystem in the future.”      Right now though, Chu said the team is focusing on enhancing usability, given their goal is to be a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, they’re working to ensure transparency of both the code itself as well as the process.      “As part of the usability, we also want to focus on the security of the implementation, which takes time,” he said.    Why privacy matters    The implications for transparent transactions aren’t limited to someone knowing how much money is in an address. It can have tangible downstream effects, given that information is power.      In traditional finance, if you want to view your bank account information (including transactions and total cash), you have to prove that you are the owner of that account. No one else is allowed to view your information without your consent.      “It’s different on the blockchain – anyone who knows your wallet address can review your transactions, trace your transactions and see all of your assets,” said Chu.    Read more: Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Will Offer Automatic CoinJoins by Default to Boost Privacy    Chu said that lack of privacy leads to a host of other issues that arise in scaling out blockchain use cases. Automated monitoring and scraping leads to unauthorized data collection, opening up potential opportunities for blackmail. In corporate use cases, trade secrets may be revealed by tracing transactions on chain.      On decentralized exchanges, that transparency leads to front-running opportunities, according to Chu. People are taking extra steps, which increases the friction of usage, just to make transactions more obfuscated.      Chu said the availability of privacy products are a secondary issue on DEXs, which is part of the reason he said he wants Manta Network to be plug and play.      “Future DEX projects don’t need to bring onboard their own cryptography team; they can use our development tools,” he said. “Other DeFi projects and general blockchain projects can do the same thing.”    Funding and the future    The Manta Network, which was previously a Web 3.0 Foundation Grant winner, closed a $1.1 million funding round, led by Polychain Capital, to build MantaSwap.      “Manta Network brings an experienced team to tackle the critical and growing issues regarding privacy on the blockchain,” said Ben Perszyk, partner at Polychain, in a statement. “Its unique approach to building as a Polkadot parachain enables them to offer plug-and-play privacy to a multitude of use cases and projects, starting with their own privacy-preserving DEX.”    Read more: 'Digital Mercenaries’: Why Blockchain Analytics Firms Have Privacy Advocates Worried    The funding will jump-start Manta Network’s development. The team is currently finishing its prototype to deliver to the Web3 Foundation. Before the end of Q1, it will be delivering the first version of its test net. In future releases of the test net, it will introduce other assets as well as exchange functionality.      “Our goal is to get main net up before the end of the year, but we recognize the importance of making sure that the security aspects of our network are thoroughly tested and addressed before we make the decision to launch the main net,” said Chu.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/02/defi-privacy-is-getting-a-boost-from-polkadot-parachain-manta-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f45e68859d880cdb75247e70e6a730979adf8d8-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385850,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOhmv,1612277200,Russia and US Dominate Global Dark Market Traffic: Report,"People in Russia and the U.S. were the source of over $284 million to illicit online marketplaces in 2020, blockchain research firm Chainalysis said in its latest report.      According to an excerpt from the firm's upcoming ""2021 Crypto Crime Report,"" published Monday, online marketplaces providing illegal goods like drugs and fake IDs received a record-setting amount of cryptocurrency last year, equivalent to $1.7 billion. Russia, the U.S., Ukraine and China were the main areas of global money traffic to such platforms.      Darknet marketplaces receive most of their money through peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces and centralized exchanges, Chainalysis wrote. However, in 2020, the use of centralized exchanges increased, as did mixing services, which allow to obfuscate the participants in a cryptocurrency transaction.    Drug deal distribution    The report lists 10 countries where people are most actively interacting with dark markets: Russia, the U.S., Ukraine, China, the U.K., Venezuela, Vietnam, Turkey, India and Germany. Together, these nations were the source of $538 million to illicit markets during 2020 while people there received $403 million, Chainalysis said.      Russians sent around $169 million to the various darknet marketplaces, and received $119 million from such sites. Americans were second, with $115 million sent and $64 million received. In third place, Ukrainians sent $47 million and received $52 million.      ""Generally speaking, drugs are grown or manufactured in Latin America and Asia and consumed in North America and Northern & Western Europe,"" the report reads. ""Darknet vendors and administrators typically launder funds through cryptocurrency services – often over-the-counter (OTC) brokers – in China or Eastern Europe. We can see some of this activity in the blockchain data associated with darknet market transactions.""    Dominant player    The biggest marketplace in the field by far is Hydra, a Russian-language drug marketplace that pocketed 75% of the entire global dark market revenue, Chainalysis said. Hydra was mostly responsible for the rapid growth in the global dark market revenue over the last year, while the income of other marketplaces didn't change significantly between 2019 and 2020.      Hydra delivers drugs to buyers via ""drops,"" in which a delivery person hides the purchase close to a buyer and shares the geolocation of the package so it can be collected. In December 2019, Hydra announced it wanted to expand to other regions of the world and would hold a $146 million token sale. This was later put on hold due to the global coronavirus pandemic.      According to the data from Bitfury's data firm Crystal Blockchain, currently, Hydra's bitcoin addresses hold more than 521 BTC, worth over $18 million. Since 2011, Hydra has sent and received more than 439,000 BTC ($15.2 billion).

Ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, rose toward a new record, potentially fueled by fresh interest in the blockchain's decentralized trading systems amid widespread dismay over the retail-investing platform Robinhood's handling of the GameStop (GME) saga.

Hey, it's crypto.      In traditional markets, European and Asian shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed toward a higher open amid renewed optimism for economic stimulus and the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. GameStop shares lost nearly a third of their value on Monday following last week's 400% short squeeze.      Silver, whose price had shot up to an eight-year high after a series of posts on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum calling for a ""short squeeze,"" tumbled as some commenters pushed back against the narrative; precious-metals analysts for the lenders HSBC and Commerzbank warned the rally would be hard to sustain.

Market Moves          With the coronavirus vaccine distribution well underway, Wall Street analysts are sketching out what the economy might look like as 2021 unfolds and social-distancing measures recede.      The short answer is that activity is set to heat up, which could also provide the first real test of the hidden inflationary pressures that might have built up over the past year. Whatever happens will likely prove crucial for the bitcoin market because the cryptocurrency has become one of the most popular ways for big investors to bet on the likelihood of rising prices or dollar debasement.      The U.S. Congressional Budget Office projected on Monday that gross domestic product will expand by 3.7% this year, after a 2.5% contraction in 2020. But Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, is even more optimistic, recently boosting its forecast for this year's growth to 6%, from 4.5% at the start of the year.      A key question for the inflation watchers, of course, is just how much stimulus money will be pumped into the economy by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve.      President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, but a group of senators from the opposition Republican party on Monday released details of a $618 billion proposal they argue is more appropriate. Bank of America's analysts assume the package will end up around $1 trillion.      Why it matters is that as Americans start to get out and about, a surge in consumer spending looks likely. The Bank of America analysts estimate there's already some $1.6 trillion of excess savings that might start to trickle into the economy.      ""The jolt from stimulus, the support of excess savings and the green light from lower virus cases should unleash pent-up consumer spending,"" the Bank of America economists wrote. ""Stronger growth means a lower unemployment rate and greater inflation pressure.""      That outlook raises the question of how the Fed might respond, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating last week that it's ""too early to be talking about dates"" for tapering the central bank's $120-billion-a-month of bond purchases – funded via printing more money – that are currently ongoing to provide stimulus to financial markets.      By the middle of this year, if the economy is recovering quickly Powell and his colleagues might find it harder to characterize any talk of tapering as still too soon. Because these are typically well-telegraphed affairs, the actual tapering might start six to seven months after that. Call it early 2022.      ""We believe the Fed will have difficulty justifying persistently large asset purchases in the face of a sustainable decrease in [COVID-19] cases, economic overheating, and frothy asset prices,"" according to Bank of America.      On the other hand, the Fed might flinch.      ""We can envision a scenario whereby the Fed signals an intention to taper/starts tapering, markets react negatively, and the Fed finds that they need to continue purchasing or extend the duration of their purchases in order to preserve market functioning,"" according to Bank of America.      It's that latter scenario – or even just the prospect of it – that might drive bitcoin prices a lot higher. Based on the reluctance of central bankers to withdraw stimulus, not to mention the market lurches late last year when a new U.S. stimulus bill seemed in doubt, the scenario isn't all that implausible.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's ongoing range play between $30,000 and $40,000 could end with a bullish breakout as demand from investors continues to outstrip new supplies of the cryptocurrency.      In 2021 so far, around 26,000 new bitcoins have been produced by miners on the Bitcoin blockchain, data provider Glassnode said in a weekly report. Yet, in the same period, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)      In another bullish indicator, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, interpreted as a sign of waning interest from sellers. The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.      On the bearish side, a stronger dollar could play spoilsport to any push higher. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with price charts showing a major bullish pattern known an ""inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.""      “If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bullish Bitcoin Fundamentals Point to Renewed Price Rally Ahead    Token Watch    The spillover to digital markets from the past week's GameStop saga has taken on a new form: Soaring demand for digital tokens associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and the arcane but fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, which could provide an alternative to Wall Street and traditional trading platforms.      ""It seems investors are looking for the next trade to cycle through,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.      The exchange Binance's in-house BNB token hit a new all-time high on Monday, just days after rival FTX's FTT token logged a new record, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported.      Prices have also hit new highs for tokens from decentralized exchanges, which are essentially just automated, blockchain-based software protocols that can be used to trade digital assets. Uniswap's UNI and SushiSwap's SUSHI both saw big price jumps – a dynamic that might reflect retail investors' growing concerns with centralized trading platforms amid widespread anger over Robinhood's trading suspensions last week. Trading volumes on the decentralized exchanges,, hit a record above $50 billion in January, CoinDesk's Zack Voell reported.      Ether, the native blockchain of the Ethereum blockchain, where much of the DeFi development is taking place, has pushed back toward a record high above $1,400.      ""Decentralized trading, decentralized lending, decentralized insurance, decentralized everything starts to make a lot more sense in light of what is happening today in the traditional financial system,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused Arca Funds, wrote Monday in his weekly newsletter.    What's Hot    ""It's pretty obvious that the WSB traders are applying the same principles of the digital/CryptoAsset world to the stock market and they are loving the fact that the old schoolers are hating it,"" billionaire Mark Cuban writes in a blog post. (CoinDesk)      Coinbase has reportedly tapped Nasdaq for its planned direct listing, according to The Block. Existing Coinbase investors have already been trading shares through Nasdaq's Private Market platform, where the company has notched an implied valuation of $50 billion.      Winklevosses' Gemini crypto exchange inks partnership with crypto lender Genesis to give customers option to earn up to 7.4% annual interest on holdings, CoinDesk's Nathan DiCamillo reported. The new offering aims to lure away customers turned off by ""anemic"" interest rates from traditional banks, Gemini COO Noah Perlman said. According to DiCamillo, the annual yield is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic. (Genesis is another CoinDesk sister company.)      OKEx announces plans to integrate Lightning Network in Q1. (OKEx via Twitter)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Robinhood has raised $3.4 billion from investors over the past several days, CoinDesk's Danny Nelson reported. The online trading platform's backers are apparently looking past the blowback from Robinhood's trading suspensions amid the peak of the runup in prices for GameStop, AMC and other ""meme stocks."" CFO Jason Warnick said the cash infusion will help Robinhood ""scale to meet the incredible growth we’ve seen and demand for our platform."" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is expected to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives' financial-services committee on Feb. 18, CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair reported.      Even before the pandemic hit, global debt was at a far higher level than before the financial crisis of 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The figure reached $197 trillion at the end of 2019, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of 226%, according to an International Monetary Fund blog post on Monday. That compares with a ratio of 193% in 2007. But because of unusually accommodative monetary policies (i.e., interest rates set at close to zero or even negative levels), the average debt expense as a share of revenue was 0.3 percentage points lower in 2019, according to the IMF. With U.S. government debt alone rising by about $4 trillion to about $27 trillion, the year-end 2020 numbers are likely to look a lot uglier.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/02/first-mover-federal-reserve-soup-now-includes-bitcoin-defi-silver-gamestop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/499c09ff35939429240fa6a1b732d712525ea7af-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385833,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdF7,1612274407,These Two Firms Want to Upgrade Crypto Infrastructure for Banks and Exchanges,"Announced Tuesday, METACO and Cobalt are launching a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that covers the full gamut of institutional trading requirements for digital assets. In short, it brings a combination of bank-grade custody and post-trade settlement to crypto.      “There is very little institutional-grade infrastructure within digital. In fact, I’m gobsmacked at how little there is,” said Cobalt Chairman Adrian Patten. “Also, I’ve noticed that in the crypto world everyone concentrates on the coin, the crypto bit. They forget the dollar. Whether that's from a risk management perspective, management of collateral or settlement, that's always the thing that holds them back.”      Specifically, the partnership involves integrating METACO’s institutional operating system for digital assets, SILO, with Cobalt’s interoperable FX and digital assets platform to offer a fully integrated end-to-end SaaS solution for the storage, limit allocation and intraday settlement of digital assets, per a press release.      “There’s a lot of friction in the market still,” said Seamus Donoghue, VP of sales and business development at METACO. “When you trade on exchanges or with counterparts in general, you have to pre-fund those positions. That's capital intensive. There's a counterparty risk there as well, and it's just not a very efficient market.”    BBVA, StanChart and more    Between them the two firms have a hand in most of the major crypto banking plays happening in Europe right now. METACO is working on crypto custody with Standard Chartered, BBVA, DBS Bank and Gazprombank Switzerland. Cobalt is also involved with Standard Chartered and has other projects in the pipeline involving the likes of ErisX and LMAX Digital.      Cobalt’s Patten pointed out that banks and many regulated buy-side firms need certain processes and ways of doing things. “You can't go settling a transaction on the back of emails. Which is what happens,” he said.    See also: Standard Chartered Participates in Jammed $18M Round for Crypto Custodian    But it’s not just institutions looking for better digital asset trading infrastructure. Many of the largest crypto exchanges are in talks with the firms too, Patten said.      “Over 75% of our pipeline is crypto firms looking to upgrade their processes,” Patten said. “They’re having massive increases of volume and volatility, and they realize you can't carry on doing it in this way.

42385845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdUD,1612269775,Bullish Bitcoin Fundamentals Point to Renewed Price Rally Ahead,"Bitcoin's on-chain metrics are painting a bullish picture after weeks of consolidation.      The top cryptocurrency hit a peak price of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and has mostly traded the range of $29,000–$40,000 since then, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      However, demand continues to outstrip supply amid the price lull. ""In 2021 so far, around 26,000 BTC have been mined. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Investment Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC in the same period,"" Glassnode said in its weekly report.      Further, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, taking sell-side liquidity off the market.      The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.      Meanwhile, the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – jumped to a new record high of 2,218 on Sunday. The count has increased by over 50 during the recent bout of price consolidation in a sign of continued accumulation by investors large enough to influence market trends.      Lastly, the odds of a deeper drop due to profit-taking appear low, as the 24-hour average of bitcoin's adjusted spent output ratio (aSOPR), recently fell to 1.00, indicating that coins moving between investors are no longer carrying profit. The SOPR metric measures the profit ratio of coins based on the prices when they last moved. The aSOPR ignores all outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour.      Investors typically sell at a loss during bear markets, but bitcoin is currently in a bull market, having rallied by 200% in the past three months.      “For SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market. We have been looking for this reset to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run,” Glassnode recently said. Historically, values below 1.0 have been consistently rejected during bull markets.      So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a convincing bitcoin move above $40,000. ""The breakout may happen in two weeks; everything is bullish now,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Twitter.      However, potential dollar strength may pose temporary risk to bitcoin's bullish outlook. The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is looking north, with the daily chart reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout – a major bullish pattern (below right).      ""If a bullish trend develops from DXY's latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,"" Kruger said, adding that the greenback's bullish move is a short-term noise. The breakout has opened the doors for a rise to 93.00. The DXY is trading near 91.12 at press time, little changed on the day.      Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns while drawing attention to the fact that bitcoin's rally from early November lows near $14,000 happened alongside the DXY's decline from 94.5 to 89.00.      Bitcoin has moved mainly in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since the March markets crash, with the cryptocurrency witnessing consolidation or pullbacks during bouts of strength in USD. Bitcoin's recent decline from record highs and the subsequent consolidation has been accompanied by a recovery rally in the dollar.      The inverse correlation between the two is likely the result of the dollar's negative correlation to the appetite for risk in the global financial markets.      ""Whenever risk sentiment deteriorates around the globe there is a natural desire to move to safety in the form of the U.S. dollar. And by extension, bitcoin, which is still an emerging asset, is exposed to risk-off,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.      However, the dollar's overall trend looks bearish, courtesy of the U.S. Federal Reserve's open-ended money printing strategy, and analysts remain confident about bitcoin's long-term prospects.

42413925,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnSnM,1612267200,Gemini Partners With Crypto Lender Genesis to Offer 7.4% Yield on Customer Deposits,"Editor’s note (Oct. 20, 2023, 21:08 UTC): On Oct. 19, 2023, the New York Attorney General sued Digital Currency Group, Genesis (a subsidiary of DCG) and Gemini, accusing the companies of defrauding investors through Gemini’s Earn program. The complaint alleges that Gemini knew Genesis’ loans were undersecured but did not reveal this information to investors. It cited the Feb. 2, 2021 CoinDesk article below, which quoted a Gemini executive.  CoinDesk, which is a subsidiary of DCG, is not named as a party to the case, and strictly follows its ethics policy:: “We operate independently of our parent company. DCG has no involvement in editorial or content decisions, and our journalists cover DCG and its portfolio companies and investments as they would any other subjects, without fear or favor.”  -- Marc Hochstein, Executive Editor  Gemini, the crypto exchange and custodian, is allowing its customers to earn up to 7.4% annual percentage yield (APY) on their holdings through a partnership with crypto lender Genesis.  “We have a lot of customers who look at the interest rate in traditional finance, which is pretty anemic,” said Noah Perlman, Gemini’s chief operating officer. The company hopes to give customers a reason to keep their crypto on the Gemini platform. The product is in line with other traditional-looking crypto products such as the Gemini credit card launched earlier this year.  The APY is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders, but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The product is offered in all 50 states, including New York where Gemini has its trust license. Users can get yield on any cryptocurrency available on the Gemini platform now and on Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin at some point in the future. The product is open to active Gemini customers currently and will be rolled out to all Gemini customers later this month.

As part of the partnership, Gemini reviewed Genesis’ financial statements and verified that the lender’s loans are overcollateralized, said Yusuf Hussain, Gemini’s head of risk.  This is the third partnership of its kind for Genesis. It also powers interest-bearing accounts at crypto lender Ledn and crypto exchange Luno, which is also owned by Digital Currency Group.  “As far as percentages of loans coming from partnerships, it’s still relatively a small part right now, largely because they are relatively new,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said. “But we expect the numbers to become more significant over time as a sign of the success of these partnerships.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/02/gemini-partners-with-crypto-lender-genesis-to-offer-74-yield-on-customer-deposits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b3f8bb84a1a8c71bb769fe984ba29e9812655b-1500x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value briefly topped $1,500, hitting $1,500.63, during early U.S. trading hours on Tuesday, passing the previous record price $1,459.93 last month, according to CoinDesk 20 data. In recent trading, ETH was at 1.494.26, up 14.28% over the last 24 hours.      The latest leg higher from $1,200 came alongside turmoil in the stock markets, where brokerage platforms like Robinhood have restricted transactions to rein volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders' coordinated buying in stocks such as GameStop. The retail frenzy prompted by Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets forced hedge funds to unwind short bets in GameStop, leading to a 1,700% price rally in the 17 days to Jan. 28.      Crypto analysts believe the restrictive actions could bring more users into the DeFi space, which is dominated by Ethereum's blockchain.      ""With investment and trading platform Robinhood halting trading of certain assets like GameStop and Nokia (NOK), and Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman calling for regulations to prevent retail investors from coordinating on social media, the case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger,"" Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Group, told CoinDesk.      According to Messari's Ryan Selkis, the door for mass adoption of bitcoin, ethereum, DeFi and Web 3.0 assets has been flung open. ""Buy ethereum to secure the fledging decentralized financial system and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your bank to f**k off,"" Selkis noted in Thursday's daily market brief.

According to a report by Politco on Monday, Tenev will likely appear before a virtual hearing titled ""Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media and Retail Investors Collide.""      The hearing, which kicks off at around 10 a.m. ET (17:00 UTC), is being chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who has already voiced her concerns over Robinhood's actions.      ""I am concerned about whether or not Robinhood restricted the trading because there was collusion between Robinhood and some of the hedge funds that were involved with this,” Waters said on MSNBC, as cited by Politico.      Last Thursday, Robinhood limited the ability of traders to buy GameStop and other stocks targeted by Reddit group WallStreetBets, which worked to cause financial harm to large hedge funds by causing a short squeeze on the hedge funds betting against the stocks.      Tenev said his platform acted to protect itself and customers during a tumultuous trading period where demand outstripped its ability to facilitate obligatory deposits to clearinghouses.
