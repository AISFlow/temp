42427505,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnJh,1493323513,R3 Blasts JP Morgan Consortium Exit as 'At Odds' With Global Banks,"JP Morgan has officially exited the global bank consortium led by distributed ledger startup R3.  A representative of the bank confirmed the departure when reached, but declined further comment. The news was first reported by Reuters earlier today.  The move comes months after the financial institution was rumored to be one of a group of banks looking to exit R3's funding round, though it was reported to still be a member of the consortium at the time. Banco Santander and Goldman Sachs exited the initiative fully in November of last year.  The exit is notable as JP Morgan was among the initial group of banks to join the consortium, launched as a collaborative effort between institutions through which they tested a number of applications.  When reached for comment, R3 managing director Charley Cooper painted the move as one that makes JP Morgan an outlier among its global peers.  He told CoinDesk:  ""JP Morgan parted ways with R3 to pursue a very distinct technology path which is at odds with what the global financial services industry, represented by our 80-plus members, have chosen.""  In recent months, JP Morgan has pursued a more singular technology strategy.  For example, CoinDesk reported in February that JPMorgan was one of the backers of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an effort aimed at creating enterprise technology solutions based on the open-source ethereum blockchain.  JPMorgan has also invested in its own distributed ledger tech.  Called Quorum, the technology was introduced via a meeting with Hyperledger's technical steering committee, though here too the bank has not yet submitted its project for incubation. The bank is also a contributing member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project.

Reports from websites include Freedom’s Phoenix and Phoenix New Times indicate that Thomas Costanzo was arrested on 20th April for unlawful possession of ammunition stemming from a prior conviction. The arrest resulted from a home raid led by the US Department of Homeland Security.  Yet warrant documents obtained by Freedom’s Phoenix suggest that authorities are investigating other aspects of Costanzo’s activities, including his use or sale of digital currencies including bitcoin, ethereum and dash.  Costanzo, who uses the moniker ""Morpheus Titania"" online, operates a bitcoin-centered website that was updated as of 3rd April. According to the site, Costanzo has been a full-time bitcoin trader for the past three years, while also sellinghttp://bitcoinandcash.rocks/products/ bitcoin miners and ATMs.  One of the warrant documents approves the search for ""digital currency including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, or other digital coin 'altcoin', or any other financial instrument believed to be proceeds of money laundering or drug sales"".  Further along, the warrant identifies records for ""digital Bitcoin transactions"" and devices capable of retaining ""virtual currency applications [and] crypto-currency wallet applications"" as other items for seizure.  A complaint and subsequent indictment filed in the US District Court for the District of Arizona, however, only account for the allegedly unlawful possession of ammunition. New Times suggested in its report that additional charges could be filed, but its unclear at this time whether that will happen.  According to Freedom's Phoenix, Costanzo is scheduled to appear at a detention hearing on 27th April.

42427521,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnjh,1493308822,Antbleed: Bitcoin's Newest New Controversy Explained,"A mining chip vulnerability that could potentially be used to remotely shut off bitcoin mining machines was revealed yesterday – with a fix from the manufacturer following shortly after.  Involving controversial mining chip manufacturer Bitmain, the issue is what some are calling a ""backdoor"" in the code that controls its hardware, offering the company a way to remotely shut off the miners. Since the code, released anonymously last evening, is vulnerable to attackers, the main concern is whether, in a worst-case scenario, it could be misused.  The fear is that bad actors could exploit the vulnerability to switch off bitcoin mining equipment in bulk, and with Bitmain supplying such a large number of machines to the market, the impact could have catastrophic implications for the bitcoin ecosystem.  Known as Antbleed (a title bestowed by the website that dramatized its release), the vulnerability is open-source, making it easy to verify. Leading up to the reveal, a group was told about the code feature, with some developers, such as Satoshi Labs CEO Marek Palatinus independently verifying that the backdoor exists and that it can be used to stop Bitmain miners on trigger.  Bitmain quickly responded with a fix that erases this part of its mining firmware. Further, its team claimed that the feature was never finished, and that it was intended to help customers recover stolen miners, a past problem for industry firms.  The statement reads:  ""We never intended to use this feature on any Antminer without authorization from its owner. This is similar to the remote erase or shutdown feature provided by most famous smartphone manufacturers.""  Much of the recent buzz in the community is around whether the so-described ""backdoor"" could have been used for malicious purposes, for example, to shut off a miner if it wasn’t complying with rules set by Bitmain.  Adding to the confusion is that bitcoin developments have been highly politicized lately, with Bitmain often sitting at the center of bitcoin’s long-standing scaling debate, opposing proposals authored by members of the Bitcoin Core community. For example, the vulnerability reveal follows allegations that the manufacturer was using a secret mining advantage to boost its profits.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun might have summed up the issue and surrounding atmosphere the best:  ""The drama in social media today surrounds the question of whether there exists a security hole that would allow this remote-control feature to be exploited for nefarious purposes.""  Code details  Still, it seems that there are other reasons to be concerned about the backdoor.  Since it can be exploited by bad actors from outside the company, the mining chips are now viewed as a security risk to the network. Every one to 11 minutes, according to the open-source patch introduced on July 12th, 2016, the machines send calls back to a Bitmain server.  The idea is that the mining manufacturer can scan for identifying information about the mining chip, including its serial number and IP address.  But, arguably the biggest concern is that the code isn't limited to use by certain people or companies, so it can be exploited by any man-in-the-middle or attacks coming from the same DNS server.  ""Even without Bitmain being malicious, the API is unauthenticated and would allow any MITM, DNS or domain hijack to shut down Antminers globally,"" the Antbleed website reads, further outlining concerns about the potential for technical or political misuse.  Vulnerability or 'malicious' backdoor?  Whether or not it was intended to be malicious seems to make up the bulk of the surrounding debate, and so far, it seems that sentiment has broken along the lines of the scaling debate.  Still, some broke away from so-called party lines.  ""This was reckless of them to leave the unfinished feature in the code since this represents a major security issue,"" said Henry Brade, CEO of bitcoin service provider Prasos, a past defender of Bitcoin Core’s scaling proposals.  ""However, based on the statement it is not accurate to call 'Antbleed' malicious in nature. It's simply a serious security issue.""  F2pool operator Wang Chun further noted that, he isn’t particularly worried about miners within his pool falling victim to manipulation by Bitmain. He noted in conversation with CoinDesk that it doesn’t seem like the company ever used it to shut down miners.  ""They have been able to do that for a long time, but they didn't,"" he said.  Guy Corem, former CEO of Israeli mining chip maker Spondoolies-Tech, chalked up the controversy to ""incompetence” and ""negligence"", rather than malicious intent.  ""It make sense they wanted to develop such feature and it also make sense they didn't complete it and abandon it,"" he added. Further, he cited Spondoolies-Tech’s own past issues with stolen mining equipment.  Still, some in the community are skeptical of Bitmain’s response.  ""Denial of many people is unbelievable. 'Antbleed' is not bug or mistake. The purpose of the code is clear; shut down miner on remote flag,"" Palatinus tweeted.  Public info?  Others have raised concerns about this vulnerability being made public, since outsiders can then take advantage of the attack vector.  Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo argued that owners of these bitcoin miners needed to know about the potential vulnerability in order to fix it.  ""The issue is it's already integrated in a ton of deployed hardware,"" he said, adding:  ""It was reported to Bitmain via that bug report months ago, and their customers need to know to protect their operations from potential [man-in-the-middle attacks].""  The issue was first reported to Bitmain on Githubhttps://github.com/bitmaintech/bmminer/issues/7 in September 2016.  One question is how prevalent the practice is in bitcoin. Secret backdoors seem to be par for the course in the technology world, often drawing security-minded critics as they're uncovered. Do other hardware manufacturers have the same vulnerability? Two mining manufacturers, at least, claim that they don’t.  ""Our hardware doesn't [have] such issues, we [don’t] offer remote update for firmware – it's the customer's decision update them or not,” said blockchain startup Bitfury Group CIO Alex Petrov.  ""My miner has no ASICBoost or backdoor,"" Jack Liao, CEO of mining LightningAsic, told CoinDesk.  Along with the details about the backdoor, those who detected it released a patch that closes it up with a single line of code.  Mining centralization  Still, there are lingering worries that the vulnerability betrays a weakness in the bitcoin network – namely, it's lack of mining chip makers.  No clear data is available about how many miners are running this software, but Bitmain is one the largest chip manufacturers in the space, with bolder estimates suggesting it produces 70% of all mining chips.  That the backdoor could be used to impact any of those chips is unsurprisingly alarming to advocates that the network be ""decentralized"" and open to competition that enables different actors to engage on it.  For now, the impact seems to be that Bitmain will take action to look at the rest of its codebase in order to spot other vulnerabilities.  ""The controversy around this code has brought our attention to improve the design in order to address vulnerabilities that were pointed out by the community recently,"" its statement reads.  Still, others are lamenting the state of the drama and conversation around the issue, noting how quickly it became politicized.  Rizun concluded:  ""All-in-all just another day in bitcoin.""

42427525,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnnh,1493306727,Bitcoin's Price Sets New All-Time High,"The price of bitcoin has set a new all-time high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Prices hit a high of $1,330.72 at press time, surpassing the previous all-time high of roughly $1,325.81 set on 10th March in the run-up to what was ultimately a rejection of a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the SEC.  At press time, the price had edged up past the $1,330 mark.  The boost comes amid an increasingly active time for the industry as it relates to public markets, as the SEC has since revealed that it is reviewing a petition submitted by the Bats BZX Exchange that will find it reconsidering the listing of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF.  The price move caps a bullish month for the digital currency, which on 1st April averaged just under $1,100, an increase of roughly 20% in just a span of weeks.  However, the event coincides also with developments in the bitcoin exchange sector that suggest the health of its infrastructure may be wavering.  Bitfinex, BTC-e and OKCoin, three leading exchanges, have all faced banking pressures in recent weeks some analysts believe could be creating artificial price pressures.  Fear index  Elsewhere in the exchange ecosystem, prices are far higher than observed on the BPI, with bitcoin trading at $1,430 on Bitfinex, roughly $100 higher than prices observed on GDAX, a regulated US exchange where the price was $1,331, at one point earlier in the day.  The divergence in pricing began a week ago, but has shown no signs of narrowing.  As for how this is affecting sentiment among Bitfinex exchange users, it seems investor confidence is stabilizing, with the total observed in a cold wallet held by the exchange declining of late.  Also on the decline is the premium buyers at Bitfinex are paying for bitcoin, with the following chart illustrating the price differential between the exchange and another market competitor, UK-based Bitstamp.  As for now, the exchange indicates it is looking for another correspondent bank, though in remarks, the company's representatives have framed this as an uphill battle.  Overall, traders and investors remain optimistic about the long-term price of bitcoin, as well as the health of the market, noting the abundance of available exchanges currently in place to support trading activity.

Institutions including Bank of Yokohama, Mizuho Financial Group and Resona Bank are taking part in the new trial, according to a report from Nikkei.  The test is the latest from the unnamed consortium, which is led by financial services firm SBI Holdings and a joint venture between that firm and distributed ledger startup Ripple, first launched in January 2016.  More than 50 institutions are part of the initiative, which has tested other applications of Ripple's tech in the past.  According to Nikkei, the banks want to assess the ability to send domestic fund transfers outside of normal operating hours, as well as to see how a virtual currency used between banks could cut costs. Further, the banks are said to be weighing the creation of a wholly new virtual currency or digital token for this purpose.  Additionally, the test could expand beyond domestic transfers, the outlet reported.  ""The consortium is also considering testing virtual currency-based international fund transfers. The hope is that the use of blockchain technology may be able to lower costs compared with SWIFT, the global payments network,"" Nikkei said.

42427508,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnPh,1493298015,Catastrophic Property Risks? There's a Blockchain for That,"Defending against the uncertainties of the future is expensive.  Today, a network of insurance companies exists to insure the insurance companies that insure insurance companies that insure people against uncertainties as varied as sinkholes and tornadoes.  It's a process called 'reinsurance', and there's even something called a 'retrocessionaire', a company that insures the reinsurance companies against even broader liabilities.  At every turn in this complicated, $4.5tn mesh of insurance services are parties and counterparties, of all shapes and sizes trying to eke out the most efficiency possible from their particular quadrant of the system.  To stay ahead of the competition, a group of five of the largest insurance companies in the world have been working since October to use blockchain to do exactly that. But progress on the effort dubbed B3i kicked up a notch earlier this year, when the consortium added 10 new members and laid out the plan for a real-world blockchain application.  As detailed to CoinDesk, the group is now working on a prototype aimed at simplifying the way reinsurance companies deal with 'excessive loss' resulting from property damaged as a result of catastrophic risks.  If successful, the app being constructed with open-source code provided by the Hyplerledger blockchain consortium has the potential to cut down settlement times between reinsurance companies and insurance companies from as long as seven weeks, to nearly instantly, while making a number of other improvements along the way.  In conversation with CoinDesk, B3i co-founder Paul Meeusen explained how a team of 15 individuals is working in a tailor-made office in Munich with a single goal in mind – to complete the prototype in just three months.  Meeusen, head of finance and treasury service at Swiss Re, said:  ""We are trying to make the contract set-up all the way to settlement...much leaner, and also a much better customer experience for our reinsurance clients.""  Work so far  B3i launchedhttps://www.munichre.com/en/media-relations/publications/company-news/2016/2016-10-19-company-news/index.html last year with founding members Aegon, Allianz, Munich Re, Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance Group, and soon added several more, including Liberty Mutual, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance and Tokio Marine Holdings.  After an initial exploratory phase where each of the members committed three employees to the project, 'friendly competitor' Munich Re dedicated part of a two-floor tech laboratory in Munich to the consortium with the goal of implementing an an agile scrum development methodology.  Beginning last month, a joint development comprised of members of the consortium engaged in six two-week 'sprints' with a number of objectives toward the goal of creating a risk property insurance contract that self-executes on a single ledger upon which each insurance company can do business.  By using blockchain to create a common technology protocol, Meeusen believes his employer and the other members of the consortium will be able to focus on competing in ways that actually impact their clients, instead of getting distracted by technological differences.  ""I will still compete against Munich Re thinking my risk assessment and my pricing is better,"" said Meeusen. ""But it will be one platform. So, better and faster for you as a buyer of reinsurance.""  Russian doll insurance  Today, reinsurance companies help ensure the insurance companies that support corporations and people remain solvent, in even the direst circumstances. Typically, the reinsurance only kicks in in extreme scenarios, hence the focus on catastrophes.  But as a result of these complicated relationships, reconciliation times between each company's independently-managed ledger can take weeks.  By the the time the exchange rates are calculated across multiple currencies and the cash is freed up in the right amount, almost two-thirds of a quarter could elapse, resulting in an almost continual state of reconciliation. Instead, B3i's Munich operation is working to use Hyperledger tech to move that entire process to a single, distributed ledger.  The results Meeusen forecasts include savings of working capital as a result of more efficient controls over premium collection and claims reimbursement, decreased transaction costs resulting from more efficient foreign exchanges and fewer operational risks as a result of the same process being repeated by insurers, brokers, reinsurers and retrocessionaires.  ""Sharing, with some intelligence, and safety, really seemed like a magic combination,"" said Meeusen. ""Because those were really the three things I’d seen for a long time as the key to the issues we were dealing with.""  Common language  Going forward, Meeusen says B3i will focus on two main areas of improvement.  First, he says that the consortia is in the process of converting the data standards and forms provided by insurance standards company Acord into the smart contract language selected by the group.  While he didn't share the smart contract language being used by B3i, he said earlier work done internally at Swiss Re was being executed using ethereum’s Solidity.  At the moment, the contracts are being designed to settle transactions in the fiat currencies accepted by the members. But in the future, he'd like to be able to accept cryptocurrencies as a way to settle balances between counterparties with longer-term contracts.  Second, the consortium has put in place a process for interacting with large insurance brokers around the world, including in North America, who he says have expressed interest in joining.  Already, existing B3i member, Germany-based Allianz, has tested an internal blockchain solution for catastrophe bonds, and New York-based Symbiont offers its own catastrophe swaps blockchain solutions to insurance companies.  While applications to join B3i are currently closed, come June when the consortium reveals the results of its prototype, that will likely change.  ""We then want to very openly do a roadshow type of information sharing, to really share what worked, and what did not work so well,"" he said, concluding:  ""Only then proceed to the next step, if all goes well, to operationalize what we have already done and further widen the scope.""

Fresh off spending nearly 20 years working at Goldman Sachs – first as a vice president, then as the managing director of technology business development – Jessop had been revealed as the new president of the heavily funded blockchain company just a week before.  His excuse? The day before marked the Easter holiday, and he had other priorities.  ""I didn't want to leave on Easter Sunday,"" Jessop said. ""My family would have been very unhappy.""  But after his first week in the startup's San Francisco offices, Jessop has now turned his attention to priorities of a different sort. Namely, how he might help steer a company that has raised $40m in venture capital.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The thing for us is, how do we create more of an inflection point? So, I think from a marketing standpoint, we're going to redouble our efforts to really engage.""  Action plan  Specifically, Jessop's push falls into two categories.  The first is to engage with the open-source developer community, which he sees as crucial to the startup's success. In October, 2016, Chain open-sourced its Chain Core developer platform, including a test network operated by Chain, Microsoft and the IC3 blockchain think tank.  Citing downloads and other metrics on Chain Core's GitHub page, Jessop said adoption has been growing, but added that so far the company hasn't put its ""foot on the gas"".  Going forward, he wants to see Chain focus on refining a turnkey experience that accelerates the time to market for developers.  Jessop's second priority is engaging with the banks and other financial institutions that Chain might consider as possible clients. Already, Chain counts Nasdaq and Visa among its early public customers, and there are other ""large institutions"" currently in the pipeline, he said.  In addition to playing a pivotal role in Goldman's early relationship with Chain, Jessop developed a reputation in the financial community for helping traditional banks improve the way they do business.  And after 17 years working at Goldman Sachs, helping to manage and found startups focused on solving what he calls ""mystery problems"", Jessop's Rolodex is full.  ""I always identified very strongly with the companies and the entrepreneurs that we were backing,"" said Jessop. ""And I loved the creative process, folks trying to transform things for the better.""  Learning phase  Founded in 2014, Chain raised its most recent funding in 2015, a $30m round led by RRE Ventures.  In addition to early users of Chain's open-source platform including Capital One, Citigroup, Fidelity and State Street, the firm is more formally working with Nasdaq on a series of blockchain solutions. Further, in October 2016, Chain partnered with one of its investors, Visa, to help build out a B2B payments solution.  As far back as 2015, Jessop said, he had crossed paths with Chain CEO Adam Ludwin during a scouting trip for possible investments. Then, when the two were both invited to Washington, DC, last year for a meeting with the Federal Reserve, Jessop said the idea of working together more formally started to gain momentum.  Now that he's with the firm, Jessop said he's so far mostly employing his skills at Chain by asking questions.  ""I'm just listening at this point,"" he said, concluding:  ""Hopefully, I’ll get to the point soon where the sponge is saturated and I can start reflecting things back to the team.""

42427509,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnRh,1493290804,Blockchain Lets This Startup Trade Gold That's Still in the Ground,"During the past year, a number of blockchain projects have focused on trading bullion, but what about gold that's still in the ground?  That seemingly unlikely business model is precisely the aim of a new partnership announced last month between Orebits, a startup providing asset-digitization for precious metal reserves, and blockchain product provider Symbiont.  The deal would see the creation of so-called smart certificates, or smart contract investment instruments, tied to proven gold reserves (supplies of the metal known to be in the ground, but that haven't yet been processed).  Despite the physical restrictions of the gold itself, the smart certificates, known as 'orebits', can now be freely traded and exchanged as tokens on a blockchain platform provided by Symbiont.  Michael Zimits, Orebits’ president and COO, told CoinDesk that each of the certificates will be backed by five ounces of proven gold reserves.  He said:  ""Orebits derive their value from the price of traded gold, providing exposure to the price movement of the precious metal without having to deal with the physical properties and logistical concerns of holding the asset in tangible form.""  As for how someone might confirm the gold reserves are real, Zimits explained that the smart contracts house this information directly.  ""This documentation is made available on the distributed ledger as part of the smart contract and includes geological surveys and findings, geologist verification, registered chain of custody, corporate documentation and owner background verification,"" he said.  As such, the partnership represents the latest effort to bridge the worlds of gold and blockchain. So far this year, companies like Euroclear and long-standing institutions like the UK Royal Mint have revealed plans to launch marketplaces enabling gold exchange via the technology.  In this light, Orebits is the latest entry in what is proving to be an attractive use case for blockchain, and further fits into the broader trend of enterprises seeking to leverage blockchain tech to open new revenue streams.

In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Brito discusses one of the first major regulatory hearings centered on bitcoin in the US.  On 18th November, 2013, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held the US Congress's first hearing on bitcoin.  These days, such meetings hardly raise an eyebrow. Back then, though, the hearing was a big deal for obvious reasons – and I testified.  First, it's important to remember this hearing came at the end of a string of announcements that, while aiming to clarify how the industry was regulated, ended up stoking fears among users.  In March of that year, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidance applying anti-money laundering rules to bitcoin businesses. Then in August, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) began its inquiry by unceremoniously subpoenaing 22 bitcoin companies and investors. And lastly, in October, federal agents shut down the Silk Road (a dark market largely powered by bitcoin).  Against this backdrop, it was with great tension that many were watching the bitcoin hearing's webcast live around the globe.  What would the Secret Service say about bitcoin? How about the Department of Justice (DoJ)? Or the US Treasury? What effect would it have on the ecosystem?  ***  My bitcoin journey began on 9th February, 2011, when I listened to episode 287 of one of my favorite podcasts, ""Security Now"". Steve Gibson spent 45 minutes explaining in detail this crazy new invention called bitcoin, and he was in awe of it. I was, too.  Once you understood how bitcoin worked, it was obvious what a profoundly disruptive force it would be. And working in technology policy in Washington, DC, it was clear to me that its regulatory implications were vast.  So I started researching, especially as it related to bitcoin and the law, which came up pretty sparse. I even asked around DC, but both the policy shops and government agencies hadn't heard much.  So, in April, in Time, I published what would be the first article about bitcoin in a mainstream publication.  At that time, I was directing the technology policy program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and while I worked on a number of tech policy issues, bitcoin was increasingly taking up more of my time. I was developing a reputation in DC as the guy to call if you had a bitcoin question. The questions at first came here and there, but by 2013, they were frequent.  ***  Some time in the spring 2013, I got asked by staff from the US Senate Homeland Security Committee to come in and talk about bitcoin.  I accepted. And that's when I first met John Collins, a staffer for chairman Tom Carper. John had become very interested in the technology and had started the inquiry at the committee (just over a year later, he would join Coinbase to head up its government outreach).  In the meantime, he and his colleagues were asking serious and thoughtful questions about bitcoin, its illicit uses and its innovative potential.  It was refreshing that the committee staff were approaching the issue so professionally and open-mindedly. Most folks don't realize it, but by the time a hearing happens, its outcome is often a foregone conclusion. The real work of educating members and staff happens in the weeks and months leading up to the actual hearing. So, it was good they were as interested in understanding bitcoin's benefits as they were about its risks.  It was also good that my colleague Andrea Castillo and I were close to publishing ""Bitcoin: A Primer for Policymakers"", a monograph we'd been working on after anticipating just this kind of educational need.  In May, I attended the bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose, which was a watershed moment for the ecosystem. It was an amazing gathering of people and the air was electric with possibilities.  It started to become clear that bitcoin was what I was doing with my life. At the conference, I met Patrick Murck who was then general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation. I also met KT Sagona of Thomson Reuters.  ***  Thomson Reuters was partnering with the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children to put on a major one-day conference in DC for technologists, policymakers and law enforcement to discuss the ""virtual economy"" (by which they meant bitcoin and Tor).  They asked me and Patrick to participate. Knowing Patrick would be in town with Gavin Andresen (who at the time was the grown-up face of bitcoin), I introduced them to the Senate Homeland Security Committee staff who were looking to talk to more experts.  After the conference, ICMEC/Thomson-Reuters created a task force of government, law enforcement, academics and policy experts to study the benefits and risks of digital currencies and online markets. Patrick and I were again asked to participate, and so was Jim Harper of the Cato Institute and Kelley Misata of the Tor Project.  During the various task force meetings, Patrick, Jim, Kelley and I made a couple of simple but very important points over and over again:  The benefits of these technologies outweigh the risks (or at the very least we need a better assessment of the risks).  If you place too high a regulatory burden on these innovations, you will effectively cede them to the very illicit actors you're trying to stop.  In July, Patrick and the Bitcoin Foundation organized a major briefing for law enforcement hosted by FinCEN, where same message was delivered.  By the time the hearing came around, we had forged a consensus on the risks posed by bitcoin.  ***  During the hearing, there was a government panel that included FinCEN, the Secret Service and the DoJ, and an experts panel that included me, Patrick, Ernie from ICMEC and Jeremy Allaire of Circle – a startup that had just been launched to much fanfare the previous month.  The day came and, well, I can't put it better than The Washington Post did in its headline: ""This Senate hearing is a Bitcoin lovefest.""  ""High-level international cybercriminals have not by-and-large gravitated to the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin,"" testified the Secret Service witness, Edward W Lowery.  ""These virtual currencies are not in and of themselves illegal. There is good reason for us to remain watchful, but we also intend to balance that against the need for legitimate users,"" said the DoJ.  And FinCEN’s Jennifer Shasky Calvery answered a question from Chairman Carper: ""Cash is probably still the best medium for laundering money.""  And there were the first words in Ernie Allen's testimony:  ""Let me begin by saying we are enthusiastic about the potential of virtual currencies and the digital economy for social good, particularly in helping to bring about financial inclusion for the 2.5 billion adults on the planet today without access to banks, credit cards, and the mainstream financial system.""  You can imagine what Patrick, Jeremy and I said.  ***  The next day there was another hearing on bitcoin by the Senate Banking Committee. When they had heard that the Homeland Security Committee had scheduled a hearing, they had scurried to schedule one of their own to make sure they, too, were claiming jurisdiction.  What was most interesting to me was what Senator Chuck Schumer had to say.  Six months earlier, Schumer had written a letter to the Attorney General expressing concern about online drug markets and he'd told the press that bitcoin was ""an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money and to disguise who's both selling and buying the drug"".  On the day of the hearing, he began his statement this way:  ""A while back, as you know, I called on federal authorities to shut down the website Silk Road, which they recently did. Many people interpreted my action at the time as directed at bitcoin because bitcoin was the sole method of payment on Silk Road, and assumed that I also wanted to shut down or stamp out bitcoin. That is not the case. I do not want to shut down or stamp out bitcoin.""  Bitcoin had jumped a major hurdle.  The message from official Washington was clear: bitcoin was not illegal or illegitimate, it was an important innovation – even if, like most new technologies, it presented challenges to law enforcement.  The industry and ecosystem around bitcoin was serious and replete with businesses and individuals who could be counted on to help fend off illicit uses.  It really couldn’t have gone better and, of course, the price of bitcoin jumped about 20% (although a couple of months later, Mt Gox imploded).  At the time both of these hearings were scheduled, I knew we were at a major turning point, and government interest in bitcoin hasn't let up yet.

42427512,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnTh,1493283604,7 United Nations Agencies Are Now Investigating Blockchain Applications,"The UN is seeking outside input for a previously undisclosed, multi-agency effort focused on applications of blockchain tech.  CoinDesk exclusively reported this week that the UN's World Food Program (WFP) wants to leverage cryptocurrencies like ethereum to transmit financial aid to impoverished areas. A pilot test scheduled for next month will cover 10,000 recipients, an amount expected to grow to as many as 500,000 by next year.  However, new information highlights how more than one agency at the UN is working on exploring blockchain.  The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) has organized a cross-agency working group specifically focused on blockchain, which includes the WFP, but also the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Development Group (UNDG).  According to a request for information issued by UNOPS and posted on 24th April, the group is soliciting input from blockchain industry stakeholders.  The agency wrote:  ""UNOPS and the member organizations of [the] UN blockchain group have been analyzing the possible applicability of the existing or emerging blockchain-based services to the international assistance area and is conducting market research for such services, associated technologies, tools, services and concepts applicable for the use in the international assistance.""  Among the applications being discussed are contributions denominated in digital currencies, supply chain management tools, self-auditing of payments, identity management and data storage.  The UN has set a deadline of 14th May for responses, and indicated that it may invite some respondents to give presentations before the blockchain working group.  CoinDesk has previously reported on efforts by UNICEF and the UNDP to explore possible blockchain applications related to humanitarian efforts.
