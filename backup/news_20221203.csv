First off, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols rely heavily on CEXs to function properly and “it would likely take a long time until the center of the price discovery process in crypto market shifts from centralized exchanges to DeFi,” the team wrote in a recent note to clients. They added that DEXs are not adequate for big-money investors given their slower transaction speeds or “their trading strategies and order size to be traceable on the blockchain.” For (on-chain) DEXs, since everything can be traced on the blockchain, it's next to impossible to commingle funds without raising attention. That's exactly what FTX (off-chain CEX) reportedly did when it loaned out half of its customer funds to its sister company Alameda Research in an effort to fund risky bets. While overall trading activity on DEXs appeared to have increased in recent weeks, that early-stage shift is more likely a function of the deleveraging that followed FTX’s collapse, the team explained. Bernstein highlighted this trend in a note last week, saying the demise of FTX is putting crypto self-custody , which allows users to store their own tokens instead of relying on off-chain exchanges, “back in vogue.” Moreover, DEX trading volumes for last month hit the highest level seen since May, rising to $103.84B in November versus $57.6B in October, data from DeFiLlama showed, signaling decreased confidence in CEXs. Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said the FTX mess is a “body blow” to trust in the crypto industry and trust in the system. But JPMorgan is still taking the contrarian view, noting DEX’s absence of limit order/stop loss functionality, smart contract risk (hacks and protocol attacks), their need for over-collateralization, and the pooling of assets into liquidity pools. “Risk/return tradeoff [is] more difficult to assess in DeFi given the use of different tokens in terms of assets borrowed or lent/collateral posted/received interest payments and given the general absence of limit order/stop loss functionality,” the note read. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world's largest digital token by market cap, dipped as much as 7.3% in the days following FTX filing for bankruptcy on November 11, though almost all of those losses were erased at the time of writing. All in all, however, the token is was still down over 70% from its November 2021 peak. See why Seeking Alpha contributor Vincent Ventures thinks the ""FTX pain is bitcoin's gain.""

5098277,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511019,1670083825,"TRON Unfazed By Decreasing Volumes, Tallies $1 Billion In USDT Inflow","TRON (TRX) remains in a stagnant phase, refusing to make any kind of momentum for an upward run despite a number of positive developments that, in many cases if not all, should have helped trigger a significant price movement. Let’s consider this summary: TRON’s seven-day jump was less than 2% During the last 30 days, TRX has already lost 12% of its value Tron blockchain enjoys a significant boost in its stablecoin inflow Instead, the asset continues to consolidate within a narrow range and is not showing any signs of immediate recovery. According to the latest information provided by Coingecko, at the time of this writing, TRX is trading at $0.053957. It only managed to climb by 1.6% during the last week although it is nursing an increase of 6.3% over the last 14 days. TRON, currently the 17th largest crypto asset in terms of overall valuation with a market cap of $4.97 billion, has already gone down by more than 12% on its month-to-date (MTD) performance. Not even the news of its mother platform registering a massive stablecoin inflow was enough to make the asset push its price to higher levels. Tron has seen significant USDT inflows over the past 2 weeks. In total, over $1 Billion of USDT have entered the chain pic.twitter.com/bbB6XRruvi — DefiLlama.com (@DefiLlama) December 1, 2022 TRON Performs Well In Stablecoin Inflow Last Month Using Twitter, pseudonymous DeFi Llama shared that the Tron decentralized platform observed an inflow of $1 billion USDT for the past two weeks. The most notable date during the said time frame was November 18 when the blockchain registered its highest stablecoin inflow. Meanwhile, November 24 and 28 were the other dates when the network experienced spikes in the particular department. At a quick glance, this development meant that investors are taking action and are showing tremendous trust for the project. Skeptics, however, were quick to assume that might not have been the case and that Tron founder Justin Sun was behind all of it in his attempt to pump liquidity for TRX. Nonetheless, this didn’t help Tron’s crypto asset as it continues to struggle in finding its groove to break out of its slump to surge in value. TRX In Neutral Stance Basing on the crypto’s four-hour chart, it could be noticed that its Awesome Oscillator (AO) was pegged to be at 0.00045. Such value is not indicative of a bullish or a bearish movement, therefore it would make sense to say that TRON is currently caught in a neutral momentum.

Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) suggests there is a strong directional push that is going in the way of buyers. However, buyers may not hold their advantage for a long time as indicated by the cryptocurrency’s Average Directional Index (ADI). As for forecasts for TRX, Coincodex says the asset will experience a slight price decline within the next five days and will change hands at $0.053338 by December 9. Come January 3, the digital coin will possess a lower trading price of $0.039659.

After going all the way up to $0.7339 on November 5, the asset was on a consistent decline that pulled it down to a monthly low of $0.3611 on November 22. Below, a summary of how MANA has been performing in the last few days: MANA registered an increase of more than 6% over the last seven days The crypto asset succeeded in recapturing the $0.40 marker A climb above the $0.50 category remains possible for the token Since then, the digital token has engaged in multiple attempts to trim its losses, starting with recapturing the crucial $0.4 marker. So far, the crypto has been successful in this endeavor. At the time of this writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, the altcoin has managed to increase its value by 3% during the last 24 hours to trade at $0.4174. Over the previous seven days, MANA has tallied an impressive gain of 6.2% and its price action indicates traders are poised to make profit with the asset. More Bullish Breakout Possible For MANA When the bulls successfully found a resting zone at $0.2572 after the FTX implosion last month that made the cryptocurrency lose all its gains prior to the unfortunate event, MANA price movement ended up being caught in an ascending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Chainlink May Rise 25% This Week As Bulls Work To Reclaim Its Pre-Crash Value Source: TradingView In crypto space, this kind of price trajectory denotes a bullish rally and, in the case of the crypto, some of its technical indicators are suggesting it is not yet done recovering its losses and is headed for another upward breakout. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is steadily rising and has moved out of the oversold territory, indicative of diminishing seller influence and increasing buying opportunities. Moreover, after being flat for about two weeks, the altcoin’s On-Balance Volume (OBV) moved up, indicating a rise in trading volume brought about by healthy buying momentum. Finally, MANA has established a bullish MACD which is considered to be a buy signal for an early uptrend. Given all of these considerations, experts predict that if Bitcoin, being the leader of the pack, is able to recapture and hold the $17K turf, the Decentraland digital token will have $0.4740 and $0.5054 as its next destination. Investors Should Still Be Wary Holders, prospective buyers and traders must not be complacent due to the idea that they could make sizable profit from MANA right now as there’s still a chance that the bullish thesis could be negated. Analysts believe that if the crypto fails to close today’s sessions with a price that is higher than the $0.3572 support zone, it will abandon any chance it has of hitting its next targets. Moreover, Bitcoin is also integral to MANA’s progress as its failure to sustain the $17K region could doom the 57th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. At the time of this writing, BTC is changing hands at $17,025 and is dangerously close of falling back to the $16,000 region once again.

5091544,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510998,1670069551,FTX Crash Triggers Major Selloff In Solana Price – How Deep Will SOL Dive?,"Solana (SOL), post-FTX life, has been very rough. On a monthly and biweekly time frame, CoinGecko data shows bearishness, while daily and weekly time frames show modest appreciation. What this proves is that the wounds left by the demise of FTX have not been healed by Solana’s native token. Ever since FTX collapsed, SOL has been losing a huge amount energy. As bearish signals continue to emerge from technical analysis, the price decrease is likely to continue. It’s possible that prices will fall down below the 61.80 Fibonacci level, which is now at $12.58. This may be because Alameda Research, FTX’s sibling in the business, had a significant role in the Solana ICO. Investor trust plummeted as concerns about Solana’s close ties to SBF and his company developed in the wake of the failing exchange’s holding of almost a billion in SOL. Is The Star Just Fading Or Dying? SOL was the poster child of DeFi in that side of the crypto industry. As of writing, the token is trading at a red candle at $13.55, a staggering 62.2% decrease in value from its $36.83 price pre-FTX. However, Solana’s prospects are bleak even before the crash. Messari’s Q3 report on Solana reveals that only certain ecosystem components, such as NFTs, have truly stabilized and even flourished.

The RSI readings are oversold, while the metric is slowly gaining pace. This is backed by a favorable increase in the CMF index. However, this occurs on a daily basis. In the 4-hour time frame, it created a triangle that is, to say the least, bearish. With a Pearson’s R score of 0.7, the regression channel confirms a further downward push, indicating that a downtrend is more likely than an uptrend. The narrow BB channel is likewise extremely bearish. Not to mention the resistance posed by the center band. Anxiety Pervading In Solana’s Ecosystem? FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) is prevalent in this case. The market is dominated by fear and a negative market mood as a result of Solana’s tight relations to FTX. The 4-hour timeline provides insight about SOL’s future course. The $13.07 is a vital support zone for SOL to stay out of extinction. If the indicated support is breached by the bears, a plunge below the 61.80 Fibonacci level is not out of the question.

In addition, crypto firms exposed to FTX got a fair share of the bitter pill. Investigations have been ongoing to determine the location of the $8 billion hole in FTX’s balance sheet, which caused the liquidity crunch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Usher In December Near $18,000 If It Moves Past This Resistance The deficit in FTX’s balance sheet kept growing. The firm initially declared only $2 billion and later said it was $5 billion. The hole has now grown to over $8 billion. In a recent Bloomberg interview, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), FTX former CEO, revealed the whereabouts of the funds. SBF said he showed investors a separate balance sheet at an emergency bailout. According to the report, SBF listed $8.9 billion in debt, $9 billion in liquid assets, and $15.4 billion in less liquid assets. The report also mentioned $3.2 billion in illiquid assets. Sam Bankman-Fried Reveals Conflicting Balance Sheets He revealed another balance sheet showing the actual situation at the time of the bailout meeting. The balance sheet bears similar numbers but $8 billion less liquid assets. SBF said he misquoted the numbers. He added that customers were transferring money to Alameda Research instead of sending it directly to FTX. According to his statement, FTX’s internal audit system double-counted the amount and credited it to both firms. Following SBF’s statement, FTX and Alameda Research had the highest cash flow, but Binance, a rival, became the highest expense. He paid a net amount of $2.5 billion to buy out Binance’s investments. SBF also revealed that he spent $250 million on real estate and about $1.5 billion on other expenses. Some $4 billion and $1.5 billion went into venture capital investments to acquire other firms, while they counted $1 billion by mistake. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $17,000, But Is It Too Early To Call The All Clear On The Bear Market? The report also stated that SBF and the remaining employees spent the previous weekend attempting to raise funds. The funds are to fill the $8 billion hole in FTX’s balance sheet and repay customers. Cause of FTX Collapse: Fraud Or Mismanagement? Meanwhile, most people in the crypto space say the FTX crisis is a fraud and not an accident. On Wednesday, during his first public appearance after the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried insisted that he did not commit fraud. He claimed that he was unaware of the extent of damage and what was going on with FTX. In an interview with The New York Times, SBF blamed the collapse of the $32 billion FTX exchange on poor accounting and management failures. This comment triggered civil and criminal investigations. The investigation aims to determine whether FTX committed a crime by lending customers’ funds to Alameda Research. However, FTX’s new CEO, John Ray III, in charge of the firm’s bankruptcy proceeding, expressed disgust at the situation. In his words, Ray said he had never seen such a complete failure of corporate control, condemning SBF for unacceptable management practices.

5080050,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510974,1670044170,"Ethereum Price To Reclaim $1,300 Throne – What Are The Possibilities?","This week saw a positive recovery in some crypto assets, Ethereum included. It is gaining momentum and preparing for a bullish rally in the days to come. Although Ethereum is still below $1,300, some factors suggest a possible increase to $1,350 and $1,550. The crypto market has been filled with FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) in the past weeks following the FTX crisis. Crypto investors are left speculating whether to buy or sell holdings as assets plunged deeper. For example, reports show that Ethereum lost nearly 39% in a couple of weeks. The crypto market has been anticipating news of the U.S. Federal Reserve dropping its bullish stance on interest rate hikes from December. As signals point towards this expectation becoming a reality, some assets started showing signs of recovery. However, despite the bullish trend, Bitcoin remains down due to miners’ capitulation, while Ethereum is rising. Factors Indicating Massive Ethereum Price Surge Coinglass’ crypto derivatives data shows that Ether futures open interest on Binance has reached an all-time high of 2.01 million. It amounts to a 9% increase in Open Interest in the last 24 hours, indicating a high probability that Ethereum will increase in the coming weeks. On-chain data from Glassnode also revealed that the total value of the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract hit an all-time high of 15,492,407 ETH. Ethereum validators’ revenue has also reached a 1-month high of 11.310%. These records have got players and analysts reacting. For example, Michael van de Poppe believes ETH is exhibiting strength as it rose from the $1,150 level to the current price. The analyst predicts that a break above the $1,225 level would trigger a rally toward $1,350 and maybe $1,550. Traders look forward to holding their Ether if it remains above the support level of $1,200. Analysts also believe the ETH price increase will rub off on other altcoins. ETH Price Journey Many traders were bullish about Ethereum’s price increase after the completion of the merger. However, Ethereum neither surpassed nor bounced back to the $1,700 level after the merge. With the macroeconomic situation, the asset continued falling and went below the $1,500 physiological. Whale accumulations saw ETH price drop from $1,661 to $1081 in one month. Whales saw the price declines as an opportunity to accumulate ETH holdings. Whale accumulations are often indicators of an asset’s bullish recovery. However, it didn’t seem so initially for Ethereum, whose price dipped to $1,081. Now the tables are turning, and Ethereum seems to gain bullish momentum, rising towards $1,350. Ethereum is trading at $1,283 with a 24-hour trading volume of $6,205,108,773. With the ETH price above the critical support level of $1,225, there may be hope for more increase. The price surged nearly 2% in 24 hours and 8% in the past week.

5072078,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510896,1670025624,This Historic Bitcoin On-Chain Support Level Is Still Not Lost,"On-chain data shows the historical 20-Day MA Bitcoin aSOPR support level has continued to hold so far. Bitcoin 20-Day MA aSOPR Rebounds Off Historical Support Line As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC aSOPR recently retested its 8-year old support. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the overall market is moving coins at some profit currently. On the other hand, values of the indicator less than the threshold suggest holders as a whole are realizing some loss with their selling at the moment. Naturally, SOPR values exactly equal to 1 imply the investors are just breaking even on their investment right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Usher In December Near $18,000 If It Moves Past This Resistance “Adjusted SOPR” (aSOPR) is a modified version of this metric that excludes from the data any selling of coins that was done within 1 hour of first acquiring said coins. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 20-day moving average Bitcoin aSOPR over the last several years: Looks like the 20-day MA value of the metric has sharply declined in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the 20-day MA aSOPR rapidly went down following the FTX crash, and touched a low of 0.93 just a week or so ago. This level was the same as the one seen during the lows of the previous bear markets, and each of the touches in those bears launched the metric back up. The support line has now been active since 2014, and in the 8 years so far the indicator has never seen any actual dip below it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $17,000, But Is It Too Early To Call The All Clear On The Bear Market? Since the retest of this support level a week ago, the metric has already bounced back up, suggesting that this important support line is still holding right now. However, it’s uncertain whether this successful retest means the bottom is now in. Back In the 2018/19 bear, it was indeed the case, but in 2014/15 it took two touches of the line before the real bottom formed. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.8k, up 3% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 18% in value.
