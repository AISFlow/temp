42401157,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLoTD,1519341018,French Regulator Says No to Online Crypto Derivatives Ads,"France's stock market regulator released a statement about cryptocurrency-tied derivatives on Thursday, which includes a curb on the advertising of such products.  In its statement, L'Autorite Des Marches Financiers (AMF) said that trading platforms should not be allowed to market cryptocurrency derivative products electronically, per regulations that cover derivatives more broadly. The publication followed a months-long review process, according to the AMF.  The agency said:  ""The AMF concludes that a cash-settled cryptocurrency contract may qualify as a derivative, irrespective of the legal qualification of a cryptocurrency. As a result, online platforms which offer cryptocurrency derivatives fall within the scope of MiFID 2 and must therefore comply with the authorisation, conduct of business rules, and the EMIR trade reporting obligation to a trade repository. Above all, these products are subject to the provisions of the Sapin 2 law, and notably the ban of advertisements for certain financial contracts.""  The EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) is an update to previous legislation, with the stated goal of providing greater transparency across asset classes in the name of investor protection. The initiative came into effect on Jan. 3.  The AMF's missive is the latest from the agency on the topic of cryptocurrencies, coming months after it first weighed in initial coin offerings (ICOs). In October, the agency launched an ICO-focused initiative, dubbed the Universal Node to ICO Research Network (UNICORN).  The effort, according to statements at the time, was aimed at ""offering to these carriers of projects a frame allowing the development of their operations and to ensure the protection of actors and investors wishing to participate.""  Other regulatory bodies within the EU have been looking into the issue of crypto derivatives as well.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is investigating if such contracts comply with MiFID rules, and announced in January that it was seeking public input on potential rule changes.

According to a recording posted on Twitter by television network VTV, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has ordered several state-owned companies to convert a percentage of their sales and purchases into the petro.  ""I gave the order to the company PDVSA, Pequiven and CVG to realize as of today a percentage of their sales and purchases in...the Petro,"" Maduro said (according to a rough translation) during the petro pre-sale announcement.  PDVSA is a state-owned oil and natural gas company which, in addition to the Venezuelan government, is also the target of U.S. sanctions. Pequiven is a petrochemical company, and Corporacion Venezolana de Guyana (CVG) is a decentralized conglomerate whose subsidiaries include aluminium and gold producers.  Maduro also said that citizens will be able to pay for fuel, airline and tourism services with cryptocurrencies, including the petro. Likewise, the government previously promised to accept petros for the payment of national taxes, fees and other public services.  Another petro?  And as the cryptocurrency world adjusts to the idea of a state-backed coin, it appears that the Maduro government is moving to launch another one already.  Just one day after the commencement of the controversial petro pre-sale, Maduro made waves once again, announcing that he plans to unveil a second cryptocurrency next week: the petro gold.  ""Next week I'm going to launch the petro gold, backed by gold, which is even more powerful, that will strengthen the petro,"" Vice quoted Maduro as saying in a Wednesday speech.

42421891,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwp6T,1519332164,What is SegWit?,"Last updated: 22 February, 2018  SegWit (short for Segregated Witness) is a protocol upgrade that changes the way data is stored. It was activated on litecoin on May 10, 2017, and on bitcoin on 23 August, 2017.  Developer Pieter Wiulle first presented the idea at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in December 2015.  Many hailed it as a long-awaited solution to bitcoin’s scaling problem. The maximum block size in the main protocol is 1MB, which restricts the number of transactions bitcoin can process to approximately 7 per second. This was going to limit bitcoin’s potential growth, and prevent it from becoming a usable high-volume payment system.  While the upgrade does enable a greater number of transactions in bitcoin’s blocks, SegWit’s initial intention was to fix a bug in the bitcoin code called transaction malleability. This flaw allowed anyone to change small details that modified the transaction id (and the subsequent hash) but not the content. While not a critical problem for bitcoin, it prevented the development of more complex features such as second-layer protocols and smart contracts.  SegWit fixed transaction malleability by removing the signature information (otherwise known as the “witness” information) and storing it outside the base transaction block. With that, signatures and scripts can be changed without affecting the transaction id.  Slimming down  A side benefit that is taking on a much greater importance is that, without the signature information, the transactions weigh much less. This means that more can fit in a block, and bitcoin can process a greater throughput without changing the block size.  SegWit introduced a new concept called “block weight.” This is a mashup of the block size with and without the signature data, and is capped at 4MB, while the block size limit for the base transactions remains at 1MB. This means that the SegWit upgrade is compatible with the previous protocol, and avoids the need for a hard fork.  So, SegWit does not increase the block size limit, but it does enable a greater number of transactions within the 1MB blocks. The 4MB cap includes the segregated witness data, which technically does not form part of the 1MB base transaction block.  Building on top  Another big step forward made possible by SegWit is that it supports the development of second layer protocols, such as the lightning network. The malleability fix made any feature that relied on unconfirmed transactions less risky and easier to design.  The lightning network will further boost bitcoin’s transaction capacity by taking frequent, small transactions off-chain, only settling on the bitcoin blockchain when the users are ready.  SegWit activation also boosted development work on other features such as MAST (which enables more complex bitcoin smart contracts), Schnorr signatures (which would enable another transaction capacity boost) and TumbleBit (an anonymous top-layer network).  Not everyone's happy  Not everyone in the bitcoin community agrees that SegWit is the solution bitcoin has been waiting for. Some believe that it is a case of ""kicking the can down the road,"" and at best a temporary fix.  Resistance to SegWit was one of the factors behind the development of bitcoin cash, a fork of the bitcoin network which chose to implement a larger block size limit rather than rely on a new transaction structure.  Where are we?  In spite of the obvious advantages, the rollout of the upgrade is moving slowly. At pixel time, 14% of transactions were using the new format (you can follow the progress here).  The main reason is that many wallets have yet to add SegWit support. Some big names such as Trezor, Ledger, Electrum and Kraken have already done so. Coinbase – the largest wallet provider in terms of number of transactions – is working on it, and expects to implement the upgrade in early 2018. And the wallet attached to bitcoin's most popular full node implementation, Bitcoin Core, is expected to roll out SegWit in the first quarter of 2018.  With the main bitcoin code also making SegWit-friendly adjustments, this could lead to an uptick in both usage and additional functionality experimentation. Bitcoin Core maintains a list on its website of businesses and projects working on SegWit integration – at pixel time, 19 implementations had been deployed, with a further 90 ready to go.  As more wallets embrace the upgrade, the percentage of transactions that use the SegWit structure will increase, and bitcoin fees should drop as blocks contain a greater number of transactions. Furthermore, the development of lightning and similar second layer protocols should get more of a boost, enhancing bitcoin’s scope and potential. This is unlikely to happen overnight – but the change is an important one, and represents a big step forward.

Venezuelan Finance Minister Simon Zerpa Delgado was in Moscow on Wednesday discussing collaboration between the two governments, according to tweets published through his official account. According to one missive, the subject of the petro – which was unveiled in December and sparked global headlines with its launch Tuesday – was brought up during the meetings.  Delgado tweeted (according to a translation):  ""In this meeting we have reviewed the economic and financial cooperation between the two countries, with emphasis on the new [cryptocurrency] of Venezuela: the Petro. We deliver the Min. Siluánov updated information about our [cryptocurrency].""  ""Russia and Venezuela will continue to strengthen their trade balance,"" Delgado also wrote. ""We will continue advancing in the construction of a multipolar and pluricentric world, free of imperial tensions.""  It's unclear based on the messages whether Russia's government will play a role in the development of the petro, which Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has pledged will be used to circumvent international sanctions imposed on the country. That said, a Russian company called Aerotrading has been linked to the project, as previously reported.  Venezuelan citizens have had mixed reactions to the launch, with some hailing the currency as part of a ""new economic era,"" while others have called it a vehicle for corruption.

Mauny is also a member of that group.  Jesperson had planned to ask the Swiss authority which oversees such organizations to grant him the legal authority to disburse the funds Tezos raised during its token sale.

With the release of Robinhood Crypto, we’re continuing our mission of making the financial system work for everyone, not just the wealthy.”  In addition to Robinhood Crypto, the company announced the launch of Robinhood Feed, a social media-type platform which will enable investors to discuss different cryptocurrencies, news surrounding the space and the markets in real-time.  The Feed platform is currently only available to a limited number of people, according to the announcement.

42401152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLoPH,1519309835,Litecoin Cash Has Forked But It's Hardly Trading,"Call it a slow start.  A plan to launch a new cryptocurrency by forking the litecoin blockchain went off without a technical hitch over the weekend, but at press time, the market isn't exactly embracing the new coin.  Currently trading at just $5 on a little over $1 million in volume, litecoin cash (LCC) is valued at just 2 percent of the price of the official litecoin project, the world's fifth-largest cryptocurrency and one of the few to see nearly $1 billion in volume Thursday.  The lackluster pricing follows what had been a notable start as far as the price action is concerned.  LCC opened at around $1.40 and surged to $9.25 on Feb. 20, which amounts to a 560 percent rise, according to data service CoinCodex (one of the few to yet offer data on the project). Even litecoin benefited from the move, surging as investors sought to lock in holdings before litecoin cash cloned its blockchain and offered free coins to litecoin holders.  However, despite this built-in audience, no major exchange has yet announced support for LCC.  As of now, it is listed only on YoBit, while other exchanges mentioned by litecoin cash website, Mercatox exchange and Trade Satoshi exchange, have not yet formally integrated the cryptocurrency.  It appears the team's naming choice has ended up being its biggest drawback. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee emerged as an early critic, with even litecoin cash developers admitting to CoinDesk the choice of name is meant to be a publicity lightning rod. (The use of ""cash"" recalls ""bitcoin cash,"" a fork of bitcoin that came amidst a deep divide among users over the project's technical roadmap).  As profiled by CoinDesk, Lee sought to accuse the cryptocurrency's team of willfully benefitting from market confusion, and few in the wider industry seemed to disagree, noting that litecoin does not have a similar vision over its technical roadmap with large numbers of users seeking to leave the network.  All in all, the 24-hour trading volume for litecoin cash, down from $5.6 million earlier in the week, is quite low in this context, taking into account the kind of attention it received across the wires ahead of the fork.  Only time will tell if LCC will rub shoulders with crypto market leaders or go the bitcoin gold way (another bitcoin fork that seems to have found little love in the investor community).

42401153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLoRF,1519307142,Jimmy Song's New Mission: Fund Unpaid Bitcoin Coders,"One of the most respected developers in bitcoin wants to give a new generation of open-source developers a revenue stream.  Jimmy Song  , known for his easy-to-understand technical analysis of cryptocurrency, is in the process of designing a laboratory to train and pay crypto developers under his new auspices as a partner at Blockchain Capital. Informally dubbed Platypus Labs, the project will support developers with a combination of residencies and fellowships, with an initial focus on coders building on Bitcoin Core, the most used version of the bitcoin software.  According to Song, the project, while still in its early stages of development, has already garnered the interest of several of Blockchain Capital's portfolio companies, plus a number of investors that have bought into the venture capital firms' funds.  It's not all that surprising given the lack of talent in the space as compared to the number of developer jobs needed. According to stats from Indeed.com, the number of blockchain jobs posted in the U.S. alone rose by 207 percent between December 2016 and December 2017.  Illustrative of this, Blockchain Capital co-founder Bart Stephens told CoinDesk, ""Without exception, all of the 62 companies in the Blockchain Capital portfolio need engineering talent. We couldn’t be more pleased to have him join the team and allow us to support and contribute to the ecosystem in this way.""  With such enthusiasm already, Song expects to roll out a fellowship or residency program in the next two months.  While the project, which will have a physical location in San Francisco, will at first focus specifically on building up the developer ecosystem around bitcoin, the lab could eventually expand to include support for other cryptocurrencies.  Song told CoinDesk:  ""We want to reward developers, because they're obviously adding tremendous value to the ecosystem, and we want to see them get compensated for it, if that's what they want to do.""  Developer interest  That modifier on Song's statement, though, stems from the fact that getting developers to participate could be more of a challenge.  During bitcoin's infancy, all Core developers were volunteers, working on the code in their spare time for free. Although other times, developers had large sums of bitcoin and so worked on the code to protect their investment.  ""If you own a lot of bitcoin, then it's in your interest to work on it – at least that's why I started contributing to Core,"" Song said.  But as bitcoin became more popular, educational institutions such as MIT and venture-backed startups like BitPay, Blockstream and Chain Code Labs began hiring bitcoin developers to keep up their work on the public blockchain.  Yet, not every Core developer has shown interest in such monetary support, in some ways stemming from the perception of working for a company versus the altruistic autonomy of working alone.  ""Certain developers, you're never going to get them to do that, they're doing it for other reasons than money,"" Song said. ""But certainly, if that is a concern, and if that's something that certain developers are interested in, we want to support that.""  Supply and demand  Song also wants to support new developers that might want to get trained in the nascent technology, but have limited resources to do so.  While Song has committed 14 changes to the Bitcoin Core codebase, he's better known as an educator, making a name for himself through Programming Blockchain, a two-day seminar designed to give Python developers the necessary skills to write code for bitcoin applications.  Yet, he wants to add to that with Platypus Labs, primarily in teaching developers how to update core infrastructure that's been overlooked for some time.  For one, there's bitcoin's aging open-source libraries, such as bitcoin wallet library bitcoinj, which was already getting old when its creator Mike Hearn walked away from bitcoin altogether in 2016.  ""A lot of open-source libraries in bitcoin have fallen into disrepair,"" he said. ""We'd like to make sure those are shored up for the sake of our portfolio companies at the very least, but also for the sake of the ecosystem.""  In this pursuit, Song is in the process of contacting each of Blockchain Capital's 62 portfolio companies to ask which coding libraries they use. He's also asking them which new tools they need and what other ways Platypus Labs might be beneficial to them.  Once that reconnaissance is done, Song expects to formally reveal the criteria for the joining the laboratory.  On top of that, he'll be perusing the industry for companies – that Blockchain Capital might invest in – run by entrepreneurs that can code the ""basics really, really well.""  Speaking to both his expanding the role on Blockchain Capital with his laboratory, plus his thesis for finding companies for the firm to invest in, Song told CoinDesk:  “I like to see companies that are innovating and not rent-seeking.""

All of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization – bar nano, dentacoin and tether – are in the red today, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped over 8 percent in the last 24 hours, as was indicated by the bearish reversal pattern on the daily charts and head-and-shoulders breakdown on the hourly chart.  As of writing, BTC had dropped to $9,958 – down 16.72 percent from the recent high of $11,958 hit on Feb. 20.  As seen above, the biggest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies is bitcoin cash (BCH), down 10.58 percent in the last 24 hours. It's also down 24.11 percent from the recent high of $1,641.40. The cryptocurrency's ascent was cut short by key resistance around $1,533, shows Bitfinex data.  Also, taking a beating today is Ripple's XRP. As of writing, the token is changing hands at $0.975152 – down 8.89 percent in the last 24 hours.  CoinDesk reported yesterday that Ripple has added five new payments clients in four countries. Further, San Francisco-based startup has also released white papers hinting at an upgrade for the underlying technology of XRP. However, the today's drop indicates the good news has been ignored by the markets or is being overshadowed by the broad-based losses in crypto space.  Whatever the case, XRP is looking heavy on the technical charts. Also, it is worth noting the cryptocurrency is down 24.99 percent from the recent high of $1.3 (reached Feb. 10).  Meanwhile, as noted, the few gaining tokens are all out side the top 10, including small caps like nano (up 8.15 percent in last 24 hours) and dentacoin (up 2.48 percent).  The total value of all cryptocurrencies taken together stands at $445 billion – down close to 15 percent from the high of $519 billion seen on Feb. 18.

Launched by the Treasury Committee, the investigation will take several angles including examining the role of cryptocurrencies in Britain, including potential ""opportunities and risks"" for consumers, the business community and government.  The potential impact of blockchain and distributed ledger technology on financial institutions and infrastructure is also under the magnifying glass, as is the matter of how to strike a regulatory balance between protecting consumers and enterprise without stalling innovation. In particular, the inquiry will ""scrutinise the regulatory response"" to cryptocurrencies from the government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England.  In an announcementhttps://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/treasury-committee/news-parliament-2017/digital-currencies-17-19/, Member of Parliament (MP) Nicky Morgan, who is chair of the Treasury Committee, said the committee will look at the potential risks that cryptocurrencies could pose, including price volatility, money laundering and cybercrime.  Morgan added:  ""We will also examine the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and the technology underpinning them, how they can create innovative opportunities, and to what extent they could disrupt the economy and replace traditional means of payment.""  The timing of the inquiry is ""right,"" according to Alison McGovern MP, Treasury Committee member. ""New technology offers the economy potential gains, but as recently demonstrated, it may also bring substantial risks,"" she said.

42401169,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLof1,1519293609,Bitcoin Rally Stalls But Bull Revival Isn't Yet Ruled Out,"Bitcoin's failure to find acceptance above the $11,000 mark this week has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook. However, the rally from Feb. 6 lows could resume if prices break above $11,250, the technical charts indicate.  As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is seen at $10,345 – down 6 percent in the last 24 hours. The BPI closed (as per UTC) above $11,000 on Feb. 17, but has since struggled to maintain the bullish momentum.  So, it appears the rally from the Feb. 6 low of $5,947 has run out of steam. Further, the BPI chart also shows a bearish reversal pattern.  BPI chart  The price action of the last two days confirms a bearish doji reversal. Bitcoin (BTC) clocked a three-week high of $11,767 on Tuesday, but closed (as per UTC) with minor gains at $11,228.24, resulting in a ""gravestone doji"" candlestick pattern (marked by arrow). Additionally, BTC fell more than 6 percent yesterday, marking a bearish follow-through to the gravestone doji.  Overall, the pattern indicates a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Daily chart  As seen on the chart (prices as per Coinbase) above, the rally has stalled at the confluence of the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the record highs.  Hence, $11,228 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) is the key resistance to watch out for. Only a daily close (as per UTC) above that level would revive the bullish outlook.  4-hour chart  The observed bearish RSI divergence (higher highs in price and lower highs on the relative strength index) also indicates a short-term bearish trend reversal.  View  BTC's rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $6,000 seems to have run out of steam.  Despite the bearish RSI divergence and the bearish doji reversal, it is still too early to call a top as the 10-day MA is curled up in favor of the bulls.  That said, a daily close (as per UTC) below the 10-day MA would boost the odds of a move lower to $9,181 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement).  Bullish scenario: A daily close above $11,228 would mean the rally from the recent lows below $6,000 has resumed. In such a scenario, attention would shift to $14,537 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement).  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

India’s information technology trade organization, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) will work with BRI researchers backed by the Canadian government to help developers learn more about blockchain platforms in preparation for creating and launching tools within the nation.  To that end, the two groups have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) establishing a financial and research partnership. According to media platform INC42, each organization will invest in webinars and other types of seminars whereby researchers within the BRI can share their knowledge using case studies with Indian government departments and other entities.  NASSCOM chairman Raman Roy said that, while he is delighted to launch a research initiative, he understands that encouraging blockchain use in the country will be a long-term effort, rather than “a plug and play we can do tomorrow,” according to the International Data Group's CIO India.  To this end, the MoU splits the research push into two parts, said BRI’s Don Tapscott. He explained:  “We need to create an awakening in India, showcase the power of blockchain and we can do this by looking at incentives/discounts to organizations who do this. That’s phase one.”  Phase two would build a blockchain institute in India, which will be specifically aimed at helping grow the digital ecosystem in the state of Telengana, according to INC42.  CNN reports  that this center would ""provide high-end technology capabilities"" to the state, as part of the BRI's push to ""build blockchain-based economies around the world.""  Stepping back, these moves would appear to bolster India's goal of putting electronic health records, land records and digital certificates on a blockchain, as stated by Amitabh Kant, the CEO of the National Institution for Transforming India, a government-run think tank.

It says that tokens can represent various financial instruments, including stocks, derivatives and digital representations of voting rights.  The agency also used the letter to offer some advice to startups looking to launch ICOs: get in touch. It advises token offers to ascertain whether their respective products fall under existing national and EU-wide regulation.

42401166,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLoa6,1519274659,Bitcoin Lightning Fraud? Laolu Is Building a 'Watchtower' to Fight It,"A woman peers out from a watchtower.  Below her hundreds of people are walking the streets of a bustling marketplace. She has one power: If a vendor tries to cheat a buyer or vice versa, she pushes a button, instantly notifying the innocent party. Once the swindle is known, the victim can zap the cheater, retrieving his or her funds and even penalizing extra for bad behavior.  Not simply abstract, though, the scene displays how a crucial part of bitcoin's Lightning Network, a complex transaction relaying layer still being built, is supposed to work.  Thought of as bitcoin's best hope for increasing its transaction capacity and reducing user costs, Lightning has been getting significant attention of late from both users and developers, but some are now even starting to tackle more advanced components of the network.  Among the first to see development is this ""watchtower"" concept, which is being spearheaded in part by Olaoluwa ""Laolu"" Osuntokun, the co-founder of startup Lightning Labs (one of several working on the technology) and one of the nascent network's more respected developers,  In interview, Osuntokun revealed to CoinDesk that Lightning Labs is working on an ""initial"" watchtower implementation, whereby the role of watching a channel for fraud would be outsourced to certain entities.  ""The initial goal post is just to get a basic system up without any sort of compensation to get the ball rolling,"" Osuntokun said.  Yet, the ""end goal"" is wider than that. Osuntokun hopes to launch a ""marketplace"" on top of the Lightning Network that would help match users, willing to pay small fees, with these watchtowers, as well as provide other services that help the network run.  Osuntokun continued, saying:  ""They should be incentivized. If they're paid for the data they're storing, that's a pretty strong incentive. I feel like anyone that wants to outsource to watchers should be able to.""  From the watchtower  More broadly, the watchtower concept stems from the potentially burdensome nature of the Lightning Network's dispute mechanism.  While Lightning transactions are instant, if there's a dispute – say if a fraudster tries to broadcast a transaction which effectively steals money from another user – the defrauded user has time to oppose the transaction. But for users to catch this kind of fraud, they'd have to be watching their Lightning accounts diligently.  Speaking to this in one of the most in-depth lectures on the topic of watchtowers, Lightning Network co-author Tadge Dryja summed up the issue well, stating:  ""The price of scalability is eternal vigilance.""  But if the Lightning Network becomes the go-to channel for everyday bitcoin transactions, this vigilance would become quite burdensome. As such, the watchtower concept allows users to outsource the ""eternal vigilance"" to other entities, who will send users a message should something look awry.  To some, this setup might sound odd. After all, the Lightning Network is being built to mirror the ""trustless"" properties of bitcoin, whereby users don't need to rely on a single entity to, say, validate or secure their transactions.  But Osuntokun and other Lightning developers envision a distributed system where users can connect to as many watchtowers as they want at once. In this way, users aren't trusting one entity and can limit potential hazards associated with trusting just one entity.  If just one of them is trustworthy, the system should work, Osuntokun said.  Another step developers plan to look into in the long term, he said, is making both components – the marketplaces and the watchtowers – invisible to bitcoin users.  ""Ideally within our application, this is all abstracted away from the end user,"" Osuntokun said, though he added the goal is still to make it easy for ""power users"" with more tech experience to construct and run their own towers.  Steep stairs  All Osuntokun's work on watchtowers is notable, showing they're a crucial step for preparing lightning for a live implementation on bitcoin. Yet, it's worth noting the concept hasn't been added to Lightning's ""specifications,"" which describe the technicals of how the network works.  Indeed, the thinking on this topic is so new, not everyone agrees on how to deal with certain hurdldes. Firstly, developers are trying to make the watchtowers more scalable.  For example, say a watchtower wants to monitor more than one channel, maybe thousands or millions of channels at the same time. Depending on how many channels a watchtower decides to monitor, this database could be larger than the entire bitcoin blockchain itself, which already causes syncing and storage issues today.  With that in mind, Osuntokun is trying to build a better, easier to manage watchtower system, the research into that being revealed at his ""Hardening Lightning"" presentation at the Stanford blockchain conference in January.  ""One goal is to make outsourcers more scalable so they can service more clients,"" he told CoinDesk.  Toward that goal, Osuntokun proposed a new scheme that would allow watchtowers to store less data for the same security and is pushing for a new bitcoin ""opcode"" that make Lightning data simpler. Though bitcoin's development process is a slow one, Osuntokun hopes the feature can be added by the end of the year.  Beyond scalability, there's another piece of watchtowers under discussion – participant incentives.  While Osuntokun mentioned the fee marketplace, other developers aren't sure about how best to structure the system to create the best incentives.  Dryja, for instance, argued that the watchtower concept doesn't really need a fee structure. That's partly because he thinks only one honest watchtower is needed to keep the network safe.  ""One altruistic node defending the whole network would be fine,"" he said, during the Stanford talk. ""Someone will do it.""  He went on to argue that if only one watchtower needs to provide honest information, that's good for the security of Lightning as a whole. And in actuality, it wouldn't be surprising if many users run honest watchtowers.  Yet, Dryja continued, arguing that if lightning actually works in practice, the watchtowers will rarely have to punish bad actors anyway, because those that break the rules, will lose money.  Adding to that, Dryja said:  ""I think invalid channel closes will be pretty much impossible. That's sort of the fun aspect of this. The risks are so high, and the gains are so small.""

42401156,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLoSE,1519269712,The Legal Risk to ICOs That No One's Talking About,"Jared Marx is an attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. He represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings.      With the rise and rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs), much attention has been paid to how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors view this innovation. And rightfully so, as those enforcement systems carry stiff penalties and even the potential for jail.  But investors and companies should also know that buyers can sue sellers privately under the federal securities laws based on similar theories. Sellers should know about these laws to understand the risks they face, and buyers should know their remedies if treated unfairly.  I wrote this article a few years ago about how to identify whether a coin is a security (back when we were calling ICOs ""token pre-sales""), and the bottom line is that it can be tricky. The important thing to know, however, is that if an ICO does constitute a security offering, then federal law requires that the seller register the security or find an exception. Failure to do so can result in SEC enforcement or criminal sanction.  But here's what not everyone realizes: the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 says that a person who buys an unregistered security can sue the seller on his own to get his money back. That's important for a number of reasons.  First, it means that the SEC and the Department of Justice are not the only parties who can allege that an ICO is a securities offering. Some argue these days that there have been so many ICOs and that the SEC is so understaffed that it will never bring enforcement actions against the vast majority of sellers. But this doesn’t mean a private party won’t sue. And if a private person does, it is not the SEC, but a judge who decides if the ICO was a securities offering.  Second, the private right of action is important because the remedy is to entirely unwind the original sale. That means that a company that raised $15 million in its ICO might have to give every penny (satoshi?) back to its buyers, even if it has since spent much of what it raised.  That kind of outcome is also made possible by federal class action rules, which allow one person to sue on behalf of all of the people who bought a particular security.  When the money's gone  What about the blood-from-a-turnip problem? That is, how do you get money back from a company that has since spent it or moved it elsewhere? Things were bad enough during the Great Depression that the drafters thought of that, too.  The 1933 Act provides for personal liability for those who control a company that sells an unregistered security. So the ordinary protections of the corporate form don’t necessarily apply.  The bad news for buyers (and the good news for sellers) is that the time in which a private party must sue is very short. The statute of limitations for this particular violation is only one year from the date of sale, and claims beyond that time are barred.  Buyers and sellers should also know, however, that this is not the end of the story. The securities laws provide additional causes of action for misstatements that a seller makes when selling a security. Likewise, other state and federal laws provide remedies for the same under general fraud statutes. And even if an ICO does not constitute a sale of a security, those same laws generally provide for remedies if the seller made material misstatements to induce the sale.  So, wherever the SEC ends up on ICOs, investors and sellers should be aware of this broader legal landscape, either to protect their businesses or to help vindicate their rights.
