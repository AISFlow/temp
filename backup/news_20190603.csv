42402966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddx86,1559595542,SEC's Crypto Savvy Surprises Blockchain Insiders at DC Forum,"It was billed as an opportunity for the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn more about cryptocurrency. But what was striking about Friday’s forum was how much the agency’s staff already knew.  From questions about atomic swaps to comments about airdrops and forks, the SEC’s FinTech Forum, held at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., demonstrated that the U.S. securities regulator has been paying close attention to the crypto world – and has a deeper understanding than some give it credit for.  “Clearly they have been listening to what those in the community – and their counsel – have been saying to them and they've put a lot of effort into understanding this space,” said Joshua Ashley Klayman, managing member of Klayman LLC, a boutique law firm.  “They were very seemingly comfortable with some of the more technical aspects and the terminology, including atomic swaps. It was a much higher-level discussion than the basics of blockchain,” said Klayman, who was one of the panelists invited to speak at the forum.  For example, several attendees referenced the moment when Elizabeth Baird, deputy director of the Division of Trading and Markets, brought up atomic swaps. These are cutting-edge transactions in which the parties exchange one cryptocurrency for another without an intermediary, and neither leg of trade is complete until both are.  Specifically, Baird asked whether such swaps reduce risk in transferring or exchanging cryptos.  On another panel, Deloitte’s Amy Steele discussed airdrops (mass giveaways of a token to spur adoption) and forks (splinter currencies available to holders of the original) with Jennifer McHugh, senior special counsel to the Division of Investment Management, with a particular focus on whether and how these impact consumer risk.  Even when pleading ignorance, the SEC officials sounded more informed about crypto than one might expect from Beltway bureaucrats.  Valerie Szczepanik, the SEC’s senior advisor for digital assets, name-checked an ethereum smart-contract programming language when explaining the need for dialogue between her agency and developers.  “We need to translate between each other,” she said, adding:  “We also learned that the federal securities laws are just as complex to computer scientists as coding smart contracts in Solidity are to regulators.”  Chen Arad, chief marketing officer of Solidus Labs and an attendee at the forum, told CoinDesk that senior SEC staff were able to “comfortably” discuss various technical issues, including nodes, consensus mechanisms and smart contracts.  Attorney Stephen Rutenberg, a shareholder at Polsinelli and a member of the firm's Fintech and Regulation Practice, agreed, saying that in his view, the SEC’s understanding of distributed ledger technology is “beyond what most people think.”  Don’t hold your breath  While the SEC may have shown its chops at Friday’s forum, this does not necessarily mean that there will be any significant change in its approach to tokens and securities law.  Regulation does not happen overnight, said Teddy Fusaro, chief operating officer of asset manager Bitwise, citing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an example. In general, ETFs were launched some 25 years ago, but the SEC has yet to publish a standardized rule for issuers looking for exemptive relief.  Klayman agreed, saying that in her view, “the law says what the law says,” and unless a new law is signed addressing the asset class, “we shouldn’t expect a radically different interpretation.”  Yet while there may be no significant change in the regulator’s approach to the space, that does not mean companies concerned about potentially selling an unregistered security have no recourse.  Rutenberg said “the biggest news of the forum from the SEC is that they appear willing to entertain granting no action letters to ICOs that are no longer selling tokens,” referring to remarks by Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman.  He did note, however, that no actual guidance was issued, saying:  “However, if one was expecting the SEC to make firm commitments or provide more definitive guidance they would likely have come away disappointed from the forum.”  For all that was said during the forum, one issue which was conspicuously scarce was a discussion of market manipulation.  Market manipulation has been a hot button topic for the SEC, with several bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals rejected due to concerns about the market. These concerns have been so publicly stated, in fact, that Bitwise (which wants to issue its own bitcoin ETF) has now submitted two reports to the SEC in an effort to counter that narrative.  Which is perhaps why the topic’s near-absence at the forum was so keenly felt. Arad told CoinDesk that more discussion of manipulation and the surveillance infrastructure that can address it is still needed.  “It's a major concern, in particular as more and more of our clients are eyeing institutional investors and their funds,” Arad said.  Szczepanik did mention manipulation – and other issues – in her closing remarks, reiterating a request for information that she, and other SEC officials, have been making for months.  “Dalia Blass and the Division [of Investment Management] put out a comprehensive letter, two letters actually, asking for input on things like custody, manipulation, liquidity, valuation, redemption, … all those things are things we invite your input in,” she said.

Blockchains was primarily interested in slock.it’s Incubed project which enables human and machines secure participation in the economy of things through the ethereum blockchain. The merger will allow both companies to combine resources and institutional knowledge to work through the security and interoperability issues within existing IoT systems.  “We have the same passion for creating a sharing economy powered by blockchain, and for creating a safe and secure entry point to the third-generation World Wide Web,” said Christoph Jentzsch, co-founder of slock.it, in a statement.  Founded in 2015, slock.it aims to extend blockchain’s intrinsic benefits ""transparency, security, and auditability to real-world devices."" The firm was previously behind the failed Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which sought to codify the rules and governance of an organization without a centralized overhead through eliminating the need for documents and decision makers.    The company is also planning to release a collection of open-source tools for the ethereum developer community over the next several months, according to the statement.  Blockchains’ President David Berns said:  Slock.it’s team of nearly three dozen experienced developers and professionals will allow Blockchains to significantly fast-track its product roadmap and enhance its collaboration efforts.  Christoph and his brother and co-founder Simon Jentzsch will become Blockchains’ vice-president of technology and director of blockchain development, respectively.

42402970,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxB3,1559590242,Mexico Is Getting Eight New Cryptocurrency Exchanges,"Amero-Isatek will open its first physical cryptocurrency exchange in Nuevo León, Monterrey, on June 21, part of a plan to expand into another seven locations across Mexico.  The company estimates that it will serve over 800,000 cryptocurrency users in central Mexico. Users of the exchange will trade in Amero, Amero-Isatek's own crypto asset, which is scheduled to launch on the day of the Nuevo León opening.  The firm already made headlines earlier this year for participating in what it called the world's biggest cryptocurrency real estate exchange. In this exchange, the company acquired 1,400 hectares in Baja California for $2.8 million paid in Amero.  According to Alfonso Jiménez, CEO of Amero-Isatek, there’s already an exchange in Monterrey, called GTM, but it doesn’t qualify as a cryptocurrency service.  “Today there are no physical exchanges in Mexico and we are going to open them,” he said.  Besides Monterrey, Amero will offer services in seven other Mexican states: Queretáro, Sinaloa, Quintana Roo, Jalisco, South Lower California, and Yucatán.  Legal Wager  The launch of physical exchanges circumnavigates Mexico's nascent fintech laws, which state that new establishments can operate in physical locations under a “sandbox” regulatory scheme.  Jimenez said in an interview that the company hopes to be able to comply with Bank of Mexico (Banxico) and international regulations. The company will also acquire two licensed Estonian crypto exchanges, Invest Global and Global XVC, to carry out financial operations.  “Whatever it happens with the Fintech Law in Mexico, under Banxico’s dispositions, we’ll be able to operate legally worldwide with a financial base from Estonia,” Jiménez said.  While the firm describes itself as a Fintech enterprise with an ecological bent, according to its CEO this definition will evolve depending on Mexican laws.  “If the fintech law turns out to be friendly in Mexico as well, we’ll be registered as a fintech with financial operations,” he said.

42402971,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxC2,1559584503,Block.One's New Social Media Site Will Do Identity Checks for Every User,"Block.one is going to keep bots off its social media platform by checking the identity of every single user against a government ID, a source with direct knowledge of the product tells CoinDesk.  The company intends to have plenty of people to verify as well, the source said, with plans to spend aggressively on marketing. Block.one concluded a record $4 billion token sale in June 2018.  ""What we're aiming for is a truly self-sustaining economy of thoughts and ideas, where what's good for the platform is good for the users, too,"" CEO Brendan Blumer said at the announcement event for Voice on June 1 in Washington, D.C.  One of the main features of the new platform will be the certainty that everyone on it is real, Block.one said at Saturday's unveiling.  Blumer told the room, ""It's never been more important to know that who we are interacting with and who we are getting information from is a real person who's accountable for what they share.""  According to the source, Block.one is going to pay for identity verification on every single user, though the precise form those checks will take will vary by country. However, ""It will require government IDs,"" the source told CoinDesk.  This could be a major feature for Voice versus networks like Facebook and Twitter, which have each faced significant challenges with bots, disinformation and abuse.  With Voice, people ""will realize how spammed out those other networks are,"" the source said.  At the same time, however, identity checks could scare off users who prefer to maintain anonymity and the extremely privacy conscious, a group well represented in crypto.  Fair launch  At the launch event for Voice, Block.one cofounder and CTO Dan Larimer explained that the economy of Voice would be governed by the voice token.  ""We believe everyone deserves a voice. This is why the voice token has the fairest distribution in the world,"" Larimer said Saturday.  While the precise details vary with each jurisdiction, every Voice user will receive tokens every day, the source with knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk. People can use their voice tokens to elevate their messages, if they so choose. As voice tokens get used on the platform, some go to content creators and some will be burned.  In that way, as the token supply expands each day, it will also contract as users take advantage of the site's features, moderating the overall supply. The source did not disclose how large the supply of voice tokens would be or whether the total pool would grow with the network over time.  Adoption  The hardest fight for any new social media project is to reach a large number of users.  The source told CoinDesk that Voice should be very attractive for influencers, because not only will they be able to monetize their following as brands pay them to engage with their products, but that paid content may also see a significant response from their followers.  In other words, if users engage with paid content, influencers will get paid twice.  Block.one plans to engage in a very aggressive marketing campaign to get this message out there. The source told CoinDesk the company is ""planning a robust marketing campaign"" that will require making use of ""a lot"" of the company's capital.

42402969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxA4,1559583957,John McAfee Says He Is Launching His Own 'Freedom' Cryptocurrency,"John McAfee, the famous and infamous security pioneer and cryptocurrency enthusiast, is set to launch his own eponymously named currency, the McAfee Freedom Coin, this fall.  A white paper is forthcoming, but on the currency’s webpage, McAfee said that the coin is not subject to relative price setting mechanisms of other fiat currencies or digital assets.  “The McAfee Freedom Coin is designed to confront the problem of exchange head-on... It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it’s natural market value is free, completely, to grow,” McAfee wrote.  This is part of a greater vision of a cryptomarket detached from the “fear, greed, manipulation and the vagaries of external economic conditions.” By eliminating the exchange value of the Freedom coin, McAfee hopes to create the first digit currency valued for its purchasing power alone.  He writes:  “The reason such has not occurred is that all goods and services cannot yet be purchased with cryptocurrency, so the currency holder must exchange with a currency that is accepted for what they want.”  In keeping with this goal, McAfee said in a subsequently deleted tweet, Freedom coin will not not be launched through an ICO, will not be mined or airdropped, and will not be listed on crypto exchanges. This may have something to do with McAfee's alleged fear of SEC threats for his previous ICO support.  While the underlying technologies are not new, McAfee says, “the uniqueness comes from a new approach to understanding the evolution of cryptocurrency and the mechanisms that have kept the Holy Grail of cryptocurrency - economic freedom - out of our reach.”  Many commenters got right to the point.

Cybersecurity firm Guardicore Labs said on May 29 that the large-scale malware effort – dubbed the “Nansh0u​ campaign"" – has been ongoing since February, and had been spreading to over 700 new victims a day. The attack mostly targeted firms in the healthcare, telecoms, media and IT sectors.  Guardicore found 20 different malicious payloads in the malware over time, with new ones created “at least once a week” and put into use as soon as they were created. The package also installed a rootkit that prevented the malware’s removal.  The firm said it contacted the hosting provider of the attack servers and the issuer of the rootkit certificate.  “As a result, the attack servers were taken down and the certificate was revoked,” it said.  Notably, the cybersecurity firm said the attack used sophisticated tools like those used by nation states, a factor that indicates elite digital weaponry is becoming more readily accessible to cyber criminals.  The package was also written using Chinese language tools and placed on Chinese language servers, according to the firm.  Guardicore said:  “The Nansh0u campaign is not a typical crypto-miner attack. It uses techniques often seen in APTs [advanced persistent threats] such as fake certificates and privilege escalation exploits. While advanced attack tools have normally been the property of highly skilled adversaries, this campaign shows that these tools can now easily fall into the hands of less than top-notch attackers.”  The firm said the campaign demonstrates that strong credentials are vital in protecting companies' assets.  “This campaign demonstrates once again that common passwords still comprise the weakest link in today’s attack flows. Seeing tens of thousands of servers compromised by a simple brute-force attack, we highly recommend that organizations protect their assets with strong credentials as well as network segmentation solutions,” the report concluded.

42402976,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxHw,1559572215,Open Bets On CME's Bitcoin Futures Hit Record High,"The open interest in CME Bitcoin Futures contract hit a record high last Friday.  The total figure of 5,190 for the period between May 27 to June 3 represents the largest number of open interest, or contracts outstanding, in CME bitcoin futures ever and a 7 percent gain on the week prior, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  May 31 marked the last day of trading on the CME futures markets before contract settlements, which are set to take place at the end of today's (June 3) trading session.  The sharp rise in the futures trading activity could be a sign of increased institutional participation in the cryptocurrency markets. It is worth noting that futures were listed on the CME at the height of the bull market in December 2017. The futures trading activity, however, remained dull throughout 2018, courtesy of the bear market.  CME Futures Market - Daily Snapshot    As seen previously, bitcoin futures usually “fill” a gap created by the close of the trading period at the end of the week with a resumption of trade on the following Monday. Large demand in futures contracts usually creates bigger gaps (from the time of close to a new open for the week), thereby risking greater draw down once prices correct.  The gaps shown on the CME bitcoin futures daily chart for May 17 and May 31 provide a good example of this.  On May 17 the spot price of bitcoin dropped to as low as $6,600 before greater buying pressure pushed prices back above $7,300, completing the 11.74 percent gap left in the futures market four days prior.  Again on May 31, after climbing to as high as $9,090 on the Coinbase exchange, BTC’s price retraced 11 percent below $8,000 before resuming its bullish trend, pushing back above $8,200 an hour later and completing the 5.5 percent gap left in the futures market, again, four days prior.  Lastly, the latest $145 gap left from yesterday's close and today's open created the possibility for a correction to roughly $8,595, which came in to effect early this morning as bitcoin's price fell below $8,400 on most exchanges.  Data from the CFTC also showed open interest in short positions sat at 85.1 percent compared to 62.9 percent for bitcoin longs, hinting at a price pullback in the short-term as investors side with the possibility for a downward move in its price.

42402982,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxGx,1559570431,Security Researcher Tears Up a Binance Scam Site to Find the Hackers,"In a six hour trek through an insecure server, security researcher Harry Denley was able to reconstruct - and apparently shut down - a clever phishing attack that is targeting users of the Binance crypto exchange.  His Medium post details the activity on a phishing site - logins-binance.com12754825.ml - that collected logins and two-factor codes from confused users. The server presented what looked like a standard Binance login and the user would type in their credentials and then be forced to wait, presumably while the hackers logged in on their side.  Luckily the server was wide open and Denley was able to find tools, logs, and even email addresses for the hackers.    Jeremiah O’Connor (security researcher at Cisco) forwarded me a domain that has been phishing for Binance logins — logins-binance.com12754825.ml.      This domain has a different phishing kit to previous ones we’ve seen, as it changes the user sign-in journey to collect personal information to eventually use in social engineering methods — this server does not communicate with the Binance domain.    The code also sent emails to various bad actors. The domains he found, including the nonsensical com12754825.ml one, seem to have been shut down and emails to the embedded addresses went unanswered. As we see, security is almost 90% about making sure that login screens and URLs look right and the rest, it seems, is luck.  Denley is Director of Security at MyCrypto.com and he last reported on a massive hole in an open source paper wallet generator.

42402972,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxD1,1559570410,Encrypted Email Service Launches on Blockstack With Bitcoin Features,"An encrypted email service that uses Blockstack IDs is hoping to make online privacy tools more accessible, especially in the Middle East.  A product of Egyptian web firm Intelli Coders, Dmail launched in beta on June 1. Prior to launch, 500 people, from Saudi Arabia to India, tested the service, according to CEO Mohamed Abdou. Since going live on Saturday, 151 emails have been sent between Dmail's 600 users.  With limited access to cryptocurrency exchanges being a common theme in the Middle East especially, Abdou said the ability to receive or send bitcoin directly to the Blockstack ID’s external cryptocurrency wallet could become a key feature in attracting users to this messaging service.  “There is social information, and payment information, already attached to the message,” Abdou said. “Especially in Egypt, I’m trying to do my best to spread the culture of privacy.”  Bitcoiners living in Egypt often struggle to acquire cryptocurrency, since electricity for mining is expensive and services like exchanges generally exclude this jurisdiction. The Egyptian government has condemned both trading and commercial usage of bitcoin.  ""This is also associated with human rights because you have the right to communicate with others in a private and secure way,” Abdou told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin could be useful to software developers who are freelancing all over the world.”  Indeed, Blockstack investor and Dmail advisor Mohamed Elkasstawi, founding partner at Zk Capital, told CoinDesk the high level of unemployment among Egyptians could be seen as an opportunity for global companies in the blockchain space. Speaking of blockchain use cases more broadly, Elkasstawi said:  “Adoption will come from emerging markets where trust [in traditional systems] is low.”  How it works  Dmail uses Blockstack decentralized identities (DIDs), which can be linked to GitHub and social profiles, as well as cryptocurrency addresses, in a way that the user controls.  The service is currently listed in Blockstack’s App Mining program, which distributes bitcoin grants to projects garnering the most usage and developer contributions.  There’s clearly a demand for secure email services, as the current market leader, ProtonMail, reportedly has 10 million users.  Dmail messages are encrypted. And, with Blockstack’s storage system, only the DID holder herself has access to any related data. Plus, recipients must indicate their consent in order to receive a message from another ID holder. Recipients can still deactivate the ability for that sender to send new messages at any time.  Speaking to the potential of this free Dmail service, Blockstack’s head of growth Patrick Stanley added:  “They seem to be a highly motivated team, and developers like them throughout Egypt need better access to funding to build great apps that protect people.”  Mohamed Abdou image via Intelli Coders",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/06/03/encrypted-email-service-launches-on-blockstack-with-bitcoin-features,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/331fade676529293282e3b1698927e9d1f81c872-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddx77,1559567054,Bundesbank Chief Warns on Risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies,"The head of Germany's central bank has said central bank digital currencies could destabilize financial systems and worsen bank runs.  In a speech at the opening of the Bundesbank Symposium in Frankfurt, Germany, on May 29, Deutsche Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann said the widespread use of digital central bank money could have “serious consequences” and should not be introduced without being well thought through.  For one, Weidmann predicted, easy access to digital money could exacerbate bank runs in times of crises.  He said:  “In a crisis, financial stability may be more vulnerable than it is today, with digital central bank money very liquid and secure investment alternative. Therefore, both ‘escape to safety’ in general and a digital bank run in particular could take place faster and to a greater extent than in the past.”  Further, demand for CBDCs could be “greater or more volatile than that for cash, with corresponding effects on the central bank’s balance sheet.”  And, even in the good times, a CBDC could bring a fundamental shift in the business models of banks, as well as in intermediation of the financial markets, he said.  The central bank chief concluded those thoughts by saying:  “I see ourselves [the Bundesbank] as having the duty to offer citizens modern, fast and also internet-enabled means of payment. The idea is to develop solutions that are up to date with the latest technology without incurring unnecessary risks to financial stability.”  “The carelessness of Epimetheus and Pandora urges us to be careful,” he added.  In the same speech, Weidmann shared details of a joint project between the German central bank and stock exchange operator Deutsche Börse on the use of blockchain technology for the settlement of cash and securities.  The blockchain solutions did not perform better in every way, while the process took a little longer and resulted in relatively high computational costs, he said.  “Similar experiences have been made elsewhere in the financial sector. Despite numerous tests of blockchain-based prototypes, a real breakthrough in application is missing so far,” he said.  Weidmann’s remarks comes as a growing number of global central banks are investigating blockchain and distributed ledger technology. An April report from the World Economic Forum showed that more than 40 central banks worldwide are experimenting with the technology.

42402975,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxFy,1559563216,Samourai Wallet Raises First Funding Round in Fight Against Bitcoin Surveillance,"The team behind the privacy-obsessed bitcoin app, Samourai Wallet, has gotten its first round of venture funding.  Founded by two former developers at Blockchain.info, Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, the wallet's maintainer, Katana Cryptographic, has received a $100,000 investment from Cypherpunk Holdings.  Samourai Wallet  has been built for Android users, specifically designed to enhance privacy while using bitcoin.  ""There is no other cryptocurrency that is as battle-tested and hardened as bitcoin,"" Rodriguez, Katana's director, told CoinDesk in an email. ""The founding team of Samourai has zero interest in working on other coins, or even other layers of bitcoin at this time.""  The wallet has a number of features that provide greater privacy for users, such as a service that puts intermediary hops in a transaction in order to create uncertainty about which wallet pays for what. Another feature makes it difficult to trace the provenance of someone's bitcoin. The company earns a small fee, in bitcoin, from users that make use of these services.  Samourai also provides a privacy-enhancing service called ""stonewall"" for free. Stonewall creates doubt about the ownership of bitcoin in a given transaction. The company is also offering a forthcoming hardware product, called Dojo, which is a user-friendly bitcoin node built to work with the wallet.  High marks  Still an alpha release in the works since 2015, Samourai has 27,000 users, according to the company. Its first full version should come out in June. Rodriguez said it will use the funding to expand its development, customer service and quality assurance program, all of which have been put under significant pressure by the wallet's growth.  The products have personally impressed John Carvalho, a longtime bitcoin user who currently works at Bitrefill. Carvalho told CoinDesk:  ""I have respect for any company that adds utility for Bitcoiners and Samourai is clearly willing to go against the grain to add privacy options for users. If Bitcoin is freedom money, Samourai are freedom fighters.""  A similar sentiment spurred the investment itself. Cypherpunk, a venture fund listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker symbol HODL, was set up as an investment vehicle to support privacy-enhancing technology.  Cypherpunk's chief investment officer, Moe Adham, said in a press release, ""Katana’s technologies will advance the bitcoin project. Privacy is an increasingly important, yet underfunded sector of the market, and it is increasingly coming under attack.""  Cypherpunk's director, Dominic Frisby, told CoinDesk that his fund is looking across a wide array of blockchain technologies for opportunities to undermine global surveillance.  ""Bitcoin itself scores badly on privacy, but it scores highly on market cap and usage. What bitcoin has that no other coin does is this colossal network effect. That is a powerful thing,"" Frisby told CoinDesk.  But the fund is not limiting itself strictly to bitcoin. Frisby said:  ""We're investing on both sides – in privacy coins themselves and in bitcoin privacy tech. We think there will be growing demand for both.""

42382013,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRRt,1559559618,Bitcoin Faces Price Pullback as Signs of Bull Exhaustion Emerge,"View  BTC risks falling below $8,000 in the short-term, having created a doji candle last week.  Below $8,000, the focus would shift to the 30-day moving average, currently at $7,643, which has a penchant for reversing price pullbacks.  The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bearish if the price sees a UTC close below the 30-day MA. The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is trading above May's low of $5,263.  The case for a short-term correction would weaken if bitcoin bounces from the bullish 5-week moving average, currently at $8,220, and ends up clearing today's high of $8,746.  Bitcoin (BTC) could revisit sub-$8,000 levels in the short-term, as a longer-duration chart is flashing signs of bullish exhaustion for the first time this year.  The world's top cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessed solid two-way business last week. Prices rose to fresh 12-month highs near $9,100 only to fall back all the way to $8,000 before registering a flat close at $8,735, according to Bitstamp data.  The indecisive price action came after a solid rally. For instance, BTC rose by $3,800 in the preceding four weeks and is currently up more than 125 percent on a year-to-date basis. Further, BTC closed May with 62 percent gains – the biggest monthly gain since August 2017.  So, the ambiguous trading activity witnessed last week could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion. That argument would be further strengthened if prices settle below $8,000 this Sunday.  Therefore, the psychological support of $8,000 is the level to defend for the bulls. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,465 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Prices hit a high and low of $8,746 and $8,336, respectively, earlier today.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin created a classic doji candle last week, signaling indecision in the market place.  The candlestick, however, appeared following a four-week winning streak and with prices at one-year highs. So, it seems safe to say that indecision or exhaustion is predominantly among buyers.  It's worth noting that BTC created a similar looking doji candle in the seven days to April 14. The pattern, however, failed to yield a correction and prices hit a fresh multi-month high above $5,600 by month end, possibly because the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) was biased bullish at the time.  The latest doji candle is accompanied by overbought readings above 70 on the RSI. As a result, a correction to levels below $8,000 looks likely.  That said, the 5- and 10-week moving averages (MA), currently at $8,220 and $6,762, respectively, continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup, and could put the brakes on any price drop.  The psychological resistance of $9,000 could come into play if bitcoin bounces from the 5-week MA at $8,220 and ends up clearing today's high of $8,746.  Daily chart        On the daily chart, the RSI has produced lower highs, contradicting the higher highs on the price.  That bearish divergence, coupled with the ""bearish outside day"" candle created on May 30, indicates the cryptocurrency is overdue for a pullback, possibly to the historically strong support of the 30-day MA, currently at $7,648.  That average has consistently reversed pullbacks throughout the rally from lows near $3,700 seen on Feb. 8.  As a result, a strong bounce from that MA would revive the short-term bullish setup, while a UTC close below that level could embolden sellers, leading to a deeper correction.  Monthly chart  BTC closed last month with 62 percent gains, marking a strong follow-through to the falling channel breakout or long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed by April's candle.  The breakout looks stronger now as the 5-month MA has crossed above the 10-month MA – the first bullish crossover of those lines since September 2015.  The 5- and 10-month MAs are currently located at $6,032 and $5,414, respectively, and would likely come into play should prices find acceptance below the 30-day MA at $7,648.  The long-term bullish outlook would be invalidated only if the price drops below May's low of $5,263.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382005,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRO7,1559556056,Anti-Patent Troll Consortium Is Recruiting Blockchain Startups,"Three blockchain technology companies have joined a multi-industry consortium dedicated to protecting members against the threat of patent assertion entities (PAEs) – more commonly known as patent trolls.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Peer Mountain, MARKNetwork and IBISA have signed on to LOT Network, which was formed in 2014 by Google, software maker Red Hat and manufacturer Canon. LOT’s more than 400 members also include such household names as JPMorgan Chase, Ford, Microsoft, Tesla, Alibaba and GM.  While the blockchain firms involved aren’t as well-known, their participation is a sign that the technology is expected to become another patents battlefield, like the storied smartphone wars of the last decade.  Easily the best-known example of a firm lining up an arsenal of blockchain and crypto patents as a potential business model is self-professed bitcoin inventor Craig Wright’s company nChain.  Wright, who was recently in the news for registering a copyright on the Bitcoin white paper, has amassed some 500 blockchain and crypto-related patents.  “Craig Wright’s lawyers are filing patents to basically put landmines in the technology roadmap waiting for the industry to come down his street so he can impose a tax,” said LOT CEO Ken Seddon, who’s seen this pattern play out in other industries. “It’s a shotgun approach: he is just going to sit there and speculate on all the possible paths and the possible forks the industry might take, sowing his seeds and waiting to collect his royalty checks.”  nChain did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  For LOT and its new members, Wright’s actions are a wake-up call. To borrow from a quote attributed to Pericles: Just because blockchain startups may not take an interest in patents doesn’t mean patent trolls won’t take an interest in them.  “Philosophically, many project leaders are opposed to the very idea of intellectual property ownership such as patents,” said Jed Grant, CEO of Peer Mountain. “However, it is important to understand that it is not just lawyers who have a stake in the patent troll fight. Developers, inventors and software engineers are already adversely impacted by frivolous litigation.”  Poison pill  LOT’s “immunization” works like a poison pill: When members join they sign a 10-page agreement which states that if their patents ever fall into the hands of a patent troll then the rest of the community members get an automatic and free license.  Every member of LOT’s 430-strong community, which collectively own about 1.7 million patents, is making this exact same commitment to everybody else, said Seddon, pointing out they can of course still defend their ideas with their patents in the traditional normal way of fair play among firms.  “It's a license agreement or a contract and we are licensing each other to our patents,” he said. “It's called an encumbrance in legal terms; we are attaching an encumbrance to this patent. So if I sell it to a [patent troll] they can't come after you because you get to say, hold on, I have a license.”  Seddon said innovation and patents go hand in hand, but there are always going to be some bad actors who take advantage of the system and try to make a profit from it  The root of the problem, according to Seddon, is that companies at some stage of their lives sell patents in the open market, whether a startup with a handful of patents or Microsoft with 80,000.  Patent trolls are also afforded a foothold wherever a new technology is applied to an existing system; a good example is in the auto industry where cars are now a locus for an assortment of new technology applications like smartphones, he said, adding:  “Patent trolls don’t make products, they don’t have factories or R&D centers. They are often nothing more than lawyers who have partnered with VC money to go around and buy patents and sue companies for shakedown money.”  The risk may be compounded for blockchain companies since the industry overlaps with other verticals, said Maria Mateo, project lead at IBISA.  “So we rely on other protocols to operate our businesses,” she said. “The intersection of technologies opens us up to exposure to patent troll litigation, even if blockchain patents themselves are only now starting to grow in number.”  Troll image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/03/anti-patent-troll-consortium-is-recruiting-blockchain-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8aa63228265203b5aafa08363ad7f66bffe0d5e2-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382004,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRPN,1559548853,Walmart Joins Pharmaceutical-Tracking Blockchain Consortium MediLedger,"Big-box retail giant Walmart has joined MediLedger, a consortium building a blockchain for tracking the provenance of pharmaceuticals.  A spokeswoman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company confirmed Walmart's participation to CoinDesk but had no further comment.  The move represents a deepening of Walmart's involvement with blockchain technology. Separately, the retailer is a key participant in IBM’s Food Trust, a system for tracking fresh produce through the supply chain that's built on the Hyperledger Fabric platform.  Walmart has insisted that its suppliers of leafy greens integrate the IBM blockchain, and it should bring similar supply-chain clout to MediLedger, whose members already include pharmaceutical manufacturers such as Pfizer and the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health.  ""Health and wellness,"" a category that includes pharmacy and over-the-counter drugs, accounted for $35 billion of Walmart's U.S. sales in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, or 10% of the total, according to the company's annual report.  Unlike Food Trust, MediLedger uses an enterprise version of the ethereum blockchain, built with a modified version of the Parity client and a consensus mechanism called proof of authority. The consortium is spearheaded by San Francisco-based blockchain firm Chronicled, which closed a $16 million funding round earlier this year.  Walmart joins as MediLedger prepares to kick off a pilot project with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in early June. The agency is testing various approaches to creating an interoperable, digitized system for tracking and verifying prescription drugs, something Congress has mandated it deliver by 2023.  Eric Garvin, co-lead of MediLedger, told CoinDesk:  “The pilots only really make sense if you are working with a group of collaborators.”  MediLedger initially focused on the verification of drugs that are returned to be resold – a sliver of the pharma market, but one that’s still worth over $6 billion. Legislation to help prevent fraudulent products being resold comes into effect in November of this year.  Now the expanded group will start work on the more broad-ranging tracking of all pharma products which involves interoperable data and packaging serialization.  Why blockchain?  It could be argued that in places like the U.K. where the healthcare system is largely run by the government, a digitized system like the one FDA has been mandated to create might be implemented more easily using a centralized system.  But the U.S. is the largest privatized healthcare system in the world (with the highest prices), which makes for a sprawling fragmentation of siloed databases, supporting the case for a decentralized solution.  The Congressionally mandated 10-year roadmap to a standardized form of serialization on all drug packaging began with the very largest firms complying with electronic tracking of lot shipments, i.e. 100 boxes of some medicine at a time. The next goal was more granular serialization at the level of pillbox or bottle  The third plank of the legislation was that the data being gathered had to be technically interoperable.  That last requirement made some people in the industry think “blockchain is the perfect solution,” said Maria Palombini, director of communities and initiatives development for emerging technology at the IEEE Standards Association.  Palombini stressed that the FDA does not advocate one technology over another and its only prescription is the use of recognized standards within each pilot’s tech stacks.  However, making data (and metadata) interoperable presents the industry with a challenge, she said:  “I think some companies will try and embrace this, and some others will try and stay away from blockchain. Because there is one word that scares them – transparency.”  Garvin said nodes are distributed and operated by industry participants and technology providers, but that data privacy is being addressed with zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic method that allows someone to prove something is true about a set of data without exposing the data itself.  This data transparency question is especially pointed at the ends of the supply chain with large pharma dispensers like Walmart, who are unaccustomed to potentially sharing their sales data with competitors.  “They have to try and figure out a way to share this data and give far more visibility into the inventory, but also now the retailers are going to have to give data back which they have never really been required to do,” said Palombini. “That’s going to be a really hard part here.”  Walmart Pharmacy image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/03/walmart-joins-pharmaceutical-tracking-blockchain-consortium-mediledger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/441586b5ed78adf699cb624941e86c574a94bffc-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Prague-based company Braiins is perhaps less well-known than Slush Pool, one of the largest bitcoin mining pools as it makes up more than 9 percent of the cryptocurrency's hashrate today.  Yet Braiins has been operating it since it took over the historic mining pool six years ago. Now, Braiins is moving to make its involvement with Slush Pool more obvious, in part with a redesign of its logo and all its product websites.  Braiins creative director Luboš Buračinský told CoinDesk:  ""After running and developing Slush Pool for the last six years more or less in the background, we're going to take a more visible public position.""  With the rebrand, Braiins wants all its products to fall under one banner. ""The rebranding will also unify our other products and services, including Braiins OS,"" Buračinský continued.  Miners need to run what's known as ""firmware"" on their mining devices to monitor the performance. Braiins OS, launched September of last year, differs from other mining firmwares because it's open-source -- it's not closed off like other proprietary firmwares.  ""If you own the hardware, you should be able to have full control of it without worrying about some 'hidden features',"" the project announcement post explains.  In addition, Braiins plans to release several new updates to their products in the coming months. The firm is working on a new ""payout"" feature for the mining pool, which would allow miners to have more control of how they get paid.  Further, Braiins is ""replacing the CGMiner with Rust implementation"" for Braiins OS, which would make ""adding new hardware much easier,"" according to the firm.

42382007,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRQd,1559534456,Why Bitcoin's 'Culture War' Matters,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.      Let’s talk about bitcoin, toxicity and inclusiveness.  (Boy, my Twitter feed is going to have fun over the next few days.)  To start with, let me take a position: I stand with those people, especially women, who’ve lately been calling out maltreatment from members of the bitcoin community and citing rude and abusive behavior as proof of that community’s lack of inclusiveness. These are people who believe in cryptocurrency technology's potential but feel discouraged to believe that they belong to the community’s dominant white-male subculture. If this technology is to fulfill its global potential, the community associated with it must confront this problem.  But the real point of this column is not to just defend these critics. It’s to debunk one of the more common positions adopted by those who take issue with their complaints, particularly on Twitter. In doing so, I hope to emphasize just how important the concepts of “community” and “culture” are to the healthy development of crypto technology and the ecosystem growing around it.  Hammer culture?  The line that’s most often thrown back at those calling out incivility is that bitcoin is nothing more than a technology, a tool, and that it’s meaningless to attach to it value judgments relating to human behavior. Bitcoin is amoral, apolitical and a-cultural, the argument goes, and like any technology it is used by good and bad people alike.  These pundits, warning of a political correctness-based threat to free speech, will then advise the injured party to take issue directly with the bad actors but refrain from agitating for community-wide change.  A perfect example of the genre came from outspoken lawyer Preston Byrne.  Clever, yes. But it’s extremely unhelpful, because the examples given do not share equivalent terms of reference.  Byrne’s “hammer” refers solely to the steel implement that tradesmen use. By contrast, people complaining about “bitcoin” are clearly using the word in a much wider context than in merely a reference to the code, to the ones and zeros that comprise the bitcoin protocol. They are inherently talking about the wider ecosystem and community gathered around the idea of bitcoin.  So, let’s equalize the terms, shall we? We can turn each of these nouns into a modifier of the word “community.”  While it might sound silly to talk about a “hammer community,” there may well be groups of hammer-obsessed souls who debate questions of design and ease of use at meetups and in chat rooms. If so, I’m going to guess that that community would probably also be predominantly male.  But the real issue is that such a hammer community is going to be far less important to the future design and evolution of hammer technology than bitcoin’s community is to its. I’m no expert, but I don’t see a great deal of change in hammer technology having occurred over the centuries and I’m not sure people expect much in the future. As such, we don’t see much jockeying among users to ensure that proposals for hammer upgrades are implemented and standardized to their preferred design.  By contrast, the open-source technology behind bitcoin is in a constant state of evolution. It is, by definition, under development, which is why we talk about the engineers who work on it as “developers,” not “custodians.” As such, there is a constant battle of interests over who gets to modify the code. Exhibit A: the block-size debate.  Counter-arguing that those who don’t like the process can just fork the code, as the large-blockers did, and set up their own new community, doesn’t cut it for me. Bitcoin is the brand that matters. Any newcomer will struggle to achieve the same network effects. Secession just isn’t viable for anyone who likes its current design but doesn’t like how its future is being defined.  Also, is there a “hammer ecosystem?” Maybe. But beyond producers of nails, and perhaps steel and rubber or wood suppliers, you can hardly call it a complex ecosystem.  Bitcoin, by contrast, which purports to reinvent the global system of money, has attracted an inherently vast array of different technology providers, all of whom have competing interests in how it is designed, managed and marketed to the world. I’m not just talking about businesses applications built on top of it, but also the developers of related encryption, payment channel, smart contract and other vitally important technologies, all of which are themselves in a constant state of flux.  (I’m guessing that the exhibition halls at hammer conventions don’t have quite the same spread of offerings as cryptocurrency events such as Consensus.)  Saying that bitcoin is nothing but a tool, is like saying that music is nothing but a system for ordering different audible tones.  Money = community  When Paul Vigna and I wrote The Age of Cryptocurrency, we spent a lot of time chronicling the emergence of the community that had formed around bitcoin, which we saw as fundamental to its success. It struck us that the notion of a bitcoin community was so prominent -- the ""c"" word was always being bandied about -- because bitcoin embodied a profound and sweeping social idea. It offered nothing less than a reinvention of money, a revolution in the entire system for coordinating human value exchange.  Money only works to the extent that there is widespread belief in it, that people buy into its core myth. Money, Felix Martin says, is a social technology, by which he means that its functionality and usability depend far less on the physical qualities of the token that represents it than on the collective agreement among large communities of people that their token captures, represents and communicates transferable value. This is true whether we’re talking about gold, dollar bills, entries in a bank account, or cryptocurrency.  By extension, then, for any form of money to succeed, it must sustain a vibrant, growing community.  Communities = culture  The thing about communities is that they inevitably develop cultures. In self-defining their boundaries of belonging, they develop shared ways of seeing and language -- akin to a kind of social protocol – that regulate (in a very unofficial, and quite subconscious way) their members’ behavior.  As they evolve, cultures can become more or less open, more or less inclusive, more or less abrasive in their treatment of outsiders. And inevitably, these cultural features will either encourage or impede the growth of the community.  All this should hardly be a revelation. Anthropology, the study of culture, is a globally widespread and influential field (one that is now appropriately turning its attention to cryptocurrency communities.)  Studies of U.S. culture, from Alexis de Tocqueville down, have rightly pointed to the inclusiveness of the founding fathers’ ideas as a key driver of its economic expansion. In fact, American culture is arguably its most important ingredient for success, a social manifestation of Joseph Nye’s notion of the United States’ “soft power.”  So, yes, bitcoin culture really, really matters. If the compelling ideas behind permissionless, peer-to-peer exchange and censorship-resistant money that attract people of all stripes to it are to retain those people’s interest and grow in influence, the bitcoin community needs to evolve a more inclusive culture.  The only way to do that is to spur the kind of open debates that have always driven the progress of human culture -- those which shifted norms and mores to the point that it became unacceptable to own slaves, to spit in public, or to jump a queue.  So, listen up, bitcoin. It’s time to confront your toxicity.  Hazard drums image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

According to a report from the Financial Times on Sunday, the CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the agency held ""very early stages of conversations” with Facebook. The goal was to better understand if the firm's crypto stablecoin could potentially fall under the CFTC's regulatory remit.  “We’re very interested in understanding it better,” Giancarlo was quoted as saying in the report. “We can only act on an application, we don’t have anything in front of us.”  The news comes amid recent reports that Facebook also held talks with government officials in both the U.S. and the U.K. to discuss opportunities and regulatory issues for its crypto stablecoin called GlobalCoin.  The cryptocurrency, under Facebook's Project Libra, is reportedly aimed to allow Facebook's global users to transfer money across borders and to make online purchases.  Giancarlo added it's now too soon to say whether Facebook's GlobalCoin could fall under CFTC's remit but said if the cryptocurrency could be backed by the U.S. dollar, then there might be less of a need for derivatives tied to it.  “That’s very clever,” Giancarlo said of this design. However, the report added that one top compliance issue by regulators is whether and how Facebook will adhere to and implement the anti-money laundering and know-your-customer measures.
