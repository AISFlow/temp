42398410,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRPX,1433371857,Final BitLicense Proves Divisive Milestone in US Bitcoin Regulation,"""Far from perfect."" ""Poorly fitting."" ""Meh.""  The comments were just some of the many that poured in today as members of the bitcoin and digital currency ecosystem gave their first impressions of the final version of the BitLicense, New York's long-awaited regulatory framework for the industry introduced today.  While hardly surprising given the two-year debate over the measures, the comments point to the sharp disconnect between headlines touting the regulation as a milestone achievement and the reaction of those affected by its provisions.  Even if the BitLicense succeeds at ""legitimizing"" the industry, it's clear its participants were after something more – the chance for innovation in the sector to advance in a way they feel is more in line with the permissions given to past emerging technologies.  ""They changed so little with this version, it's laughable,"" Yale Law School's Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk.  The author of a petition for the bill to include safe harbor provisions for early-stage startups, carve outs for micropayments and other such leniencies, Stark's comments may have been expected, but they were far from solitary.  Coin Center  , the nonprofit research group backed by Andreessen Horowitz and RRE Ventures, went so far as to vow to mobilize its resources to stop similar regulation.  Executive director Jerry Brito said:  ""The only consolation is that now businesses have clarity on some other obligations. It's a mixed bag, is the best that can be said about the BitLicense.""  The tone of Brito's remarks was characteristic of general social media conversation, which saw groups such as the Bitcoin Foundation and individuals like BitFury board vice chairman George Kikvadze vocally denounce the law, while investors and unaffected parties like VC Barry Silbert and BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shrugged off the update.  While concerns or indifference dominated the Internet conversation, the overall sentiment was more balanced, with some praising the laws as a best effort that will move conversation forward as the industry seeks to make real NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky's ""gut feeling"" that it will succeed.  ""Would I welcome lighter touch?"" Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire asked. ""Sure, but I think it's an important stake in the ground.""  Concerns remain  Elsewhere in its release, Coin Center took aim at the BitLicense for being too technology-specific, a charge that implies the law imposes a higher threshold for compliance on bitcoin startups than those in traditional financial services.  Also attacked was the lack of specificity, most visible in the grey area that the regulations will likely leave for startups working on products that don't fit the templates of existing business models.  For example, Allaire noted questions about private key custodianship, in which a company may hold one key to a client's funds, but not all, was not covered, a point visible in the online discussion.    This is an inexcusable oversight @BenLawsky. This point was highlighted repeatedly and loudly for past 9 months. https://t.co/lJ03BlCVCu        — Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) June 3, 2015      Other representatives from the technology's business community were open about their disappointment, but suggested they would look to work with the NYDFS as it seeks to carry out the provisions of the BitLicense.  ""For a company like Circle, it's very cut and dry,"" Allaire said. ""For others, not so much.""  In statements to CoinDesk, John Collins, head of policy and government affairs at Coinbase, struck a familiar attack against the law's inconsistencies with federal guidelines.  ""It's troubling that this nascent industry is being subjected to more onerous regulations than those typically applied to legacy financial institutions,"" Collins said.  Boost VC CEO Adam Draper took a similarly negative approach to the announcement. Draper, whose startup incubator recently invested in 21 bitcoin companies are part of its Tribe 5 batch, had previously attacked the law for what he said would be the added legal costs of compliance.  ""It's going to be expensive to start a bitcoin startup. Innovation will be restricted to those with the money,"" Draper told CoinDesk. ""It's not ideal.""  'Net positive'  Still others took a more balanced tone, even formerly outspoken critics such as Allaire, whose bitcoin wallet and brokerage recently raised $50m from investors including Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital.  Allaire told CoinDesk that, over time, his concerns were assuaged as provisions that called for duplicative financial crime reporting were removed and clarity was provided in regards to what changes to its product and investor team would require approval from the NYDFS.  ""When the first draft of the BitLicense emerged, at that point in time, we were outspoken in what our concerns were. Some specific provisions that were in there were technically impossible for us to comply with, so we either had to stop using bitcoin or see that changes were made,"" Allaire said.  MIT Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) director Brian Forde also praised Lawsky and the NYDFS for making the changes it had requested to the bill, suggesting the law is likely to have a positive impact on the ecosystem by encouraging new interest and financial support.  Forde told CoinDesk:  ""It's great to see that active voices in the bitcoin community were heard by Superintendent Lawsky and his team, and they updated regulations and made clarifications that will protect consumers and spur more investment in entrepreneurs building companies in this space.""  Juan Llanos, a former risk and compliance expert at the Bitcoin Foundation and Bitreseve, was more measured, voicing his belief that the rules are ""pretty standard"" in context of those for traditional financial institutions.  He also spoke to the disconnect between both sides on the issue.  ""What I think has caused so much agitation here is the combination of the DFS having made explicit certain requirements that had been implemented via examination before (eg cybersecurity obligations) with the relative inexperience of a new generation of entrepreneurs that didn’t expect the financial services world to be so restrictive,"" he said.  Innovative business models  In his speech, Lawsky called for regulators and technologists to commit to an ongoing dialogue regarding legislation, though comments illustrated how immediately some of these discussions may be needed.  Stark, for example, took issue with the idea that startups would need a license to ""issue a virtual currency"", which she argued would hurt the growing number of bitcoin 2.0 projects seeking to use cryptographic tokens to incentivize communities.  Though exceptions were made for the use of tokens for non-financial purposes, Stark predicted the industry will see a broader trend toward decentralization, though at the cost of ease of use for consumers.  Both Allaire and SKBI research fellow Tim Swanson, for instance, differed on how business models such as those advertised by 21 Inc and bitcoin mining firms in general would be viewed under the law.  While Allaire suggested he thought distributing mining technology and sharing the gains would be excluded, Swanson framed this as more of an unanswered question.  ""When a miner sends work to a pool, the pool typically keeps the reward money on the pool before sending it to the miner or until the miner manually removes it. Would mining pools be considered a custodian or depository institution since they control this asset?"" he asked.  Impact assured  Given the sizable media attention, however, the BitLicense has arguably already succeeded at casting the industry in a more positive light.  This, Allaire argued, would help the industry secure more partnerships and build better businesses. Others like Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring said her nonprofit group would work to level the playing field for smaller startups, which she argues will lack a ""clear onramp"" to the industry.  Together, the comments suggest the BitLicense may in fact be just as much a milestone as it is a stepping stone in a longer dialogue between regulators and the industry, one that could have a wide impact in the US.  The California Department of Business Oversight, the agency tasked with considering bitcoin regulation under its state law, indicated it would be assessing the law as part of its own fact-finding on the industry.  ""As we consider how we want to approach virtual currency, we have closely followed regulatory developments in New York and elsewhere,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We will analyze the rules unveiled today as we continue our deliberations.""

42398404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRJd,1433345442,New York Releases Final BitLicense,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released the final version of its long-awaited regulatory framework for digital currency companies today.  The final release of the BitLicense follows nearly two years of fact-finding and debate. The NYDFS began crafting the rules after it determined the technology should not be regulated under existing state law.  The bill will not become law until its publication in the New York state register, a weekly government-issued guide to proposed rulemakings.  Agency approval  In remarks issued by NYDFS at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington, DC today, superintendent Benjamin Lawsky clarified that the final regulation meant firms will no longer need the agency's approval for each new software update or round of venture capital funding.  Additional changes include the fact that companies can now satisfy BitLicense and money transmitter license requirements simultaneously with a ""one-stop"" application submission.  Overall, Lawsky was tepid in his optimism about the technology, reiterating past statements that suggest he believes bitcoin or other decentralized blockchain technologies could bring about needed change in the financial sector:  ""We are excited about the potential digital currency holds for helping drive long-overdue changes in our ossified payments system. We simply want to make sure that we put in place guardrails that protect consumers and root out illicit activity – without stifling beneficial innovation.""  Limited changes  As indicated by Lawsky in his speech, edits to the final version of the release are limited to section 200.10. This section aims to clarify when businesses working with digital currency would need approval from the NYDFS for certain actions, or 'changes'.  In the latest version, a change is defined as something ""proposed to an existing product, service, or activity that may cause such product, service, or activity to be materially different from that previously listed on the application for licensing by the superintendent"".  This includes instances that present legal or regulatory issues as a result of the update or if the update raises safety concerns.  Lawsky said:  ""We have no interest in micromanaging minor app updates. We’re not Apple.""  The sparse nature of the changes marks a shift from the last revision to the law. Released in February of this year, the revised BitLicense included new exemptions for software providers, enhanced supervision requirements and altered many definitions used in the NYDFS' initial draft.  Notably absent were several proposals put forth by the digital currency community, including exemptions for entities working on open-source protocols and micropayments, alongside a 24-month safe harbor period for early-stage startups.  Turning back the clock  Elsewhere Lawsky used the speech, one of his last before his exit from the agency this summer, to caution regulators against repressive regulation that attempts to ""turn back the clock"" for new technologies.  ""Attempting to force novel technologies and business models into existing regulatory boxes – simply because 'that is the way it has always been done' – may not be a sensible approach. We need, at times, to be more creative than that as regulators – even if it takes us outside our comfort zone,"" Lawsky continued.  The final release comes amid a time of increasing discussion regarding how digital currencies should be regulated at the state level in the US in absence of federal laws.  'Early innings'  Though Lawsky was positive in his remarks on the technology, his speech also took aim at the tech community and its obligation to regulators. He said:  ""Technologists also have a responsibility of their own to meet. They cannot simply ignore the rules they do not like and try to create 'facts on the ground' ... generally speaking, consumer protection rules exist for good reason.""  Technologists have the right to put pressure on regulators should they believe laws to be misguided, he added, but this should not come at the cost of eroding the provisions that limit harm.  This balance was highlighted in Lawsky's statements that the law seeks to only apply to ""financial intermediaries"" and not software providers.  ""There is a basic bargain that when a financial company is entrusted with safeguarding customer funds and receives a license from the state to do so – it accepts the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny to help ensure that a consumer’s money does not just disappear into a black hole,"" he added.  Still, Lawsky stressed this debate is still in ""early innings"", predicting that a ""collision"" between regulators and the financial technology was only beginning. He concluded:  ""Both sides – regulators and technologists – could benefit from taking a moment and trying to put themselves in the shoes of their counterpart across the table.""

42398399,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRGg,1433335378,BitPay's Multisig Wallet 'Copay' to Leave Beta Today,"Bitcoin payments processor BitPay has announced that Copay, its multisig bitcoin wallet, is set to leave beta today.      Copay, originally known as Cosign, aims to combat bitcoin wallet thefts by offering customisable security for businesses and individuals.      Like other multisig products, a predetermined number of parties must 'sign off' each Copay transaction before it is broadcast to the bitcoin network.      The app, which has been in development for over a year, is fully open-source and able to be ""forked, changed, and developed by the community,"" the company said.    The launch comes as multisig security is gaining ground among bitcoin companies. Just last month, UK-based digital assets service provider Elliptic partnered with Gem to offer a custodian service for the private keys of multisig wallets.  The californian bitcoin API developer, which has raised $3.3m to date, launched its multisig wallet API back in April.

42398415,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRQW,1433332850,Mirror Raises $8.8 Million for Bitcoin Smart Contracts Trading,"Mirror has secured $8.8m in Series A financing to reposition itself as a smart contract trading platform built on bitcoin's blockchain.  Led by Ripple Labs investor Route 66 Ventures, the round also included Battery Ventures, Crosslink Capital, RRE Ventures and Tim Draper. As part of the deal, Route 66 venture partner Pascal Bouvier will join Mirror's board of directors.  Reports of Mirror's round first surfaced in a New York Times article that suggested the company had raised $12.5m to fund a pivot toward smart contract technology with the help of renowned cryptography expert Nick Szabo.  In a statement, CEO Avish Bhama spoke of the wider impact he hopes his company's new direction will have.  ""There is an unbundling of the financial services industry that’s occurring right now, and we see an enormous opportunity to provide advanced, more efficient services for risk management and hedging.""  With total investment standing at $12.8m, Mirror indicated it will use the funding to build out its engineering team while scaling its international operations.  The company raised $4m in seed funding last May from Battery Ventures, Tim Draper and AOL CEO Steve Case under its previous name, Vaurum, before rebranding later that year.  At the time, the company suggested it would seek to improve liquidity in international markets and democratize access to the financial system.
