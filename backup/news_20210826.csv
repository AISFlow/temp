13222953,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=470230,1630021151,Midas Touch Director Gives Bitcoin Target Of $100K Or Higher,"Bitcoin has been moving sideways during the day after an increase in selling pressure brought back to mid-range of its current levels. The first cryptocurrency by market cap trades at $47,394 with a 5.4% profit in the daily chart. Despite the cool off in the crypto market, sentiment has turned bullish. Managing Director of Midas Touch Consulting Florian Grummes recently supported the optimism thesis for the long term. In an interview with David from Kitco News, Grummes reiterated his prediction on Bitcoin and claimed that the cryptocurrency will continue into uncharted territory in 2021. In that sense, he expects BTC&apos;s price to rise above the $100,000 mark in the next six months on the back of fresh capital coming into the market. Financial institutions could have bigger motivations to jump into BTC. The cryptocurrency is amongst the best-performing assets of the decade and, as Grummes said, there is &apos;a lot of pressure&apos; on these entities to show good performance on their investments. The Managing Director for Midas Touch believes that Bitcoin was designed to perform well under the current economical conditions. He said: (…) lots of institutions still have to catch up there, and I think this was all implemented in the game theory of Satoshi (Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin) and it&apos;s playing out wonderfully. In the short term, Grummes acknowledged that BTC&apos;s price saw a &apos;good&apos; bounce over the past weeks.

13222954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=470206,1630018832,Why Breaking $49K Is Important For Bitcoin To See Another All-Time High,"Bitcoin has once again dipped back down below its $47K resistance point. This time, the price of the digital asset looks to have turned its attention downwards. While this downward correction continues, it is important to know where this correction might lead. Price dips are not a novel concept in bull markets. In fact, price dips are often expected following a rally in the price of any digital asset. Related Reading | Why An 18% Drop In Bitcoin Could Still Be Bullish This drop in price is usually the market taking a bit of a step backward. Not necessarily pulling out of the asset. Bitcoin had only recently broken $50K and did not rest at this position for long. So a small downward stretch will most likely lead to a bounce-back that will push the price higher back above $50K. With a consolidation point putting the digital asset at a reasonable position above $50K. Bitcoin Setup For New All-Time High For bitcoin to hit a new all-time high as the market expects, some factors would play into this. Simply speaking, certain signals would need to be triggered for this price jump.

The news was first reported by The Block.  1inch is in the early stages of this latest venture round, which it is looking to close by the end of 2021.  In an email, 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz said the company would use the capital to decentralize its “network of backers even further,” noting that it had already grown “from two-and-a-half men in 2019 to more than 65 contributors and multiple teams around the globe.”  Kunz added that 1inch was “looking for smart money and value add contributors to help us with our path forward with 1inch Pro, its institutional-grade, regulated product offering.”  Sergey Maslennikov, 1inch’s chief communications officer, wrote separately that the company would expand its developer and marketing teams as it “aims to release two more protocols.”  Maslennikov also said that 1inch was looking “to onboard the next 10 million users in DeFi” with its 1inch wallet app.  Earlier this month, 1inch expanded to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet, which it expects will help increase transaction speeds and lower gas fees for 1inch users.  “The 1INCH token price in discussion is $1.50 and will be sold in part from our Growth & Development Fund to ensure the healthy growth and expansion of the 1inch Network,” Maslennikov said of the raise.  “This round’s tokens will also have a lock-up period with linear vesting similar to previous rounds,” he added.

42374487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZpz5,1630010244,Market Wrap: Crypto Pullback Deepens; Expect Higher Volatility,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Thursday as bullish sentiment wanes. Stocks were also lower as Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan mentioned during an interview on CNBC that he would like to see tapering of bond purchases announced in September.  Bitcoin was trading around $46,000 at press time and is down about 4% over the past 24 hours. Technical charts suggest the pullback could stabilize between the $42,000-$45,000 support zone.  Traders will be monitoring Friday’s month-end option expiration, which could be a source of volatility. “The moderate volatility in BTC price this morning is likely due to an estimated $1.8 billion of monthly BTC options set to expire tomorrow,” wrote FundStrat in a newsletter on Thursday.  “The current max pain level, according to the derivatives exchange Derebit, is at $44,000,” FundStrat wrote.  For now, digital asset manager StackFunds wrote in a Thursday report that further consolidation is expected around current levels before the next upside push.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $47,000, -3.6%  Ether (ETH) $3,120, -3.09%  Traditional markets:  S&P 500: 4470, -0.58%  Gold: $1,793, +0.11%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.35%, compared with 1.347% on Wednesday  Bitcoin whales selling  Large bitcoin holders, often referred to as whales (addresses with 1,000-10,000 BTC), have been distributing their holdings, according to blockchain data. Smaller bitcoin holders (addresses with 1-1,000 BTC), however, have been adding to positions, which could mean that retail investors have fueled the recent bitcoin rally.  The fact that large holders are in profit taking mode is an “unfavorable situation and leans bearish,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.  Higher volatility expected  “There has been a clear decoupling between short-term and long-term volatility since August 9,” options data provider Skew tweeted on Thursday. “Traders are expecting bitcoin volatility to ramp up in the later part of the year.”  The options market has also flipped bearish for the short term, with the one-week put-call skew reporting positive values at press time. That’s a sign of short-term puts, or bearish bets, drawing higher demand than calls, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Bitcoin miner positioning  Bitcoin miners are back in accumulation mode after the sharp sell-off earlier this year. The miners’ positioning index (MPI), which tracks the ratio of BTC leaving all miner wallets, stabilized around negative levels.  “In every bitcoin bull run, miners sell before the final cycle top,” CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post. “This occurred in 2013, 2017 and now in 2021 (as shown in the yellow boxes below).”  “Recently we have entered a short-term bear market, also considered a correction,” CryptoQuant wrote. It is possible that miners are waiting for higher prices to sell their BTC holdings.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty – a measure of the amount of computing resources required to mine bitcoin – has increased for the third time in a row in yet another sign of the network’s staying power following a crackdown on the industry earlier this year by authorities in China.  On Wednesday, the blockchain’s mining difficulty increased by 13.2% at block 697,536, according to several mining sites.  Altcoin roundup:  Can Avalanche Keep It Up? In an explosive move reminiscent of the growth of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon earlier this year, the Avalanche blockchain is attracting a flood of new deposits into its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Despite the signs of strength, however, not all analysts are convinced the Ethereum competitor has staying power, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reports.  What Binance Smart Chain’s Lagging Performance Means for Layer 1 Blockchains: It was not long ago when Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was beating Ethereum by several blockchain metrics, but the former Ethereum alternative darling has seen its growth slow amid intensified layer 1 blockchain competition. A growing number of “rug pulls,” or exploits on BSC, meanwhile, has also raised questions about BSC’s security after some users have left the platform fearing for the safety of their funds, according to analysts. BSC’s challenges show that while attracting new capital via cheaper, faster transactions is a first key step for any smart contract blockchain, security and decentralization are still essential for retaining users in the long run.  RLY Holders Approve Social Token Platform’s Decentralization Plan: Social token platform Rally is set to initiate a five-pronged decentralization plan after token holders voted unanimously in favor of the proposal Thursday. Rally will now branch into a venture studio, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a nonprofit, an Asia-focused entity and U.S.-based Rally. Platform leads pitched the new structure as a “major step” toward full decentralization – a common goal in the crypto sector. The proposal was submitted last week.

42421254,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXklUz,1630009408,Welcome to the New CoinDesk,"Today CoinDesk launches a completely redesigned website, crafted to match the needs of our rapidly expanding – and increasingly mobile – audience. Articles are easier to read, our price pages put more information at your fingertips, and the homepage is a better showcase for all of our content. We think our new logo looks pretty snazzy, too.  The changes aren’t just skin deep. The site also has a new engine behind the scenes: an entirely new content management system (CMS) and digital experience platform called Arc XP. Used by several prominent media companies (most notably the Washington Post, which first built it for its own newsroom’s needs and then offered it up to other organizations like it), Arc is a CMS designed specifically for publishers. We’re excited to roll out a site with such a firm foundation, and we’ll be leveraging its highly scalable platform to offer even more innovative experiences in the coming months.  Why such a dramatic shift? Easy – we had to.  It would be hard to think of an industry in today’s world more dynamic than digital assets. Glancing at the sector today versus a year ago, you quickly understand that rapid change is the norm. But even by crypto standards, what’s happened in recent months has been transformative; when digital assets inspire skits on SNL, you know something big is happening.  Even for a purely digital publication like CoinDesk, keeping up with all this change is a tough job. The audience for CoinDesk is no longer just crypto enthusiasts, traders, professional investors and the like – the site now regularly reaches a vast audience of everyday, tech-savvy people who can plainly see the rising influence of this industry and want to learn more.  While CoinDesk has always had excellent designers and product managers improving our platform over the years, it’s become clear that incremental upgrades are no longer what was called for. To meet the challenge of today’s crypto audience, we needed to re-engineer the site from top to bottom.  That’s a huge task, and one that fell squarely on the shoulders of our chief product officer, Mina Azimov. When Mina joined CoinDesk last fall, there was already a growing recognition that our site was pushing its WordPress-based roots past their limits. With the mandate to both update the design of the site AND modernize our back end, Mina built a team and focused its efforts around taking our platform to a new level.  Prior to today’s launch, I spoke with Mina to talk about the new CoinDesk, and what it says about today’s crypto audience.  Pete Pachal: Why now? Why is this the time to redesign CoinDesk?  Mina Azimov: CoinDesk has seen exponential audience growth as crypto interest has become increasingly more mainstream. We went from 2.5 million unique visitors per month to more than 30 million. So we felt it’s time to give that audience more reasons to be engaged by giving them a fuller experience.  With such massive growth, it’s not just numbers – the nature of the audience is changing. A bigger audience has different demands of websites, especially media websites. How does this change respond to that?  We’ve gone from a crypto audience to now we’re moving into a mainstream audience. Two to three days after I joined [CoinDesk], PayPal made an announcement, saying that they would let customers buy bitcoin. And shortly after, Tesla made the announcement that they’d be accepting bitcoin. And JPMorgan, and other major financial institutions have joined in. And then there was a huge interest from a “discovery” audience – wanting to learn more about crypto and possibly find ways to invest. And these are (largely) millennials and Gen Zers that are really interested in investing in crypto.  How do you balance that “discovery” audience with CoinDesk’s traditional audience? Obviously everyone wants more eyeballs, but how do you ensure that you’re not leaving core readers behind?  In order to hit that perfect chord, we’ve done user testing on our new design to make sure it’s appealing and sending the right messaging – delivering the right type of information for different kinds of audiences. One of the ways we’re doing that is with our redesigned Learn section, now called Crypto Explainer+. It’s a full experience that will help you navigate the crypto world regardless of your level.  For Crypto Explainer+, we’ve also injected difficulty levels that are matching to the content type. Whether that’s beginner, intermediate or expert level, it’ll provide you with the right type of right level of educational information that you’re going to need.  In subsequent weeks, we’ll have crypto “crash courses,” which were inspired by Instagram stories. Of all the Explainer+ features, it performed the best in user testing. It’s designed for a mobile experience, which makes up a significant percentage of our readers. It’s short and concise, with animations and illustrations. You can select different topics, such as what you need to know about bitcoin, and it’ll walk you through a story to play through various chapters.  Why the name Crypto Explainer+?  We went through dozens and dozens of various names. There were some that we absolutely loved, but they were taken. We user-tested all of them. This one scored the best, and it was still available. It’s creative enough, and yet its message is unambiguous. And it seemed to resonate with all the different types of audiences we have at CoinDesk.  What are some of the other site features that we might see in the coming weeks?  We’re going to have a single sign-on (SSO), which will give our audience a very personalized experience. That’s happening by the end of the year. We’ll also be rolling out $DESK on the site ($DESK is CoinDesk’s own digital token, with no monetary value), which we introduced in beta phase during Consensus earlier this year. It will be a way to encourage users to engage more deeply with various types of content on CoinDesk.  Can you talk a little bit about price pages? A price page can be aimed at retail investors and newbies, and it can also appeal to institutional and professional traders. What is CoinDesk’s approach to this?  Our Price Pages drive the lion’s share of entrances onto CoinDesk.com, but there are a lot of price pages out there. So we did a very deep competitive analysis, both across the crypto landscape and outside of crypto. We tested extensively and came up with the new price page design to meet most of our audience’s needs. It has a variety of information on the page that’s easy to navigate and find. We’ve also partnered with IntoTheBlock for some metrics, such as social sentiment – which was a favorite with the audience we tested.  Tell me about the new homepage, which these days typically isn’t a reader’s first stop.  The homepage is the face of the site – thus, we wanted to bring the look and feel of our homepage closer to the news outlet mission that’s core to CoinDesk’s brand and identity. Also, it doesn’t matter whether you’re coming through an article or a price page – no matter where you are on the page, it’s very natural to click on the primary logo and go to the homepage. Thus, we wanted to make sure the main top navigation on the homepage was straightforward and that all the information is categorized clearly.  Mobile audience is a big deal. You mentioned the “crash courses” that cater directly to that, but what else can people expect in the future?  We will be rolling out a mobile app in conjunction with our $DESK wallet coming next year. It’s going to have the prices feature with the ability to create a watch list and other features to help the audience engage more with our content.  How are you measuring the success of all this?  Right now, we have a great audience reach, but our audience engagement needs to grow. With our new site design, the single sign-on, and the mobile app, it’ll be much easier to understand our audience and measure their affinity with us. The more our audience comes back and engages with us, the better. That’s how we’ll see how successful we are.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2021/08/26/welcome-to-the-new-coindesk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfb4ea1a26135945fc775e033b64c5e52d2ad25a-1893x1221.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHtoJ,1630009276,"2 New Bills Ask CFTC to Clarify Crypto Regulation, Prevent Price Manipulation","Two bills introduced in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday seek to push the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to clarify the regulation of cryptocurrencies, prevent price manipulation, boost acceptance of blockchain technology and, ultimately, make U.S. cryptocurrency businesses more globally competitive.  The bills were both introduced by Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and co-sponsored by bipartisan crypto-friendly congressmen in the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  The newly proposed pieces of legislation would, if passed, provide the CFTC with greater regulatory authority over cryptocurrency. It comes as the regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC vie for control of cryptocurrency regulation and seek to define spheres of control in the cryptocurrency industry.  The Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act of 2021 calls on the CFTC, in conjunction with the heads of the SEC and other relevant federal agencies, to produce a cryptocurrency report that aims to promote “fair and transparent virtual currency markets by examining the potential for price manipulation.”  The second bill, the U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act of 2021, which was co-sponsored by Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), similarly pushes the CFTC to “promote United States competitiveness in the evolving global virtual currency marketplace,” specifically by issuing clarity on cryptocurrency regulation and, if deemed appropriate, suggesting legislative changes.

42421760,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpNvx,1630007337,Should Crypto Journalists Own Crypto?,"I still remember my first bitcoin.  Well, around half a bitcoin. It was early 2014, and I was at Bitcoin Miami reporting on, among other things, the announcement of Ethereum. We were in the midst of a raging bull market, and BTC had recently skyrocketed to over $600 – unthinkable heights! I split a hotel room and my roommate sent me $250 worth of BTC to cover his share.  To this day it’s still the most bitcoin I’ve ever owned. It would be worth around $25,000 right now, for an annualized 990% rate of return. Unfortunately, I had to sell that bitcoin almost immediately.  Woe is me.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I had to sell because I was in Miami doing some of my first reporting for Fortune Magazine. Fortune, like most traditional financial and business news outlets, prohibits its writers from owning financial assets anywhere adjacent to the beats they cover. The idea is that owning an asset will inevitably skew your coverage of it to be more positive, or lead you to write negatively about competitors. (I couldn’t buy the Ethereum pre-sale either, big RIP.)  Policies like this have recently come up for scrutiny following a fairly nuanced tweet thread from investor Lyn Alden. She’s not arguing against no-conflict policies in general: “It’s understandable that you can’t own some minor altcoin that you could conceivably move the price of with your words, as a journalist.”  But Alden does wonder if journalistic no-conflict policies shouldn’t apply to bitcoin because, “People who write about money and finance should be able to own money. Bitcoin is money, in a global sense.”  There’s some déjà vu here for us old-timers, because this is essentially the same argument that was being made quite frequently seven years ago: “Bitcoin is money. Journalists own dollars, right? Doesn’t that bias them towards fiat?”  That argument is vastly more defensible today than it was seven years ago. “Bitcoin is a $900 billion market cap asset,” as Alden writes. “An individual piece of writing, even at [The Wall Street Journal] or Bloomberg, won’t materially influence it now.”  That’s correct as far as it goes, though much the same could be said about Tesla or, as Willamette University law professor Rohan Grey points out, Purdue Pharma. Ultimately, I don’t think it’s a great argument because we’re not just talking about individual actors here, but an entire industry. Maybe one biased story by one journalist holding bitcoin wouldn’t skew the discourse, but what about all of them at once?  A much more important argument for allowing journalists to own at least a little bitcoin (as a treat) is that they need exposure to how it works at the social, technological and market levels. Someone reporting about Instagram without having used it would be irresponsible, and the same goes for crypto: If you’ve never used MetaMask, I’m a bit less interested in your theories about the future of Ethereum.  Seeing that first $250 worth of bitcoin arriving in a cobbled-together DOS-text wallet on my clunky 2012 ThinkPad has enhanced my reporting on crypto every single day since then. And during the brief periods when I’ve been out of journalism and held it, I was motivated to watch markets and learn their dynamics. (I also bought at $3,000 in 2019 but had to sell at around $10,000 when I returned to Fortune. Rekt again!)  Alden also makes a further point that I frankly find more troubling: “Not owning some of the best-performing assets, like bitcoin, can also affect [journalistic] bias.” I’m sure this is an attractive notion for investors who see journalists writing critical things about bitcoin and crypto – they’re just salty that they’re not getting rich like me!  That’s pretty worrying logic, though, and I think not actually helpful for smart investors. It implies that any critical treatment of a successful asset by a non-holder can be dismissed as “salt,” which could amount to putting on blinders to real concerns. We all know bubbles and manias and frauds exist, and if you’re not even willing to evaluate negative signals you’re not doing good risk management.  And that’s the main reason you as a reader benefit from no-conflict rules: It ensures the information you’re getting is motivated by the writer’s professional incentive to find facts, rather than their personal incentive to pump their bags.  More to the point, I think the “salt” thesis reflects a misunderstanding of what kind of people become journalists. As a group we’re certainly more cautious and risk averse than bleeding-edge tech investors – it’s pretty inherent to our training and mindset. Good journalists, at least, ask a lot of questions and think slowly and carefully.  The reward is that we get to spend our time being curious. Leaving aside institutional concerns, plenty of business journalists would be glad to be entirely detached from the industries and markets they’re covering, just so they can ensure their curiosity is unconstrained. We’ve mostly reconciled ourselves to the idea that we’re not going to make tech-investor type money, and see it as a fair trade-off.  Now, as you may know, CoinDesk doesn’t have the same kinds of rules as Fortune or Bloomberg: Journalists here can own crypto, though with strict rules about disclosure and timing. Personally, I own less than 2% of my net worth in bitcoin and ETH, and small amounts of polkadot and solana tokens. (I also own a bunch of Gods Unchained cards that I bought in 2018 for ETH that would be worth about five grand now (argh), and a herring NFT of incalculable value.)  One important thing to note about CoinDesk’s policy is that, unlike Fortune or Bloomberg, we’re not a general interest publication. As big as our long-term ambitions are (and they’re huge), we’re still effectively a trade publication for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. So nobody in their right mind would come work for CoinDesk if they didn’t already have at least some degree of faith that this industry matters and will continue to matter. And while we’re proud to offer a diversity of critical opinion, basic media literacy should tell you you’re not going to get “this entire industry is fake”-type takes here. (Try the Financial Times.)  Note, crucially, that believing something will matter is different from believing it is good. The fact that I own bitcoin doesn’t mean I think it fixes all the world’s problems. I’ve been thinking about technology long enough to know that it will have weird, complex and sometimes negative implications. But I feel secure reporting on those problems because I believe that bitcoin, like Thanos, is inevitable. The same fascination that drove me to write about it at $600 is basically why I work at CoinDesk now, and why I’m still buying.  One final personal note that might be enlightening. Back in 2014, I barely had two pennies to rub together: I had just left academia and was freelancing to make ends meet while I figured out my next move. A $100 prize from winning a poetry contest helped me make rent one month. So even if I had been able to invest, I doubt I could have pulled together more than about $2,000 to put into bitcoin at the time. That would have turned into about $200,000 by now. Not bad!  But instead, learning and writing about bitcoin wound up being my gateway to an honest-to-god career – an almost unimaginably fun and creative one, and relatively lucrative to boot. After that trip to Miami, I covered crypto for Fortune regularly, eventually becoming a full-time staffer there before landing at CoinDesk.  The upshot is that in the years since I sold that sweet, sweet $600 bitcoin, I’ve earned many times those lost investment returns by writing about finance and technology, an activity which to me barely feels like work. Looking into the future, I doubt I’ll ever have a hard time finding stimulating, fun and well-paid employment again.  If I had to miss out on a few years of 1,000% gains to get where I am now, I can’t say I’m salty about it.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,David Z.

42376213,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHts5,1630005985,How Bitcoiners Should Watch the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium,"When Jerome Powell steps up to the podium Friday at the Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium, held virtually this year but traditionally near Jackson Hole, Wyo., he’s likely to deliver a speech that has had many revisions in the past two months.  While many market participants expect the Fed chair to announce a date and pace for tapering it’s $120 billion a month of bonds purchases, the dominance of the Delta variant of Covid-19 makes such a pronouncement less certain, some economists say.  “I was expecting him to maybe announce plans for tapering but the increase in the Delta variant makes it less likely,” said David Beckworth, a former international economist at the U.S. Treasury Department.  “We know for certain there’s more caution but the economy is still growing rapidly, inflation is high,” said Beckworth, now a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “I think you can make a case for why they might still go ahead and taper.”  Some crypto analysts see tapering as an obstacle for bitcoin speculation, since quantitative easing is generally thought to give investors the liquidity to invest more in riskier assets. Because of macroeconomic uncertainty created by the course of the pandemic, bitcoiners may be able to continue to count on quantitative easing staying at the same pace or tapering at a slower pace than might have been expected a few months ago – when coronavirus-related restrictions looked to be nearing an end, as vaccines became more widely distributed.  “I would have more confidently said he was going to signal something more concrete than the committee has if this were maybe two months ago,” said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability. “I assume he’s ripped up a couple drafts in the intervening weeks given the state of the Delta virus and the fact that the conference itself has moved online due to disruptions.”  It’s possible that Powell will wade into the issue of stablecoins – digital tokens linked to government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar – and financial stability given that the issue came up in last month’s Fed meeting minutes. But given the importance of monetary policy at Jackson Hole, it’s unlikely that crypto will come up in the speech, Beckworth said.  Powell will also likely review what the central bank has learned so far with the implementation of its flexible average inflation targeting framework. The framework came at a good time because it allowed the Fed to respond to 2020′s inflation misses, but this past year has also made it more difficult to assess the success of the framework since most of the high inflation is supply-side inflation and not inflation across all prices, Beckworth added.  In last month’s Fed meeting minutes, officials at the central bank expressed an interest in delinking quantitative easing from interest rates, which could give the Fed more flexibility to maneuver without causing a “taper tantrum,” wherein market expectations for the Fed funds rate go up because investors expect interest rate hikes to follow, Kelly said.  Because most inflation has been driven by supply chain bottlenecks, the Fed won’t feel much pressure to taper in response to inflation headlines. Powell has characterized the elevated inflation rate as “transitory.”  “There’s a reason they do these purchases in the billions and trillions, is because it takes so much of it to have an impact,” Kelly said. “Even with hundreds of billions of dollars of QE we’re talking about, maybe a 100 basis points impact – if you’re lucky – on the 10-year yield.”  General inflation is subdued, said Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson. “The 10-year real yield is negative 1%,” he said. That’s the nominal yield on the U.S. government bond, minus the inflation rate.  “What that tells us is that people are willing to lend money to the US government at negative real interest rates, so there’s no real evidence of the economy overheating by that metric,” Brynjolfsson said.  With the $1 trillion infrastructure bill making its way through Congress, the pressure on the Fed to maintain economic growth may be eased, Brynjolfsson added.  “When the government spends money, it makes a huge difference as to whether that’s spent on investment like infrastructure, or whether it’s spent on current consumption, like payments to individuals,” Brynjolfsson said. “If it’s spent on investment, then that means that productivity is going to grow, capacity is going to grow, and inflation is going to go down. If it’s spent on consumption, then you don’t have more supply, and you don’t have more output.”  At the moment, it’s unknown when lower unemployment will lead to more general inflation and the Fed, policymakers, and Congress will want to test how far they can push the economy, Brynjolfsson said.  “For most of the past decade, the Fed has missed by having an unemployment higher than what their target was, and also having inflation lower than what their target was,” he said. “Both of those point in the same direction that the Fed has been too tight.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/26/how-bitcoiners-should-watch-the-feds-jackson-hole-symposium,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5709790d39b4c48760517e801df82c1d5871d3c-1992x1288.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new bureau will officially launch in September and fall under the authority of the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU), an arm of the FSC that handles anti-money laundering enforcement.  According to a report from the Korea Times, the new bureau will be called the Crypto Asset Monitoring Bureau and will be responsible for overseeing licenses for exchanges and other operators.  Licensing is a key role given that FSC officials said in April that exchanges that do not register with and receive a license from KFIU by late September will not be permitted to operate in Korea. The FSC’s licenses require exchanges to tighten their know-your-customer (KYC) standards and collect personal information about customers.  The bureau will also be responsible for monitoring for suspicious activity including fraud and money laundering, according to the Korea Times.  South Korea’s ongoing crypto crackdown is tied to the growing level of debt among young people, which the government’s top regulator – FSC Chief Koh Seung-beom – has blamed, at least in part, on digital asset speculation.

42421761,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpNuv,1629999790,OnlyFans Shows How the Banking System Is Politicized,"Recently, the noted content subscription service, OnlyFans, announced a move away from sexual content. Specifically, the platform announced a ban on explicit and sexual content (while still permitting some more innocuous nude content). The move raised eyebrows; OnlyFans banning sexual content is like a lion announcing its intent to become a vegan or soccer star Lionel Messi banning his left foot. Sexual content is quite simply OF’s raison d’être.  According to the platform’s founder Tim Stokely, blame lies with major banks such as Bank of New York Mellon. “The change in policy, we had no choice,” Stokely revealed to the Financial Times. “The short answer is banks.”  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  The platform later reversed itself, stating that it had “secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community,” suspending the planned policy change. But the complete pivot, though subsequently walked back, was startling. How could payment processors or banks cause a platform largely used for sexually explicit purposes to renounce its entire business model, even if temporarily?  Anyone who is vaguely familiar with payment processing will not be remotely shocked by the episode. Sex-related internet platforms have been targeted for financial exclusion for the better part of a decade. While the government cannot, under the First Amendment, ban perfectly legal industries like adult entertainment, it can encourage banks (and by extension, payment processors) not to support those industries. That banks are effectively extensions of the state. They have sole access to Federal Reserve master accounts, are highly regulated and own extremely scarce bank charters. That all means that the government can make policy through banks without passing laws.  Far from the narrative being spun by liberals about the OnlyFans episode being further evidence of a radical, Puritan agenda being imposed by wannabe Christian theocrats, the identification of pornography as a “high-risk” industry began with a shadowy Obama-era program known as Operation Choke Point.  The approach was simple: The Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), realized around 2012 it could exert pressure on politically disfavored industries under the guise of eliminating fraud. The approach involved threatening banks with expensive and reputation-damaging investigations and subpoenas if they failed to coerce payment processors providing services to these industries into cutting them off.  Through Choke Point, the DoJ and FDIC deputized banks and turned them into an enforcement arm of the government. That approach was and remains legally questionable. Critics questioned the DoJ’s standing to pressure banks to redline whole industries without establishing actual legal malfeasance.  By vaguely threatening banks (and by extension, payment processors relying on those banks), the DoJ did not need to rely on legislation to ban entire industries de facto. They could simply choke off their financial lifeblood and compromise their ability to operate. Much like the government’s extra-legal – but still apparently persuasive – entreaties to Big Tech oligopolies to deplatform disfavored content (the private sector isn’t bound by the First Amendment, after all), Choke Point relied on threats of financial enforcement and expensive subpoenas to obtain compliance. When the Constitution constrains the state, the government is apt to find end-arounds by mobilizing the private sector. Banks, of course, are not “just private companies,” as the pro-censorship refrain goes today. They are agents of the state, but just distant enough that persuading them to “derisk” disfavored industries wasn’t blatantly unconstitutional.  Read more: Go West, Bitcoin! Unpacking the Great Hashrate Migration | Nic Carter  Ostensibly focused on stopping legal but distasteful businesses like payday lending, Choke Point quickly ballooned out of control. By 2014, the FDIC’s website listed 30 merchant categories associated with “high-risk” activity, many of them perfectly legal (at least in many states). Those included ammunition and firearms sales, coin dealers, fireworks sales, “as seen on TV” sales, tobacco sales, travel clubs, credit repair services and pornography. Regarding the latter, Choke Point historian Iain Murray has speculated that porn was included not because of any puritanical sentiments at the Obama DoJ, but because its high chargeback rate caused it to be associated with other “high-risk” industries.  Choke Point found inspiration in the online poker ban from 2011 through the Southern District of New York’s action against three major poker companies, which many Bitcoiners will remember clearly. The poker companies were primarily indicted for circumventing a 2006 law, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which effectively made processing gambling-related payments illegal. As a result, Full Tilt and PokerStars began concealing the nature of payments in order to retain financial access to their customers. It was this deception that ultimately led to criminal charges. If that sounds reminiscent of the plight of certain stablecoins – whose problems stem from finding end-arounds bank exclusion – it’s no coincidence. Walling off an industry from financial services and scrutinizing its attempts to reconnect with customers is an effective means of criminalizing a politically unpopular industry.  Choke Point 1.0 eventually came to an official end when a number of policymakers realized what the DoJ was doing and raised concerns. Missouri Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, a Republican, led the charge to shame the DoJ into ending the practice in 2017, but the damage was done. Choke Point did not disappear; rather, it was simply internalized by banks and payment processors. The message to payment processors, while implicit, remains clear: Support politically exposed businesses and face a loss of banking.  One must merely observe today how wary financial services companies are of servicing politically exposed individuals or firms. Examples abound. In 2018, Bank of America and Citigroup abruptly deplatformed firearms manufacturers. Twelve Democratic Senators promptly followed that move by demanding that 11 other major banks follow suit. Not satisfied with merely deplatforming firearms companies, Bank of America has begun voluntarily informing the federal government about its customers’ gun-related activity – all without getting subpoenas.  Firebrand progressive Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) has indicated her willingness to employ her seat on the House Financial Services Committee to prosecute social issues, including private prisons. In response to a pressure campaign, numerous banks withdrew their support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. And this tone extends to the very top. While the Brian Brooks-led Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under then-President Donald Trump passed a “fair access” rule designed to prohibit Choke Point-style selective platforming by banks, the Biden OCC promptly rolled back the rule.  This belief that financial services should be weaponized for policy outcomes explains enthusiasm for central bank digital currencies among progressives, who worryingly extol the virtues of a Chinese social credit scheme with American characteristics. Choke Point was just an appetizer: This dismal future portends a world where it’s not just Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes who are kicked off the financial internet, but any conservative expressing subversive thoughts online. Naturally, the would-be architects of these schemes do not devote much thought to the risk of a wholly politicized payment system falling into the hands of their political opponents.  Read more: Why Central Bankers Invoke Free Banking to Attack Stablecoins | Nic Carter  Trump was not particularly interested in deputizing financial infrastructure for political adventurism, but his successor Biden certainly is. Liberals decrying the OnlyFans ban should consider it a mere taste of what a wholly politicized financial sector might look like. Had Trump been more competent, he might have sought to use such underhanded tactics to deplatform abortion clinics, progressive nonprofits, educational institutions peddling critical race theory, teachers’ unions and other causes he politically objected to. It just so happens that the instruments of state power in this context have largely been wielded against conservatives so far, but that may not last forever.  If there’s a silver lining in the OnlyFans episode, it’s the reminder that it can happen to you, too. The OnlyFans deplatforming is an exception in that, for once, it was a liberal cause that was threatened with bank exclusion. The current anti-sex worker agenda – despite a solidly blue administration – is simply a reminder that censorship, once normalized, always strays from its initial confines. If Choke Point continues its unacknowledged revival under Biden, the progressives who by and large support selective financial exclusion (just witness the jubilation when rightist platforms like Gab and Parler have their payment relationships stripped) should consider what a similar program might look like under a President Cotton, DeSantis or Hawley.  The bottom line is that platforms like OnlyFans shouldn’t be marginalized via an opaque process involving extra-legal guidance emanating from unaccountable bureaucrats and regulators. We are still nominally a nation of laws and constitutional constraints. Instead of petitioning the state to ban one’s ideological enemies from financial infrastructure, and being taken by surprise when the political pendulum swings back, we ought to embrace neutral, apolitical financial infrastructure. OnlyFans is a potent reminder: You simply never know when you’ll be on the receiving end of the stick.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/26/onlyfans-shows-how-the-banking-system-is-politicized,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fa02f7a2c477f8cbb1ccacd80fec489069d000d-1400x1052.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHtyN,1629995182,A16z Details Its New Approach to Crypto Governance,"Following a pair of controversial votes in the governance forums of the Uniswap exchange, venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) said in a blog post Thursday it will “open source” its decentralized finance (DeFi) delegation procedures.  Titled “Open Sourcing our Token Delegate Program,” the post lays out how a16z selects the individuals and entities it chooses to delegate its considerable voting heft to.  Given the size of the DeFi ecosystem – now rivaling mid-sized American banks at $146 billion in total value locked (TVL) – and the considerable governance token reserves controlled by a16z, this effort towards transparency sheds light on policies that have the power to shape an emerging financial vertical.  The a16z post shares a draft of the 1,500-word legal agreement intended to ensure delegate independence, shows a full breakdown of current a16z delegates and their voting power and explains a16z’s conceptual approach to delegation.  DAO voting and delegation will be managed by a new, four-person team led by a16z partner Jeff Amico, he said in an interview with CoinDesk. Former 0x engineer Alex Kroeger announced last week he’d also be joining the team:  Some personal news--I’m excited to say I’m starting at @a16z this week on the crypto team!  — alexkroeger.eth (@alex_kroeger) August 15, 2021  The a16z Protocol team will be perhaps the first-ever third-party professional protocol politicians with a purview that will comfortably rank a16z among the most powerful voices in DAO governance.  The Protocol team will select the entities that will receive “well over half” of a16z’s voting powers, and also choose how to vote with the remaining percentage – ultimately commanding a pot of tokens that can single-handedly sway governance proposals.  DAO Democracy  The effort to “open source” delegate procedures comes after a pair of controversial votes in Uniswap’s DAO governance system.  In June, a proposal passed to fund a $20 million DeFi Education Fund designed to engage in political activism. The proposal, which was written by a16z delegate Harvard Law Blockchain and Fintech Initiative and which a16z voted in favor of, was broadly criticized for lacking transparency and oversight mechanisms.  Last week, a16z also voted against a proposal to allocate $25 million in UNI toward yield farming, the proceeds of which would have been used to fund analytics firm Flipside Crypto. In a Twitter thread explaining the rationale behind the vote, Amico wrote that a lack of transparency and oversight was a motivating factor:  Even by the standards of sometimes-rancorous DeFi governance forums, the Flipside vote was contentious and messy – including bugs that flipped intended “No” votes to “Yes” and multiple parties with relationships to a16z publicly disagreeing on Twitter.  The final vote on the proposal was 47,624,544 in favor to 46,988,497 (meaning UNI owners accounting for 18% of the circulating token supply participated in the vote, an unusually high percentage), though it was cancelled because Index Coop, which delegated its UNI to Flipside in order to make the proposal, fell below a necessary UNI ownership threshold to keep the proposal live.  A16z and its delegates accounted for a significant portion of the voting power. The venture capital firm cast a “No” vote with just over 15 million UNI ($375 million), while a16z delegates Dharma, Argent, the Stanford blockchain club, the Columbia University blockchain club and Compound contributor Getty Hill pitched in another 22,728,754 million UNI – almost 40% of the UNI represented in the vote in aggregate.  If the analysis were to include parties with a financial relationship with a16z, such as Robert Leshner, who founded the a16z-funded Compound, the percentage climbs higher.  CoinDesk could not verify if a16z’s delegates were voting only with their delegated tokens or with their personal stake as well, and likewise CoinDesk could not verify if the nearly 38 million tokens on display represent a16z’s full UNI ownership stake or if its net holdings are larger.  Sybil.org, a dapp designed to make delegating DeFi governance votes easier, shows that a16z’s 15 million voting stake is itself delegated from 10 different wallets.  A16z has never publicly disclosed the quantities of governance tokens they hold in major DeFi protocols such as Maker, Compound and Uniswap. The VC firm also has investments in multiple companies expected to launch governance tokens, including OpenSea and Nansen.  Transparency  Amico told CoinDesk that the “open sourcing” of the delegate program is a bid to lift the veil on how a16z approaches protocol governance.  “If we’ve had a fault to date, it’s been a lack of transparency,” he said.  The goal moving forward is to “build in public.” One key takeaway from the Flipside vote, Amico added, was that there is significant appetite for more public governance debate. As such, he told CoinDesk that the Protocol team will be communicating its thoughts on governance developments more frequently in the future.  Additionally, a16z said the team would be open to providing smart-contract-based guarantees of delegate independence (rather than possibly flimsy legal ones) as the technology becomes available, and that the team would be open to delegating voting power to an organization that is itself decentralized, such as a DAO.  In a somewhat symbolic gesture given that there’s little to no associated code, the team has also posted the details of its delegate selection process on the software development platform and open-source hotspot GitHub, and is inviting public comments, contributions and conversation.  Ultimately, a16z’s Amico said a long-term aim is to inspire other large token holders, such as VCs, to rethink their approach to governance:  “Our hope is that presenting a systematic, thoughtful way to do this will lead to others trying it too.”",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | UNI | ZRX,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/26/a16z-details-its-new-approach-to-crypto-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d948b902c6d973d5b5dc82528971b62d6bee1d7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424619,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2w4Jh,1629989181,Bitcoin Eyes 200-Day Moving Average Support as $2B Options Expiration Nears,"Bitcoin is again experiencing moderate price turbulence heading into the monthly options expiration.  The cryptocurrency is trading at about $47,000 at press time, representing a 4.4% drop on the day, CoinDesk 20 data show. The decline has reversed Wednesday’s 2.7% gain and exposed bitcoin to the widely tracked 200-day moving average (MA) line located at $46,040  “What we are seeing is typical pre-expiry price volatility,” said Philippe Bekhazi, CEO at XBTO Group. “[The] market generally rebounds after monthly settlement.”  A total of 42,500 option contracts worth roughly $2 billion are set to expire on Friday, according to data provided by Skew. The dominant crypto options exchange Deribit will settle the majority of open interest at 8:00 UTC.  Data since January show bitcoin tends to move toward the “max pain” point in the lead-up to an expiration and sees a solid directional move in days after settlement. In traditional market theory, that behavior results from option sellers, mostly institutions, manipulating the spot market to push prices closer to the strike price at which the highest number of open options contracts expire worthlessly, yielding maximum losses – or maximum pain – for option buyers and minimizing losses for the sellers.  History seems to be repeating itself, as the max pain point for Friday’s monthly expiration is $44,000, according to Deribit. The options market has also flipped bearish for the short term, with the one-week put-call skew reporting positive values at press time. That’s a sign of short-term puts, or bearish bets, drawing higher demand than calls. The one-month skew is neutral, while the three- and six-month skews are still trading negative, indicating a long-term bullish bias.  A continued inflow of BTC onto crypto exchanges could also bring some price volatility. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant data show the Huobi exchange received 23,256 BTC at 06:08 UTC today.  “It’s an actual deposit from a user,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki-Young Ju told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. Users typically transfer bitcoin to exchanges when they plan to liquidate holdings or sell coins to fund derivatives and alternative cryptocurrency trading, leading to increased price turbulence.  “Bitcoin reserve across all exchanges is increasing lately, and this could affect the market in the short term,” Ju said. “These bitcoins could be sold, used as collateral for derivative trading, or used for altcoin trading. Either way, it increases the market volatility.”  From a technical analysis standpoint, the immediate bias has flipped bearish owing to the cryptocurrency’s failure to keep gains above $50,000 earlier this week.  “Both bitcoin and ether confirmed short-term counter-trend ‘sell’ signals per the DeMark indicators, which have been fairly timely in the past as indicators of short-term inflections,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in an email. “The message is for another 1-2 weeks of sideways-to-lower price action.”  Stockton added that while the intermediate-term momentum remains positive, some risk management may be necessary for the very near term, given the 50-day MA at $39,652 is the initial support. Meanwhile, XBTO’s Bekhazi mentioned $46,800 as key support.

Called Royal, the music tokenization platform slices up song royalty rights into crypto tokens that anyone can buy and trade.  The platform, which could ultimately see music fans claim a sliver of song royalties and, maybe, upend the traditional record deal, has generated enough buzz to raise $16 million in funding, a relatively massive haul for a crypto seed round.  Paradigm and Founders Fund each invested $7 million and scored board seats for their respective general partners, Fred Ehrsam and Keith Rabois, Blau told CoinDesk. Co-founder JD Ross pitched in $1 million through his venture capital fund, Atomic, and a handful of angel investors contributed the final $1 million, Blau said.  With tech based in part on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Royal is likely well-positioned to ride the current NFT boom. Blau previously raised $11.7 million in an NFT album sale back in February.  If that project turned a profit by wrapping music in crypto, then Royal does the opposite, Blau said: It distributes music’s real-world profit through crypto.  “We’re calling them limited digital assets,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  “There’s an NFT component to them but then a bunch of other smart contract infrastructure that basically enables the distributed collection of royalties from the off-chain world to the on-chain world.”  In doing so, Royal hopes to give artists a way to monetize the music hype cycle – and fans a way to get in on the action.  How it works  Limited digital assets, or LDAs, are the backbone of the system, Blau explained in a call.  An artist decides how much of his or her royalty share to reserve for LDA-holding fans and how many “official editions” to mint for a given song. Royal then facilitates the sale of those LDA tokens, generating cash for the artist and the possibility of future income from the song owners.  A song with 100 “official editions” might entitle each holder to 0.5% of the royalties it generates, Blau said. It’s up to the artist to decide which income rails to tap.  “Income may be exclusive to streams, all dependent on the on-chain agreement,” Blau told CoinDesk in a text. “We want to give artists the flex of deciding on a case-by-case business.”  I’m a business, man  The fans who buy LDA tokens can later sell them to others on Royal. Blau said it gives them an opportunity to participate in the wheeling and dealing of the music business.  “So many people are investing in music today as an inflation-protected asset,” he said, listing private equity firms and hedge funds. “It’s just not accessible to the public.”  Royal’s proposed answer to the accessibility question adds some spice to an active market for song royalty rights. Competitor site Royalty Exchange claims to have raised $90 million for music-rights holders. Another service, SongVesthttps://www.songvest.com/faq, auctions fractionalized shares of future music royalty revenue to the public as securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Royal has “no plans of issuing securities” in the short term, said Blau. He said Royal worked with former regulators to ensure its flagship LDAs will follow geographic rules. Artists can’t use Royal to fundraise for unreleased songs, he said; letting them do so could “change the categorization of the asset.”  “Owning master recording rights and music today is not treated as a security,” he said. “Putting that on the blockchain, people will have opinions about it–but people can buy, trade and sell royalty rights today as non-securities in the real world.”  Not a businessman  That Royal could give musicians a way to cash in on their songs–and possibly buy back their royalty rights later–is an intriguing play, said Ben Kessler, an indie pop artist with 10 million streams.  “Any alternative way to raise money that works outside of the major label system is definitely positive for the industry as a whole,” he said.  Kessler still wants to read “the fine print” for a Royal LDA; he also wants to know how open the platform intends to be for lesser-known acts such as his. But he’s bullish on the fan-ownership aspect nonetheless.  “Platforms that allow artists like myself to connect directly with fans and create community” is the “future” of the industry, Kessler said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/26/3lau-raises-16m-to-tokenize-music-royalties-for-artists-and-fans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e863b212f3ce90d45924e3d95f49a0679763771b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Microsoft’s patent describes a ledger-independent system for helping users to create tokens, and for managing them across different networks.  On receiving a request from a user, the system offers templates with various attributes and control functions. Those would depend on the type of token required, representing, for example, a digital or physical asset. Once the user has selected the desired template, the system creates the token on the designated networks.  The system also provides a common interface for managing the tokens, so developers don’t have to worry about token-specific code to interact with them.

42421765,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpNy1,1629963000,Your Clients May Already Own Crypto. Here’s How to Hold It,"Takeaways  Products and services to help advisors handle crypto on behalf of clients are only just emerging.  Even so, most serious cryptocurrency investors want to hold tokens directly.  Advisors should understand how hot wallets and cold storage work for their crypto investor clients.  How do we advise clients on an asset we can’t (yet) handle directly?  Clients are already asking about investing in cryptocurrencies, but within the next tax year, they’ll almost certainly be asking about what to do with the digital tokens they already have.  That’s because billions of dollars in new wealth have been created since bitcoin roared into the marketplace. And to handle this influx, our industry will have to speak the language of cryptocurrency – specifically, how crypto enthusiasts hold and store their digital wealth.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here.  Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets were born in a move toward self-sovereignty during a time of very low trust in the financial industry. As a result, many digital asset owners are accustomed to holding tokens themselves, and will be slow to trust products and services that introduce intermediaries, whether advisors or third-party corporations, into the crypto market.  Apps like CashApp and Robinhood have introduced alternatives allowing individuals to buy and own cryptocurrencies on their platforms, sparking a backlash among digital asset owners for whom handing control of cryptocurrencies to a third party runs counter to the do-it-yourself ethos of the asset class: If you don’t own the keys, you don’t own the crypto.  A decentralized status quo  To date, there are very few options for advisors who want to serve as a crypto custodian and handle digital asset investments for their clients. The status quo has been for most digital assets to be held away from advisors.  “There really isn’t a platform yet that has designed a solution where an advisor can open an account and have power-of-attorney over it and manage it to the portfolio construction they would like to have,” said David Olsson, global head of institutional distribution at crypto financial services firm BlockFi. “While we’re working on that capability, currently it isn’t easy for advisors. Part of the reason is that cryptocurrencies are analogous to bearer bonds: The person who has it, has it. That’s why concepts like cold storage [keeping a device offline] are so important to custody and security.”  And the crypto sector may stay that way for some time: One of the primary trends fueling the popularity of bitcoin and altcoins has been the idea of decentralized finance – transactions, investments and other money management tasks handled without the need of an intermediary like a broker or an agent.  “This is something we’ve never really seen before – a new asset class that didn’t originate with custodians or traditional financial institutions,” said Dani Fava, head of strategic development at financial software provider Envestnet. “It’s so decentralized, it’s going to take a while for the same ease of access and use we’ve seen from consumer apps and crypto exchanges to come to advisors.”  In lieu of keeping their coins within accounts on exchanges or fintech apps, long-time investors often move the keys to their tokens off these platforms and into a personal cryptocurrency wallet.  What is a digital wallet?  A wallet consists of a public key, the digital location of the wallet, similar to a bank account’s number, which can be used to allow others to send or take money from an account. A private key is more like the online password to an account or the personal identification number to a debit card offering access to the account. Public and private keys define an individual’s ownership stake in crypto.  Simply put, a wallet is a place to store digital currency. Wallets come in two flavors: A hot wallet is based on software that is connected to the internet, while cold storage refers to a hardware device that is kept completely offline.  Hot wallets resemble bank accounts – they can be accessed via websites, mobile apps and software on a computer desktop. A hot wallet is typically used when people want to transact with cryptocurrency, either to make sales or purchases, or to trade frequently. Most hot wallets are able to store many different cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.  Many crypto enthusiasts balk at hot wallets associated with exchanges and mobile apps. While these wallets are secure, they offer investors less control over their digital assets, because an exchange or mobile app could experience outages, go out of business, or unilaterally choose to freeze an account.  Cold storage wallets often resemble a USB drive, but they can be as simple as a paper document containing information about public and private keys. These offline wallets are often seen as very secure, because they are difficult for outsiders to access and hack. Cold storage is typically used by those who want to hold a token like bitcoin for its utility as a long-term store of value.  If you’re using a hot wallet, make sure to update any software associated with the wallet frequently, use two-factor authentication to minimize the risk of hacking and follow best practices when it comes to creating and updating passwords and protecting private keys. Most hot wallets are able to store many different cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Novel altcoins like ERC20 coins, monero or dogecoin may not be able to be held in certain devices or in cold storage at all, because they may require their own dedicated hot wallet.  Which way of holding crypto is best?  In some ways, the choice of which method to hold cryptocurrencies is related to an investor’s risk tolerance and philosophical stance toward financial institutions. Risk-averse, low-trust clients and those with a deep knowledge of digital assets may be the best candidates for the cold storage concept, while clients with a high-risk tolerance or who are merely experimenting with cryptocurrency investing may be better suited for keeping more of their assets in a hot wallet.  “It’s tough, because moving forward, some clients might ask their advisors to buy and handle crypto assets for them, but the majority will come to an advisor with their Gemini and Coinbase accounts and their cold storage devices and say, ‘I have some crypto here, here and here, can you pull it into your system? Can you tell me if I own too much, or if I need to rebalance?’” said Tyrone Ross, CEO of crypto-asset integration platform company Onramp Invest.  “But advisors aren’t going to be able to bill on those assets directly. They’re still going to want financial planning and crypto management, but many will insist, ‘My crypto is mine. I’ll deal with it, I just want you to see it.’”",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/26/crypto-for-advisors-your-clients-may-already-own-crypto-heres-how-to-hold-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14097e2f3e23b1b0d0293cfc3e02a6a97b9bab48-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421767,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpO3B,1629963000,Why Are Digital Assets Different?,"Digital assets, cryptocurrency, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – they have all been the subject of intense media hype. No doubt you’ve heard of at least a few people who have become wealthy through their investment in digital assets, as well as a few who have lost all or part of their investment. What started with bitcoin has ballooned into a huge array of digital assets, which come with their own technologies, lexicon, risks and loyal followings.  Now, you likely have clients who are asking about the possibility of investing in digital assets, and even more clients who have already done so.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk's new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here.  In the journey to decide if you should even learn about digital assets, and then how to make the asset class part of your practice, one of the first questions you might ask is, “What is so different about digital assets?”  First, you’ll want to know the answer so you can determine the amount of time and money to invest in learning about this asset class. Second, the answer will be the basis for your conversations with your clients around digital assets. Third, you will need to determine how best to bring digital assets into your practice.  Code as value  When we are speaking purely of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, we have to try to determine some idea of value. However, in the case of bitcoin, there is no underlying physical or even corporate asset. Bitcoin is also not backed or issued by a country or corporation. It does not need a bank or network of banks to send it anywhere in the world.  Because of this, our traditional ideas of valuation have to be rethought. In essence, bitcoin has value because we say it does. The level of that value is based more on a trust that there will only be a certain number of bitcoins ever created, and there will be an increasing demand for those limited bitcoins.  We are used to having stocks that represent ownership in companies, bonds that represent cash flow or commodities that are physical assets.  Valuing an asset that was digitally created, stored and moved is very new and will take some time to better understand.  Crypto custody  We have grown so accustomed to our convenient custodial systems. We no longer self-custody most assets because it is not efficient. As advisors, we know we can use custodians to hold client assets, and we can advise and direct the investment in those assets.  Digital assets, however, work better and were designed for self-custody. We even have a catch phrase – “Not your keys, not your crypto.”  Cryptocurrency was specifically developed to not have to rely on banks or other traditional custodians.  A new class of custodians – crypto or digital asset custodians – have been created and often offer on-ramps and exchange services as well. Some of these are even receiving bank charters, while traditional custodians are adding digital assets custodial services.  Custody is a matter of technology, more than just outsourced recordkeeping. As the advisor, you will need to understand, and help clients navigate the issues of custody of their digital assets, based on risk, allocation and goals.  International and nonstop  Partially due to their non-custodial nature, digital assets are traded 24/7/365 all over the world, leading to several issues we haven’t had to address in the past.  Prices can fluctuate wildly while we sleep, as Asia and Europe trade and as their news cycles drive values. We might come in on Monday to find the prices vastly different than when we left on Friday.  Further, assets that are traded and used internationally are subject to macro- and micro-economic factors all over the globe. There are no “international funds” for crypto. They’re all international.  This reality also makes digital assets the most liquid assets we’ve seen. While we might think we like more liquidity in an asset class, as advisors you need to determine where you draw the line with clients. Are their accounts, and you as their advisor, available to trade 24/7/365? Are we sticking to traditional hours?  Moving forward  You’re going to have to evaluate digital assets as a part of your clients’ portfolios. Understanding the differences between this asset class and traditional investments will help as you assess the risk for your clients, the associated allocation and the conversations you’ll end up having as you make digital assets part of your practice.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/26/crypto-for-advisors-why-are-digital-assets-different,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6ce5a26b10123086d1f499cdfe3cefa8349eb06-640x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7aL,1629951666,India's Securities Watchdog to Launch System for Monitoring Financial Instruments,"India's securities watchdog plans to lean heavily on distributed ledger technology for the monitoring and recording of financial instruments, beginning next year.      The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) announced Wednesday its intentions to roll out a system for ""security and covenant monitoring"" for non-convertible debentures (NCDs) by April 1, 2022.      It marks a significant step for the use case of blockchain within India's financial ecosystem and follows other major institutions in leveraging the technology for increased systems efficiency.      NCDs are financial instruments that recognize a debt obligation toward the issuer. Typically a debenture is a long-term instrument with a feature that allows it to be cashed in for shares at a later date at the discretion of the owner. Debentures that cannot be converted into shares are considered ""non-convertible"" products.      The system will also keep tabs on covenants – terms inserted into a debt agreement – and will monitor the credit ratings of the NCDs. The system will provide necessary permission to trustees, issuers, and credit rating agencies to update transaction data. In turn, the data will be accessible to stock exchanges and depositories to provide for a more transparent process.      Data stored will be cryptographically signed, time-stamped, and sequentially added to the ledger, leaving behind a verifiable audit trail of transactions. Transaction history and data on the ledger will be ""fully"" encrypted and will be shared only with necessary stakeholders on a ""need-to-know basis,"" SEBI said in its statement.      ""DLT has the potential to provide a more resilient system than traditional centralized databases and offer better protection against different types of cyber-attacks because of its distributed nature, which removes the single point of attack,"" the watchdog said.

Digital land art, however, is much newer. In 2013, a digital artist combined light perception with real landscapes to create a kind of &apos;digital land art.&apos; Soon after, other artists joined in those techniques. These various art forms were united by their focus on creating new ways to explore traditional concepts of landscape through sculpture, performance art, installation art, photography, video art, and more. However, as with any other digitized art at the time, it would be impossible to verify ownership in a trustless manner. That all changed with the advent of the blockchain, enabling trustless, decentralized ownership of any digital asset, including digital art.

42376302,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7bb,1629939674,Can Avalanche Keep It Up? DeFi Users Rush In as Incentives Roll Out,"In an explosive move reminiscent of the growth of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon earlier this year, the Avalanche blockchain is attracting a flood of new deposits into its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.      Despite the signs of strength, however, not all analysts are convinced the Ethereum competitor has staying power.      At the end of July, Avalanche’s DeFi ecosystem accounted for just $180 million in total value locked (TVL) – a figure that has since ballooned 1,000% to over $1.8 billion at the time of writing. Likewise, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, has rallied from $13.41 to a high of $55.42 earlier this week.      Money market Benqi is leading the way, cracking the $1 billion TVL threshold Tuesday – less than a week after its Aug. 19 launch. By comparison, Aave, among the first DeFi lending protocols when it launched in 2019, took more than eight months to reach the same mark on Ethereum.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Ava Labs Director of DeFi Luigi Demeo said that a number of factors, including a revamped token bridge and a $180 million incentive program, are chief catalysts for the surge.    Read more: DeFi Exchange SushiSwap Builds on Avalanche as Part of $180M Incentive Program    “We’ve kind of seen all these things culminate at once, between the bridge, lending, a massive incentive program and a lot of things the team has been working on very deeply, heads down, for six months,” he said.      However, Mewny, a self-described “Internet Couch” and a pseudonymous member of the angel investing collective eGirl Capital, cautioned that the burgeoning ecosystem could be due for an eventual pullback.      “It could go one of two ways,” Mewny told CoinDesk, speaking to the roving horde of DeFi investors. “The [liquidity mining] incentives kickstart a flywheel effect around their ecosystem, or enthusiasm dries up and the hot ball of money moves to the next pot of honey.”    Incentives and catalysts    The timing of Avalanche’s emergence is something of a surprise, given that the layer 1 went live on mainnet in September 2020 and had a functioning (if clunky) bridge as early as February this year.      “The UX wasn’t great,” Ava Labs’ Demeo said. “It was slower, more extensive… it was a temporary solution, frankly.”      Additionally, Demeo said that the ecosystem was missing “key infrastructure pieces,” including oracles, a faster bridge, a lending platform and stablecoin support.    Read more: Avalanche to Include Data From Chainlink    Chainlink oracles went live July 21, providing the pricing data infrastructure that allowed Benqi’s lending platform to launch. Money market Aave will soon be joining with $20 million in liquidity mining incentives; Curve, a protocol allowing for efficient stablecoin swaps, is also signing on with $7 million in AVAX liquidity mining rewards.      Demeo added that the new bridge provides free AVAX (for deposits above a certain amount) to pay for subsequent transactions.      While Demeo refers to Ethereum-native dapps such as Curve, Sushi and Aave deploying implementations on Avalanche as a “validation of the technology,” eGirl’s Mewny says other layer 1s paved the way for Avalanche’s success.      “I think BSC and Polygon set the stage for this current AVAX run. The relationship between the [liquidity mining] incentives that dropped and the rapid TVL that bridged is obviously no coincidence,” they said, adding:    “While I think the tech is interesting and this isn’t a negative comment on its technical merits, many people saw the green light to capture the gains that were seen with the aforementioned platforms. As money trickles in to play the casino yield farms and/or long the same basic DeFi primitives but on a new platform, the same playbook is possible (yet again).”  Future developments    Demeo argues that Avalanche has built-in technical advantages that will allow it to compete in the long term, including a unique consensus mechanism and architecture.      “A key fundamental decision was to allow for multiple subchains, which should let AVAX easily integrate any virtual machine or smart-contracting language,” he said. “This should be a competitive advantage for long-term sustainability [allowing] AVAX to pivot easily to capture different devs.”      Additionally, Demeo said the $180 million Avalanche Rush program is currently tailored to users. Over time, the money could be used to incentivize developers to build more platforms on Avalanche. He said a user base is a necessary first step.",NEUTRAL,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/26/can-avalanche-keep-it-up-defi-users-rush-in-as-incentives-roll-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f60c2c3f41d6f385c938d17b8a52af6faf0905a-1500x1007.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
