KODAKCoin  ‚Äì which is being developed by a firm called WENN Digital using the brand of the onetime photography giant, and is set to form part of a new digital rights management platform ‚Äì is being sold by way of a Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), according to the paper.  It includes a long disclosure acknowledging that while WENN Digital is pitching the KODAKCoin as a so-called ""utility token"" ‚Äì which would, at least in theory, keep it from being deemed a security by SEC standards ‚Äì the U.S. regulator may make a different determination.  The firm wrote:  ""While WENN Digital intends for the KODAKCoin issuable under the SAFTs to be classified as utility tokens rather than securities tokens, WENN Digital will be required to make a final determination of the tokens' status as one or the other prior to the time that the KODAKCoin are issued pursuant to the SAFTs. In conjunction therewith, WENN Digital may decide to seek formal or informal input from the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. If it is ultimately determined that the KODAKCoin are 'securities' for purposes of the Securities Act, the KODAKCoin will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer in the absence of registration under the Securities Act unless an exemption from registration is available.""  The disclosure is a notable one, given that the SEC is said to be probing SAFTs as part of a wider investigation into ICOs.  As it stands, the exact timeline of the sale remains unclear, given recent delays, and the white paper doesn't include any updates on that front.  On the project's official website, a message dated February 5 states that ""the ICO is moving full-speed ahead.""

These markets have been growing rapidly, attracting significant attention from investors and start-up enterprises in search of capital. The hearing will examine the economic efficiencies and potential capital formation opportunities that cryptocurrencies and ICOs potentially offer to businesses and investors, and review the adherence to applicable laws so that investors receive the full protections afforded by the federal securities laws. Additionally, the hearing will consider the current regulatory approach that regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, are using to monitor and oversee cryptocurrencies and ICOs and how to achieve further regulatory clarity in these markets.""

Officials from the Australian Federal Police are said to have visited the bureau's headquarters in Melbourne on February 28, conducting interviews with the two employees.  The report investigation represents what could be the latest instance in which public sector employees mine cryptocurrencies ‚Äì an energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new coins as a reward ‚Äì at work. Past examples include a Federal Reserve Board staffer, an employee of New York's Department of Education and, most recently, employees of Louisiana's attorney general.

David Schweikert (R.-AZ) during his keynote address on day two of the D.C. Blockchain Summit, where he outlined some of the challenges he sees in mainstream blockchain adoption.  One of his chief concerns surrounded regulation, the Congressional Blockchain Caucus co-chair told the audience. While wider adoption of blockchain technology will require some guardrails, too many requirements could inhibit innovation.  During his speech, he warned:  ‚ÄúThe regulators are all going to want to step in and say ‚ÄòI want to be the arbitrator so I can reverse a transaction.‚Äô That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm most worried about the regulatory world, because they‚Äôre going to want to slow this down and say ‚ÄòI need 24 hours to vet this,‚Äô and they‚Äôre going to take away all the efficiency.‚Äù  Schweikert, who has co-sponsored a bill in Congress to exempt small bitcoin payments from taxation, explained his strategy for persuading fellow lawmakers of the blockchain's benefits.  ‚ÄúHow do I take 435 of us in Congress? I don‚Äôt need them to understand what a node network is, from my view I‚Äôm trying to sell the societal good that can come from a bulletproof ID,‚Äù he said.  Moreover, existing precedents can help define how blockchain legislation should work. For example, he said, ‚Äúwe actually have 100 years of history of ‚Äòhow do you tax people that do foreign exchanges?‚Äô‚Äù  Using existing tax code to determine how to tax cryptocurrencies would simplify that process, he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel from top to bottom. We actually do have case laws and IRS rules that are out there to think about these things.‚Äù  Ultimately, blockchains can be useful when applied correctly, Schweikert said. He suggested that small communities can use private networks for shared services, such as a babysitting cooperative, or larger networks can store medical data.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many applications here that if you start to unify the mechanisms, it solves a lot of my societal problems,‚Äù he said.

According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the price hit a low of¬†$9,075.87 before recovering. At press time, the cryptocurrency's value is hovering around $9,287.00. The development is a notable one, coming roughly a day after the market saw a $1,000-plus drop during afternoon trading.  Observers attributed Wednesday's¬†move to several factors, including issues at cryptocurrency exchange Binance, a warning from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about exchange compliance and a report from the trustee of Mt Gox revealing that some $400 million in bitcoin and bitcoin cash had been liquidated over a several-month period.

While the bill won't be finalized until the full House puts it up to a vote, the endorsement raises the likelihood that it will be sent to the governor's desk for signature ‚Äì and become state law.  Lawmakers first began considering the measure back in January, as CoinDesk previously reported. If approved, residents can pay ""tax and any interest and penalties"" using ""bitcoin or other cryptocurrency."" While the specifics of this process will likely need to be fleshed out further, the measure also calls for the state's Department of Revenue to convert the cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars within 24 hours.  Arizona's State Senate passed the bill by a 16-13 vote on February 8, as reported at the time, and the bill was then passed on to the House just over a week later.

42401208,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcM0sb,1520523947,"Crypto Industry Should Self Regulate, Says CFTC Commissioner","Regulations can take years to develop, so why wait when you can self-regulate?  That's the message U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner Brian Quintenz delivered to the audience at the D.C. Blockchain Summit on Wednesday.  ‚ÄúI believe that a private cryptocurrency oversight body could bridge the gap between the status quo and future government regulatory action,‚Äù he told the audience in his keynote address.  Quintenz also suggested that a cryptocurrency self-regulatory organization (SRO) could have an impact beyond the U.S. market, and could potentially take on global significance.  ""I think right now everyone's trying to figure out where and how their laws apply to this space,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview.  Quintenz continued:  ""So if the community takes advantage of that time and that ambiguity there's the potential for a global framework to apply to everyone if there's enough buy-in from the community to do that, since there aren't jurisdictional questions as to which entity has to do what, or rules that necessitate a bifurcation or separate approaches to the regulation.""  Classification confusion  Numerous jurisdictional questions concerning cryptocurrencies and tokens currently face the industry, with the CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service taking different stances on how they classify the assets.  While Quintenz remarked in the interview that ""bitcoin is absolutely, clearly not a security. It is absolutely a commodity,"" he also said that the aforementioned agencies and others should avoid reducing the broader space to one type of product.  ""In reality, it's a very broad array of innovative products that have been created,"" he explained, going on to say:  ""Some are very simple, some are very complex, some have utility function, some have security-like features, some have payments associated with them or returns or ownership, or I'm sure some could have voting rights. You get into a very murky landscape very quickly as you go through the diversity of the landscape here.""  While the commissioner said it is unlikely that the CFTC would be directly involved in creating a cryptocurrency SRO, he said it could likely offer some guidance informed by policies it has already developed for exchanges and clearinghouses with regard to cybersecurity:  ""We can tell them about what we've already done and help them navigate the decisions we've already made to help inform any new concepts that could better apply to the space so they don't have to recreate the wheel,"" he said.  Agency coordination  As for the CFTC's role in regulating cryptocurrencies, Quintenz emphasized that he would like the agency to avoid setting policy through enforcement actions, though it has done so in the past. He explained that policy set in that manner would lack ""the same force as a commission ruling or as a judge's adjudication on a case.""  Likewise, he told CoinDesk that the CFTC will continue to work with the SEC in cases where the jurisdiction lines of a given product are unclear, like ICO tokens, for example.  Quintenz said:  ""Is that fake token that never got issued a commodity or security? Is it an investment pool? Is it a commodity pool? Someone's got to take down that bad actor. And we try to coordinate to make sure we know who's best equipped to do it.""  Although the CFTC and SEC coordinate on such cases, the commissioner said he was unaware of ‚Äì and wasn't able to give any insight into ‚Äì the rumored SEC subpoena sweep directed at ICO issuers.  However, Quintenz stressed that the SEC has a job to do in ensuring that IPO laws are adhered to.  ""It does not surprise me that people are trying to get around that, and it doesn't surprise me that the SEC is figuring that out. And I think that that's going to be an ongoing conversation,"" he concluded.

42401214,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcM13Q,1520521210,Sierra Leone Secretly Holds First Blockchain-Audited Presidential Vote,"Behind the scenes of Sierra Leone's presidential election Wednesday, a second, perhaps larger milestone was quietly achieved.  As voters in the nation's most populous Western District lined up to cast votes in what had been a heated campaign between 16 candidates, unbeknownst to them, blockchain voting startup Agora was helping keep track of it all, and through its proprietary distributed ledger, providing unprecedented insight into the process.  In what, by all accounts, appears to be a world's first for the emerging technology, Agora, accredited by Sierra Leone's National Election Committee used a private, permissioned blockchain ‚Äì one inspired by the technology that backs bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ‚Äì to oversee the results of a national election in real time. It then relayed the data to individuals entrusted to oversee and verify the nation's democratic process.  However, for Agora, the elections could be step one in an even larger plan to launch a¬†more decentralized version of its technology, and the startup boasts that it's already in conversations with a number of other nations interested in hosting future elections.  Indeed, as even such stalwarts of democracy as the U.S. have proven their susceptibility to elections fraud, the Sierra Leone election ‚Äì exactly because it was so hotly contested ‚Äì could prove to be a landmark of sorts, if blockchain can overcome just a few more hurdles.  ""You're looking at a country that you probably wouldn‚Äôt normally expect to be the first to use transparent voting tech,"" said Agora's newly appointed COO, Jaron Lukasiewicz, who previously founded Coinsetter.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A country like Sierra Leone can ultimately minimize a lot of the fall-out of a highly contentious election by using software like this.""  A long way to go  But while the voting may be over, the test for blockchain is, in some ways, just beginning.  As this article was being completed, Agora, a Switzerland-based foundation, was in the process of manually counting the votes and logging them on a blockchain.  ""Voters complete their votes on paper ballots and then our team with impartial observers register them on the blockchain,"" explained Lukasiewicz, who formally joined the foundation in January after first joining as an advisor.  Stepping back, though, not only is this the first time blockchain has been implemented in a national election, it's also the first live implementation for Agora's stack of blockchain services ‚Äì¬†what the foundation calls ""skipchain"" technology, designed to reach consensus with each node only seeing part of the blockchain.  The lowest level of the stack consists of ""write-permissioned"" nodes operated by Agora and third-party witnesses,¬†Red Cross,¬†√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Freiburg, as well as ""read-only"" nodes that let anyone observe the data.  And while the act of counting votes certainly introduces a number opportunities for fraud, Agora CEO Leonardo Gammar was on-location to help manage the operation as voter IDs were checked against Sierra Leone's National Electoral Committee‚Äôs voter registration list. Future implementations, he said, may be even further decentralized by logging some data on the bitcoin blockchain.  According to Gammar, the firm is in conversations with multiple other nations in Africa and Europe and is pursuing a business model where they aim to provide their customers a 70 percent discount on their current cost.  ""It has been incredible to play a role in helping Sierra Leone‚Äôs citizens exercise their democratic rights, and to help their country maintain a transparent democracy,"" Gammar said, adding:  ""I strongly believe that this election is the beginning of a much larger blockchain voting movement.""  Kind of peaceful  On a more skeptical note, the election took place within context that transcends tech.  Viewed by one Sierra Leone native and current political risk analyst, the election was little better ‚Äì or worse ‚Äì than any of the previous three general elections. Blockchain or no blockchain, he finds little has changed since the end of a bloody civil war that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 50,000 citizens.  Abdul Deensie, who was born in Sierra Leone, left in 1997, five years before the civil war had ended. Eventually, he joined as a fellow with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and got a job at USAID, an independent agency that administers federal aid around the world.  Now, Deensie has been corresponding with several ""sources on the ground"" in Sierra Leone, as well as watching social media and news broadcasts closely, and he says that little he's seeing about the election process has changed.  Skeptically, Deensie pointed to Sierra Leone's ""control of corruption"" score, an annual rating of nations determined via a number of indicators, as something that was perhaps more important than the use of a novel technology.  Citing a history of failing scores in this category (this year Sierra Leone's government rated worse than half the governments measured) and scattered reports of intimidation, he concluded ambivalently:  ""The election itself, I believe, beside these little skirmishes, we can give it a pass as free and fair.""  But according to Lukasiewicz, such skepticism was exactly what led the government to approach his foundation in the first place.  While Sierra Leone does have a history of largely peaceful general elections since its civil war, a number of violent incidents were reported in the days leading up to the event.  Further doubt was cast on the integrity of the leading All People's Congress (APC) party, when the nation's Accountant General found a reported $5.7 million in aid money had gone missing, leading to accusations of fraud and corruption.  Facing such concerns about the reliability of the election, national authorities implemented military support provisions that placed police in the streets, and the national electoral commission has been posting updates on its blog about difficulties with the voting process.  Still, Lukasiewicz said the current Sierra Leone government wanted to create an extra layer of transparency by using Agora's blockchain technology. In total, 17,745 sealed voting boxes were used, with 37 exhibiting various problems, according to the commission's site.  ""We‚Äôre coming in with fully auditable code, fully auditable voting processes,"" Lukasiewicz said.  ""We‚Äôre really bringing something to the table where a voter themselves can audit the election.""

42401204,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcM0wX,1520517615,Stellar Investment Could Make Crypto as Easy as Chat,"Settling a tab in crypto tokens?  While the idea may seem far from mainstream, it's actually at the center of a deal that finds the non-profit behind the world's eighth-largest blockchain, the Stellar Development Foundation, funding the co-founders of OKCupid and their new cryptography-centric startup, Keybase.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Keybase has accepted an undisclosed investment from Stellar. But while the terms of the deal aren't known, the startup wasn't shy in boasting about the alleged size. Stellar was so keen on the concept, the company now says it won't need to pursue a Series B round at all.  And that's no small feat. Founded in 2014, Keybase is built around improving end-to-end encryption, a goal for which it has secured $10.8 million in venture funding in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz.  Thursday's deal, however, isn't a typical VC round. (As evidence, Stellar isn't taking a seat on the Keybase board.) ""It's a very friendly and mutually beneficial arrangement. It's significantly less formal than a traditional venture round,"" Keybase co-founder Chris Coyne explained.  But if the idea and its participants sound surprising,¬†Coyne, who helped launch the well-known U.S. dating aggregator in the 2000s, sees it as a continuation of years of interest in cryptocurrencies.  In fact, near the end of his time at the matchmaking giant, Coyne and his partners made OKCupid one of the first well-known tech companies to accept bitcoin payments.  Coyne recalls:  ""What I realized while this integration was happening was that people had to go through this huge effort to acquire this bitcoin, and then we were just taking it from them. It never felt like anything was really happening on the consumer side.""  Now as a co-founder at Keybase (alongside another OKCupid cofounder, Maxwell Krohn), Coyne believes that his company has built an infrastructure that could accelerate person-to-person payments through work with stellar and the use of its cryptocurrency.  To begin, Keybase is accepting the funds in what it jokingly called ""dirty fiat,"" though over time, it indicated it will enable customers to hold value in Stellar's cryptocurrency, lumens.  Product ahead  Circling back to the big idea, though, it's easy to see the fit for both parties.  Since even before OKCupid's bitcoin integration, Coyne and his partners have been excited about the potential of crypto, but disappointed to see it even still largely used as a store of value or for speculation.  ""It feels like we've almost given up on this story of people sending cryptocurrency to each other,"" Coyne said.¬†""What excites me about Stellar is that it's insanely fast, transaction fees are close to zero and the low energy consumption is exciting to a lot of people on our team.""  But there's more the ideology supporting the deal.  The heart of Keybase's technology is a central repository of public keys, so that data can be encrypted to all of a user's devices without any need for them to handle cumbersome PGP keys (or even see them).  Keybase already allows users to send encrypted chats, files and even run encrypted Slack-like collaborations, all end-to-end encrypted, across multiple devices for each user. Private keys stay on each device that generated it, so the user never has to trust Keybase itself.  In this way, whatever Stellar is investing in Keybase to build for the lumens ecosystem, Coyne seems to hint that the idea is bigger than a mere wallet.  He said:  ""There will be a reveal later this year when the product launches. We will definitely make person-to-person cryptocurrency transactions a lot easier.""  Lumens' features  Still, Stellar's lumens could bring additional advantages to Keybase users.  One feature of lumens the team likes is its ability work as IOUs for fiat, backed by institutions (such as banks) that can be transferred between users.  Using blockchain, these fiat-backed lumens could easily cross borders, so a French user could pay in euros to a British user who would receive pounds, all for tiny fees subtracted from the transaction.  But while most tech companies would have a hard time backwards-engineering a crypto integration effectively, Keybase can, and the reason goes back to the early interest of the founders in its core ideas.  ""Back then, I imagined this world where people had wallets, cryptocurrency wallets, and we would send small amounts of money to each other,"" Coyne told us, concluding:  ""It's always felt like something we could do a very good job on.""

42401213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcM11S,1520516102,Bull Reversal? NEM Price Jumps as Coincheck Moves to Refund Users,"NEM's XEM token has seen a revival of sorts today, suggesting a short-term bottom is in place.  As of writing, XEM is changing hands at $0.349382 ‚Äì up 8 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  Still, the world's 13th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down at least 83 percent from its record high of $2.09 set on Jan. 4. Also, XEM is one of the few cryptocurrencies that has not recovered in line with other crypto markets since the widespread drop on Feb. 6.  Notably, NEM's cryptocurrency was involved in a hack in late January, when hackers stole around $530 million-worth of the digital asset from Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck. Back then, XEM was trading just above $1 and was the 10th largest cryptocurrency as per market capitalization.  Following the theft, Coincheck announced on Feb. 1 that it would reimburse its investors for their stolen funds and that pushed XEM prices higher to $1.22. However, the spike was short-lived, courtesy of a broader market sell-off in early Feb.  Fears that hackers would sell the stolen 500 million XEM appear to have kept the bulls at bay. Thus, the cryptocurrency continued losing altitude through February and fell to $0.286299 yesterday ‚Äì the lowest level since Dec. 8.  The uptick seen today is likely due to oversold conditions, as shown in the technical charts, as well as reports that Coincheck will start compensating customers that lost money in the heist starting next week.  Daily chart: RSI favors the bulls  Historical data shows that XEM usually gains when the relative strength index (RSI) is near 30.00 or below 30.00 (oversold region).¬†That pattern has been repeated today, indicating XEM could gain altitude in the short-term.  Daily chart: Bullish reversal not confirmed  The above chart shows:  Falling wedge pattern: A breakout (daily close above the wedge resistance) would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are trending lower in favor of the bears. The 50-day MA and 100-day MA bearish crossover also favor further losses in XEM prices.  View  The bullish daily RSI pattern and XEM's 8 percent rise indicate a temporary bottom has been made at $0.271848, and the cryptocurrency will likely witness an upside break of the falling wedge. If so, that would confirm a bullish trend reversal and could yield a rally to $0.642539 (Feb. 17 high).  On the other hand, a dip below $0.271848 would open up downside towards $0.21 (wedge support).

""The companies that are usually hit hardest by that gap of trade finance are small- and medium-sized businesses,"" he said. ""We think this is where the blockchain could come in.""  Yet, attendees who spoke to CoinDesk proved to be more conflicted on the question of blockchain's use in government ‚Äì as well as the topic of cryptocurrency regulation, which was top-of-mind at the event as well. One employee of a major blockchain startup expressed skepticism that the U.S. government would seriously commit to using the tech, arguing that agencies might be better served looking at the benefits of tokenization.  Other officials at the event expressed the view that, should blockchain find its way into public-sector use, it may come as part of a wider technology suit.  Marcel Jemio, chief data architect at the¬†Office of Personnel Management (OPM), spoke alongside IBM Public Service Blockchain partner Mark Fisk, stating that blockchain could be used to aggregate government employee data in a more accessible and efficient way.  ‚ÄúI think blockchain in a lot of cases is going to be an enabler of solving the problem, but not necessarily with solving the problem only with blockchain,"" Fisk stated.  'Everyone's talking about it'  As might be expected, the topic of regulation was a major one, both on and off the stage.  Earlier in the day on Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission publicly warned about ""potentially unlawful online platforms for trading digital assets,"" arguing that exchanges which offer services for ICO-derived tokens may be required to register with the agency.  The topic of regulation came up during an appearance by Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, who revealed that the bitcoin mining hardware giant wants to invest in startups seeking to create ""private central banks"" that use cryptocurrencies.  In Wu's view, most tokens on the market today will ultimately come to be viewed as securities under traditional definitions.  ‚ÄúMost tokens will very likely fall into the definition of a security and will be subject to the regulation of a security,"" he commented, going on to argue:  ""But I believe regulators need to prepare a good answer on how to deal with such business innovations.""  Some conference attendees told CoinDesk that they would welcome regulation, particularly pertaining to ICOs, while others claimed that developing regulation at this moment would ""lock"" businesses into rigid models ill-suited for a fast-moving environment.  Attendees also expressed concern about the inconsistent treatment of cryptocurrencies by the U.S. government, given that the IRS considers bitcoin as property and the CFTC views it as a commodity (the latter of which having been reinforced by a court ruling earlier this week).  However, two participants from a cryptocurrency services firm said they thought such discord could eventually benefit the industry, with the lack of agreement by the IRS, the CFTC and the SEC ultimately forcing more discussion on the best way forward.  The event also saw Brian Quintenz, a commissioner for the CFTC, strongly advocate for more self-regulation in the cryptocurrency space.  Quintenz told the audience that cryptocurrency platforms should ""step up"" and self-regulate while the government deliberates, a position he has also expressed in the past.  ""I believe that a private cryptocurrency oversight body could bridge the gap between the status quo and future government regulatory action,"" he argued, adding that he believes such a group could have a global influence.

42401218,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcM14P,1520505611,"Bitcoin Price Revisits $10K, But Will It Stay?","Bitcoin is in a recovery mode after yesterday's seemingly news-driven drop, but the gains could be transient, technical analysis suggests.  Soon before press time, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) had bounced back to $10,070 ‚Äì up 6 percent from the previous day's low of $9,468 ‚Äì and was last seen at $9,993. However, on a 24-hour basis, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is still reporting a 4.25 percent drop, according to CoinMarketCap.  Twenty-four-hours ago, bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $10,500 and clocked a high of $10,702 at 15:00 UTC before falling more than $1,000 to the lowest level since Feb. 26.  Although the sell-off was largely in line with bearish technical set up, negative news flow seems to have added fuel to the fire.  As reported by CoinDesk, it was revealed that the trustee of collapsed Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, Nobuaki Kobayashi, had dumped $400 million-worth of bitcoin and bitcoin cash ‚Äì a move that has angered some investors.  Reports of unauthorized sells on cryptocurrency exchange Binance and technical issues at cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX have also added to bearish pressure around BTC.  Further, the SEC issued a statement that looks to have added to the market's jitters, tweeted by CoinDesk, saying:    3/ SEC: ""If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an 'exchange,' as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.""        ‚Äî CoinDesk (@coindesk) March 7, 2018      For now, though, it appears the sell-off has ended around the key 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the Feb. 6 low and Feb. 20 low.  Daily chart  As seen in the chart above (prices as per Bitfinex), BTC left a higher low around $9,577 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) in late February and rose to $11,700 (Mar. 5 high). Once again, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement is proving a tough nut to crack.  The 1-hour chart, below, shows scope for a minor recovery as the relative strength index (RSI) has diverged in favor of the bulls.  1-hour chart  The ""lower lows"" on the price chart and the ""higher lows"" on the RSI (bullish divergence) indicate that BTC could re-test the descending 50-hour moving average (MA), currently seen at $10,427.  That said, the gains will likely be short-lived, as the 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA and 200-hour MA are all trending lower in favor of the bears. Further, the 100-MA has almost crossed the 500-MA from above (bearish crossover).  Daily chart 2  Bitcoin's close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA yesterday, and the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover, add credence to the bearish set up discussed yesterday and has boosted the odds of a further decline in prices. And, the RSI has dipped below 50.00, also signaling a scope for further losses.  View  A minor corrective rally to $10,400‚Äì$10,500 cannot be ruled out, but gains will likely be short-lived.  BTC looks set to test $8,906 (200-day MA) and could possibly extend the decline to $8,000.  Bullish scenario: A high volume break above $11,000 in the next 72 hours would mean the sell-off from March 5 high of $11,700 has bottomed out around $9,577 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) and could yield a much-awaited bullish break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance.

In a press conference Thursday,¬†Coincheck CEO Koichiro Wada and COO¬†Yusuke Otsuka said that the platform will release more details of the¬†compensation process in the next few days. The pair also revealed a further plan to resume trading services for some cryptocurrencies next week.  As reported by CoinDesk, Coincheck first confirmed some 500 million NEM token had been stolen on Jan. 26, which at the time were worth around $530 million. Soon after the incident, the platform announced it would compensate each stolen token at a rate of $0.81 per token ‚Äì an amount near $420 million.  Following the breach, Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), soon stepped in to inspect the platform's security measures and its fiscal capacity for refunding victims of the heist. As the investigation continued, customers of the exchange also filed class action lawsuits demanding that Coincheck expedite reimbursement of their losses.  Coincheck's plan to refund users comes amid a wider effort by the FSA to more closely scrutinize crypto exchanges in Japan to try and stop such events from reoccurring.  As reported by CoinDesk, following an extensive investigation of the remaining unlicensed exchanges in Japan, the FSA has issued administrative penalties to seven trading platforms today ‚Äì two of which have been ordered to suspend services, while all are mandated to submit a written plan for security improvements by March 22.

42380435,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NbgN,1520499618,Compliant ICOs? Bitcoin OGs Launch Token Sale Service,"Mason Borda has been into initial coin offerings (ICOs) since the beginning.  Yet, the former BitGo software engineer, who helped set up Augur's wallet for its token sale in 2015, was hesitant to enter the market himself until last summer. That's when Borda, and security veteran James Poole, started building TokenSoft, a platform for helping projects manage their initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the project is officially launching today, and with the news, Borda is detailing for the first time a number of the platform's features that are aimed to combat what he sees as prevailing industry issues and pain points.  For one, the white-label software solution is all about compliance, treating every token sold as a security per guidelines laid out by various SEC regulations (such as Reg D, Reg A, etc.).  This will likely attract many clients amid rumors the SEC has undertaken a sweep of the ICO industry, sending out subpoenas and requests for information to all kinds of stakeholders.  ""People are starting to err on the side of compliance, rather than trying to figure out how to make their token sale a utility token sale,"" Borda said. ""We've always known here, at least, that you can't really do a full utility token sale.""  And while TokenSoft is entering a hot market with a fair share of competition, Borda believes his past will help him differentiate the platform and make sure it's prepared for anything the token industry throws at it.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Regulations are really important to me and if you see what happened with the previous blockchain companies, the ones that survived are the ones that embraced regulations.""  Automating compliance  With the focus on compliance, Borda told CoinDesk the platform can handle just about any token offering, including those that want to target U.S. customers ‚Äì they just have to follow the rules.  The U.S. regulatory environment is notoriously cumbersome, and with the SEC yet to issue any formal guidance on the industry, some token issuers have decided to cut off investors in the country rather than deal with any possible regulatory repercussions.  TokenSoft, though, is for issuers that don't want to circumvent rules and regulations, but be proactive about building their tokens with existing regulations as guidelines.  And that's not just in the U.S., but throughout the world, where quirky legalities also exist.  For instance, Borda mentioned fund-of-funds client Apex Token Fund, which had a requirement that their investors needed to adhere to the disparate securities laws of the countries they were in. As such, TokenSoft built their platform to take that into account, automating the addition of compliance mechanisms, such as know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML), that vary by country.  ""If in other countries there are different requirements, we can help do that,"" Borda said, although he didn't disclose how exactly TokenSoft does this.  It's currently serving 50 countries for Apex Token Fund.  Looking forward, the company sees opportunities in further automation.  ""There's a lot of new technology that allows the enforcement of these rules we keep talking about, but by pushing that down to the blockchain itself,"" said Poole, an alum of prominent security companies like RSA and Symantec.  For example, say a security token needs to be traded only with other regulated investors, a smart contract could white list all the wallets that could possibly trade that token and block trades that sent tokens anywhere else.  Borda said this could create a global mesh of compliant channels, which could increase liquidity for these assets while eliminating the friction of abiding by the law.  Engineering good experience  But there's more than just compliance.  Another area TokenSoft looks to improve is the user experience for investors. Poole believes TokenSoft's white-label software, in which all the issuer's branding and precise legal language can be easily adapted, will help there.  ""All the investors know that they go directly to our client to be the face of the sale,"" Poole said.  But because TokenSoft handles the infrastructure that supports that page, the instances of those websites crashing due to significant traffic is limited. The benefits of this were displayed when Overstock's tZero switched platform providers in the midst of their $250 million token sale, dropping SaftLaunch because of its time-consuming and complicated compliance.  TokenSoft has also added mechanisms for making purchasing cleaner.  For instance, when a typical sale goes live that accepts ether, bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, the same public address is usually given to all investors, leading to higher transaction fees.  But Borda believes that's a waste of money. So, on the TokenSoft platform, investors are queued up using a unique ID as they come into the sale. In this way, their place in line is already set, eliminating this practice.  Shifting perspective  Still, given the somewhat murky nature of ICO regulations, it's natural to ask, what exactly convinced Borda and his team the timing was right?  First, Borda said he began seeing entrepreneurs who already had successful companies move to launch token sales, putting their reputations on the line. And second, Borda saw a spate of high-profile law firms starting to take on ICO clients.  TokenSoft only works with companies with counsel from one of four law firms, for now: Perkins Coie, Cooley, DLA Piper and WSGR.  And for Poole? Seeing crypto tokens start to find uses beyond just raising money, such as decentralized governance, was the turning point for him.  ""This actually is something that could change a lot of the finance industry,"" he said.  TokenSoft's first two sales ‚Äì Doc.ai and Swarm Fund ‚Äì ran on Sep. 9. Since then, the company has worked with six more clients and currently has five sales active.  ""There's a lot of new companies entering the space that haven't necessarily been in production,"" Borda said, adding:  ""We've been in the space for a while. We're doing interesting things like helping people adhere to global securities regulations.""  Disclosure:¬†CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo.

42380431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Nbcb,1520492418,New Jersey Issues Cease-and-Desist to ICO Endorsed by Steven Seagal,"The U.S. state of New Jersey has issued a cease-and-desist order to an initial coin offering (ICO) endorsed by film actor Steven Seagal.  In an order entered on March 7, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities alleged that Bitcoiin¬†is selling unregistered securities to New Jersey residents. The document highlights the lack of concrete information about those behind the project, stating that ""Bitcoiin's developers, officers, managers, employees, controllers, and/or directors are anonymous,"" though it highlights the endorsement by Seagal.  ""Bitcoiin has never been registered to sell securities in the State of New Jersey,"" officials wrote.  The project made headlines last month after Seagal, best known for his action film roles in the 1990s, publicly endorsed the cryptocurrency offering through his official Twitter account ‚Äì a notable development given the string of endorsements seen last year and the subsequent warning by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding celebrity involvement in token sales.  The Bitcoiin ICO had sparked accusations that it was a pyramid scheme seeking to mislead investors through the close name association with bitcoin ‚Äì allegations that Bitcoiin¬†later rebuked in a public statement.  Notably, New Jersey's cease-and-desist order highlight's Seagal's role as a brand ambassador, noting a disclaimer on its website that states the actor holds no ownership stake in the project. That said, officials drew issue with the lack of information regarding the compensation he may have received.  ""The Bitcoiin Websites do not disclose what expertise, if any, Steven Seagal has to ensure that the Bitcoiin investments are appropriate and in compliance with federal and state securities laws,"" the order explains. ""Additionally, there are no disclosures as to the nature, scope, and amount of compensation paid by Bitcoiin in exchange for Steven Seagal‚Äôs promotion of the Bitcoiin investments.""  A day before New Jersey's cease-and-desist order was published, Seagal posted a tweet claiming that Bitcoiin was on the cusp of being ""listed on some of the biggest exchanges globally,"" with his message bearing an ""#Ad"" hashtag. He added that additional details are ""coming very shortly.""  Officials framed Wednesday's cease-and-desist action as an effort to protect investors in the state from potential fraud.  ""The Bureau‚Äôs actions today are a reminder to investors that while celebrity endorsements can add to the excitement and hype of cryptocurrency-related investments, they do not guarantee that an investment is sound or even legal,"" Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement.

A total of 13 projects received more than $2.5 million combined to work on scalability, security, development experiences, user interface study and other derivatives of the ethereum blockchain, according to a Wednesday announcement.  The grants will help the ethereum community better develop distributed applications (dapps) and smart contracts, according to the post. The Foundation also noted the different topics each of the recipients is researching, and said, ""we hope that these grants will signal to the community what we think are the missing pieces in the ecosystem that need more support.""  The Foundation continued, saying it ""is here to serve teams and individuals that are working to prevent a tragedy of the commons.""  Notably, it went on to acknowledge that the grant program had changed its focus since its first announcement in January. At the time, it was aimed at developers working on scaling ethereum‚Äôs network, as previously reported.  On Wednesday, the Foundation explained the change:  ‚ÄúWe decided to broaden the support to projects that are doing great work across scalability, usefulness and security. These projects have no ICOs, no token sales, and focus simply on building useful products and experiences.‚Äù  Nor are the grants strictly related to the main network. The Foundation noted that some of its grants went to ‚Äúhackternships‚Äù for members of the community who proposed a useful side project.  That being said, some of the largest grants went towards scalability research - L4 Research, which earned $1.5 million to work on state channels, while Prysmatic Labs earned $100,000 for work on sharding.

42380441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Nbnv,1520485246,SWIFT Claims 'Huge' Progress on DLT Bank Pilot,"Interbank messaging platform SWIFT has published the results of a long-running distributed ledger proof-of-concept project.  Based on Hyperledger Fabric, the SWIFT trial focused on the use of nostro accounts, or bank accounts held by banks inside other banks. The proof-of-concept envisioned these ""many-to-many"" bank transfers, specifically examining how the system could meet requirements around governance, security and data privacy as they relate to the nostro reconcilitation process.  According to Damien Vanderveken, SWIFT's head of research and¬†development, the test provided a window into the strengths ‚Äì and limits ‚Äì of migrating such a system to distributed technology.  He said in a statement:  ""The DLT sandbox enabled us to control access, to define and enforce user privileges, to physically segregate confidential data and store it only with the relevant parties while supporting a strong identity framework by linking all participants to their BIC, and having all keys signed by a SWIFT certification authority.""  ""Lots of things we couldn't do before, we can do now,"" he later told CoinDesk. ""Some things we couldn't do, but it's just a matter of time before they get fixed and we are entirely happy.""  According to Vanderveken, from a technology perspective, ""the progress compared to a year ago was huge and fantastic.""  However, SWIFT's report also details the limitations of the transaction capacities current blockchain solutions can support, considering that, at a commercial-scale level, the system in question would need to be able to handle many more channels than the proof-of-concept demonstrated.  ""If you have so many channels, then it becomes more complicated to do a number of things,"" Vanderveken explained.  That said, the test showed that banks could conduct real-time transactions using a distributed ledger, while staying in compliance with reporting requirements.  ""It enabled real-time ... transaction status updates, full audit trails, visibility of expected and available balances, real-time simplified account entries confirmation, the identification of pending entries and potential related issues, and generated the data required to support regulatory reporting,"" Swift said.

According to statements at the time, the FSA discovered Coincheck's internal systems were lacking, including inadequate anti-money laundering measures.  Following its on-site inspection on Coincheck, the financial regulator also expanded its probe to other domestic crypto trading platforms that are yet to be approved by the FSA for inadequate security measures which included the two that are suspended today.  Elsewhere in the announcement, the FSA also established a cryptocurrency exchange industry study group which aims to examine institutional issues regarding cryptocurrency.
