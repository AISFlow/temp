42380389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NUzD,1519945555,"Don't Ban Crypto, Says Former FDIC Chief Sheila Bair","The former chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures bank deposits in the U.S., says that cryptocurrencies shouldn't be outlawed.  According to a new interview published by Barron's, Sheila Bair suggested that while bitcoin and other cryptos lack an ""intrinsic value,"" so do currencies such as the U.S. dollar.  ""I don't think we should ban it – the green bills in your pocket don't have an intrinsic value, either,"" she was quoted as saying.  The comments from Bair – who led the government corporation between 2006 and 2011 – are notable, given the growing scrutiny being applied to the market from a range of regulators worldwide. Bair, who has opined about cryptocurrency regulation in the past, is also a member of blockchain startup Paxos' board of directors.  Indeed, she suggested that as far as the price of cryptocurrencies is concerned, the market itself is best equipped to ascertain some kind of value.  ""Let the market figure out what it's worth,"" she told the publication. ""That is what it is doing now.""  That said, Bair didn't say that regulators should take an entirely hands-off approach. Officials, she indicated, should push for ""good disclosure, education, warding off fraud, and making sure it is not being used for illicit activities.""  In the U.S. itself, the Trump administration is taking an increasingly proactive tack in this area, as evidenced by recent comments from officials like Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, among others.  During her interview, Bair also had some words of wisdom for those looking to potentially invest in cryptocurrencies, telling the publication:  ""Don't put any money into bitcoin that you can't afford to lose.""

42380392,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NV0T,1519940149,Fake Website Scam Targets Aspiring Telegram ICO Investors,"Amid a flurry of reports about messaging app Telegram's multibillion-dollar initial coin offering (ICO), a newly-created website appears to be attempting to ensnare would-be investors.  The website  , hosted by the ""Telegram Foundation,"" is seeking funds for what it calls the ""public ICO"" for the Telegram TON token. Yet as reported by CoinDesk and other outlets, the sale has largely taken place behind closed doors, with the only publicly available information related to the offering coming in the shape of a Form D filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  On Thursday, CoinDesk received reports of a fraudulent email attributed to Telegram, and also located a Twitter account with the username ""Telegram ICO (TON)"" and the handle, @ico_ton.  A screenshothttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXOC5sPVAAECuHt.jpg of the email shows an effort to pitch the Telegram Open Network public token sale, which it states is accepting bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum as payment methods.  The email goes on to say:  ""Our efforts in creating a better blockchain cannot take effect unless we get the support of as many participants as possible. In return for your contribution we will continue developing this blockchain even further, giving you more advantages within the blockchain technology.""  Yet the associated website was registered on Feb. 12, around the time that details of the token sale emerged. According to information from Whois.com, the site's registrar is MaxiDed, which per its website ""is a real legit company, is an international organization officially registered as MaxiDed Ltd"" and is based in Dominica.  A second website that appears to be associated with the scheme, telegram-ico.org, triggers a Cisco cybersecurity warning when accessed. That website was registered in Russia on January 26, Whois data shows. The Twitter account attributed to the Foundation was also launched in February of this year.  Telegram's billion-dollar token sale has previously been targeted by such campaigns, as CoinDesk previously reported. The efforts are perhaps unsurprising, given the ICO's high-profile status as well as the prevalent trend of social media-based cryptocurrency scammers.  Earlier this week, it was reported that hackers recently hijacked verified Twitter accounts to pose as prominent individuals and entities in the crypto industry.  Representatives for Telegram did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The sanctions were unveiled on Feb. 23, targeting North Korea's shipping and maritime trading industries. The goal, as stated at the time, is to disrupt the country's ability to conduct energy-related imports and exports.  Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, however, took the administration to task that same day, arguing that the sanctions are insufficient for a number of reasons. Among those, he said, is a lack of cybercrime-related elements, specifically referring to steps taken by North Korea to hack exchange services and steal bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Markey said in a statement:  ""And despite North Korea being an avowed state-sponsor of cybercrime, the country’s illicit cyber activities are not addressed. Russia's reported involvement in providing internet connectivity to the North Korean elite and the Chinese hosting of some North Korean cyberattacks go unmentioned. And these sanctions do nothing to restrict North Korea’s ability to steal cryptocurrencies, a principal means for Kim Jong Un's regime to raise revenue for its military programs.""  Allegations  that North Korea has moved to infiltrate cryptocurrency exchanges date back to last summer, coming in the wake of intrusions against a series of South Korea-based platforms. South Korean law enforcement officials ultimately came out publicly with their accusations.

42380382,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NUrf,1519930815,Overstock Defends tZero ICO: SEC Subpoenaed 'Everyone Else',"The president of Overstock's tZero subsidiary has one simple message to convey: ""We have not received a subpoena.""  Since public documents Thursday revealed the e-commerce giant's efforts to raise funding via an initial coin offering (ICO) had drawn scrutiny from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, Joseph Cammarata has been speaking out, seeking to put forth the message that Overstock is ""willingly working"" with regulators.  The documents, published this morning on the SEC's website, describe an investigation that's looking into whether federal securities laws were violated as part of the company's $250 million initial coin offering.  Coming just a day after it was first reported that a ""wave of subpoenas"" had been issued by the SEC as part of a broad investigation into ICOs, Cammarata's statements are notable in that they position the company as outside of this effort.  In interview, Cammarata sought to further distinguish the Overstock investigation from the SEC's work with other ICOs, explaining how a series of other decisions the company had made resulted in the different dynamic.  He told CoinDesk:  ""They subpoenaed everybody else and asked us to cooperate.""  The reason for this distinction, according to Cammarata, goes back to a conversation the regulator had had with executives at Overstock about the company's decision to file the token issuance as a Reg. D exemption according to SEC guidance.  Contrary to many other ICOs that have been notoriously opaque regarding their ICOs and how the founders spend the money, filing under the Reg D exemption means an increased level of transparency is built into the process.  However, the fact that the investigation was being conducted by the Division of Enforcement is also notable, as the division is involved in investigations generally only after the regulator identifies more concrete concerns.  The SEC declined to comment on our request to confirm that the Division of Enforcement was overseeing the investigation, and referred us to the publicly available documents.  Still, for Cammarata, the decision to list the firm's blockchain securities on an ATS makes the offering materially different than others that aren't operating with regulatory clarity.

42380397,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NV6l,1519924227,AMD: GPU Business Could Take Hit If Crypto Miners Stop Buying,"A drop in demand for graphics cards (GPUs) by the world's cryptocurrency miners could 'materially' impact AMD's chip business, the company disclosed this week.  In its most recent 10-K annual filing, AMD – one of several firms to ride the recent wave of demand for GPUs (which are needed for the energy-intensive mining process) – highlighted how ""the rise of cryptocurrency prices and the introduction of new cryptocurrencies created a demand for our GPUs in 2017."" While the company offered no specific figures, the disclosure, published on Feb. 27, is in line with past predictions from AMD, which suggested near the end of 2017 that its GPU business was getting a lift thanks to crypto-miners.  That state of play might not last forever, however.  In the 10-K, AMD indicated that several factors could change the environment on the GPU front, highlighting market and regulatory risks that could lead to a decline in the number of GPUs being bought by cryptocurrency miners.  The firm wrote:  ""The cryptocurrency market is unstable and demand could change quickly. For example, China and South Korea have recently instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. If we are unable to manage the risks related to a decrease in the demand for cryptocurrency mining, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.""  The prediction that volatility could alter the pace of demand is shared by others in the space, including rival GPU maker Nvidia.  During an earnings call in early February, Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, said it was “hard to quantify” how much of its GPU revenue came from cryptocurrency miners, adding that ""cryptocurrency trends are likely to remain volatile.""  Still, the inclusion in its most recent filing serves to highlight how AMD is among a growing list of companies – primarily financial institutions – to acknowledge the impact that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will have on their bottom lines.

The release states that dealers in cryptocurrency, such as NairaEx, a Nigeria-based bitcoin trading platform, are ""not licensed or regulated by the CBN.""  The commentary follows previous messages sent to Nigerian financial institutions in early 2017, in which the CBN advised domestic banks to distance themselves from cryptocurrencies, warning ""not to use, hold or transact in any way with the technology.""  Despite that, the remarks come at a time when Nigeria has seen growing interest in cryptocurrency investments.

What began with a sell-off in bitcoin, one that pushed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies to a 10-week low of $276 billion, has ended in a seeming recovery, with the total value hitting $450 billion Thursday to end February trading.  However, the numbers don't exactly tell the whole story. Comparing performance to January, the market saw a decline of 8.5 percent month-over-month, and a decline of 45.78 percent from its 2018 record high of $830 billion.  But that's not to say there weren't gains to be had. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, saw a ""V-shaped"" recovery, while fifth-place litecoin notched monthly gains.  Still, it was the lesser-known cryptocurrencies that performed best amid the broad-based gloom and doom, suggesting that after a flurry of retail trading to end 2017, enthusiasts are perhaps once again the dominant market force.  DigixDao  DigixDao (DGD), an ethereum-based token, gained a staggering 136 percent last month, rising 90 percent in the last week alone to hit an all-time high of $597.66 Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap.  Courtesy of the meteoric increase, DGD is now the 25th largest cryptocurrency by per market capitalization, putting into large-cap territory.  For those new to asset's climb up the charts, the team behind the project are creating a new token called DigixGold (DGX), which will be backed by physical gold.  ""Every DGX will be backed by 1 gram of LBMA-approved bullion,"" as per the official website, which claims the coin will be released by the end of the first quarter.

It is worth noting that DGD cannot be bought with fiat currencies and going forward the DGX token can only be bought with ethereum's ether token.  Litecoin  Litecoin clocked a high of $251.90 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange on Feb. 20 as investors bought in to make free money via the litecoin cash (LCC) hard fork.  However, airdrop aside, gains could be associated with Litecoin Founder Charlie Lee asserting his belief that the cryptocurrency could overtake bitcoin cash in market cap this year. Further, LTC was also in the limelight due to Litepay launch.  Currently, LTC is trading at $205 on GDAX, having witnessed the bull exhaustion near the stiff resistance zone of $230-$240 earlier this week. Meanwhile, LCC (created on Feb. 20) is trading at $1.39 - down 31.13 percent in the last 24 hours.  OmiseGo  Having rallied more than 140 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $7.39, OmiseGo's ICO token ranks third on the list of gainers among top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

42380385,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NUuB,1519909196,Payment Provider Fleetcor to Pilot Ripple's XRP Cryptocurrency,"Workforce and fleet payments provider Fleetcor Technologies has become the latest to trial Ripple's xRapid product, which utilizes its custom cryptocurrency XRP.  Canada-based financial consultants Cambridge Global Payments, which Fleetcor acquired last year, will also be part of the partnership, a Ripple spokesperson said. Cambridge has been a Ripple client since 2017, though it has largely used the startup's xCurrent product.    Stepping back, the news comes over a month after telecom provider IDT and payments provider Mercury signed on to pilot xRapid. Similarly, MoneyGram soon after revealed it was piloting the same product to test its speed and efficiency for international payments, as previously reported.    At present, the companies must use pre-funded bank accounts in various countries in order to facilitate transactions.  Cuallix, a Mexican financial services company, has been using XRP as an alternative since last year, and noted in a recent blog post that the liquidity provided by xRapid helps it process direct payments between the U.S. and its southern neighbor both quickly and cheaply.  Various other companies have also signed on with Ripple in recent months, using its blockchain technology stacks, but not XRP, to ease cross-border transactions. Over the past few months, Abu Dhabi-based UAE Exchange, China-based LianLian and the UK arm of Santander Bank have all signed on to use xCurrent.  At the time, the companies largely announced they were looking to lower the cost and time required to send funds across borders.

42380380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NUp9,1519907537,Overstock: $250 Million tZero ICO Under SEC Review,"A filing with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released Thursday has revealed new details about Overstock.com's ongoing $250 million ICO for its tZero alternative trading system.  However, most notable amid the stream of information on the sale structure and advisory board, is the public e-commerce company's confirmation that the sale has been under review by the SEC since February.  While the documents explicitly state Overstock is not aware of any legal proceedings that could have an ""adverse impact,"" on the company, they do shed light on a Wall Street Journal report Wednesday that confirmed the agency is conducting a sweeping probe of companies and firms that have sought to raise money via the mechanism.  ""In February 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed the Company that it is conducting an investigation in the matter re: Overstock.com, Inc. and requested that the company voluntarily provide certain documents related to the Offering and the Tokens in connection with its investigation,"" the filing reads.  It continues:  ""The SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law. Also, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security.""  As reported by CoinDesk, much remains unknown about the ongoing fact-finding, including the number and timing of SEC inquiries, with sources speaking on background varying widely as to the details related to the probe.  The president of tZero, Joseph Cammarata told CoinDesk: ""We are actually happy that the SEC is scrutinizing the space.""  Still, the admission that Overstock has received such an inquiry is likely to further speculation as to what might result from the ultimate investigations, building on comments from SEC Chair Jay Clayton, who has suggested he believes legal non-compliance is rampant in the sector.  Platform switch  Elsewhere in the filing, Overstock confirmed it has concluded its ICO pre-sale after raising $100 million, and has initiated its subsequent fundraising round. However, this shift is coinciding with a large technical change.  In an interview with CoinDesk, tZero president Joseph Cammarata confirmed tZero will switch from SaftLaunch, a platform for managing crypto token sales, to StartEngine, a platform first developed for equity crowdfunding management.  ""SaftLaunch was utilized for the presale. We're now augmenting the subsequent sale to bring on StartEngine,"" Cammarata said.  According to Cammarata, tZero's decision to switch platforms was not due to regulatory issues, but stems from SaftLaunch's complicated and time-consuming anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) process, which resulted in a bottleneck as the ICO attracted huge interest.  As such, the presale of tZero's tokens for interacting with the company's alternative trading system for blockchain securities, was extended. The sale, which was modeled under the simple agreement for future equities (SAFE) framework was initially set to end on January 18, and only concluded today.  A spokesperson for SaftLaunch confirmed there were delays in the onboarding process, saying, ""Because of strong demand, there was an initial backlog in managing inquiries from interested investors but there is no backlog now, and the offering remains open.""  Early investors in the pre-sale will continue to be able to use the SaftLaunch platform, but investors in the subsequent round, which kicks off today, will go through StartEngine.  And just how much  The ICO's delay, no surprise, also brought out the skeptics.  Top among the concerns around the token sale is whether or not tZero has actually raised the $100 million it claims to have already taken in.  For instance, a report last week placed the actual number at $49 million based on the latest SEC filings, and Cammarata said others have speculated the number is as low as $18 million, with the rest being perhaps inflated by investments from Overstock.  Cammarata discounted those suggestions, however, telling CoinDesk that 70 percent of the ICO's investors have come from family offices, hedge funds and the people who run those institutions, with the other 30 percent coming from non-institutional investors.  And as far as Overstock inflating those numbers with its own money, Cammarata concluded:  ""One thing that I'd like to make clear is we're over $100 million and Overstock has not put anything in the ICO at this time. They have not bought any tokens or made any investments at this time.""  Correction: Language has been removed suggesting Overstock has received a direct subpoena. CoinDesk has updated the article.

According to a Reuters report, Ong Chong Tee, deputy managing director of MAS, said during a speech Thursday that his agency is currently ""assessing if additional regulations are required in the area of investor protection,"" though he didn't elaborate on the details.  The comment signals that a new regulatory framework may be imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges in Singapore, and comes as the monetary authority is already paying close attention to domestic cryptocurrency activities.  As reported by CoinDesk, in response to parliamentary inquiries, MAS chairman Tharman Shanmugaratnam has previously said that, while Singapore is not likely to ban cryptocurrency trading, his agency has been looking at imposing anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules on exchanges.  The latest statement also follows the authority's warning in December of last year – at a time when bitcoin's price reached an all-time-high of around $20,000 – that investors must be extremely cautious in dealing with cryptocurrencies, which are not regulated by the agency.

42428633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9T3h,1519875917,"SEC ICO Probe Underway, But Stories Conflict on Size of Sweep","""It was a nasty piece of business.""  That’s how one industry lawyer described a subpoena he saw in January from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), part of the agency's months-long probe into the nascent crypto fundraising mechanism, initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The roughly 25-page document, the lawyer said, was ""hyper-detailed,"" asking for “every bit of communication around the token launch.”  But while large financial institutions have the resources and procedures to handle such requests as a matter of course, complying would be a tall order for a startup.  The lawyer said:  ""For any normal person trying to respond, it would be hellish.""  Still, there was an alternative: instead of producing reams of documents, emails and messages, the recipient of the subpoena could instead just meet with the SEC. “Just come in and talk to us” is how the lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, paraphrased the invitation.  The anecdote illustrates how the agency has been trying to quickly get its arms around the explosive growth in ICOs, which according to CoinDesk’s ICO Tracker have raised nearly $8 billion cumulatively, the vast majority of that in the last year.  “This is the tool they have to understand the world,” said another industry lawyer of the agency’s practice of issuing subpoenas and requests for information (RFIs).  A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on the probe earlier Wednesday, contending that it has kicked into high gear in recent weeks.  Conflicting accounts  But much remains unclear about the ongoing dragnet, including the timing. Several lawyers interviewed by CoinDesk this week said the subpoenas and RFIs started last fall and estimated that there have been perhaps 80 in total.  “They are shotgunning these, we’ve been warning people about this for months now,” another attorney, who wanted to remain unnamed, told CoinDesk.  Yet, others gave even higher estimates of the volume – into the hundreds – and described a recent uptick.  According to industry sources who have seen several ICO subpoenas, the requested information typically includes lists of investors, emails, marketing materials, organizational structures, amounts raised, the location of the funds and the people involved and their locations.  Not only issuers and advisors have been contacted, several sources said, but also exchanges and even investors have received requests as well.  In a recent Senate hearing, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton indicated that the SEC was pounding the beat.  ""With the support of my fellow Commissioners, I have asked the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to continue to police these markets vigorously and recommend enforcement actions against those who conduct ICOs ... in violation of the federal securities laws,"" he told lawmakers.  So far, there's been a handful of actions, with notable cases including Munchee and AriseBank.  Common thread?  One possible interpretation is that the raft of subpoenas could just be a way to scare the industry.    In the view of Carol Van Cleef, CEO of Luminous, a decentralized technology solutions company, that's plausible. ""Is this a deterrent or enforcement?"" she asked rhetorically.      But in light of Clayton's remarks, Van Cleef said it's likely a common thread will appear in this sweep.      ""There have been occasions where [the SEC] has sent out more than one subpoena at one time …if it is not indicative of a major initiative across the space, they're all related to the same case or they're all interrelated,"" said Van Cleef, who was previously a longtime financial-services lawyer.              According to multiple sources, many of the ICOs under the microscope have been transactions where investors received a token that does not yet have any use because the proposed blockchain network has yet to be built.    What remains to be seen is if the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), a bifurcated structure introduced to the market last year to satisfy regulators, will have the intended effect.  Broader context  According to Van Cleef, other recent news in the crypto space could also hint at what the SEC’s sweep is all about.    For instance, after Circle's acquisition of crypto exchange Poloniex, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper tweeted out a slide deck apparently showing that the SEC told Circle it would not pursue enforcement action against Poloniex if Circle moved promptly to seek the appropriate regulatory approval to operate the token exchange business.      Just got this slide from a confidential Circle presentation. It does more to explain Circle's acquisition of Poloniex than anything I have seen today. pic.twitter.com/gRXxDeXvxl        — Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) February 26, 2018        ""On the eve of major SEC action, [Poloniex] sells for $400 million … it appears to have been given a huge pass,"" Van Cleef said.      And what that shows is that going forward, ""for entities dealing with possible noncompliance, there's a need for an appropriate balance in the dialogue with the SEC and other government agencies. A failure to manage that dialogue appropriately will make the hurt much more significant.""

According to business news outlet Yicai, China's Public Information Network Security Supervision agency under the Ministry of Public Security, the country's police force, has been closely watching foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as domestic platforms that have shifted overseas.  The report said the effort comes as part of the Chinese government's efforts to prevent potential money laundering, pyramid schemes and investment fraud from platforms accessible to Chinese investors.  The latest sign that China's regulators are actively scrutinizing cryptocurrency exchanges, the report further explained that the execution plan came into effect in September last year when People's Bank of China (PBoC) put out its ban on initial coin offerings (ICO) and ordered closure of fiat-to-crypto trading.  Following the clampdown, ICO organizers and crypto exchanges have shifted their focus to overseas platforms. And yet Chinese regulators have issued multiple warnings on risks associated with global cryptocurrency activities.

According to a receivership report filed this week, co-founders, Jared Rice Sr. and Stanley Ford, initially failed to comply with a court order requiring them to disclose all of their property as well as assets owned by AriseBank.  Ford is at present in Dubai, but Rice later acquiesced and the case's appointed receiver, Mark Rasmussen, has identified 27.96 bitcoins, 196,131.04 dogecoins, 271.33 litecoins, 2,391,455.51 bitshares coins, 19,413.76 PIVX and 3599.99 BitUSD coins in addition to other funds in fiat as assets.  However, the document later reads:  ""The receiver believes that there are additional assets of the receivership entities that he has not taken possession of and may need to file lawsuits to collect all of the property that belongs to the receivership entities.""  The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission issued a cease-and-desist order to AriseBank, a self-described ""decentralized banking platform,"" late last month. The agency subsequently charged the founders with fraud and issuing unregistered securities in relation to their January token sale.  The receivership report also indicates that the case could expand its reach beyond AriseBank and its co-founders.  ""The receiver has issued multiple subpoenas to third parties for documents and deposition testimony,"" says the document, though it states that no further lawsuits have been filed.  Another notable revelation from the document is that Rasmussen does not intend to liquidate the AriseBank Estate's cryptocurrency holdings, though he will do so with other assets ""that may decrease in market value,"" such as televisions, smart phones and computers in order to ""maximize the recovery amount.""  ""For now the receiver intends to continue holding the cryptocurrency in the receiver's wallets and not liquidate it.
