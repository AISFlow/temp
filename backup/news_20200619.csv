42404746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTrj,1592605711,‘Satoshi Was a Black Woman’: Blockchain Entrepreneurs Talk Financial Inclusion on Juneteenth,"Racial diversity and financial inclusion are good for cryptocurrency and blockchain – and the industry has work to do.      That was the overarching conclusion of a virtual Juneteenth event put together by Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain.      Juneteenth is the celebration of June 19, 1865, when the last group of enslaved African Americans were made aware of the Emancipation Proclamation that U.S. President Abraham Lincoln had signed two years earlier.      While America’s education system has left many ignorant of the origins of Juneteenth, there has been a revived interest in turning the day into a national holiday after protests sprung up around the world in response to the May 25 police killing of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd.      In a wide-ranging conversation Friday, panelists at the event said crypto has the potential to allow citizens to opt out of what they described as a racist financial system on Wall Street. That said, the panelists added, Black people and people of color must be part of the development of the technology for that to happen.      Read more: Bitcoin Is a Way to Repair Economic Injustice: Author Isaiah Jackson      Isaiah Jackson, founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and author of ""Bitcoin & Black America,"" said he believes Black investment in digital assets would create a more resilient system than Black Wall Street, a Black business district that was burned down by white mobs during the Tulsa race massacre of 1921.      “You can’t burn down cryptocurrency and blockchain technology,” Jackson said. “I want to encourage everyone to stay vigilant and make sure you start to move your money and savings out of this failing system. … We need to make sure we use censorship-resistant and scarce-money systems such as bitcoin.”      Sinclair Skinner, the co-founder of pan-African bitcoin remittance firm BitMari, agreed, saying the ethos of bitcoin and the ethos of the Black community are aligned.      “We say that Satoshi is Black,” Skinner said. “But Satoshi was probably a Black woman because a man would have never been able to walk away and not take credit.”    More work needed    Despite crypto’s potential, however, the industry is not immune to the same societal ills that have affected the broader world, Skinner said.      “Blockchain is full of racists,” he said. “It’s just like the rest of society.”      In the fight for venture capital, blockchain enthusiasts should remember that cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Black founders face the same issues – being turned away for being different, Mesidor said.      In turn, entrepreneurs should choose investors that have diverse funds, said Jalak Jobanputra, founding partner of Future\Perfect Ventures, an early-stage fund investing in blockchain technology and machine learning.      “We have to make sure that diverse voices are represented unlike what happened with the internet 20 years ago when it was really created by one demographic for one demographic,” Jobanputra said.

42404742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTmo,1592603448,Cambodia Plots a Dollar-Free Future With Blockchain-Based Payments: White Paper,"The National Bank of Cambodia revealed the technical details of its upcoming blockchain-based payments system dubbed ‘Project Bakong’ this week.      The central bank, which has been building Project Bakong since 2017, views its quasi-digital currency project as a high-tech revamp of the Khmer Riel, Cambodia’s official currency but hardly its de facto cash choice, as locals have favored the U.S. dollar for decades, according to the white paper published Thursday.      The central bank said Bakong will help challenge the dollar’s reign by inducing Cambodians to pay instead via QR codes and a mobile app, with a Hyperledger Iroha blockchain facilitating real-time fund transfers between e-wallets plugged into their bank accounts.      That permissioned blockchain will work between Bakong accounts and traditional accounts, record transactions on a distributed ledger, reach consensus via the block voting hash-based “Yet Another Consensus” algorithm, and process transactions in five seconds or less, according to the white paper.      “Transaction throughput is between 1,000 and 2,000 transactions per second,” depending on tech specs, the central bank said in the white paper. “This suggests that there is potential for this project to scale.”      Watch: Cambodia's Project Bakong and the Future of Payments      The bank said its system’s peer-to-peer nature removes the inefficiencies of centralized clearing house models without costing users anything to transact.      “Since banks and individual users are now brought into one DLT platform both banks and users no longer face interconnectivity and interoperability problems,” the central bank said.    Quasi-digital currency    Cambodian officials have been hesitant to label the fiat-backed Project Bakong a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the past, instead calling it a blockchain payments system. Users must load Riel into their Bakong accounts before they can transact with others. That's different from a natively digital CBDC.      Even so, the white paper frames Bakong against the proliferation of CBDC projects in highly-developed countries around the world. But while the paper said such nations may turn to CBDC to address their population’s falling cash use rates, in developing countries – a category in which Cambodia may remain for decades – it said that CBDC can promote financial inclusion, improve inefficient payment systems and even reduce poverty by opening access.      (Notably, the National Bank of Cambodia is one of the few central banks whose future-of-money initiative actually relies on a blockchain.)      The demographically young and increasingly tech-savvy population of Cambodia will likely boost Bakong adoption, according to the bank. Cambodians are increasingly porting their financial lives onto their phones: e-wallet accounts in the country climbed 64% in 2019 to a record 5.22 million, according to the paper.      See also: Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      Mass adoption may also grant the central bank a greater degree of control over Cambodia’s monetary policy by breaking the dollar’s decade-long local hold. Bank officials are already moving to oust the U.S. dollar: Last month, the central bank announced plans to phase out $1, $2 and $5 banknotes by the end of August.      It is still unclear precisely when Project Bakong will fully launch. The white paper said “early 2020,” despite being published midway through the year.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TRADING | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/19/cambodia-plots-a-dollar-free-future-with-blockchain-based-payments-white-paper,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc3602a612717e0ee5a322d5edd6bc7a5b95ca04-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404731,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkRAT,1592599467,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Spot Volumes Are Weak While Options and DeFi Strengthen,"Bitcoin spot volume may have been low this week, but the real action in crypto has been in the options market and decentralized finance.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,274 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 1% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Friday (8:00 p.m. Thursday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,368 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. It slogged around a tight range between $9,280 and $9,428 during the preceding 19 hours. Its price is now below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages - a bearish signal for market technicians who study charts.      “Since the halving mid-May, bitcoin has gone nowhere, basically stuck in a range of $8,500 to $10,200,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      Trading has dipped on spot exchanges like Coinbase, with its three-month average daily volume at $171 million. Over the past week, its seven-day average has been $82 million, more than 50% lower.      Next week, on June 26, approximately $1 billion in bitcoin options will expire, and traders expect price movements that could be violent as a result. “Price action is like a spring,” said Lifchitz. “The longer it remains stuck in a narrow range, the more any breakout on the upside or the downside will be violent, just like a spring expands the more violently the more it is compressed.”      Read More: Outflow of Bitcoin From Miners at Lows Not Seen Since 2010      The majority of bitcoin options expiring are bullish bets on the price going up, wrote Singapore-based quantitative trading firm QCP Capital in an investor note Friday. “The end-June open interest is concentrated in calls with strikes around $10,000-$15,000, and likely a function of institutional interest as a good portion of the calls were executed on CME.”      This may suggest the smart money is betting on a better bitcoin price. CME is a venue professional commodities traders use for different futures and options strategies. The growing bitcoin options open interest there, including a record $372 million in open interest June 10, shows increased crypto interest by sophisticated investors.      “We've now had a long period of sideways consolidation since the beginning of May, out of which will come a sharp move higher or lower,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for London-based brokerage Koine. “As long as the market can hold above $9,000, I still favor the upside, which could see bitcoin testing above $12,000.”    Compound token creating opportunities for some traders    Excitement around COMP, the governance token of the Ethereum-based Compound lending network, has certainly given some traders new ideas on how to profit from the growing interest in decentralized finance, or DeFi. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization powering the Ethereum network, was trading around $228 and slipped 1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Compound’s COMP Token More Than Doubles in Price Amid DeFi Mania      One quantitative firm has seen traders use Ethereum-based stablecoin arbitrage as part of a strategy to make gains on COMP’s growth. “We saw traders using USDC to borrow USDT and other stablecoins on Compound to earn COMP, then use Curve to swap the USDT back to USDC and repeat the process,” said Peter Chen, a trader at Hong Kong-based OneBit Quant.      Curve is a decentralized exchange, or DEX, that launched earlier this year. Many well-capitalized traders say DEXes are slow and have low liquidity, making it difficult to execute large trades. However, the growth of stablecoin-heavy Curve and other DEXes as an alternative to the centralized spot and derivative crypto exchanges may allow many traders, over the long-term, to develop exciting new DeFi-based strategies.      Curve is dominating the DEX market Friday, with its $24.7 million volume in the past 24 hours outpacing second-place Uniswap, at $16.2 million in volume, according to aggregator Dune Analytics.

42404719,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkQyf,1592596507,New York Fed's 'Bitcoin Is Just Another Fiat' Claim Sparks Controversy,"Economists with the New York Federal Reserve do not think bitcoin is a new kind of money.      Bitcoin, the decentralized, permissionless, trustless digital value system that an anonymous programmer created over a decade ago is “just another example of fiat money,” said Michael Lee and Antoine Martin in a Thursday blog post.      “Bitcoin may be money, but it is not a new type of money,” they said. Dollar bills are fiat, gigantic limestone wheels were once fiat and bitcoin is fiat as well, they said.      Their argument appeared to employ a definition of fiat money as being an intrinsically worthless object whose sole value derives from the bearer’s belief he or she can use it for goods.      But such a definition misclassifies the nature of bitcoin by botching the very meaning of fiat, said Nic Carter, a partner at the blockchain-focused Castle Island Ventures and frequent crypto commentator (including for CoinDesk).      Carter said fiat currency, such as dollar bills, has value because the issuing authority says so. But that is not at all the case with bitcoin, he said.      “I don't know if their intent is to denigrate bitcoin but it comes off that way,” Carter said of the NY Fed economists. In a tweet he called the Fed's argument ""insane.""    What is bitcoin?    Martin and Lee posit that the Bitcoin ecosystem’s true newness lies in the novel “exchange mechanism” it spawned. “The ability to make electronic exchanges without a trusted party – a defining characteristic of Bitcoin – is radically new,” they said.      Simply put, there had never been a true means to conduct “electronic transfers without a third party” before Bitcoin came around, they said. Yes, central banks and commercial banks and an ecosystem of financial products all allowed money to flow electronically before. But those all worked because a third party said so. They said that’s not the case with Bitcoin.      Bitcoin’s innovation permits an ensuing wave of similarly trustless monies to foster and grow: stablecoins, initial coin offerings as well as unexpected assets, like CryptoKitties, they point out. But they also argue that none of those are new forms of money either.      “It is more accurate to think of Bitcoin as a new type of exchange mechanism that can support the transfer of monies as well as other things,” they said.      Carter agrees Bitcoin gave the world a new way to move money, challenged the authors' assertion the Bitcoin blockchain should harbor other assets and said it was impossible to divorce bitcoin’s monied nature from the mechanism it exists upon.      “The monetary qualities are also essential. That was clear in the way Satoshi described” its limited supply, he said.      The economists concluded it's important to define what is actually new about bitcoin for historical reasons.      “History provides lessons about what makes a good money as well as what makes a good transfer mechanism,” they wrote. “These lessons could help cryptocurrencies evolve in a way that makes them more useful.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/19/new-york-feds-bitcoin-is-just-another-fiat-claim-sparks-controversy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/481064cb04c76087d2725e795338a124802cb8d4-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404717,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkQxg,1592594913,DeFi Startups Built on Compound Weigh What to Do With $200 COMP Tokens,"The token for the decentralized finance (DeFi) app Compound, COMP, hit an all-time high of $231 on Friday. Now startups built on top of the lending protocol are considering what to do about this sudden windfall.      Compound was built from the beginning as a simple marketplace for placing collateral and borrowing money. The intention was always to make it easy for other companies to build products atop it, and several have.      But some startups are in a situation where they have control of COMP earned from funds entrusted to them by their customers. The question then becomes: Do they return that COMP to users immediately or use it to lock in other benefits? And if they do redistribute it now, do they simply give users COMP or convert it first to a more familiar form of crypto?      CoinDesk checked in with companies built on top of the Ethereum-based application this week to find out their plans for using the fresh COMP tokens earned by users of their platforms.      While the startups we spoke with were still exploring which course of action would be best, they generally agreed COMP's rapid ascent is a positive moment for the DeFi industry.      Read more: A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand      Dharma CEO Nadav Hollander explained the implications of opening up governance of Compound for a company like his. In an email to CoinDesk, he wrote, ""It's like being a bank and getting to vote at Federal Reserve meetings – only any user of the protocol can do it.""      In fact, Dharma has already been actively taking part. It has a proposal in now to increase the amount of interest earned on tether (USDT) deposits on Compound. Such deposits go into the reserve pool, a sort of security blanket that each liquidity pool creates for itself. As a governance token, COMP is used to stake a person's or entity's vote, either for or against.      According to DeFi Pulse, Compound's total value locked (TVL) now stands at $418 million, $80 million short of overtaking MakerDAO, the dominant protocol in DeFi. Compound has added over $300 million in liquidity since COMP distribution began on June 15.      The COMP token is trading at $218 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko, for a market cap – separate from the Compound protocol's TVL – of roughly $570 million. The market cap of Maker's governance token, MKR, currently sits at $466 million.    Dharma    Meanwhile, Dharma is still sorting out how to handle COMP that its users are earning.      Dharma is a smart-wallet app that lets users deposit dai to earn interest easily. It also allows them to easily pay each other in dai, much like Venmo. While dai has not been the most popular asset on Compound lately (USDC and USDT have), each depositor and borrower on Dharma still earns some COMP each day as it gets distributed.      Read more: Crypto Lender Dharma Pivots to Stablecoin Savings Accounts      Dharma's COO has spoken about the options that Dharma is considering on Twitter. It is considering holding onto the COMP for now so that Dharma can be a stronger voter in governance, but it may also directly distribute the COMP to users or convert it to dai and then distribute it.      Forster tweeted, ""We've been discussing this internally and in our Discord channel. Haven't reached a conclusion yet.""    PoolTogether    PoolTogether is a lossless lottery. Users deposit their funds with PoolTogether in order to win a chance at winning all the interest earned by everyone else who did the same.      PoolTogether has a weekly dai pool and a daily USDC pool, but their returns have been hammered by the way liquidity mining has changed the market.      ""PoolTogether contracts are earning COMP and currently, the value of that COMP is actually greater than the value of the interest accruing to the prizes!,"" Leighton Cusack, the founder, told CoinDesk in an email. ""However, when we designed the protocol we did not have COMP in mind so there is not a mechanism right now to re-distribute it to depositors or include it in the prize.""      Read more: Coinbase Pumps $1.1M USDC Into DeFi Sites Uniswap and PoolTogether      Cusack let his community know that this was a question under consideration the week before COMP started to be distributed.      Like Dharma, it's considering holding onto COMP so it can vote the tokens in the interest of PoolTogether users. That said, Cusack also wrote, ""The most likely scenario though is that we'll include the accrued COMP in the prize distribution. So longer-term this will be great for users as the value of the COMP will supercharge the prize size.""    Staked    Staked is a startup that takes care of the hard part if users have a token on which they can earn a yield. It even has a product that will move assets around to optimize their income, called RAY, for Robo Advisor for Yield.      Staked CEO Tim Ogilvie told CoinDesk, ""Any COMP earned is distributed to depositors. Next week we're going to update our algorithm so the yield attributable to Compound includes both interest and the value of the COMP earned.""    Linen and Argent    Linen and Argent are both wallet applications that make it easy to move assets into Compound and earn interest. Because all deposits in Compound are tokenized, this is simple to do in a non-custodial fashion; if your wallet can hold USDC it should be able to hold cUSDC (the tokenized version of a deposit of USDC on Compound).      Argent posted on its blog Wednesday that its users would be able to keep track of COMP earnings right in their wallet and use it like any other token.      Read more: Paradigm Leads $12M Round for DeFi-Friendly Wallet Startup      Linen founder and CEO Vitaly Bahachuk told CoinDesk via email that it would do the same. He wrote, ""Linen app is powered by a user self-custody wallet and Linen does not have access to members' assets including access to COMP. We will build an in-app interface where our members can claim their COMP and use COMP however they chose to.""      One choice they might make, HODL the COMP and delegate to Linen to vote their interests. Linen has declared itself as a delegate for voting on Compound protocol questions.    Opyn    Opyn has also declared itself as a Compound delegate.      The company built a decentralized protocol for hedging risk on ERC-20 tokens. While using Opyn itself does not create a way that users would earn COMP, its application may be more valuable in a highly volatile market like the one created by COMP's release into the wild.      Read more: Options Protocol Brings ‘Insurance’ to DeFi Deposits on Compound      When Opyn creates a hedge, it also tokenizes it. So if a user buys a hedge against ETH dropping they get oETH. With so many users converting USDT into Compound deposit tokens, cUSDT, the ever-lingering concerns about tether have become salient to Opyn's community.      ""We've seen user demand for ocUSDT (protection on USDT deposits in Compound) as lots of DeFi users have been attracted to the COMP incentives for USDT,"" Opyn co-founder Alexis Gauba told CoinDesk.      With the price of COMP going so high so suddenly, there has been discussion on Twitter of creating a hedge for the governance token.      Gauba wrote, ""The Opyn team does currently have plans for an oCOMP token, however, the protocol is completely open and supports options on any arbitrary ERC-20 token, so anyone could create an oCOMP token!""",POSITIVE,COMP | USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | FIAT | USDT | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/19/defi-startups-built-on-compound-weigh-what-to-do-with-200-comp-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b54f5b76cdfb4accdb28449285f1de70cd243c0c-1900x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR2b,1592594558,Tether's Supply on Compound Jumps to Over $224M in a Week,"Tether's volume on decentralized lender platform Compound has soared as traders try to maximize the amount of COMP they receive.      Data from Compound shows the supply of the USD-backed stablecoin has quadrupled from roughly $43.7 million at the start of the week, to over $224 million on Friday. This time last week, USDT supply had just about crossed the million-dollar mark.      With 2,000 suppliers (lenders) and just over 400 borrowers, USDT one of the largest and most active lending markets on the Compound protocol. For comparison, the supply for USDC, another stablecoin, is currently just under the $170 million mark – although the number of lenders is far higher at over 5,500.      “USDt’s growth on Compound has been faster than the growth of any other asset in the protocol, by multiples,” said Calvin Liu, Compound's strategy lead, in a statement.      See also: A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand      This bookends a rather manic week for Compound. Total value locked (TVL) has been on a near-vertical trajectory since the release of its new governance token, COMP, on Monday – it broke past the $100 million boundary on the same day, for the first time.      At the time of writing, TVL stood at just under $400 million, according to data site DeFi pulse.      One of the reasons for Compound's soaring popularity this week might be that users are trying to receive as much COMP tokens as they can. The platform rewards all activity with COMP, so both lenders and borrowers are directly incentivized to use the platform as much as possible.      This incentive has created a feeding frenzy as COMP soars in price. The token price has more than doubled in the past 24 hours to $200. The rise has been so rapid that aggregation sites are flashing different numbers for market value. At press time, DeFi Market Cap gave Compound a market cap of $1.9 billion, whereas CoinGecko had gone for a more conservative $500 million.      Automated market maker Curv told CoinDesk earlier this week that it was seeing users depositing USDC as collateral to borrow USDT and using that borrowed USDT as a deposit for borrowing the USDC back again. Some users repeat this process up to 30 times – the maximum leverage on Compound – which they use to maximize their COMP allocation.      See also: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home      CoinDesk asked Tether whether it thought the surge in USDT supply on Compound could be users trying to game the system.

42404720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkQze,1592593033,"Ex-Kraken Trading Head Leads Crypto Quant Fund With $23M in Assets, $2.3B in Trades","A little-known virtual currency fund heavy on math and statistics is turning a steady profit under a lead trader who once oversaw a major cryptocurrency exchange.      Galois Capital, a San Francisco cryptocurrency hedge fund that launched in January 2018, said in an investor letter and financial filings that it increased its holdings from $10 million to $23 million in two years with high-frequency trading and funds from new investors lured by returns.      A quantitative fund manager, Galois Capital computationally makes bulk volumes of speedy, precise trades shaped by its founder and lead trader Kevin Zhou, previously head of trading at American cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, and a team of technical talent.      “Most of us are math, physics or computer science folks,” Zhou told CoinDesk, adding that highly sought International Mathematical Olympiad competitors have been sending in their resumes.    Quant competition    Quantitative approaches to trading are wide-ranging. They might encompass regression modeling, direction and magnitude calculations for price prediction or stochastic processes for volatility modeling and options pricing, Zhou said. On the technology side, programming interfaces, trading software and hardware equipment enabling fast communications and data analysis with exchanges are used.      Galois Capital built much of this architecture from the ground up, with custom tools such as co-located servers and network adapters, due to what Zhou cites as a dearth of heavy-duty options for cryptocurrency traders found at Hudson River Trading and Jane Street Capital, two of the biggest Wall Street quantitative trading funds.      Read more: Hedge Fund Pioneer Turns Bullish on Bitcoin Amid 'Unprecedented' Monetary Inflation      Still, the quantitative bent is relatively tame at Galois Capital. For Zhou, sophisticated trading models and technologies, such as the machine learning software the fund experimented with and shelved, are sometimes overkill in this era of cryptocurrency markets.      “What works is a lot simpler than what would work in traditional markets,” said Zhou. “Some of these models that we have right now would not work in traditional markets, in more mature and more efficient markets.”      But that isn’t to say the field hasn’t gotten more competitive since 2013 to 2015 when he managed Buttercoin, a bygone bitcoin exchange backed by Silicon Valley-located startup incubators Google Ventures and Y Combinator, and from 2015 to 2017 the trading desk at Kraken.      At Buttercoin, “the sizes of transactions were a lot smaller. The spreads were a lot bigger. I remember there were days where you were getting 100 bps [basis points] just trading $100,000,” said Zhou. “At Kraken, spreads tightened up a bit. It was like 40, 50 bps on $200,000. Now, it’s a lot tighter, probably a million dollars gets 10, 15 bps.” A spread is the difference between a financial instrument’s bid and ask price; a “bp” (pronounced “bip”), or a basis point, reflects a 0.01% change in a financial instrument’s value.      Considering Kraken is valued at $4 billion and processes millions of dollars in cryptocurrency flows each month, the trading desk was an all-seeing looking glass into why cryptocurrencies are bought and sold in a large corner of the market. It gave Zhou a knack for sizing up counterparty motivations with Galois Capital’s programmed trades, where the other trading actor is faceless.      “When you’re market-making with bots on all these different exchanges, you don’t actually get matched up with on the other side,” Zhou said. At Kraken, his trading desk dealt with miners and investors, up close and personal, who gave context into their market movements. “So just being able to read Kraken’s book,” as in the exchange’s record of buy and sale orders, “is definitely informative.”    Market-making as a “safer” line of business    In terms of trading volume, Galois Capital went from processing $671 million to $1.4 billion between 2018 and 2019, the investor letter says. While non-algorithmic trades shrunk from $666 million to $562 million, its algorithmic trades blew up from $5 million to $876 million to enlarge the fund’s share in crypto-asset markets.      According to Zhou, about 85% of Galois operations are geared towards liquidity provision, matching crypto-assets at prices quoted by bidders, similar to services offered by Genesis Trading, Cumberland DRW and Circle. The other 15% of operations are focused on hedge fund management of cryptocurrency plays. Galois Capital started with over-the-counter (OTC) trading – manual liquidity provision and Zhou’s specialty at Kraken – and branched out into algorithmic market-making – automated liquidity provision – and discretionary trading.    With market-making, generally you don’t want to be holding onto risk for that long. What I mean by that is more than 30 seconds.    “Liquidity provision in the traditional markets is handled by prop shops rather than hedge funds. So we’re in kind of a unique situation in that most crypto funds are long only in these different tokens, or they’re long-short and look at factors like trying to detect momentum signals and reverse signals,” Zhou said.      “I want to be able to generate profits regardless if the market’s moving up or down, regardless if there’s momentum or reversion, just based on the micro-structure of the market, just based on providing compensation for providing liquidity to the market,” Zhou said. “To me, that seems a lot safer and generally, as a trader, I’m more conservative.”    Long-short, but for the short term    Galois’ hedge fund wing, which emphasizes derivatives, quantitative long-short and discretionary long-short trades, as of January 2020 netted to-date 29.5% for a Class A fund and 53.5% for a Class B fund. (The funds charge different fees on investment subscriptions, which begin at $50,000 an investor.) The two-year returns outdid several benchmarks over the corresponding period, such as a 20.8% S&P 500 gain, a 46.6% bitcoin loss, a 32.6% cryptocurrency hedge fund loss and a 4.6% non-cryptocurrency hedge fund gain, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index and Eurekahedge return indices.      The Class A fund was, however, more volatile than the Class B fund: According to the investor letter, the Class A fund tumbled 22.4% in 2018 and spiked 66.8% in 2019; the Class B fund ticked up 33.9% in 2018 and 19.3% in 2019.      “We don’t really have that much of a long-term portfolio that holds the large positions longer. For us, a lot of this is just very short-term inventory balances,” Zhou said to CoinDesk. “With market-making, generally you don’t want to be holding onto risk for that long. What I mean by that is more than 30 seconds. So we’re usually flat on that exposure at any given time. And then, for very short periods of time, we’ll have short exposure in a number of different coins, but we’ll hedge that off very quickly.”      Read more: Mutual Fund Giant Vanguard Wraps Phase 1 of Digital Asset-Backed Securities Pilot      Galois Capital opened cryptocurrency futures and swaps in April 2019 and long-short trades in August 2019 to more cheaply hedge spot exposure and arbitrage price disparities with derivatives, the investor letter says. It will also initiate cryptocurrency options trades on the Deribit exchange in the fourth quarter of this year, but the plans are tentative to exercise caution over low and therefore risky options volume. Deribit alone trades less than $50 million a day.      Galois Capital has done some notable long-short trades, such as going long bitcoin at $3,750 in December 2018 and buying the FTX crypto-derivatives exchange’s FTT coin at $0.10 in April 2019, according to the letter.      The firm took the optimistic bitcoin position at a market low on the view that industry-wide hedge fund investment redemptions had subsided, that a crash in initial coin offerings – virtual currency investment structures highly correlated to bitcoin – had bottomed out and that legal measures surrounding Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings had abated bitcoin selling pressure.      And, due to a close relationship with FTX’s investor Alameda Research, Galois Capital saw FTT as undervalued at the time of its investment. The coin sale was “very rushed and did not tap all of the available capital” despite “a surplus of demand on the sidelines,” the investor letter says. Galois Capital exited the FTT long position at a price between $0.80 and $1.94 while retaining some holdings of the coin.      In the coming year, Galois Capital will trade against its own market-maker, combining its liquidity and hedge fund services. Borrowed from traditional prop trading shops Two Sigma, Jump Trading and Tower Research, the strategy is aimed at improving long-short trading efficiency. According to the letter, Galois long-short traders have accidentally taken opposite positions and strive to trade independently without confusing each other’s profits and losses.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ada Hui,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/19/ex-kraken-trading-head-leads-crypto-quant-fund-with-23m-in-assets-23b-in-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a92eb30d4cac14ee2df622705c96ae9dd204cee-942x736.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404723,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR4Z,1592591816,The Queens Politician Who Wants to Give New Yorkers Their Own Crypto,"Assemblyperson Ron Kim wants his constituents to be self-sovereign. The trouble is, his constituents don’t know what that means.      A member of the New York State Assembly representing District 40 as part of the Democrat and Working Families parties, Kim has been a fierce advocate for progressive politics and a surprising voice for crypto advocacy.      Over the course of his seven-year stint in office, Kim has put forward bills to create local currencies (potentially blockchain based) as well as, recently, a decentralized standard for contact tracing. Kim’s political imagination aligns with the crypto-community. He wants to decentralize power structures and provide technological pathways towards individual autonomy.      “It all boils down to getting people their self-sovereign IDs,” Kim said. “The options that grow out of that are limitless.” This includes establishing a streamlined architecture to pay out public benefits — including COVID-19 relief payments — rebuilding a crumbling public health infrastructure as well as establishing a statewide digital banking system.      See also: Meet the US Senate Candidate Who’s Invested in Bitcoin Since 2013      “I tried a few years ago to talk about the concept of community currencies, which I thought was an introductory concept,” Kim said. “But I realized early on that if you talk about currency as an Asian man, or cryptocurrencies, people’s flags go up.”      “So I pivoted to focus on economic failures and personalizing it by discussing credit card debt, student debt, mortgages, to expose why our market economy is failing us,” he said.      In conversation with CoinDesk, Kim, a measured speaker, framed his technocratic dreams in opposition to the profit-driven systems currently in place. From big banks to big tech, monopolistic firms “extract” value from communities and encroach on individual civil liberties.      COVID-19 both highlights and accelerates these issues, and is the impetus for Kim to double down on a series of public blockchain initiatives.      In mid-May, Kim introduced Assembly Bill A10462, which lays out a decentralized and privacy-preserving protocol for contact tracing. Citing the over-reliance on “Big Tech” firms like Google and Apple to mediate a public health crisis, Kim argues providing them access to de-anonymized biometric data.      In early June, together with Sen. Julia Salazar (18th Senate District) and Cornell law professor Robert Hockett, Kim proposed a digital payment platform and cryptocurrency for the state. Colloquially known as a “public Venmo” option and officially as the Inclusive Value Ledger (IVL), Kim wants to build a peer-to-peer savings and payments platform to encourage local spending.      This is a moonshot as far as local politics goes, but many discounted the idea of universal basic income and digital dollars, too, and both are gaining mainstream acceptance. (For what it's worth, Kim has UBI and crypto-booster Andrew Yang's endorsement.)      “The system would allow public benefits to be used like real money,” Kim said. “Benefits are so rigid [right now] they go unused and untapped. The IVL would make it fungible and fluid to add value flow to economies. It’s an entry point to public banking.”    I realized early on that if you talk about currency as an Asian man, or cryptocurrencies, people’s flags go up.    According to the plan, $55 billion per year in uncollected individual tax credits, pension benefits, and other welfare payouts will be distributed to every New York resident through a virtual wallet system administered by the state.      Recipients would be able to pay for goods and services, and also to transfer money directly to each other through a fee-less, instantaneous payment rail.      Further, Kim said the system could be used in crisis. “If we had a flexible payment system like IVL, all my constituents who are still waiting for their stimulus and unemployment checks, for months, could get airdropped their payments immediately, with the proper attestation protocols in place.”      Asked whether innovative fintech firms could fill in more effectively, Kim responded that “trojan horses” like Square appear to work for the public good but are ultimately extractive. “They have to make money somehow, so we’re losing value whenever the people transact,” he said.      Kim, Salazar and Hockett are not completely alone in their vision. For instance, the small Washington State town of Tenino (population: 1,884) is considering issuing a local currency printed on thin sheets of wood, to bolster an economy wrecked by the COVID-19 pandemic, and various local currencies operate around the country, including the Current in New York’s Hudson Valley.      But the IVL is significantly larger in scope. Defining the “local community” as the entire state of New York, the project would become the largest experiment in “complementary currencies” since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913.      See also: The Post-Trust Election: CoinDesk Hits the 2020 Campaign Trail      But it’s a vision Kim has been chasing since at least 2018, when he proposed a series of local currencies to be distributed among pockets of New York, including his native Flushing, Queens. Pitching it as a way to become resilient to economic downturns by keeping value circling within an economy, Kim said the idea was favorably received by younger people.      Also, the primarily Asian-American area is already predisposed to electronic payments. “If we were to apply this pilot in a place like Flushing, it would be easier to transition into because people are used to QR codes,” he said at the time. “There’s a culture that’s used to going cashless that’s already ingrained in our community.”      Now, facing reelection in a primary set for June 23, the populist legislator is doubling down on the idea of self-sovereignty. It’s not a concept that most voters are familiar with, but Kim says he’s introducing the concept in terms people can come to understand.      “We’ve bought into the idea that bigger is better, so we approve every merger and help Amazon become vertically integrated into every market sector with tax abatements,” Kim said. With public options, “you can have a menu of different things, as long as it’s an open and competitive market.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/19/the-queens-politician-who-wants-to-give-new-yorkers-their-own-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b278a0db92c0b07f1e858a7df60df12effa998d1-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC announced Friday it had filed a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Sean and Shane Hvizdzak and their corporate entities, alleging the brothers stole millions from victims who thought they were investing in high-growth crypto opportunities.      Investors had been told they were getting in on a high-growth fund that doubled its money in a single quarter and grew an additional 90% the next, according to the SEC. The Hvizdzaks ran multiple firms, including ""Hvizdzak Capital Management"" (HCM), ""High Street Capital"" (HSC) and a fund, High Street Capital Fund USA, LP.      According to the SEC, the Hvizdzaks have moved nearly $26 million into personal accounts from the $31 million the investment firm HCM has held since 2019. They alleged that bank records document at least $3 million in misappropriations and suggest millions more.      A court filing claims the two used their personal Gemini accounts to convert dollars to digital asset equivalents, with these funds being transferred ""to various custodians and trading platforms including platforms outside the [U.S.] and to unattributed addresses on multiple blockchains.""

42404727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR9U,1592585173,Money Reimagined: Ethereum’s Renaissance Creates an Opportunity – And a Major Test,"If, in the compressed time of blockchain existence, the “crypto winter” of 2018-2019 was Ethereum’s Dark Ages, then we’re now in its Renaissance.      But it’s an open question whether the blockchain platform and its enthusiastic community can take the wider world into the next era: the decentralized equivalent of the industrial revolution.      As Ethereum prepares to celebrate the five-year anniversary of its mainnet launch on July 31, billions of dollars in value rest on that question. Specifically, on whether the all-important Ethereum 2.0 scaling project can be successfully launched and integrated into its existing architecture.      By most measures, the Ethereum ecosystem is undergoing an impressive growth spurt. Record-breaking “gas” usage for smart contract and payment executions has now put Ethereum’s daily transaction fees totals above those of bitcoin. A strong rally in the price of ether (ETH) means Ethereum’s native token is among just a few leading cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Cardano’s ADA and Stellar’s XLM, to have more or less shaken off the sharp crypto selloff seen in March. And the amount of second-tier value locked into Ethereum smart contracts is ballooning, with total daily value transfers on Ethereum reaching that of Bitcoin in April.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      The growth is found in a variety of Ethereum-based applications.      Take decentralized finance, for starters. With the locked value in DeFi applications now above $1 billion, there’s an increasing array of products servicing this burgeoning ecosystem. This week, we learned of the successful launch of decentralized lender Compound’s new COMP token and that Nexus Mutual, a decentralized insurance provider to protect users against smart contract breaches, saw its pooled funds double to more than $4 million over the past 90 days.      There’s been similar growth in Ethereum-based stablecoins. This is dominated by dollar-pegged token Tether, which is widely used as a settlement and clearing mechanism by cryptocurrency exchanges and has seen spectacular issuance this year. As we reported in Money Reimagined two weeks ago, nascent demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins such as USDC is emerging in dollar-starved developing countries, where it’s being used for remittances and day-to-day payments.      Apart from these financial use cases, there are also healthy growth indicators in the software development economy that has arisen around Ethereum. For instance, the worldwide community of developers tapping into bug bounties and other projects funded through Gitcoin, an Ethereum-focused marketplace for open-source engineering work, has grown to almost 40,000.      According to analysis by Glassnode, the majority of ether transactions are now used to pay for a variety of smart contact commands rather than simple monetary exchanges between so-called externally owned accounts. That, along with a reduction in large-scale “whale” ether accounts, suggests transactions on Ethereum are now more connected to utility than to speculative activity.    The scaling imperative    These are encouraging signals. They reflect growing confidence the initial coin offering (ICO) bust is in the rearview mirror and that concerns about smart contract insecurity are diminishing.      But if the Ethereum community is to achieve its sweeping goal to create a decentralized economic system, it must function at scale. All hinges on Ethereum 2.0.      The two core components of the phased 2.0 transition are incredibly difficult to engineer for a decentralized system of this breadth: a foundational shift from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake blockchain, and an ambitious “sharding” effort to dramatically accelerate transaction processing.      These steps must happen in a phased way.      The development work first entails integrating a new proof-of-stake blockchain known as Beacon, and its related software clients into the legacy proof-of-work blockchain. With no corporate organizational structure to direct commands, all work is conducted by a giant, decentralized, hard-to-coordinate team, with armies of developers in far-flung parts of the globe earning bounties to detect bugs in the system’s sprawling codebase. That’s difficult.      And the importance of getting this right is underscored by Ethereum’s history. On numerous occasions malicious attackers have exploited smart contract loopholes and other security vulnerabilities to steal millions of dollars, most famously in 2016 with the $60 million DAO attack, more recently in the $25 million loss at DeFi protocol dForce.      For all those reasons, Ethereum developers can be excused for the long delays in rolling out 2.0. But they’ll eventually need to flip the switch and start the initial Beacon implementation because, at some point, delays themselves can eat into confidence among participants.      For now, Ethereum 2.0 appears to be enjoying an optimism lift.      Codefi, a financial services platform based at influential Ethereum development lab ConsenSys, this week announced it would pilot a new staking-as-a-service ether product backed by cryptocurrency heavyweights Binance, Huobi Wallet, Matrixport, Crypto.com, DARMA Capital and Trustology. Such services act on behalf of holders of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies to stake them for block rewards. In effect, it turns cryptocurrency custodial holdings into quasi interest-bearing accounts. Needless to say, the service will only work if and when Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake.      During CoinDesk’s Consensus Distributed conference last month, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin retracted an earlier comment that Ethereum 2.0 was likely to launch in July. However, he did indicate all the pieces are falling into place for a more scalable, private system to come online soon.    A tiny pond fight    Despite all this progress, the Ethereum economy is still just a tiny dot within the $88 trillion global economy. If it is to change the world, scalability and adoption need to happen.      And because the opportunity is so large compared to its current footprint, there’s no guarantee Ethereum becomes the standard, despite its early lead on other blockchains.      Charles Hoskinson, founder of competing blockchain Cardano, told Ryan Selkis of Messari on Thursday that Ethereum’s claim to have gained unbeatable “network effects” is the “biggest lie ever told in this space.” Ethereum calling itself “the dominant platform” is “like saying you’re the biggest fish in a tiny pond right next to the ocean,” he said.      Hoskinson argues Cardano’s moves in developing countries will let it seize the pole position in a part of the world likely to leapfrog the industrialized world with decentralized technology. But to suggest Ethereum doesn’t have a head start and an advantage is naive. The breadth of developer and transaction activity generates real-world value in a self-fulfilling expansion, as it unlocks funds for Ethereum protocol and dapp developers to do yet more work on new solutions and to bring even more participants into the ecosystem.      Even if it doesn’t win, no one, not even the most hardened bitcoin maximalist, can deny the Ethereum community has fostered some powerful, outside-the-box, innovative ideas for a future economy. It’s these kinds of ideas that will shape the Web 3.0 world to come.    Bitcoin, tech stock    Last week, we, among other outlets, remarked on bitcoin’s closer correlation with U.S. stocks. Both the rally to a four-month high near $10,000 and the subsequent drop last week coincided with similar movements in broad indexes such as the S&P 500. It raised the question: Is bitcoin now solely to be lumped into a broad category of “risk assets?”      But here’s another, more pointed question: Why is bitcoin behaving like an internet network platform? Charlie Morris of ByteTree noted a remarkable correlation between the price of BTC and the NYSE’s FANG+ index. That index’s eight component stocks include six internet juggernauts – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Twitter, Alibaba and Baidu – alongside electric carmaker Tesla and GPU provider Nvidia. Its performance is very much tied to the social network connectivity and data aggregation benefits that the internet has delivered to those dominant platforms. Here’s a chart of bitcoin’s performance against that index.      The relationship has not always been there. As this chart shows, the NYSE FANG+ index and bitcoin were showing essentially zero correlation before March.      What is this telling us? Well, first, remember the golden rule: Correlation is not causation. But it’s nonetheless tempting to speculate that in the COVID-19 work-from-home era, cryptocurrencies are being viewed as part of a suite of technologies enabling a decentralized, online economy.    The Global Town Hall    NOT JUST CRYPTO. If it’s frustrating for crypto traders to find that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can’t perform on their own terms at the moment, maybe they’ll take some comfort from the fact they are not alone. Foreign exchange traders are also finding currencies behaving as if their value is dependent on stocks. As Eva Szalay at the Financial Times reports, currencies such as the Australian dollar and the British pound, whose fate is normally directly determined by macroeconomic conditions, are now caught in the same “risk-on/risk-off” trading whims of the stock market. It’s yet another way in which the Federal Reserve’s massive monetary stimulus efforts during the COVID-19 crisis are distorting the functioning of our financial system. Like a broken record, let’s say it again: To protect the fabric of our economies and societies, we need a new system for spurring economic activity, one that doesn’t skew it toward the interests of hedge funds and instead encourages innovation and gets resources to those who most need it. Wall Street-centric solutions aren’t working.      DON’T LISTEN TO TINA. The history of financial crises shows the most dangerous assumption in investing is that a particular bet is a sure thing. (Think of the flawed pre-2008 notion that housing prices always go up.) The same goes for the assumption the U.S. dollar will always be propped up by the demand of foreign governments, companies and financial institutions, which need it as a reserve asset or as a trade-intermediating instrument.      Economist Stephen Roach, formerly chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now a professor at Yale, is taking it upon himself to warn against that assumption. He’s predicting a 35% plunge in the value of the dollar against its trading partners’ currencies, telling CNBC it will “fall very, very sharply.” A move like that would have far-reaching fallout in a global economy where assets and liabilities are heavily dollarized, which is one reason critics of dollar bears like Roach say it won’t happen: because there’s too much at stake. In a supporting column for Bloomberg, Roach called this pro-dollar argument the TINA case – for ""there is no alternative"" – and he warned of its complacency. With the U.S. now acting against globalization and running dangerously high debt levels, the reasons for foreigners to lose faith in the dollar are rising, he wrote. No mention of the role that cryptocurrencies or stablecoins might play in this, but it’s a reminder the existing framework for the dollar-dominated global economy is ripe for newly imagined form of money.      TRANSPARENCY PLAY. Latin America is proving to be a fairly receptive place for blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions — including among governments. A big part of that stems from the proactive work of the Inter-American Development Bank, which has launched a variety of pilots and experiments in the region. In April, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen reported on a project led by an IDB-sponsored project led by startup Emerge to improve health record keeping amid the COVID-19 crisis. Now, it’s partnering with the World Economic Forum to work with the Colombian government on a blockchain project aimed at adding transparency to official procurement and curtailing corruption. Just a proof-of-concept at this stage, but at a time when other developing nations are facing a crisis of trust in their governments, which undermines faith in their currencies, innovative efforts to boost trust could pay dividends.

42404726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR6X,1592583338,"Blockchain Bites: COMP x2, Reddit Scales and Factom Goes Bankrupt","The COMP governance token is seeing massive gains (increasing more than 270% day over day, according to CoinDesk's First Mover team), as well as potential listings on Coinbase Pro and CoinFlip, a crypto ATM network.      This wild, retail-driven speculation is also driving value into Compound's smart contract. With $395 million locked up, Compound is gunning for the position of DeFi king, long occupied by the MakerDAO protocol. By another metric, COMP has already surpassed MKR in fully-diluted value, according to DeFi Marketcap.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      What this points to is a possible sea change in the DeFi lending standard. Compound is a lending protocol that allows users to leverage deposits and algorithmically sets interest rates based on demand. COMP, the protocol's governance token, will let holders vote on development decisions, including which types of collateral to accept.      Only launched Monday, with about 10,000 of the 4.2 million tokens set aside for community members in circulation, it's impossible to gauge what comes next. To put it in Mythos Capital Founder Ryan Sean Adams' words, ""Stocks drunk. DeFi sober. I wrote that Monday. I jinxed us. Cause DeFi's drunk now too.""    Top shelf    DeFi Darling DeFi has been completely overtaken by Compound this week. As long as the token’s price remains above $100, the effective market cap of COMP, the new governance token, is more than $1 billion, though many of the tokens are illiquid. It’s hard to predict what will happen – as only approximately 10,000 of the 4.2 million tokens set aside for community members have been released, though here are a few staggering data points:    Coinbase Pro announced Thursday it will list COMP next week, after investing in Compound's $8.2 million seed round in 2018.  More than 10% of the total supply of USDC, the stablecoin created by Circle and Coinbase, is currently locked on Compound.  The total amount of tether (USDT) on Compound is up almost 8,000% since June 11.  FTX and FTX US will both list COMP as well as cUSDT, the Compound version of tether.    Ethereum's Progress: Reddit and Hard Forks Reddit announced a partnership with the Ethereum Foundation to find a Layer 2 scaling technique for its Ethereum-based “Community Points” system, which may expand to the site’s 430 million users. These tokens are earned by garnering “upvotes” on posts and can be used to purchase specialized GIFs or emojis. While ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups are product-ready L2s, they are targeted for exchanges. “Many of these designs don’t take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant,” Reddit states. “Community Points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with on-boarding new users.” Applicants are asked to submit proofs-of-concept by July 31 with reviews concluded by September.      Ethereum’s consensus algorithm is not the only thing changing with the launch of Eth 2.0. The underlying cryptography itself is getting an overhaul based on leading research out of the Electric Coin Company. Called BLS12-381, a new elliptic pairing curve will securely coordinate transactions on the proof-of-stake Eth 2.0 network, while opening up opportunities for data savings and privacy-tech solutions. The curve is slated for introduction at Ethereum’s next hardfork, Berlin, slated for July.

The previous decade low of 988 was registered on May 23. “It is a sign of efficient miners continuing to hoard (only selling a proportion of BTC),” said Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital.    Opinion    Censorship or Speech? Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist and co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, sees both sides of the argument over tearing down public statues of ignominious men. As Boris Johnson said, it’s a form of censorship, while the ancient Romans practiced damnatio memoriae, where they would ritualistically deface statues of former leaders. Carlson’s take? “By all means, continue to educate generations to come about these men. Educate generations to come about these statues. And finally, educate generations to come about why some of these statues were defaced or removed. Removing or altering monuments to fit the morals and values of the day is not censorship. It is an act of speech in and of itself.”    Podcast    Its Just My Job, Folks.

The Kin Foundation said in a press release the move to Solana’s blockchain was in response to a growing user base, which was hitting limitations on the Stellar blockchain fork the cryptocurrency is currently built on. According to the firm, the cryptocurrency currently has over 3 million active monthly spenders and has been integrated into 57 different, mostly mobile, applications.      App developers, node operators and the Kin Foundation’s board members (Ted Livingston, who founded the Kik messaging app and is the face of Kin, and William Mougayar, an author who hosts the annual Token Summit conference) voted on the proposal, which was released on Github last month.      “They had already been pushing against the limits of the Stellar fork,” Mougayar said      He said a rise in users meant that the Kin cryptocurrency needs to be able to process more than 100 transactions per second, which is the upper limit on the Stellar fork.      According to Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, the blockchain can handle up to 60,000 transactions per second on its current mainnet.      “In addition to speed, Solana’s natural ability to scale turned out to be a major determining factor in their (Kin’s) decision,” Yakovento told CoinDesk.      This is also not the first time the cryptocurrency has changed blockchains. Launched by Kik in 2017, Kin was originally built on the Ethereum blockchain, but a few months later it announced that it would use Ethereum for security and the Stellar blockchain for transactions. Then in May 2018, Kin announced that it would fork Stellar’s blockchain to create its own.      According to the firm’s emailed statement, as part of the crypto’s transition to Solana, the blockchain firm has also promised to give 1% of all of Solana’s token supply (amounting to $3.5 million) as grants to the Kin Foundation.      Even as Kin continues to expand its user-base, the regulatory troubles it faced in the past have continued to persist.      “Kin is not getting much recognition in the marketplace, unfortunately because of the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] darkcloud,” Mougayar said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | SPONSORED,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/19/kin-community-approves-move-from-stellar-fork-to-solanas-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5292211a3280ec360be128b55692746a208dfc9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkQsl,1592580520,OpenZeppelin Discloses 'High Severity Vulnerability' in DeFi Wallet Argent,"A “high severity vulnerability” was found and patched in Ethereum wallet Argent, according to leading white-hat hackers OpenZeppelin.      Disclosed Friday, OpenZeppelin security researcher Alice Henshaw discovered a vulnerability within Argent that would have allowed user funds to be drained from wallets that did not have Argent’s “guardian” feature.      According to an OpenZepplin blog post and press release, news of the discovery was first shared with Argent on June 12:    “OpenZeppelin’s research revealed an error in the latest version of Argent’s smart contracts that would allow anyone to trigger the wallet recovery process without a signature – on any wallet with zero guardians – as soon as the wallet is upgraded.”    If attacked, users had only 36 hours to prevent drainage of wallet funds. Even then, users could have their funds frozen through a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, OpenZeppelin wrote.      According to Henshaw, the vulnerability stemmed from a March 30 wallet update. OpenZeppelin said 329 wallets with 162 ether (ETH) and undisclosed decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens were at risk. Another 5,513 wallets were vulnerable as well, once they updated to the new Argent software, the blog states.      No Argent funds were affected and a patch has been issued, according to the firm. Henshaw received $25,000 in dai as compensation.      “Only 61 wallets without Guardians and with the affected update were at risk,” Argent spokesman Matthew Wright told CoinDesk. “Our security model meant they had 36 hours to block it by simply tapping ‘Cancel’ in the app. 0 funds were lost.

42404730,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkRBS,1592575721,First Mover: Compound's COMP Token More Than Doubles in Price Amid DeFi Mania,"The speculative fervor surrounding the autonomous lender Compound's new digital token rose another notch Thursday as its already relatively lofty price more than doubled in 24 hours.      The rapid ascent of the COMP ""governance"" token comes as something a surprise given it was released just Monday and is still only trading on a handful of lesser cryptocurrency exchanges.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The token is so new that not even cryptocurrency data sites are using consistent methodologies for deriving COMP’s market value. The website DeFi Market Cap bases the calculation on the 10 million tokens in existence, for a market value of about $2 billion. But CoinGecko bases its figure on a circulating supply of 2.56 million tokens, for a market value of $537 million.      COMP may have gotten an extra jolt Thursday, when the big U.S. exchange Coinbase, which was an early investor in Compound, announced in a blog post that Coinbase Pro accounts could start trading the tokens next week in all supported jurisdictions except New York State.      CoinDesk's Brady Dale reported CoinFlip, which runs a bitcoin ATM network in the U.S., would list the dollar-linked stablecoin USDC on its machines, partly due to COMP-related demand.      The crypto exchange FTX also now plans to list COMP along with a suite of derivatives that will allow traders to make leveraged bets on the token's price, Dale reported.      The apparent runaway success of the token offers a glimpse into just how frenzied the speculation has become over the future of decentralized finance, or DeFi – blockchain-enabled systems, mostly using the Ethereum network, that allow for the lending and trading of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, without the need for trusted intermediaries like banks and centralized exchanges.      ""DeFi is hitting its stride and the space will continue to accelerate,"" the research firm Delphi Digital wrote Wednesday in a report.      Mythos Capital Founder Ryan Sean Adams put it more bluntly on Twitter Thursday, posting an image of the reconfigured DeFi market-cap rankings beneath a succinct remark: ""DeFi's drunk.""      As of Friday, COMP tokens were changing hands at about $230, for a gain of more than 270% in 24 hours, according to market data site CoinGecko.      The COMP digital coins are known as “governance tokens” because they give holders a right to vote on decisions affecting the management of the protocol, such as technical upgrades or whether to incorporate new assets onto the platform. Eventually, according to cryptocurrency research firm Messari, holders might also be able to get a share of fees paid into the system or vote to buy back tokens – similar to stock buybacks.      The 10 million COMP tokens in existence include stakes held by Compund executives and early investors such as Coinbase and the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. COMP's splashy arrival on the DeFi scene means it's now already vying for top slot with Maker's MKR, the next-biggest token in the ecosystem of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Messari puts MKR's market cap at $515 million.      COMP's rally appears to be based on bets on a future shakeup of the competitive landscape, since the Compound protocol still ranks behind Maker in terms of total value locked in DeFi. As of Thursday, some $323 million of value was locked in the Compound protocol, compared with Maker's $494 million.      “For basically all of DeFi, Maker has been the king of DeFi, and it has had the canonical tokens,” FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “One thing the markets are implying right now is that Compound is making a serious run for that crown.”      According to Dale, traders are depositing tokens onto the Compound platform, usually USDC stablecoins, and then borrowing other tokens, such as tether, another dollar-linked stablecoin – to maximize their usage; COMP tokens are awarded daily to users of the system, as an incentive. Traders can then turn around and swap the borrowed tether back into USDC to put into Compound and maximize their COMP earnings.      Even some involved in COMP governance have expressed concerns that the tether market is being manipulated by COMP token harvesters.      ""I wouldn't read too much into the current price,"" Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner of Dragonfly Capital, told Dale in an email.      Even before Compund's release, SesameOpen Co-Founder Henry He had warned that the COMP tokens might get caught up in a speculative cycle.      ""One thing for sure is that the COMP market value will grow way higher than its intrinsic value, and at some point, the COMP market value will start to go down,"" He wrote in a June 6 Medium post. ""Then it will trigger a negative amplifying force. Lower COMP value will reduce incentives, which will cause borrowers and suppliers to leave, which will generate less interests, which will further drive down COMP value.""      As crypto traders know all too well, the amplifying forces can work both ways.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,410 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,460 | 24-Hr Low: $9,236      Trend: Bitcoin's multi-week period of low-volatility consolidation continues amid conflicting signals from the options market.      The one-month put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, has increased to 9.2%, the highest level since May 27, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The positive number indicates that puts (bearish bets) are costlier or drawing higher demand than calls (bullish bets).      Meanwhile, three-month and six-month skews are hovering below zero, a sign calls are more expensive than puts.      The mixed data suggests investors are cautious about bitcoin in short-term, but hold a long-term bullish view, as tweeted by Skew. To put it another way, the options market expects price pullbacks, if any, to be short-lived.      Bitcoin is trading near $9,410 at press time, representing a slight decline on the day. The cryptocurrency, however, has been stuck in a range between $9,000 and $10,000 roughly since the beginning of May.      A high-volume range breakdown could be followed by quick slide to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $8,239. Meanwhile, a break above the range would shift the focus to $10,950 (September 2019 high).

42404718,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR0d,1592574384,The Zcash Privacy Tech Underlying Ethereum’s Transition to Eth 2.0,"Ethereum’s consensus algorithm is not the only thing changing with the launch of Eth 2.0. The underlying cryptography itself is getting an overhaul based on leading research out of the Electric Coin Company.      Called BLS12-381, the new elliptic pairing curve will securely coordinate transactions on the proof-of-stake (PoS) Eth 2.0 network, while opening up opportunities for data savings and privacy-tech solutions.      Currently, the ins and outs of that curve are being baked into the network with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 2537. That EIP is slated for delivery with the protocol’s 10th hard fork, Berlin, tentatively scheduled for July.      As a hard fork, Berlin will add up to four backwards-incompatible upgrades, two of which continue to be vetted and may ultimately not be included (all though that remains unlikely given all four EIPs are being implemented on various levels by each Ethereum client).      A test net, Yolo, conducting dry runs without applications, is currently underway for EIP 2537 and one other proposal, EIP 2315, which will add “simple subroutines” to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).      For Eth 2.0, EIP 2537 is an introduction into the interesting cryptography work underpinning the new network while answering a question Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been pondering since the network’s early days.    From 1.x to 2.0    In order to launch Eth 2.0, a technical bridge must exist between Ethereum’s existing Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0.      BLS12-381 undergirds one such option by building an Eth 2.0 “lite client” inside the current Ethereum network, according to an April Medium article by Ethereum developer Alex Stokes.      In short, Eth 2.0 will roll out in steps, beginning with Phase 0 in Q3 2020. Phase 0 will begin with the beacon chain, a coordination mechanism for investors staking funds. In PoS networks like Tron or EOS, staked funds operate as a voting mechanism and incentive to partake in verifying transactions.      Read more: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0      Eth 1.x operates on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm and has a wholly separate cryptographic schematic called Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), also employed by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.      But in order to bridge the PoW and PoS networks a common tongue is needed.      That’s what EIP 2537 does – by providing a cryptographic translator between the two networks in what is called a precompile of the underlying primitives of Eth 2.0. This precompile makes a lite client possible.      In practice, a lite client would be built as a smart contract inside the EVM. Its main purpose, given the client’s limited functionality, would be to port ether (ETH) over to the new chain, a prerequisite for boarding people onto the new network.      Additionally, Layer 2 (L2) solutions for scaling Ethereum and Eth 2.0 could be built on the lite client, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in an April Ethereum Magicians post.      “If we have that, then an eth2-in-eth1 client is actually not that hard, which opens the door to applications that use eth2 as an availability engine (ie. things like Plasma but waaay more powerful),” Buterin wrote.    Finding the right primitive    The next iteration of Ethereum has far larger ambitions than the ECDSA can handle. Luckily, 10 years of cryptocurrency research has borne fruit in at least one subject: cryptography itself, Cloudflare cryptographer Nick Sullivan said in an interview with CoinDesk. New curves such as BLS12-381 prove as much.      “Elliptic curves have been around since the mid-1980s,” Sullivan said. “The problem is that they’re somewhat limited in what they can do. They can do effectively classical public-key operations: digital signatures, encryption and key agreement.”      Alternatively, “pairing friendly” curves invented in the early 2000s provide alternative security measures that aptly apply to blockchains, Sullivan said.      Invented in 2017, Electric Coin Company cryptographer Sean Bowe’s BLS12-381, a variant of the BLS curve invented by three cryptographic pioneers in 2003, is perhaps the most consequential for most coins today. His curve, and others like it, are the reason blockchains can scale.      “BLS12-381 is a special kind of elliptic curve (a ‘pairing-friendly’ curve) which enables cryptographic primitives like SNARKs and vector commitment schemes,” Bowe said in an email. “These primitives are very useful for improving scalability and privacy in blockchain projects.”    BLS and Eth 2.0    For Eth 2.0, the advantage can be cut into three parts: data savings, privacy and interoperability.      First, BLS-styled signatures keep the necessary computation light by batching cryptographic signatures that verify transactions, according to Ethereum researcher Carl Beekhuizen in an Ethereum Foundation blog post.      Beekhuizen wrote:    “If 10% of all ETH ends up staked, then there will be ~350,000 validators on eth2. This means that an epoch’s worth of signatures would be 33.6 megabytes which comes to ~7.6 gigabytes per day. In this case, all of the false claims about the eth1 state-size reaching 1TB back in 2018 would be true in eth2’s case in fewer than 133 days (based on signatures alone).”    (For reference, that’s equivalent to nearly three times the weight of the current Bitcoin blockchain.)      BLS12-381 also allows Eth 2.0 to implement zero-knowledge proofs more naturally: Privacy variants of ETH could be native to Eth 2.0. In fact, BLS12-381 was hard forked into the Zcash protocol with the 2018 Sapling update as a more robust cryptographic primitive.      Moreover, the use of ECC tech on Ethereum highlights the close relationship between Buterin and Zooko Wilcox, co-founder of Zcash and the CEO of ECC. Both the ECC and Zcash teams have shown past interest in bridging the two technologies.      Read more: Zcash Will Get a Gateway Into Ethereum’s DeFi Ecosystem      Thirdly, the proposal opens up interoperability between different chains such as Filecoin, Chia or Algorand and Eth 2.0, a longstanding promise of multiple other blockchains networks such as Polkadot, which announced the launch of its mainnet earlier this month.      Eth 2.0’s ability to connect with other projects – specifically non-Bitcoin ones – could materialize in a few different ways: Perhaps Ethereum shares its value across different chains or perhaps it siphons tech away from other projects, taking their market caps with it.      Either way, Cloudflare’s Sullivan remains impressed by the math:    “It's a really fascinating curve of how things happen – from the mathematicians and the cryptographers writing about it in academic papers and then people in the engineering world started implementing it and testing it and then it's getting introduced into projects and protocols and then being part of society.

42404725,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR7W,1592573268,Outflow of Bitcoin From Miners at Lows Not Seen Since 2010,"Miner outflows of bitcoin have dropped to decade lows, with analysts suggesting a hoarding mentality is partly responsible.      The seven-day average of the total amount of bitcoin transferred out of miners' addresses declined to 987 on Thursday, hitting the lowest level since Feb. 3, 2010, according to data source Glassnode. The previous decade low of 988 was registered on May 23.      The number of coins being sent by miners to exchanges is also at its lowest point in over a year, as noted by Glassnode in its weekly report.      “It is a sign of efficient miners continuing to hoard (only selling a proportion of BTC),” said Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital.      The increase in miner holding does not necessarily have long-term bullish implications for the cryptocurrency’s price. Miners tend to operate mainly on cash and liquidate their holdings almost on a daily basis to fund operations.      As such, miner hoarding could be termed as temporary deferral of BTC sales, possibly due to fears that the market lacks the strength to absorb the regular amount of supply. Essentially, they may be waiting for the market to show strength and prices to rise before realizing their profits.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Makes Biggest Jump in 29 Months      The market, therefore, could face an above-normal miner supply during the next meaningful price rise. That, in turn, could put the brakes on a price rally.      Hoarding aside, the other main reason for the decline in outflows is the reduction in bitcoin being mined since May’s reward halving, said Ahmad.      Indeed, transfer volume from miner addresses fell from 2,334 BTC to 1,034 BTC in the nine days following the May 11 reward halving, which reduced the per block emission by 50% to 6.25 BTC.      That sharp decline in profitability forced out less inefficient miners, as evidenced by a drop in the seven-day average of the hash rate – the total computing power dedicated to mining blocks on the blockchain. That fell from 120 tera hashes per second (TH/s) to 90 TH/s in the two weeks following halving (though it's since climbed as more efficient machines were switched on).      Forced out miners, however, may return to bitcoin's blockchain if prices rise sharply, making older hardware once again profitable.      Bitcoin is currently trading largely unchanged on the day near $9,370, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      See also: Bitcoin Miner Maker Ebang Estimates $2.5M Loss for Q1 in IPO Prospectus Update      The cryptocurrency has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000 since mid May.

42404715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkQtk,1592571961,Blockchain Company Factom Inc. Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy,"Once the lead proponent and builder of the Factom Protocol, Factom Inc. has been in financial difficulties for some time.      The Austin, Texas-based company has declared voluntary bankruptcy, saying it is currently not in a position to pay as much as $7.5 million in debts. ""It is desirable and in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders to file a voluntary petition for relief,"" reads a submission seen by CoinDesk, filed in Delaware on Thursday.      Alarm bells started ringing in early March when Factom Inc. told investors it faced liquidation unless it received further funding by the end of the month. Although it received some interest, the company's board announced March 31 that it would be wound up after being unable to find a lead investor.      However, Factom Inc. has now opted to go the Chapter 11 route, which allows it to restructure the business and pay creditors over time. The company's board submitted its reorganization proposal with its bankruptcy filing, which will now be evaluated by the administrators.      The company has raised a total of $18 million from investors in a series of funding rounds.      Factom Inc. Chairman David Johnston previously told CoinDesk the company's closure will have no impact on the running of Factom Protocol, a trustless data provenance layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.      See also: London Block Exchange Placed Into Compulsory Liquidation      As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Factom Inc. has publicly declared its balance sheet. Reading through, it's clear the company, which once received a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has been in dire financial straits for some years.      Losses have escalated since Factom Inc. launched in 2013. In the 2016 tax year, the company reported a $2.6 million loss, and another $4.3 million loss the following year. It appears the company tried to cut back after gross losses peaked at nearly $5 million in 2018; losses amounted to $4.8 million in 2019.      Although Factom cut employee wages by just under $390,000 between 2018 and 2019, compensation for company officers appears to have increased by over $260,000, according to the filing. The company also saw a significant $430,000 increase in ""other deductions,"" which includes legal fees.      CoinDesk approached Factom for further comment but had not received a response by press time.

The president of the Bitcoin Association, the entity behind Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), has accused Binance of cherry-picking its relationships with the cryptocurrency project after news came out earlier this week the exchange's new mining pool was now the single biggest verifier on the BSV protocol.      In a statement to CoinDesk, Jimmy Nguyen said it was a ""little too ironic"" that Binance, which delisted BSV from its main exchange in April 2019 and has been critical of the cryptocurrency, still considered BSV economically worthwhile to mine.      See also: Craig Wright Challenges Court Order Criticizing His Evidence in $4B Kleiman Case      ""These actions speak far louder than the words: Binance spoke in April 2019 when it delisted BSV by saying the coin did not meet its supposed “standards.” The truth is BSV does meet Binance’s standards — for generating revenue from BSV when it chooses,"" Nguyen said.      It emerged earlier this week that Binance Pool, which launched at the end of April, had become BSV's biggest miner. On a seven-day moving average, Binance Pool made up just under 20% of the network's total hashrate at press time.      About a year ago, Binance, along with several other exchanges including Kraken and ShapeShift, delisted BSV, in protest over the behavior of Craig Wright, one of BSV's leading advocates, who has claimed, without evidence, to be bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.      Wright had publicly threatened to sue anyone who called him a fraud. In response, many, including Binance CEO Changpeng (""CZ"") Zhao took to Twitter to do just that.      Zhao further called on the BSV community to kick Wright out of its ecosystem: ""Anyone who supports BSV from a tech perspective should be attacking the fraudulent Craig Wright, who is poisoning YOUR community, and not attack the rest of the world.""

Announced Friday, the two entities have also formed a partnership to prepare for the launch of KyberDAO with the intention of increasing adoption of Kyber's on-chain liquidity protocol. KyberDAO is planned as a community platform for the decentralized governance of the network.      Coming at a time when decentralized finance, or DeFi, is booming, the investment from ParaFi was made in the form of an undisclosed direct purchase of Kyber Network Crystals (KNC), the project's native token. Kyber Network is an Ethereum-based protocol that aims to aggregate liquidity and facilitate swaps for ERC-20 standard tokens.      Kyber aims to draw on ParaFi's experience in DeFi as well as the firm's knowledge of investing and market making to build liquidity infrastructure, the Kyber team said.      “ParaFi Capital has been a driving force in the governance and growth of DeFi. With their support and active participation in KyberDAO, we are confident that we can bring Kyber’s role as the liquidity layer for DeFi to the next level,” Kyber CEO Loi Luu said.      See also: Business Is Booming for DeFi Insurer Nexus Mutual Ahead of Ethereum 2.0      The investment firm will also participate in Kyber's governance, or community decision-making, by staking KNC and voting on KyberDAO using its purchased tokens. Kyber said ParaFi will also connect professional market makers to DeFi through Kyber’s liquidity supply system called Fed Price Reserve (FPR).      ParaFi is best known for having received investment capital from billionaire Henry Kravis, co-founder of KKR, in June 2019. It has also had backing from Bain Capital Ventures and Dragonfly Capital Partners. According to Crunchbase, ParaFi previously invested in crypto exchange Coinbase and stablecoin developer MakerDAO.      “We have been working closely with the Kyber team on their crypto-economic re-design and transition to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with Katalyst. Kyber’s growth trajectory and breadth of integrations across the DeFi stack are impressive, as it evolves to become a liquidity protocol for the ecosystem,” said Santiago Roel Santos, partner at ParaFi Capital.      DeFi has been a hot topic in recent days, with the emergence of Compound (COMP). The project which is carving out a sizeable portion of the DeFi market share, placing at the top of the list in terms of total market value. Capitalizing on the buzz, FTX, a crypto derivatives exchange, recently moved to list derivatives based the token just days after it launched.

CoinShares CEO and co-founder Jean-Marie Mognetti, who will run Komainu as well, said in a press release the venture will cater to traditional institutional investors such as banks, pension funds and mutual funds that want to enter the digital asset market.      “Komainu has created the first turnkey solution that establishes the trust required by institutions to gain exposure to digital assets,” said Mognetti.

Komainu’s platform supports 20 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and XRP.
