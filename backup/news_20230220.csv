Inflation's impact on Bitcoin is harder to understand, since Bitcoin is a new and volatile asset class that doesn't fit within traditional valuation models. I'm continuing to hold Bitcoin and don't expect the CPI to be the most important factor in its long-term price appreciation. Thesis Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could be setting up for another bull run, even in the face of a hotter-than-expected January CPI report. So far, there is little evidence to claim that high inflation is bad (or good) for Bitcoin. I instead look to other factors such as the four-year halving cycle and adoption metrics to anticipate Bitcoin's price movement. The CPI Report The January CPI report was released on Tuesday, February 14th. Inflation rose 0.5% month-over-month (0.4% expected), up 6.4% from last year (6.2% expected). Excluding food, energy, and shelter (because who needs those, right?), inflation rose more slowly at 0.2% month over month and 4% year over year. Although inflation is still trending down from recent highs above 8%, it remains very elevated, and this month surprised to the upside. Obviously, high inflation is bad for the average consumer, but what about for investors? FRED Investors have probably heard many times that decreasing inflation is likely to be good for stocks (and arguably cryptocurrency) because it means that the Fed can start lowering rates. As shown in the chart above, the Fed funds rate is often set slightly above the inflation rate. During past periods when the inflation rate spiked and passed the Fed funds rate (namely the 1970s), inflation didn't peak until the Fed funds rate passed it. This chart is somewhat behind, as the current Fed funds rate is 4.5%-4.75%. Although I could attempt to predict that this means the Fed will raise rates to at least 6.4% to match the current inflation rate, it's difficult to say this for sure. After all, inflation is already falling despite the Fed funds rate being lower than the inflation rate, and that didn't happen in the 1970s. I do think it's likely that because inflation increased faster than analysts expected this month, it's also likely that analysts will increase their inflation targets/Fed funds rate targets and decrease their stock price targets in the short term. Despite this, I still believe it's likely that rates will reach their peak this year, regardless of whether that's closer to 5% or 7%. This means that stocks could have reached their bottom already, although nobody can say for sure. (It should also be noted that stocks had a positive return in the 1970s despite high rates/high inflation.) Does CPI Impact The Crypto Forecast? The theoretical correlation between stock prices and the Fed funds rate (and thus the CPI) is well-documented. But will the cryptocurrency market be impacted in the same way? Crypto is barely a decade old, so we can't look back to the 1970s for a historical example of what crypto does during a period of high inflation. Over the past decade, the potential use cases touted for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been quite varied, including: A risk-on asset (inflation is bad) A scarce store of value (inflation is good) A payment method (inflation is arguably good) A new asset class that's not correlated with existing classes (inflation is irrelevant) Despite touting some use cases that would make inflation good for Bitcoin, this hasn't been the case so far. 2022 was the highest inflation year since Bitcoin was created, yet Bitcoin's value was halved from $48K in early 2022 to $24K today. And as the belief that inflation peaked gained popularity this year, Bitcoin started the year off strong after bottoming below $16K. The small amount of history so far certainly implies that inflation is bad for Bitcoin. Google News However, it's dangerous to make such sweeping assumptions from a small amount of data. For example, looking at only one day of data pictured above, one might conclude that hotter-than-expected inflation would be good for Bitcoin and bad for stocks. That's the exact opposite of what one would conclude about Bitcoin in 2022. Overall, Bitcoin's short-term movement following CPI reports has been difficult to predict. There is some evidence that sustained high inflation would be bad for Bitcoin, but not enough evidence to say this conclusively. What Is The Crypto Forecast? Rather than looking at the CPI to determine what Bitcoin's price will do, I prefer to look at other factors that I believe are more relevant. Over the last decade, crypto has been one of the best-performing asset classes, despite facing tests like the COVID-19 crash and the 2018 tech wreck. By many metrics, crypto has been adopted as quickly as the internet, and its use cases have expanded rapidly to include applications like remittances and collectibles. The long-term trend is looking good for crypto. Like past crashes, the recent crash has left some people questioning whether crypto will continue to be adopted rapidly going forward. But unlike previous crashes, this crash hasn't generated many meaningful concerns from a usage perspective. Blockchain.com The above chart shows Bitcoin's hash rate over time. The hash rate in terahash/second (purple line) has steadily increased and is now at its highest value ever. As I've previously written , a higher hash rate corresponds to more mining and better network security. Blockchain.com It's a similar story when it comes to transactions per day, which is arguably a more important metric. The number of transactions per day (purple line) remained steady even as Bitcoin's price crashed early last year, and the value recently spiked to new highs. Why would Bitcoin's price fall despite these strong usage metrics? It's well-documented that since its inception, Bitcoin has rallied going into its halving event and subsequently crashed shortly after the halving completes. With the last halving completed in mid-2020, it appears that Bitcoin once again followed this cycle. While this pattern probably won't hold up forever, investors should hope that Bitcoin once again rallies going into the next halving event in early 2024. I believe that the chances of a rally are higher if usage of the network continues to increase. Admittedly, it's also possible that external factors - including high CPI reports and the stock market selloff that they supposedly caused - partly contributed to Bitcoin's recent price decline. Bitcoin certainly wouldn't be the only high-tech asset to see its valuation reduced despite strong growth in recent years. Based on what we've seen in Bitcoin's short history, Bitcoin investors should cautiously hope that inflation declines and stocks rise. However, I'll once again stress that I don't believe inflation is the most important factor for Bitcoin in the long term. Conclusion Bitcoin has been a top-performing asset despite its selloff last year, and the underlying story about Bitcoin being a stable, decentralized, and scarce asset hasn't changed at all. Although there's some evidence that high inflation is bad for Bitcoin, rapid adoption of the Bitcoin network has continued even in the face of its recent price crash. Thus, I continue to hold Bitcoin - as well as correlated cryptos Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Flow ( FLOW-USD ) - in anticipation of another bull run starting at some unpredictable time in the near future.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580047-bitcoin-is-cpi-report-bearish-for-crypto-forecast?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9700067.jpeg

42388028,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR2O0r,1676910572,"Retail Crypto Investors in Emerging Economies Hit Hardest by FTX, Terra Collapses: BIS","While most crypto app users worldwide lost money on their bitcoin holdings after last year's collapses of the Terra ecosystem and the FTX exchange, investors outside of major economies took the biggest hit, the Bank for International Settlements said in a report published on Monday.  Losing money in risky investments isn't exactly a new phenomenon: Last year, American investors lost $9 trillion due to falling stock prices alone. More than $450 billion vanished from the crypto market following the collapse of Terra in May, 2022, and another $200 billion was lost following FTX's bankruptcy in November, the report said.  The BIS is owned by owned by 63 central banks, representing countries from around the world that together account for about 95% of world GDP. BIS analyzed data from crypto exchange apps for 95 countries and on-chain data on the daily distribution of bitcoin holdings collected from IntoTheBlock. The data showed that from August 2015 to December 2022 almost three-quarters of users downloaded a crypto platform app when the price of bitcoin was above $20,000.  ""The median investor would have lost $431 by December 2022, corresponding to almost half of their total $900 in funds invested since downloading the app. Notably, this share is even higher in several emerging market economies like Brazil, India, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey. If investors continued to invest at a monthly frequency, over four fifths of users would have lost money,"" the report said.  The authors of the report assumed users invested in bitcoin ""on the same day they downloaded the app"" and that ""each new user bought $100 of bitcoin in the month of the first app download and in each subsequent month."" It's unclear how much these assumptions reflect reality – particularly whether downloading an app ensures the purchase of crypto.  The report also said larger investors might have benefited at the expense of smaller ones. ""The price patterns suggest that larger investors were able to sell their assets to smaller ones before the steep price decline,"" it said.  Following the market collapse, regulators who were previously more concerned about crypto's impact on financial stability, have pivoted to setting up stronger safeguards for retail investors.  ""Evidence suggests that crypto shocks have a limited impact on equity prices or broader financial conditions,"" the BIS report said.

FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November after its sister company Alameda Research was blown out of levered long positions during the market downswing.

""I think a lot of these firms are projecting around 50 cents on the dollar recovery,"" the creditor suggested.

42421365,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnu61,1676906143,CoinDesk's Major Award Is a Huge Moment for Us and Crypto Media Generally,"The news that Ian Allison and Tracy Wang are joint recipients of a Polk Award, one of the most prestigious in journalism, for three November scoops that led to the unraveling of FTX’s empire is a source of immense pride for all of us at CoinDesk.  This is a milestone, not only for CoinDesk, but for crypto media generally. It underscores the role that sound, professional journalism can play in bringing transparency to the too-often-opaque and, sadly, scam-ridden crypto industry.  As Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker and Executive Editor Marc Hochstein put it in their write-up of the three award-winning stories (Ian’s initial scoop on Alameda’s balance sheet, his followup on Binance being likely to withdraw its bailout and Tracy’s bombshell on CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s “cabal of roommates” that ran FTX): “There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly.”  It’s painful to see so many FTX victims in the fallout from what Ian and Tracy uncovered. But the reality is it would have eventually been exposed. That it wasn’t earlier is, in fact, the problem. It’s why a professional, independent media is vital for an industry with trust issues.  But it takes a technical grounding to cover this complex topic properly. Just as bankers exploited miscomprehension of collateralized debt obligations pre-2008, crypto scammers hide behind techno-fog. That can be challenging for reporters unfamiliar with the tech. It’s why some mainstream coverage of Bankman-Fried left a lot to be desired.  Here, CoinDesk is unique. Sure, there are quality crypto reporters in mainstream media as well as in the crypto press, but no outlet has nearly as deep a bench as we do. We combine the best of mainstream and crypto journalism.  We are led by Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds in editorial, who had a storied 23-year career at Bloomberg, and by Joanne Po, executive producer and head of multimedia, who led TV and digital multimedia teams at CNBC, The Wall Street Journal and Fox Digital. We have other senior editors with decades of newsroom experience. Just as importantly, we employ many scoop-hungry, crypto-native reporters – some of them straight out of school, others older – with deep, personal understanding of the technology and its opportunities and challenges.  This two-way approach is more important than ever. Contrary to its critics, crypto isn’t going anywhere. But, clearly, it needs to be improved, both on the technical side and in the regulatory framework. If it is to live up to its transformative potential, it’s vital that crypto’s problems be exposed, so that solutions can be iteratively developed and so that promising projects are given the attention they deserve.  It has become popular in some crypto circles to argue that this should be left to solo “citizen journalists” on Twitter. But while there’s definitely a place for the crowdsourcing of information that happens on social media, Ian and Tracy’s work is Exhibit A in the case for why independent, structured press organizations like CoinDesk remain vital.  Until someone comes up with something better – perhaps, one day, a workable, trusted decentralized system for uncovering facts and holding bad actors accountable – there’s no substitute for the training or the embedded principles of professional journalism with which reporters develop trust with sources, report accurately and work with integrity.  Do we occasionally get things wrong? Sure. But there’s a commitment, day in and day out, to endeavor to get it right, promptly correct and disclose our mistakes and strive for objectivity and transparency. The best way to address the conspiracy theorists who blindly claim we serve some puppet master’s interests is to point to the proof in our pudding.  Today is therefore not only a day to celebrate Ian and Tracy and their editor, Nick Baker, but every single person at CoinDesk. They have all contributed to a workplace that allows and encourages our journalists to pursue these high standards – one result of which is this highly deserved accolade. It’s a day, also, to recognize why it’s so important that the wider crypto industry supports media institutions like CoinDesk that live by these principles.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Michael J.

42388032,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR2OJZ,1676905200,"CoinDesk Wins a Polk Award, One of Journalism's Top Prizes, for Explosive FTX Coverage","CoinDesk journalists won a George Polk Award for the scoop that led to Sam Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion cryptocurrency empire collapsing in days and for two explosive follow-up stories. This is the news organization’s first major journalism award.  CoinDesk’s Ian Allison and Tracy Wang won the prize for financial reporting, according to a statement Monday. Previous winners in that category include The Wall Street Journal’s series on Theranos and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ stories on the so-called Panama Papers.  Created in 1949 by Long Island University to honor murdered war correspondent George Polk, the Polk Awards are among the most prestigious prizes in journalism and emphasize “investigative work that is original, resourceful and thought-provoking.” The trio of honored CoinDesk stories exemplified those qualities.  “This is an important milestone, not only for CoinDesk, but for crypto media generally,” said Michael Casey, CoinDesk’s chief content officer. “Despite all that Ian and Tracy’s incredible reporting exposed – and the fallout that it triggered – the crypto industry will continue to have a significant impact on the world. It’s vital that it be covered with the kind of probing, well-informed, professional journalism embodied by these two reporters and their attentive, dedicated editors.”  The industry-shaking Nov. 2 story from Allison, a senior reporter, resulted from a source’s tip that Sam Bankman-Fried’s closely held trading firm, Alameda Research, was on shakier financial footing than was generally known. Allison got to work finding evidence and nailed it by obtaining the company’s balance sheet, which was not a public document.  It showed that a significant portion of Alameda’s billions of dollars in assets was secretly made up of FTT, a sort of digital Monopoly money issued by Bankman-Fried’s better-known FTX crypto exchange.  The resulting story raised concerns about the stability of Alameda and FTX, and called into question Bankman-Fried’s image as a white knight capable of backstopping struggling companies and as an “adult in the room” in a field notorious for fly-by-night outfits and scammers. The article debuted in a world where FTX was fast becoming a household name thanks to a marketing blitz featuring Larry David, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.  Within days the price of FTT plummeted and Bankman-Fried agreed to a bailout from rival exchange Binance. Almost immediately, Binance got cold feet, as revealed by another Polk-winning scoop from Allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market. Hours later, Binance confirmed it was backing out of the deal.  Wang, a deputy managing editor, provided the third CoinDesk scoop honored by the Polk Awards: A story revealing that Bankman-Fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury Bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies – including the fact that Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had once been a couple. The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a scathing report issued soon after on FTX’s extremely lax administrative procedures.  Nine days after Allison’s initial story, Bankman-Fried’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection. Not long after, Bankman-Fried was arrested and the U.S. Congress held hearings.  There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly. The fallout reverberated throughout the crypto industry and even hurt CoinDesk’s corporate sibling Genesis and parent company Digital Currency Group, underscoring CoinDesk’s editorial independence and dedication to telling important stories.  More than 2,000 news stories have credited CoinDesk for setting off the chain of events, including pieces from high-profile publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Verge, New York Magazine, CNN and NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast.  “As great an honor as the George Polk award is, I gotta say Ian and Tracy totally deserve it for some of the best journalism it’s been my pleasure to witness,” said Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk’s editor-in-chief. “They and the work they did are totally awesome. I also need to give a shout-out to Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, who was a key partner to Ian and Tracy in bringing these market-shaking stories to life, and to the rest of the CoinDesk news team, which kicked butt on covering the maelstrom that resulted from Ian and Tracy’s incredible scoops.”  Read More: CoinDesk’s Major Award Is a Huge Moment for Us and Crypto Media Generally",POSITIVE,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | FTT,"Nick Baker, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/20/coindesk-wins-a-polk-award-a-top-journalism-prize-for-explosive-ftx-coverage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2f4ad046d1785db9e7dc7ab8d25228151cb7ea1-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator is seeking comments on whether to allow licensed platforms to serve retail investors and what consumer protection measures to offer. The new rules would also mean all platforms would need to apply for a license, including existing ones. Platforms “should begin to review and revise their systems and controls to prepare for the new regime,” the SFC said. It was misconstrued through a tweet last week that the city was set to offer crypto trading to retail investors, which is not the case. Hong Kong’s new Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) licensing regime kicks in at the start of June, but it only permits exchanges to provide access to professional investors.  Helium is set to entirely shift to the Solana blockchain by March 27, developers have said. That’s prompted a rally of the decentralized wireless network’s HNT tokens, which are up nearly 6% at $3 in the last 24 hours. Following the migration, HNT, MOBILE and IOT will all be issued on the Solana network and continue to be the tokens in the Helium ecosystem. A new version of the Helium wallet app will become available, and users will also have the option of using Solana-based wallets like Phantom and Solfare.  Crypto-focused hedge fund Galois Capital has shut down after losing a sizable portion of its assets during FTX’s collapse last year. Galois told CoinDesk last November that the $40 million stuck on FTX amounted to around half of its funds.

In other FTX-related news, founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other execs have been subpoenaed by bankrupt brokerage Voyager Digital’s unsecured creditors.

A rescue deal, which was in ""advanced talks"" in November, has been ""signed but not closed,"" Zipmex CEO Marcus Lim told CoinDesk in an email. ""We are making good progress but the deal isn't done yet.""  Zipmex was one of several firms that found itself in trouble following last summer's market collapse that spawned out of the implosion of Terra and its algorithmic stablecoin UST. It issued two loans to Babel Finance and Celsius Network worth $53 million, neither of which has been repaid.

42388026,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR2NrV,1676894004,Bitcoin Layer 2 Stacks Network's STX Token Spikes 50% as 'Ordinals' Boom,"STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network, is surging as the recent arrival of the Ordinals protocol has unleashed a new narrative of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Stacks Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts focused on establishing the world's biggest and oldest blockchain programmable – a dominant feature of Ethereum and its competitors such as Solana, which currently account for a majority of global NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.  Stacks has a separate ledger to store data outside the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications similar to those on Ethereum and Solana. STX, known for being the first token offering qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is used to incentivize Stacks miners and participants in the proposed Stacks bitcoin (sBTC) system, which is aimed at making bitcoin fully programmable.  The token has risen nearly 50% to 60 cents in the past 24 hours, taking the month-to-date gain to 125%. Prices were quoted as high as 84 cents early Monday, the highest since May, CoinDesk data show. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin (BTC) has risen just 6% this month.  The outsized move comes as the crypto community goes gaga over Ordinals, which went live on Jan. 21, allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, Ordinals are like drawing artwork directly on satoshi (sats), the lowest denomination of a bitcoin, while NFTs on Ethereum are analogous to an authenticity certificate from the creator that is separate from ether.  The number of newly created Ordinals or NFTs inscribed directly into Satoshis on Bitcoin crossed the 100,000 mark last week, causing network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Per Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, the growing popularity of Ordinals would bode well for layer 2 systems.  ""Ordinals on Bitcoin [layer 1] are complementary to Bitcoin NFTs on [layer 2s] like Stacks. Ordinals have a natural limit on the L1 scale, and L2s provide a clear scalability path,"" Ali tweeted Monday. ""Wallets like Xverse and & Hiro are amongst the first to release or work on Ordinals.""  Activity in NFTs on Stacks has picked up in the wake of the Ordinals' rising popularity. Data from DappRadar shows trading volume on Gamma.io, a Stack-based Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has increased by more than 1,000% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, volumes on Megapont have increased by 125%. Per data tweeted by Ali, there is an active community of artists and creators on Stacks and people have minted 650K Bitcoin NFTs on the layer 2 system.  ""Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin blockchain has been very successful, leading to a general Bitcoin NFT fever,"" CK Cheung, investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, said. ""Stacks is a beneficiary of this as it is an L2 supporting smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin Network. People could mint new Bitcoin NFTs on top of Stacks with a lower cost and higher speed.""  Last week, the bitcoin-focused Web 3 wallet Xverse rolled out support for Ordinals. At the same time, Hiro Wallet added support for inscriptions on its testnet, with Ali describing the same as Metamask for Bitcoin.  Early this month, Gamma.io unveiled a no-code creator platform for NFTs on native Bitcoin through the use of ordinals, opening doors for users to create inscriptions without having to run a full Bitcoin node or write any code. Gamma's new launch essentially made Ordinals accessible to everyone.  ""Ordinals (inscriptions) are similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the smallest value of Bitcoin (satoshis). This is now opening up the use case for NFTs and merging them with the Bitcoin network security layer,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in an email while pointing to the upcoming ""Building on Bitcoin Hackathon"" as the key event to watch out for in the short term.  The hackathon, scheduled from Feb. 24 to March 7, will have participants build their own smart contracts using Clarity, programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.  ""This virtual hackathon is driving a lot of attention as Stacks uses 'Clarity,' a programming language for writing smart contracts that might be easier to learn than Solidity. The hackathon will reveal in the next two weeks if everybody can now build smart contracts without too much technical knowledge,"" Thielen noted.  Finally, on top of all this, STX is seemingly drawing a haven bid, according to Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik.  ""STX is also one of the rare tokens approved by the SEC. So in these uncertain times when the regulator is going after a lot of crypto companies, an SEC-approved token also sounds like a good thing to the market,"" Malik said.",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | STX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/20/bitcoin-layer-2-stacks-networks-stx-token-surges-130-as-ordinals-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f42cca02de15ab3c3d68b51e9bb66a805910a7e-1697x867.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FSB’s upcoming guidance targets the strengthening of stablecoin governance frameworks, redemption rights and stabilization mechanisms, Knot said in a letter to G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors.  According to its work plan for 2023 published on Monday, the FSB is set to finalize its recommendations for regulating crypto and stablecoins by July. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar or the euro.  Regulators around the world have been taking steps to oversee payments-focused stablecoins, most of which are backed by fiat currency reserves in the form of cash equivalents – or more infamously by unsecured short-term debt. While stablecoin issuers have made efforts to cut private debt out of their reserves and improve transparency, Knot’s message indicates these measures may not be enough.  In his letter, Knot added that many existing stablecoins wouldn’t meet the international norms set by payments or securities standard setters either.  In February 2022, the FSB warned that crypto risks to financial stability “could rapidly escalate.” Regulators around the world, including the FSB, have been increasing efforts to oversee the sector following last year’s many company collapses – including token issuer Terra and crypto exchange FTX.  Last week, the FSB said it will work with other standard-setting bodies to determine how decentralized finance (DeFi) should be regulated. It is also planning a paper with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on regulatory issues associated with crypto.

42414379,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5MGt,1676882513,Hong Kong Proposes Rules for Crypto Trading Platforms,"Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Monday published its proposed rules for virtual asset trading platforms and is seeking public comment.  Aside from setting up a licensing regime for crypto service providers, the regulator is also seeking views on whether to allow licensed platforms to serve retail investors, and under what investor protection measures these services should be offered, an official notice said.  Under the new regime, all crypto trading platforms planning to apply for a license – including pre-existing platforms – ""should begin to review and revise their systems and controls to prepare for the new regime,"" the notice said.  ""Those which do not plan to apply for a license should start preparing for an orderly closure of their business in Hong Kong,"" it added. Hong Kong is also planning to regulate stablecoins starting in June this year.  The consultation paper published on Monday sets out proposed requirements, like assessing clients' risk profile and setting limits to ensure their exposure is ""reasonable.""  Under the proposed measures, it will be up to operators to do due diligence on tokens, and monitor them. That includes assessing the regulatory status of the asset in each jurisdiction in which the operator provides trading services. It also proposes checks on the operator’s liquidity and whether its holdings are concentrated or controlled by a small number of individuals or entities.  Operators can only offer tokens which satisfy the SFC's criteria for an ""eligible large-cap virtual asset,"" listed on two ""acceptable indices.""  They must do smart contract audits on tokens to check for security flaws.  The proposed measures also state that operators should not offer virtual assets which fall within the definition of ""securities"" if it would breach Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Ordinance.  The SFC proposes operators provide a compensation arrangement which it must approve to cover for risks, in place of a hard limit for assets held in cold storage. Operators will have to monitor daily the amount of customer assets held and adjust the arrangement accordingly.  Each licensed operator may have to set up a token admission and review committee to assess tokens up for trade and set obligations for issuers to inform operators about any hard forks, airdrops or regulatory action.  In the paper, the SFC acknowledges that industry players want to offer derivatives and is open to hearing about business models and demand, and conducting a separate review to draft related policies.  In January 2022, the SFC allowed retail investors to access some regulated crypto-related derivative products traded on conventional exchanges.  For much of last year, the SFC seemed unwilling to allow retail investors access to crypto under its virtual asset licensing regime. It signaled it was willing to change its stance at Hong Kong FinTech Week in November last year.  The consultation is open through March 31, while the new licensing regime is set to take effect on June 1.

The migration will see HNT, MOBILE and IOT issued on the Solana network, which will continue to be the tokens in the Helium ecosystem.  Once the migration is complete, a new version of the Helium Wallet App will be made available. Additionally, the Helium layer 1 blockchain history will remain public. Users will be able to access the new application by updating their current wallet app. HNT holders can also use other wallets within the Solana ecosystem, such as Phantom or Solflare.  The final stage of the Upgrade will take place on the proposed date of March 27, beginning around 15:00 UTC. During this 24-hour transition period, all users will be migrated to the Solana blockchain.  On this day, Core Developers will initiate a chain halt via a chain variable. Validators will stop producing blocks, and chain followers like routers, blockchain nodes, and will no longer sync blocks and transactions after the halting block. The network and account state will be effectively frozen at this time.  After Core Developers validate that block production has halted, a final snapshot of the Helium blockchain will be taken. Subsequently, the chain state will be migrated to the Solana blockchain, including all accounts/tokens; Hotspots will be minted as non-fungible tokens.  The upgrade may be delayed if any critical bugs are found leading to the migration event.

42414383,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5MRV,1676861670,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Opens the Week Testing $25K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin tests $25,000, and here's what has to happen for it to break $30,00.  Insights: The June arrival in Hong Kong of a framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as exchanges, will not give retail investors access to crypto. But will that change?  Prices  Here's How Bitcoin Hits $30,000  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,133 −4.6 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,364 −295.1 ▼ 1.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,682 −11.3 ▼ 0.7% S&P 500  4,079.09 −11.3 ▼ 0.3% Gold  $1,847 +6.3 ▲ 0.3% Nikkei 225  27,513.13 −183.3 ▼ 0.7% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Happy Monday. While the U.S. is off for Presidents’ Day, bitcoin was recently trading at $24,226, and ether $1,689, both in the red at close to 2% and 1.5% respectively in the past 24 hours, as Asia begins the work week.  In the last week, bitcoin has gained over 11% while ether gained 9%. Layer 1 protocols including Solana, Polkadot, and Polygon have also made double-digit gains, up 20%, 19%, and 18.5%, respectively.  DOGE is up 5% on week and SHIB is up 4%, having seen their gains from an Elon Musk tweet last week tested by the market. Floki, named after Musk’s dog, is down 7% on-day but still up 108% for the week.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, says that $23,000 is bitcoin’s new support level and the next week is critical if bitcoin is to hit $30,000.  “It was critical for bitcoin to reclaim $23,000 if we were to see more upside action,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “With February coming to an end, another bullish monthly close may be what the market needs for bitcoin to test $30,000.”  DiPasquale thinks we’ll see the market consolidating if not going up, with a limited downside in the short term.  Looking to the next week, Coinbase is scheduled to post earnings and investors are expecting lukewarm results. With regulators in the U.S. looking to cut off crypto’s banking access, Coinbase executives will probably have a lot to say on the topic.  Let’s see if crypto’s upward rally can hold.

Hong Kong is warming up to crypto, and a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) – the local term for crypto exchanges – begins on June 1.  Does this mean crypto will be ""fully legal"" in the city for everyone, as a tweet suggests? Not at all.  While the situation may change later, for now the VASP framework for licensing exchanges, which just finished a multiyear consultation, allows them to provide access only to accredited professional investors. Retail investors are excluded.  The Hong Kong government has indicated that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), its securities regulator, may consider retail access to virtual asset services in the future, after further consultation.  In January, Reuters reported the SFC is in the process of considering which cryptocurrencies to offer to retail investors should the door eventually be opened to them. CEO Julia Leung is quoted as saying that only “highly liquid” assets will be on the list, and the choices will be very limited at first.  The city's authorities see June 1 as an opportunity, saying ""Brand Hong Kong"" is much more highly regarded worldwide than, say, Seychelles or St. Kitts and Nevis. The regulator is expanding its headcount to deal with an anticipated flurry of license applications.  “We’re able to bring together investments globally,” Christopher Hui, secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (FSTB), said in an earlier interview with CoinDesk. “We can manage and also channel these investments in a well-regulated and also sustainable manner.”  Hong Kong’s credibility comes from its “rule of law, regulation, commercial modus operandi,” Hui said, and this translates well from traditional finance to crypto.  Others in Hong Kong, however, see things differently.  ""For those platforms operated outside of Hong Kong, we see little incentive to incorporate in Hong Kong, establish an office here, go through the strict licensing requirements, as the local market is small,"" Leo Weese, co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, wrote in a 2021 post. ""Local institutional investors will be able to interact with foreign platforms through their foreign subsidiaries.""  Still, he's optimistic the new regulations ""can reintroduce clarity and stability after years of uncertainty,"" Weese said in an interview. ""It is important that individuals are granted the easy access to bitcoin they have become accustomed to in the past 12 years.""  Those individuals, the retail investors, are bound to be excited by the chance to use a local Hong Kong entity to trade. After all, there is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong, and Japan shows what happens when retail investors are able to trade in a regulated environment. Post-FTX, Japanese traders seem to be living in a parallel world, where their tokens were stored with a custodian and funds are being returned.  But it's not quite the retail investors' turn yet in Hong Kong. That's still a work in progress.

42414384,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5Mc7,1676854800,Klaytn Foundation to Make Changes to KLAY Tokenomics and Governance Models,"Klaytn Foundation, one of the key developer and code maintainers of the Klaytn blockchain, is making changes to the network's governance system and make changes to the token model of native KLAY tokens, it told CoinDesk over the weekend.  The Foundation will aid Klaytn blockchain's transition to a wholly permissionless validator structure, provide opportunities to the general public to participate as block validators, and introduce a communication channel for Klaytn's community members to participate in decision-making processes.  These changes are expected to enhance Klaytn's overall technical capabilities, revenue sustainability, and decentralization aspects while contributing towards making KLAY more valuable eventually. To make these changes, the Foundation will work alongside the Klaytn Governance Council (GC), a group of network participants that currently oversee governance of the Klaytn network.  Validators are one of the main entities of any blockchain and are responsible for verifying transactions on that network.  The Foundation will continue to serve as a decision-making body for Klaytn ecosystem expansion projects, and propose major agendas for the Klaytn platform. GC members' decision-making authority over Klaytn blockchain business will be further expanded, and the Foundation will promote projects based on GC members' decisions rather than its own.  Additionally, the Foundation will strengthen governance transparency by disclosing GC's on-chain voting agendas and statuses in real-time through Klaytn Square, a governance protocol. Such measures can help prevent a repeat of governance dramain recent weeks: Earlier in February, decentralized exchange Uniswap saw contention among community members for the allegedly skewed voting rights held by big-name investor Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The fund eventually lost the vote following the culmination of a behind-the-scenes political battle that lasted weeks.  The Klaytn Foundation will present a revamped tokenomics proposal to the GC starting Monday. This includes a proposal on handling the uncirculated (reserve) KLAY tokens in response to community feedback. Finalized agendas and proposals will be made public on Feb.28 alongside a technical road map for 2023.",POSITIVE,KLAY,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | KLAY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/20/klaytn-foundation-to-make-changes-to-klay-tokenomics-and-governance-models,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6512bb86380495954d8e837011052e96f9dccfdf-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
