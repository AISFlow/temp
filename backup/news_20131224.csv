42425221,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUFh,1387906217,Slovenia Clarifies Position on Cryptocurrency Tax,"Slovenian regulators have released a statement clarifying certain ambiguities related to bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The Tax Administration of the Republic of Slovenia said it received queries from taxpayers who were interested in the possible tax implications of bitcoin transactions.  In response, the Tax Administration requested a formal response from the Ministry of Finance, which stated that bitcoin remains a virtual currency – thus, it is not a 'monetary asset' under Slovenian law.  Furthermore, bitcoin is not considered a financial instrument, either. However, the ministry stressed that taxation of bitcoin income still warrants a review on an individual basis. In other words, it is necessary to determine who actually generates an income, and classify what sort of income is being generated.  Some income will be taxed  Income made by individuals is subject to standard income tax provisions, irrespective of the form in which it is paid or received. Such income is taxable under Slovenian law, and bitcoin income will apparently be taxed by measuring the bitcoin/euro exchange at the time of the transaction.  However, personal income tax is not paid on capital gains. Hence, individuals who generate income by selling bitcoins will not pay income tax.  This does not apply to bitcoin miners, as their income is taxed like any other income – using the exchange rate at the time the income is received. Profits derived from trading and mining bitcoin are taxed as income under the provisions of Slovenian personal income legislation.  Corporate regulations remain ambiguous  According to Slovenia’s Corporate Income Tax Act, any profits generated over the course of a year are included in the annual income statement, but the Ministry stressed that the current legislative framework contains no provisions applicable to businesses involved in bitcoin trading.  There is a fair amount of ambiguity here, as the ministry cites two corporate income laws, so determining the tax base could be problematic. The statement concludes that the treatment of bitcoins in the accounting process varies on a case-to-case basis.  Although this may sound unusual, it is a quite common practice in Slovenia and its neighbouring countries. With relatively small economies, it is possible to determine whether a specific law or bylaw applies to each individual business that applies for clarification.  At a glance, the latest statement does not in any way affect Slovenia’s overall position regarding digital currencies. Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp is based in Slovenia, but none of the issues raised in the statement should have an impact on its everyday operations.

42425212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvU1h,1387899015,Alternative Cryptocurrencies Thrive in Bitcoin's Shadow,"David Sterry has been a bitcoin believer for years. He even founded a bitcoin startup. But when he heard that miner demand was causing monthlong backlogs on certain computer components, he realized it was a big, big moment – not for bitcoin, but for litecoin.  The alternative cryptocurrency, created in October 2011 with a few tweaks to the Bitcoin protocol, has seen its value rise and fall in lockstep with bitcoin's. As bitcoin has risen in prominence and in price and become more difficult to mine, new miners have rushed into litecoin as the next best thing – and purchased just about every available AMD Radeon graphics card, the most efficient way to mine litecoin.  “It’s kind of capped by how fast AMD can create video cards,” said Sterry, founder of the nonprofit Litecoin Association. The rush on AMD's product has been so pronounced, Sterry said, that ""Litecoin could be the first math-based currency to have an impact on a Fortune 500 company's bottom line.""  Litecoin now has a market cap of $410.8m, making it the second biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin's $7.7bn – but far from the only alternative math-based currency out there. Cryptocurrency watchers estimate there are as many as hundreds of others.  ""You can take Bitcoin open source code and make a couple tweaks, and you have an altcoin,"" said Greg Schvey, head of research for The Genesis Block, a New York research firm specializing in bitcoin.

42425222,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUHh,1387894198,Blockchain.info Acquires Bitcoin Price App ZeroBlock,"The world's most popular bitcoin site and online wallet, Blockchain.info, today announced it has acquired ZeroBlock LLC, makers of the leading mobile bitcoin app.  ZeroBlock's developer, Dan Held, will also join the Blockchain team as a Product Manager.  Released in summer 2013, ZeroBlock has become one of the most popular mobile and web apps for bitcoin enthusiasts. It combines live Bitcoin exchange data with up to the minute breaking news and charts, both on mobile devices and its website ZeroBlock.com.  It displays prices in bitcoin's three most-traded currencies (CNY, USD, EUR) with up-to-date data from the largest exchanges (BTC China, Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Coinbase). There are also statistics for miners such as block times, hash rates and difficulty increases. A basic grayscale version of the app is free to download on iOS, and users who donate $2 can see charts and graphs in color.  As of December 2013, ZeroBlock is the most-reviewed and highest-rated bitcoin app on the Apple iOS App Store. It is on track to surpass 1,000,000 impressions (people opening the app) in the month of December and in the same month has been downloaded 9,000 times. In November it launched a version for Android, gaining thousands more users.  Blockchain said ZeroBlock fits in with its ""very ambitious future goals in the bitcoin space,"" and will play a pivotal role in helping bitcoin users follow market trends and hopefully open up new revenue sources.    “When I’m asked what’s the killer app for Bitcoin right now I always recommend ZeroBlock,” said Nicolas Cary, Blockchain's CEO.      “What Dan Held and Kevin Johnson have accomplished is truly remarkable. ZeroBlock has created an enduring design aesthetic that elegantly filters the signal from the noise in the bitcoin ecosystem. I’m completely obsessed with it.”    Though Blockchain is keeping the price of the acquisition confidential, in keeping with its image as a ""non-fiat company"" the deal was done entirely in bitcoin.  Both Blockchain and ZeroBlock have experienced massive growth in the past couple of months, as bitcoin's value and appeal suddenly skyrocketed. The companies have taken a more analytical approach to bitcoin, presenting its statistical nuances to the public in a well-designed way to make it approachable to newcomers and professional analysts.  ""I want entrepreneurs to know that we're serious about seeing their projects succeed, and we're looking to form partnerships with bitcoin thought leaders,"" Cary concluded.

42425214,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvU5h,1387890045,New Bitcoin Exchange Unocoin Launches in India,"A new bitcoin exchange service has launched in India, amid a growing wave of digital currency interest in the world's second largest country.  Unocoin  launched at the well-attended Global Bitcoin Conference, India's first, in Bangalore on 15th December. It is currently running on a 'trial basis' and new verified users are limited to buying/selling 10 BTC per day.  Vikram Nikkam, a director of parent company Unobit Solutions Pvt. Ltd, said full cooperation with financial regulations was a key point in gaining acceptance. Local banks were receiving client monies and making payments without issue. He said:    ""It is an extra special project as it is built to facilitate the value transfer of bitcoins between individuals online in compliance with the KYC and AML policies in India.      It is a platform giving every Indian the opportunity to have some bitcoins in their possession and thereby India does not miss out on this technology like we did in the case of the Internet.""    Regulatory compliance  To become verified, users need to have an Indian PAN (Personal Account Number) and card, which are required for all all documents pertaining to financial transactions in India. They must also supply a full name and contact details with proof of address, and an optional photo. Transfers are handled via linked bank accounts.  Users can send and receive bitcoins without limits, and users who trade local currency for bitcoins regularly for 60 days or more are elevated to Gold User status, with higher limits.  It's also possible to send bitcoins to a friend via email whether the recipient has an existing bitcoin wallet with Unocoin or not. If not, they would be invited to sign up with Unocoin to claim the amount.  Unocoin also has two-factor authentication and the ability to generate paper wallets with client-side JavaScript to take bitcoin storage completely offline.  Fertile ground for bitcoin  The large number of IT professionals and businesses located in India these days could drive interest in bitcoin and play an important role in its growth.  The bitcoin meetup group in Bangalore, a center of the country's burgeoning IT sector known as ""India's Silicon Valley"", has over 400 members. There are numerous other local groups in other tech centers throughout the country, with the Bombay Bitcoin group in Mumbai raising similar numbers.  The team behind Unocoin also runs CoinMonk, a site that seeks to educate newcomers on how to use bitcoin. It also features a block chain explorer, manufactures physical bitcoins for sale in smaller denominations like 0.01 BTC, and sells shares in its bitcoin mining operation.  Another popular exchange in India is buysellbitco.in, which also verifies account holders are Indian residents with PAN cards, and gives prices in local currency. It fixes exchange rates for one hour at a time, and also trades in litecoin.  Financial services  With recent developments in China causing uncertainty for bitcoin, it's possible attention could now shift to India. With its 1.2 billion population and the world's 10th largest economy comes enormous potential for growth.  There is also a large market for international remittances and a large proportion of the population without access to banking services. Nikkam said:    ""India houses about 700 million unbanked individuals which is one of the biggest issues that banks here are trying to resolve.      Bitcoin has the potential in that sense to very smoothly minimise this challenge, which is precisely what we are trying to present to financial institutions in the country.""    There is also evidence Indians are looking for alternatives to cash to store their wealth. India accounts for 20% of the world's gold demand, making it the largest market in the world. The national government has tried to curb this demand to control the country's current account deficit, increasing import duties from 2% to 15% over the past two years.  There were reports recently that India's central bank would join other around the world by issuing a warning on bitcoin use, citing price volatility and the dangers of bitcoin investment schemes.

42425228,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUTh,1387888099,2013 Bitcoin Trading Volume: The Winners and Losers,"Recent reports that China-based exchange OkCoin may be fabricating data highlight the incentives for exchanges willing to inflate their reported trading volume.    The reason why an exchange might want to do this is quite simple: the bigger the volume an exchange appears to have, the more likely it is that liquidity-seeking traders will be attracted to that particular exchange.  Additionally, what makes inflating volume data even more tempting is that, unlike bitcoin price data, there is no independent method available to easily verify an exchange's reported volume data.  The prices which Bitcoin exchanges report can be verified by comparing actual trades at the quoted ask/bid with the prices that exchange is reporting through its API data stream (which most major exchanges now have). There should not be a significant discrepancy between two.  In contrast, given the anonymous nature of bitcoin transactions, and the lack of other market features such as a central clearinghouse, we are wholly reliant on each individual exchange for trading volume figures.  Is bitcoin trading volume data a fantasy?    While bitcoin exchanges have the motive and the means to readjust their volume figures, there are some good reasons why we shouldn't dismiss their data completely.    As Bitcoin matures, one can imagine a day when independent auditors will verify reported volume data, in the way that professional accounting firms certify the public financial statements for corporations.  In the meantime, the closest approximation we have to independent audits are the venture capital firms, which are investing in various bitcoin exchanges.    For example, Lightspeed Venture Partners recently made a $5m investment in BTC China. As a well respected venture firm, we can reasonably expect that Lightspeed audited BTC China's volume data as part of their due diligence process, particularly given how important this data is to the value of the investment.      Further, while there is some dispute over the recent OkCoin reports, the story does illustrates how some traders are watching the exchanges for possible discrepancies.      In the OkCoin example, it is also interesting to contrast Bitcoin customer activism with the lethargy of traditional bank customers, who take very little interest in the reporting and operations of their banks because deposits are insured.      In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, some scholars, such as Paul Seabright of the University of Toulouse, have questioned whether the financial system would have been more secure had it been more like Bitcoin’s. In other words, Seabright conjectured that the financial system could be made more stable by having bank customers play a more active role alongside regulators in monitoring financial institutions by reducing/removing deposit insurance, thereby giving them more ‘skin in the game’.    The topsy-turvy world of bitcoin exchanges    With these caveats and disclaimers on volume out of the way, what can be said about trading volume for bitcoin this year, as we approach the end of 2013?      Figure 1: 2013 BTC Volume (units) – Cumulative Volume for BTC China, Mt. Gox and Bitstamp      One of the most striking elements of Figure 1 – which depicts the cumulative 2013 bitcoin trading volume across three leading exchanges – is that even with the dramatic upswing in November's prices, we have still not yet seen the same level of volume as mid-April.      The cumulative volume of 636,571 BTC on 16th April – the largest volume day of 2013 – is nearly double the peak November-December volume of 340,727 BTC on 18th December.      Figure 2: 2013 BTC Volume (units) – BTC China, Mt. Gox and Bitstamp      It is also worth noting the shift in the dispersion of volume between the April and November-December periods. As can be seen in Figure 2, Mt. Gox dominated bitcoin-trading volume through the first half of 2013, and beyond.      For example, on 16 April, the number of bitcoins traded on Mt. Gox alone equaled 572,186 BTC (90% of the total of the three exchanges).      In contrast, on 18 December there was a roughly equal dispersion across BTC China, Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, with a volume of 93,934, 109,723, and 137,070 BTC respectively.      Figure 3: 1st August – 23rd December BTC Volume (units) – BTC China, Mt. Gox and Bitstamp      More recently, we can see in Figure 3 how BTC China has caught up to and overtaken Mt. Gox and Bitstamp in daily trading volume, again as measured by the number of bitcoins exchanged.      From 20 October through to 23 December, the average daily trading volume on BTC China has been 55,216 BTC, while Mt. Gox and Bitstamp have averaged exchanging 34,192 and 32,235 BTC per day, respectively.      However, if we look at most recent days we already see a dramatic reversal of fortune, with BTC China now falling behind both Mt. Gox and Bitstamp. In the last four trading days, BTC China’s average daily volume has been 15,293 BTC, whereas Mt. Gox and Bitstamp have averaged 17,434 and 21,574 BTC.      Why hasn’t bitcoin volume matched its April highs? Which exchanges are poised to pull ahead in 2014? Share your thoughts on these and other exchange volume issues in the comments below.

42425225,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvURh,1387879203,Canadian Provincial Bitcoin Law: It's All About Protecting the Consumer,"My name is Matt Burgoyne and I’m an associate at Canadian legal firm McLeod Law. I’m involved with Canadian and international counsel in the developing area of virtual currency law, specifically including bitcoin currency. In this two-part series, I will give a basic primer on the state of Canadian law as it applies to digital currency entrepreneurs.  In the first article I published on Canadian bitcoin law we discussed legislation as it applies at the federal level, where I made the comment that it is at the federal level where most of the ‘action’ lies in respect to Canadian law as it pertains to bitcoin businesses.  This is because in Canada, pursuant to our constitution, currency and coinage, legal tender and other financial activities like banking fall under the exclusive domain of the federal government, and I referred to the piece of legislation that would likely take precedence in bitcoin transactions, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the “PCTFA”).  FINTRAC is the ‘watchdog’ if you will, enforcing the PCTFA. As a result, most bitcoin businesses operating in Canada would first and foremost want to be sure their activities are compliant with the PCTFA and FINTRAC.  FINTRAC (like FINCEN in the United States) has the power to compel companies to comply with the PCTFA, in some cases in rather costly ways.  In this article on Canadian bitcoin law, I will cover provincial legislation and accompanying regulations pertaining to companies operating in the bitcoin space.  No money transmittal laws  Unlike the legal framework of regulation in the United States, on a province by province level in Canada, bitcoin businesses should not be concerned about licensing requirements as they pertain to money transmitting, since those activities, if and when the federal government so chooses, would likely be governed under the PCTFA.  Consumer protection laws  What provincial laws would a bitcoin business have to be cognizant about when conducting operations in Canada?  A bulk of the laws relate to how and under what circumstances a bitcoin company can interact with the public (i.e. consumer protection legislation). It is important to note that, with some exceptions, the application of consumer protection legislation in each province is for the supply of goods and services for personal, family and household purposes, not for business purposes.  Some provinces have separate legislation, as discussed below, that deal with unfair business practices. Some provinces have a single ‘hybrid’ law that covers both consumer protection and protection against unfair business practices.  Bitcoin entities operating in Canada need to be aware of how consumer protection legislation and legislation protecting against unfair business practices can affect their businesses.  There are 13 provinces and territories in Canada. For the purposes of this article, I will focus on two of the 13 which are a fair reflection of the provincial laws of other jurisdictions in Canada.  I will focus on Ontario as an example of one province which has consumer protection laws but no ‘business dealing’ protection laws (Ontario has other laws which deal with business dealings and businesses in general and it is beyond the scope of this article to delve into that legislation), and British Columbia as an example of a province which has a hybrid consumer and business protection law which could apply to bitcoin businesses.  Ontario  Make no mistake, the Ontario Consumer Protection Act and its single Regulation (together, the “Ontario Act”) are both lengthy documents and the following summary is meant to be very general at best.  Often the best way to deal with a specific issue is, if your bitcoin business is selling consumer goods to an end user in Ontario (or any other province in Canada for that matter), contact a lawyer in Ontario who is familiar with the Ontario Act and who can pinpoint what section of the Act may apply to your specific issue.  At the outset, it’s important to note that the Ontario Act specifically does not apply to financial services related to investment products, income securities or consumer transactions that involve financial products or services regulated under other more ‘business’ friendly Ontario Acts such as the Securities Act and the Insurance Act.  As you will see, the legislation in Ontario is fairly heavily weighted in favour of the consumer. Bitcoin businesses offering consumer products to purchasers in Ontario should keep this in mind.    Cooling off period    In Ontario, consumers may be entitled to a cooling off period. Let’s say a consumer makes a purchase or signs an agreement in her home via the internet to purchase some bitcoin mining hardware for her own personal use and then decides to change her mind.  If the deal is worth more than $50, she has the right to cancel within 7 days in respect to an internet purchase and 10 days for a purchase made through other means and could get her money back. The legislation permits cancellation by registered mail.  When a consumer takes advantage of her 7 or 10 day cooling off period and notifies the business (preferably in writing) that she has changed her mind, the company has 15 days to return the purchaser’s money. The business has the right to take back the goods provided under the agreement by either picking them up or paying for the cost of sending them back.    Unsolicited goods    If a consumer is sent unsolicited goods they didn’t ask for, the consumer doesn’t have to accept or pay for them. In fact, a consumer may use them or throw them out.    Pre-paid goods or future service oriented agreements    Pre-paid goods or future performance agreements over $50 must have a written agreement. When some part of the agreement occurs in the future, (e.g. a bitcoin organization membership or a pre-paid bitcoin gift card) and the goods or services are worth more than $50, a written agreement is required. The agreement must contain complete details of the transaction and full disclosure of any credit terms.  All agreements must be clear and understandable. Vague language is discouraged in agreements. All required information must be clear, prominent and easy to understand. If there is a dispute over unclear language, the Ontario Act requires that it be interpreted in favour of the consumer.  So if you are a bitcoin entity trying to sell a consumer good it would be prudent to ensure your lawyer drafts up an agreement that cannot allow for more than one reasonable interpretation; there can be no room for ambiguity.    Consumer assistance rights    Some bitcoin businesses, like other businesses, add arbitration clauses to their agreements that require users to use a private arbitration process to resolve complaints instead of going to court or seeking assistance from the consumer services division of a provincial government.  In Ontario, consumers are not legally bound by these clauses, even if the consumer has accepted the agreement. Bitcoin businesses conducting any consumer related activity in Ontario must have competent legal advice ahead of time, prior to the time that contracts are drafted and executed.    Misrepresentation is illegal    All charges in an agreement must be what they say they are. For example, a bitcoin business may not add a $20 surcharge for a “tax” that is not really for tax. Consumers are advised to understand what each charge is for and that it’s valid and bitcoin vendors need to understand this at the outset.    Consumer agreements require extensive detail    If a consumer has entered into an agreement in which a cooling off period applies and he discovers that the bitcoin business failed to disclose something they were required to by law, the consumer has the right to cancel the agreement within one year.    Timely delivery of product    Deliveries must be on time. For example, a supplier of bitcoin mining equipment must deliver within 30 days from the promised date. After that, a consumer can cancel the contract by sending a cancellation letter; however the consumer loses the right to cancel the agreement if he accepts delivery after the 30 day period has elapsed.  Individuals who violate certain sections of the Ontario Act are liable to a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment of up to two years less one day or both. A corporation can be fined up to $250,000.  British Columbia  As with the Ontario Act, the British Columbia Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act and its associated 10 regulations (together, the “BC Act”) is a very lengthy piece of legislation and it is the intent of the writer to deal with the BC Act in a very general way.  Readers are advised to consult a lawyer for specific advice if they are a bitcoin business selling goods to consumers or businesses in British Columbia and have a specific issue they are unsure about.  The BC Act applies to all consumer transactions. “Consumer transactions” means a supply of goods or services by a supplier to a consumer for purposes that are primarily personal, family or household, or a solicitation, offer, advertisement or promotion by a supplier with respect to a transaction previously referred to.  “Consumer transaction” can also mean a solicitation of a consumer by a supplier for a contribution of money or other property by the consumer.  Interestingly, and this is what sets the BC Act apart, makes it a ‘hybrid act’ if you will, and differs it from some other provincial acts that simply protect the interests of consumers in consumer transactions, are the sections in the BC Act on credit reporting and debt collection apply to all transactions (not just ones involving consumers but also to unfair business dealings).  However, after my review of the BC Act I can’t see how these ‘business dealing’ sections would apply to bitcoin businesses since bitcoin entities are not (at least not at the time of the writing of this article) in the business of credit reporting or debt collection.    Standard (direct) sales contract information    Under the British Columbia Act, any sales contract entered into between a supplier and a consumer for the supply of goods or services that is entered into in person at a place other than the supplier's permanent place of business (a “Direct Sales Contract”) must contain very specific information, including but not limited to the following:    (a) the supplier's name;      (b) business address, telephone number and the date on which the contract is entered into;    (c) a detailed description of the goods or services to be supplied under the contract and an itemized purchase price list for the goods or services being acquired;    (e) the total price under the contract, including the total cost of credit and terms of payment; and    (e) a notice of the consumer's rights of cancellation, in the prescribed form and manner, if any.      Internet (distance) sales contract information    In the event a bitcoin business that is not physically located in British Columbia is selling goods to consumers in British Columbia via the internet (a “Distance Sales Contract”), the Distance Sales Contract, in addition to the information above, must contain extra information, including but not limited to the following:    (a) the supplier’s email address;      (b) a description of any relevant technical or system specifications;    (c) the currency in which amounts owing under the contract are payable;    (d) the supplier’s delivery arrangements; and    (e) the supplier’s cancellation, return, exchange and refund policies.    A supplier must give a consumer who enters into a Distance Sales Contract a copy of the contract within 15 days after the contract is entered into.    Cooling off period/right of cancellation    Similar to the Ontario Act, a consumer is entitled to cancel a Direct Sales Contract within 10 days of the date the consumer receives a copy of the contract, by giving notice to the supplier in writing via registered mail, delivery in person or delivery via email.  In the case of a Distance Sales Contract, the cancellation period is 7 days (same notice provisions apply as in a Direct Sales Contract).  A consumer can cancel a Distance Sales Contract within 30 days after the contract is entered into if the supplier does not provide the consumer with a copy of the contract listing the above disclosure requirements or if the product is not delivered within the 30 day period from the date the Distance Sales Contract was entered into.    Unfair and deceptive acts or practices    The British Columbia Act broadly defines a ‘deceptive act or practice’ to mean any conduct by a supplier that has the ultimate effect of deceiving or misleading a consumer.  “Representation” includes any term written on any website or promotional item.  This is not an exhaustive list, however any one or more of the following can constitute a deceptive act or practice under the British Columbia Act:    (a) a representation by a supplier that a particular product has sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics or uses or benefits that they do not have;      (b) a representation that a particular good is of a particular standard, quality, grade, style or model if it is not;    (c) a description by a supplier of a product that uses exaggeration, innuendo or ambiguity about a material fact or that fails to state a material fact, if the effect is misleading.    If it is alleged that a bitcoin company selling pre-paid gift cards loaded with bitcoin committed or engaged in a deceptive act or practice, the burden of proof that the deceptive act or practice was not committed would be on the bitcoin company.  An individual who commits an offence under the British Columbia Act is liable to a fine of not more than $10 000 or to imprisonment for not more than 12 months or to both.  A corporation who commits an offence under the British Columbia Act is liable to a fine of not more than $100 000.  Final thoughts  In this article I focused on consumer protection acts in two sample provinces because I believe that bitcoin businesses operating in a specific province or territory in Canada are going to be most concerned with consumer protection legislation; that type of legislation is the most relevant and in my opinion the most important for bitcoin businesses operating in Canada.  That being said, there are a number of other provincial acts which could apply (not only to bitcoin businesses but to any business), in a more generic ‘no brainer’ sense:    - Employment Standards Codes;      - Business Corporations Acts;    - Personal Property Security Acts; and    - Privacy Acts.    So far I have covered Canadian Federal law as it may (or may not) apply to bitcoin businesses, discussed Canadian provincial law as it applies to bitcoin businesses and pondered the question of how the Canadian federal government views bitcoin, either as a barter good or as a currency (it’s the former).  Expect my next article to focus on the Canadian banking industry and how it views bitcoin businesses, since that has been a major issue for my clients and others operating in the Canadian bitcoin landscape.
