42426288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhzh,1423868745,"Québec Mandates Bitcoin ATMs, Trading Platforms Obtain Licenses","The Québec regulatory agency that oversees Canadian financial markets has enacted new policies that mandate virtual currency ATM operators and virtual currency trading platforms obtain a license.  The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has amended its Policy Statement to the Money-Services Business Act to apply to select bitcoin businesses operating in the jurisdiction. The AMF stressed in its formal announcement, however, the licensure does not indicate that it is regulating the bitcoin industry.  The statement seems to have caught members of the local bitcoin community off guard given that Canada has been working toward regulating bitcoin on the federal level, a process that has been spearheaded through an 18-month Senate study due to be released this year.  Kyle Kemper, vice president of Calgary-based bitcoin exchange CAVIRTEX, indicated that it would need to more closely examine the ruling to determine its actions, but suggested that the move sends a potentially troubling signal for local businesses.  This concern was echoed by Christine Duhaime, a Canada-based lawyer and executive director at the non-profit Digital Finance Institute, who indicated that the wording of the latest update is likely to leave many in the community seeking additional clarity.  Duhaime told CoinDesk:  ""The wording is really vague, a platform for trading virtual currency, that does not strike me as I know exactly what they mean by that. We don’t know if that means a website, or if a person can be an exchanger.”  Kemper went on to suggest that the law represents a potentially troubling change in the broader regulatory landscape in Canada, due to the ongoing discussion on a federal level that he suggested could end up advocating for a stay on bitcoin regulation.  “What I’m not looking forward to – and maybe this is a signal with Quebec – is that every province comes out with its own licensing, because then we’d be in a situation that’s going in the US, where it creates unnecessary barriers,” Kemper added.  The decision by Québec notably follows a decision by the Canadian Parliament to amend its Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act of 2000 to apply to the digital currency industry.  To date, the government has not made progress on creating regulation so that the law could be enforced, choosing instead to wait for the Senate’s formal guidance.  BitLicense impact  Duhaime went on to describe the action as one that compared to proposed regulation in New York, as Québec would now have similar oversight over the industry.  For example, she noted one section that indicates bitcoin ATM owners will now have more onerous reporting requirements. Under the bill, Sûreté du Québec, the state police force, would need to investigate and clear covered bitcoin entities and their officers to receive a license.  “An indication as to previous convictions or good moral character is an important factor that could influence whether a licence for a money-services business is issued, suspended or revoked,” the law reads.  ATM owners also now need to verify the identity of customers and their “co-contracting parties”, keeping records of all transactions for six years. Information that will need to be logged includes customer information and the source of liquidity.  Elsewhere, affected companies will need to track income statements, accounting registers, records of officers, directors and employees and any other records prescribed by the act.  Clarity for ATM industry  While Duhaime categorized some parts of the directive as potentially problematic, the provisions for ATM operators, she said, were more clear.  Haseeb Awan, co-founder of bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitAccess, one of the more active companies in Canada, echoed the tone of surprise, stating that he expected the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) to issue guidance before any one province takes action.  While noting that Québec often passes laws that contrast those in the country at large, he expressed his belief that the company can adapt to this directive.  “We provide know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) tools to our operators to comply with local compliance,” Awan said, adding that his company would strive to help operators with the transition.  The company has five BitAccess machines in operation in Quebec, all run by individual operators.  Mitchell Callahan, the developer behind Canada-focused point-of-sale system PocketPOS, further expressed his belief that local ATM owners “were anticipating” such guidance.  Warnings given  In addition to the new reporting requirements, the AMF also warned the public about the more negative aspects associated with bitcoin use, citing its inability to protect consumers from liquidity or volatility risks.  ""Quebeckers should therefore be careful with virtual currency transactions as they may incur losses that are not covered under current compensation or deposit insurance plans,"" the formal guidance reads.  The AMF went on to indicate that bitcoin's ""low transaction costs"" may also encourage its use in Ponzi schemes and other illicit schemes, echoing concerns raised by global regulators.

42426275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhdh,1423859744,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Hong Kong’s MyCoin Sparks Global Conversation,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media coverage and its impact.          Bitcoin has been hung out to dry many times before in the media as part of reports that supporters argue often overemphasise its involvement in criminal activities.      Its reputation often suffers due to the lack of information – or misinformation – available.      If the Silk Road Trial did not do enough to put bitcoin under scrutiny, the recent scandal at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange MyCoin certainly fueled new skepticism around the digital currency.      What was said about bitcoin this week and where? CoinDesk takes a look at the top headlines across the globe.    MyCoin dominates news narrative  The South China Morning Post (SCMP) was the first outlet to break the story that MyCoin, a Hong-Kong based company, may have left ""as many as 3,000 local investors with combined losses of HK$3bn, on 9th February.  The SCMP article labeled MyCoin a ""bitcoin trading platform"", a description that would prove significant as the story unfolded.  Two days later, the publication ran with the following headline. The words ""bitcoin"" and ""pyramid scheme"" were certainly going to attract some attention.  At the time of press, a search on Google News brought up 46,200 results and over 100 articles addressing the incident, even reaching Israeli news sources, a rare feat for any bitcoin story.  As the situation unfolded, it became somewhat evident that bitcoin was being linked to criminal activity, as yet another company hid behind its premise of alleged anonymity to fulfil its illegitimate objectives.  The piece noted that ""there is no direct link between bitcoin and the popularity of this alleged fraud"".  It continued: ""There are rogues everywhere and in every field. However, the authorities are searching for as many reasons to act against bitcoin, a hard currency to supervise, and this story will certainly give it some more ammunition in the crusade against it"".  Headlines inspire action in Hong Kong  Despite the situation becoming more apparent as facts came to light, the original report does seem to have had an impact on shaping public perception.  The Hong Kong Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB) is already conducting a preliminary investigation into the alleged unlawful activities that may have taken place at the now defunct company.  Leung Yiu-chung, a lawmaker cited in the article, expressed his concern about the Hong Kong's Monetary Authority's response, stating:    ""As bitcoin is not a currency, it does not fall under its oversight.""    As he called on the authority to ban the sale of bitcoin in Hong Kong, he highlighted that the digital currency ""was more than just an investment product"", adding that ""in fact bitcoins can be used for shopping, which resembles [one of the functions] of currency"".  By this time, the story had caught wind and continued to spread.  Reuters then ran a story about Hong Kong's central bank warning consumers against investing in virtual currencies, amid local reports that a ""Hong Kong bitcoin exchange"" may have run off with $387 million in client funds.  The outlet noted that not only was the amount allegedly stolen hugely significant, but the scandal could also potentially be the biggest bitcoin related story in the region since the bankruptcy of Tokyo-based Mt Gox.  The outlet also cited the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which cautiously released a statement saying that the case ""may involve fraud or pyramid schemes,"" adding:    ""Given the highly speculative nature of bitcoin, we have all along urged the public to exercise extra caution when considering making transactions or investments with bitcoin.""    On the same day, Quartz published a piece that headlined with ""The MyCoin scandal in Hong Kong had nothing to do with actual bitcoins"".  In the article, Heather Timmons, cites various sources, including Leo Weese, the president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, who says that it is likely that the exchange never held any bitcoin.  ""It looks like it was an elaborate hoax – probably a Ponzi scheme,"" noted Timmons.  Positivity for emerging markets  Although the coverage may have focused on the bad and the ugly, there are also positive conclusions to be drawn from this week's coverage, especially as publications commented on bitcoin's impact in emerging markets.  Techcrunch'sChristine Magee put it rather well when she said that ""while the tech world is busy speculating about bitcoin's volatile value, cryptocurrency is making arguably its biggest impact in countries where the current price of 1 bitcoin exceeds the average salary earned in a week"".  Kenya, Uruguay and Panama are just some of the few countries playing host to an increasing group of venture-backed bitcoin companies that are utilising the blockchain technology to tackle regional payments challenges.  The news comes after the launch of Mondome, a bitcoin comparison site that seeks out to boost remittances in the digital currency.    The analogy between bitcoin and the internet was regurgitated by Business Insider, which published a profile on Xapo CEO Wences Casares, with ""Star Silicon Valley entrepreneur: Here's why bitcoin will be bigger than the internet"" as its headline.      A serial entrepreneur, Casares created Argentina's first internet provider and later sold his online brokerage firm to Banco Santander for $750 million in 2000. He provides a refreshingly different – albeit bold – view on the future of bitcoin, stating:      ""I think bitcoin may very well be the best form of money we've ever seen in the history of civilisation.""              The future holds many questions for bitcoin, but it seems that the media media coverage is willing to showcase both the extreme positives and negatives of the digital currency – at least for now.

42426284,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhvh,1423855220,"Purse Opens Nakamoto's, San Francisco's Bitcoin-Only Retail Shop","Purse.io, a startup that lets consumers buy Amazon items at a discount using bitcoin, has opened a brick-and-mortar store.  Called Nakamoto’s, the shop is designed to demonstrate that digital currencies can rival other payment methods, offering shoppers significant savings.  Purse  CEO Andrew Lee told CoinDesk:  “The goal for Nakamoto's is to demonstrate the advantage of using bitcoin to mainstream users. The store sells everything for 10% cheaper than Amazon, if paid in bitcoin.”  Lee indicated that he sees a large opportunity in the Nakamoto's concept, and that the company is looking to franchise retail stores that offer bitcoin discounts.  “Purse is the majority shareholder, but we are looking for partners to take over the retail operations and franchising,"" Lee said. ""Nakamoto's is a proof of concept that we hope will be replicated in every major city.”  Notably, the store's location, inside San Francisco’s Mission District, is the one of the fastest-developing and most gentrified areas of the city.  Previously, Nakamoto’s storefront was known as 20Mission, a bitcoin-centric co-working facility that the city reclassified as a strictly commercial retail space.  Inside the store  Over one dozen San Franciscan artisans are located inside the shop, and custom leather goods seem to be a popular offering.  The Nakamoto's section of the store offering Amazon goods only accepts bitcoin, although Lee said the store plans to implement Square as well. Even so, customers using the Square credit and debit card payment method won’t enjoy Purse’s 10% bitcoin discount.  Store operators said they are trying their best to facilitate digital currency payments by having an onsite bitcoin ATM. “If the customer doesn't have bitcoin, a retail associate will guide them to buying bitcoin through [the] ATM,” said Lee.  Nakamoto’s is leveraging Purse’s data to stock in the store what to buy in the area– which consists mostly of electronics.  “The business leverages Purse data to stock items purchased in high frequency by Bay Area bitcoiners. If the store doesn't have the items, they'll order it to your address,"" Lee added.  Bitcoin returns to 20Mission  Lee said 20Mission is a logical tenant for Nakamoto’s because of the concentration of bitcoin interests within the building. The facility offers entrepreneurs housing on the upper floors and houses the Money & Tech production studios for bitcoin-related video content in the basement.  20Mission was purchased by Jered Kenna, an early bitcoin investor and the co-founder of now defunct bitcoin exchange Tradehill. It has acted as a hub for cryptocurrency events and hosted bitcoin meetups and one-off soirées like last year's Bitcoin Art Fair.  Having graduated  the Plug and Play Technology startup accelerator Lee and co-founder Kent Liu moved Purse's operations north to San Francisco’s Mission District, at 20Mission, while it was a co-working space for cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.  20Mission closed because the city insisted it become a retail operation, and it was filled with local artists selling their work.  Purse wanted to return bitcoin to 20Mission through Nakamoto’s. The store currently uses the SnapCard bitcoin point-of-sale solution. The other businesses inside the storefront have seemingly grown accustomed to the digital currency as well.  Nakamoto’s is open Wednesday-Sunday, 14:00-22:00 PST.

42426285,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhxh,1423852227,Bitcoin Payments Still Power 5% of Porn.com Sales,"Bitcoin currently accounts for roughly 5% of all sales at Porn.com, the adult entertainment company that began accepting bitcoin as payment in January 2014.  The findings come roughly one year after Porn.com began accepting bitcoin and as part of an interview with CoinDesk centered on the anniversary.  Porn.com declined to disclose the total sales completed in bitcoin, though vice president Phil Bradbury described these earnings as “substantial”. Notably, the 5% figure is down from the 10% estimate the company reported in February 2014.  Still, Bradbury called bitcoin a “great addition” to the website, one that he said has paid off in unexpected ways, stating:  ”Initially, we were simply trying to capitalize on the fact that bitcoin allowed for somewhat anonymous payments, allowing people to join our site without having to give out their credit card information … Since then we have realized that there are many benefits that we had not thought of.”  Chief among these benefits, he continued, may be the increase in commerce the website sees when its name is mentioned in bitcoin news articles.  Bradbury projects that press coverage related to bitcoin acceptance has been an active driver of business, noting that bitcoin has accounted for up to 50% of the sites sales for periods as long as a few days.  The strong continued sales observed by Porn.com follow less encouraging metrics released by e-commerce giant Overstock, which also began accepting bitcoin in January 2014. Overstock earned $3m in bitcoin sales over the course of the year, which fell below its original estimates of $10m–$15m.  Bitcoin price an influence  While bitcoin sales have largely stabilized, Porn.com reports that there are factors that boost this metric, namely the price of bitcoin.  “We also see an increase in sales when there are large fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, both when the price goes up and when it goes down,” Bradbury said.  Though he didn’t provide month-by-month metrics, Bradbury noted that this 5% figure has been the norm “for some time” since the initial rush of enthusiasm for the program.  Porn.com also noted that is has seen an uptick in sales over the last few weeks, suggesting that sentiment that bitcoin’s price might not again rise is encouraging spending.  “My thoughts are that a lot of people who have been holding their coins, hoping for the price to shoot back up quickly, are starting to begin to spend them again, understanding that much of the price decrease was a correction and that their coins won’t be worth $1,000 again within a week or two,” he added.  The power of community  Besides the sales benefit, Bradbury also spoke to the strength of the bitcoin community, describing its fervent user base as a key driver of awareness.  “The crypto community is pretty tight,” Bradbury continued, “they stick together and they share information. Shortly after launching bitcoin payments on Porn.com, we noticed in communities like Reddit, that users weren’t just sharing the fact that they had joined using bitcoin, they were sharing their experiences with our products.”  Bradbury said that bitcoin users, for instance, would explain how to interact with the company’s live cam models using tokens. Further, he noted that bitcoin users were noticeably more active in commenting on the site and its related products.  “The community not only wants the value of bitcoin to stabilize and increase, they want new products and services to adopt bitcoin payments and there are happy and willing to support those products that help make bitcoin a viable form of payment,” Bradbury explained.  He further touched on the problem of consumer confidence in the adult entertainment space, and how this group, in his opinion, has helped provide benefits to all its customers.  In addition to bitcoin, Porn.com also accepts litecoin, dogecoin and wankcoin. Bradbury said that the company continues to consider other digital currencies for potential acceptance.

42426280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhjh,1423848932,MIT to Host Second Bitcoin Conference in March,"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is set to hold its second industry event in March.  The MIT Bitcoin Expo  will be held over two days on 7th and 8th March, featuring a number of notable speakers from the digital currency ecosystem. The event comes less than a year after the first conference took place in May of 2014.  The event will include speakers such as Circle Internet Financial founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, Chain founder Adam Ludwin and Blockstream co-founder Matt Corallo, among others.  Jinglan Wang, president of the Wellesley Bitcoin Club and the director of the MIT Bitcoin Expo, said that, compared to last year’s more introductory conference, the 2015 gathering is aimed at facilitating more in-depth conversation between local developers and the broader bitcoin industry.  Wang told CoinDesk:  ""We're hoping that this year's event will be more academic. We've got students who have bitcoin and want to build. This our chance to learn from speakers and other attendees; to figure out what to build, how to build it and maybe even find people to build with!”  The full list of planned speakers can be found here.  Bitcoin grows at MIT  MIT and the surrounding Boston area is home to a growing bitcoin ecosystem, one propelled forward by the distribution of $100 in bitcoin to undergraduates beginning in October.  The giveaway was organized by the MIT Bitcoin Project, which sponsored a bitcoin app development contest last summer.  Jonathan Harvey-Buschel, president of the MIT Bitcoin Club, said that the event gives local developers an opportunity to learn how the industry has changed in the past year and “foreshadow the developments to come”.  The idea of bitcoin, according to Harvey-Buschel, is spreading through word of mouth, even by those who aren't actively involved in the university's cryptocurrency organizations.  ""Students are finding existing services to use their bitcoin on, as well as creating their own,"" he said. ""In fact, ordering food online via Foodler using bitcoin was something I had heard about from a student outside of the club, after the airdrop.""

42426304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhnh,1423828067,Bitcoin ATM Selling Gold and Silver Goes Live in Singapore,"A Singapore company has created a way for customers to buy gold and silver directly from a Lamassu bitcoin ATM.  Quantified Assets  , a bitcoin-to-precious metals brokerage, has a prototype machine set up in Singapore's HackerspaceSG, which it is using as a showcase to offer its front-end interface to all 118 Lamassu operators worldwide.  Founder and CEO Ville Oehman told CoinDesk the first request from another Lamassu operator came within ten minutes of announcing the service.  The company has added the functionality by building its own fork of Lamassu's software, which is open source. The ATM manufacturer has given its blessing to the extensions.  Future enhancements  Precious metal purchasing is just one of many potential enhancements to the services bitcoin machines like Lamassu's offer, Oehman said.  ""Bitcoin vending machines are a great interface to the bitcoin ecosystem, and in the future they will provide a lot more functionalities ... like sending money abroad.""  Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey said the company is in communication with Quantitative Assets and will work with its team to get the service integrated with its main platform, so all operators would have the chance to enjoy it.  ""We're excited to see what they've done and how they're received,"" he added.  He did, however, caution against completely replacing the official Lamassu software. While the company is in favor of third parties developing further capabilities for its machines, he said, the company is unable to provide upgrades or support in such cases.  How the process works  The process works as follows: a customer selects 'Buy Gold/Silver' from the ATM's main screen, creates a QR code and supplies an email address. Quantified Assets then creates an account for them which can be accessed from its site.  Next, the customer scans the QR code and inserts their money – the machine's interface will show the current conversion rate.  Finally, the customer receives a receipt for the purchase of the amount of metal their money has bought – this is typically a fraction of a gold bar, Oehman said.  Quantified, one of the oldest bitcoin businesses in Singapore, is a bitcoin-to-metals only service. A customer inserting fiat currency into a Lamassu machine has their money converted first to bitcoin, which is then processed as a purchase of metal for bitcoin.  The physical metal itself is stored with ""with reputable, fully insured and fully audited storage providers"" in Singapore, as per Quantified's customer conditions. It is fully compliant with all Singapore's KYC-AML procedures.  The company has also developed an online platform for 'crowd-buying' gold and silver, which can also be used to access and manage metal assets purchased via Lamassu machines.  Bitcoin, Singapore and hard assets  Singapore has in recent years established itself as a popular valuable asset logistics and vault storage location, even establishing a free port near Changi Airport and a special police force for its international clientele.  Quantified Assets says it plans to integrate hard assets other than just gold and silver into the bitcoin ecosystem, and is in the process of partnering with additional precious metals platforms and vaults to offer increased investment and storage options to its international customers.  ""We are specifically looking for partners in China, Russia and UAE at this time,"" Oehman said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/13/bitcoin-atm-selling-gold-and-silver-goes-live-in-singapore,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b24a2ae92db4bbe0e2decef218bd83b2d594ad1d-1597x1038.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
