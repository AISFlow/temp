In a blog post, Huobi Global, a top-10 exchange by trading volume, said About will “control the majority stake” of Huobi once the deal closes and the ownership transfer will have no impact on trading operations.  The news comes after months of speculation and reports that founder Leon Li was seeking a buyer for his nearly 60% stake in Huobi, and was asking for at least $1 billion. The terms of the deal with About Capital were not disclosed.  Under new ownership, the exchange is plotting an international expansion and will receive an “injection of sufficient capital in margin and risk provision fund,” the blog post said.  In a statement, Li, who founded Huobi in China in 2013, said the exchange's late 2021 departure from the Chinese mainland kicked off a globalization push that will now accelerate under About Capital.

42435053,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnme7,1665175192,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin, Other Risk Assets Fall Again Following Disappointing Jobs Data","Price Action  Bitcoin and ether traded down to close the week, decreasing in line with traditional risk assets, though not to the same extent.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, decreased -0.80%.  In traditional financial markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, were down 2.1%, 3.8%, and 2.8%, respectively.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply to start the U.S. trading day, decreasing 1.9% on heavy volume following the release of the U.S. jobs report. Prices recovered slightly in subsequent hours before declining again to around $19,450.  Ether (ETH), which still maintains a tight relationship with BTC, traded in similar fashion. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization shed 1.7% during the 12:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. ET) hour, also on higher-than- average volume.  Both BTC and ETH have resiliently held within a narrow band throughout the recent flurry of economic releases – good ones and bad ones alike. BTC’s increased correlation to gold prices further reflects its muted volatility. Gold has historically been viewed as a haven asset for investors.  U.S. jobs growth slowedin September, but by not as much as most market observers expected. Non-farm payrolls increased by 263,000, a 17% decrease from August, but more than the projected 250,000.  The unemployment rate declined to 3.5% versus expectations of 3.7%, and the labor participation rate was 62.3% essentially identical to the 62.4% rate in the prior month.  The employment figures offered the latest evidence that the economy is slowing, but not enough for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group of Federal Reserve officials that sets the central bank’s policy rate, to justify pivoting away from its recent spate of hikes.  The CME FedWatch tool now assigns an 82.3% chance for a 75 basis point rate hike in November, up from 56.5% just a week ago. The next question may be whether market participants begin considering the probability of a 100 basis point increase.  The higher increase seems unlikely unless the September consumer price index report on Oct. 13 is surprisingly high. A greater-than-expected report would indicate that current efforts to stem inflation are not working as well as the Fed would like. A plausible outcome in this scenario would be even more aggressive rate hikes.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin searching for trading level following release of jobs data  Friday’s labor market report was better than expected, which is bad news for risk assets in the current environment.  The decline in traditional equities is pronounced, though more in aggregate than percentage terms. A few data points stand out in BTC’s hourly chart today.  Momentum increased prior to the jobs announcement, on a progressively narrower trading range.  The post-announcement decline was exacerbated by excessive trading volume, which placed downward pressure on prices.  The volume profile visible range (VPVR) tool highlights the lack of volume between $19,900 and $19,500 for BTC. Prices tend to move rapidly through “low-volume node” areas such as these, in search of an area where a large degree of price agreement exists.  The move higher during the 14:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET) hour came on lower-than-average volume, which can be interpreted as a bearish signal.  The relative strength index (RSI), often used to indicate whether an asset is over- or undervalued, only reached oversold levels during the 15:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET) hour.  That BTC prices fell below the next high-volume node at $19,500 is likely concerning for traders because the next price level where significant agreement exists is close to $19,200.  The $19,200 mark is dangerously close to the $19,000 mark where the open interest for put options (which give the right to sell), exceeds that of call options (the right to buy). Breaching this level is likely to put additional weight on the price of BTC.  Investors should monitor BTC’s reaction to moving into oversold territory, particularly in trading volume. Low buying volume at BTC’s current level would indicate more trouble to come, at least in the short term.  On-chain analytics offer a glimmer of hope, as the movement of stablecoins onto centralized exchanges has been increasing, while BTC flows onto exchanges has been falling.  As stablecoins can represent dry powder for investors looking to go long, the recent increase implies bullish sentiment by investors who may simply be lying in wait for their desired price point.  By contrast, the inflows of BTC onto exchanges has declined. Typically, BTC moving to exchanges represents a willingness to sell. The extent to which this changes or stays the same within the next few days will be key to evaluating the next price direction.

42411343,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEWZ,1665174600,What’s Inside the FSOC’s Long-awaited Report on Crypto Regulation,"The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) published its own highly anticipated report in response to U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto earlier this week, calling on Congress to define the line between a security and a non-security, at least as far as crypto is concerned.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  FSOC: Do something, Congress!  The narrative  The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) finally published a long-anticipated report about the regulation of crypto. Essentially, FSOC said it believes federal agencies already have much of the authority they need to oversee large chunks of the crypto sector. The one area it really asked for Congress to get involved is defining just where the limits of securities regulation should be. In other words, much of this wasn’t really a surprise.  Why it matters  Where the line is between a crypto security and a crypto commodity is the question in the U.S.: Where exactly does the Securities and Exchange Commission's authority end and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's authority begin? Congress has not really tried to answer that question. Sure, there are bills that sort of seek to address that, such as the Senate Agriculture Committee’s DCCPA. But a closer look at the text shows that it doesn't actually provide that definition. This has left much of crypto in an odd sort of limbo.  Breaking it down  FSOC published a 124-page document on Monday. Here’s CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton on the highlights.  As a quick reminder, the council is composed of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Acting Chair Martin Gruenberg, National Credit Union Administration Chair Todd Harper and a handful of others.  The actual report went largely into detail on what currently exists in crypto, detailing existing rules and regulations, some of the recent events and precedents that we’ve seen and a summary of how regulators see crypto posing eventual risks to the U.S. and possibly the broader financial system.  “Some characteristics of crypto-asset activities have acutely amplified instability within the crypto-asset ecosystem. Many crypto-asset activities lack basic risk controls to protect against run risk or to help ensure that leverage is not excessive. Crypto-asset prices appear to be primarily driven by speculation rather than grounded in current fundamental economic use cases, and prices have repeatedly recorded significant and broad declines,” the report said.  The report also took aim at how a lot of the companies that offer services in the crypto ecosystem advertise themselves as regulated. They’re not lying, but the report is concerned that usually this means they’re overseen as money transmitters.  FSOC is concerned that money transmitter frameworks don’t have a huge focus on anti-money laundering controls, customer protection and absolutely does not look at financial stability concerns.  In particular, the report says that there are issues with the spot market for cryptocurrencies. Namely, there is no federal spot market regulator or framework. There's also no real international framework, which could allow different entities to conduct regulatory arbitrage.  Another concern seems to take aim at FTX (and I guess CME now) by noting that some platforms want to offer retail customers direct access to their markets, which again raises some stability questions.  In short: Financial stability (obviously) is the key concern by way of how crypto interacts with the rest of the world, whether that’s through stablecoin payments, banking activities, tokenized real-world assets, investment products or even just this general idea that crypto and crypto tools may be used to facilitate, replace or even just bolster some of the more traditional financial activities that take place out there.  And then there's the hacks and crashes. A fairly significant section of the report is focused on the fact that much of crypto is built around speculative trading, but is vulnerable to frequent hacks (as of this writing, the most recent hack is around 15 hours old) and other issues.  “Fundamental economic use cases do not currently anchor prices of many crypto assets. Rather than reflecting analysis of cash flows, crypto-asset prices may reflect the probability that economic use cases could develop in the future, balanced against the probability, as expressed by some industry commenters, that no significant economic uses for blockchain technologies may develop,” the report said.  The prevalence of (alleged) fraudsters also naturally takes on a star role.  To wit: The important part is the recommendations here. The first two are straight forward –= regulators should treat crypto risks like they treat other risks, keep enforcing rules, etc.  The third, fifth, sixth recommendation calls on Congress to get busy.  “The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation that provides for explicit rulemaking authority for federal financial regulators over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities,” the report said in recommendation three. “The Council recommends that this rulemaking authority should not interfere with or weaken market regulators’ current jurisdictional remits.”  Recommendation five called for stablecoin legislation, six called for letting regulators coordinate or even supersede affiliate and subsidiary regulation (if those subsidiaries are operating under, say, a state regulator rather than a federal one),  Other recommendations include closer coordination between different regulators, whether that’s state-to-state or with different types of regulatory entities, and having federal regulators continually build out and reassess their crypto knowledge as they oversee and license different entities.  There's also a call for “a coordinated government-wide approach to data and to the analysis, monitoring, supervision, and regulation of crypto-asset activities. The Council recommends that member agencies consider the use of available data collection powers in order to facilitate assessments of the financial risks related to crypto-assets, as part of data sharing and coordination efforts among the members.”  The other thing that’s really interesting is we sort of previewed the report on Monday with the New York Fed, which published a research paper earlier in the day detailing some of the concerns that exist about stablecoins. In particular, it said even supposedly safe stablecoins like USDC might pose a risk to the broader financial sector if it becomes a safe haven for people fleeing less-safe stablecoins backed by sketchy assets.

Dapper, the company behind popular NFT collections such as NBA Top Shot, said, “It is now prohibited to provide crypto-asset wallet, account or custody services of any value to accounts with connections to Russia.”  Impacted users can still look at their NFTs, but they cannot move funds, gift tokens, sell NFTs or buy new ones, Dapper said in the post, citing its payment processor.  On Thursday, the European Union confirmed its ban on transferring money to and from Russian crypto wallets, accounts and custody providers after proposals of the restrictions the week prior. This is a tightening of the EU’s limitations of Russian crypto wallet payments, which previously capped the amount at 10,000 euros in April. As of Thursday, Russian users cannot transfer any funds, including crypto funds, to or from the EU.  While crypto exchange OKX cut off its services in the country earlier this week, it's likely that more crypto products will follow as restrictions tighten.

The deals involve cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and Flourish, a fintech company owned by 171-year-old insurance giant MassMutual, plugging into Envestnet’s RIA software known as Tamarac. This is the latest doorway to open for RIAs and accredited investors that could lead to broader crypto investing. Last month, investment management giant Franklin Templeton announced plans to offer digital asset strategies to wealth managers. Earlier this week, Fidelity launched its first Ethereum-focused index fund.  Financial advisers managing the assets of individual and institutional investors have shown an increased willingness to offer clients access to cryptocurrencies. However, potential hurdles include the difficulty of offering an emerging asset class within battle-tested, institutional-grade technological infrastructures. Integrations can bring crypto to the advisers on their home field.  “Many of these advisers are interested in offering crypto to their clients, but they have highly specific needs – from regulatory and compliance considerations to specific tech functionality to integrations into their key reporting systems,” Flourish President Ben Cruikshank told CoinDesk in an email. “As a result, they can't use the big retail exchanges.”  Gemini BITRA  Through the new integration with Gemini, advisers and clients can now view their crypto portfolios, performance data and billing information from within the Tamarac dashboard that RIAs are already using. This comes through Gemini BITRIA, a system Gemini acquired in January to offer a combination of adviser-focused services, including asset custody, liquidity, trading, portfolio construction and reporting.  ""Gemini has built an ecosystem around the BITRIA platform that serves both wealth and asset managers. This approach means that advisers who participate in the Envestnet | Tamarac ecosystem will enjoy a much cleaner, more streamlined workflow,” Daniel Eyre, head of Gemini BITRA, told CoinDesk in an email.  Flourish Crypto  The Flourish integration brings Flourish Crypto’s data into the general workflow for Tamarac users, allowing advisers to handle crypto the same way as any other asset class. Features include portfolio management, reporting and planning support, and billing.  MassMutual acquired Flourish in February 2021 following a $100 million investment in bitcoin and the purchase of a $5 million equity stake in custodian NYDIG in December 2020. Flourish, which works exclusively with independent RIAs, launched Flourish Crypto with custodian Paxos as a way for advisers and their clients to invest in bitcoin.  “Envestnet | Tamarac is one of the largest adviser-centric reporting software platforms, used by thousands of advisers. By launching this integration, crypto investing has now become one huge step more accessible to RIAs, giving them access to crypto just like any other asset class or investment,” explained Cruikshank.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/07/rich-investors-pathway-to-crypto-just-got-a-bit-easier-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae569b94b8f7d794eb999d6b27e677767577035d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iodh,1665171377,Independent Examiner Ordered to Produce Interim Report About Crypto Lender Celsius,"The independent examiner in crypto lender Celsius Network’s bankruptcy will need to produce an interim report detailing Celsius’ financial management and handling of customer accounts, U.S. bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn ruled Friday during a court hearing.  The interim report, expected to be filed in mid-November, will form part of the process to determine who owns the crypto assets held in Custody and Withhold accounts, and under what circumstances Custody and Withhold account holders may access their holdings, according to the ruling.  Celsius had been one of the most prominent crypto lenders, and its bankruptcy left many thousands of customers waiting for funds that are currently trapped on the platform. The U.S. Trustee’s office, a Department of Justice entity, appointed Shoba Pillay, a Chicago-based partner at law firm Jenner & Block, as an independent examiner to probe into Celsius’ operation, financial management and handling of crypto accounts that led it to file for bankruptcy earlier this summer.  Pillay’s interim report will mark the “first time the court will hear from an independent, neutral third party on a number of critical issues in the case,” Dov Kleiner, a partner at law firm Kleinberg Kaplan, told CoinDesk in an email. “She is expected to weigh in on, among other things, where currencies were held, how they were stored and moved around and to whom they currently belong.”  The report may also affect decisions about potential preference claims and transaction clawbacks.  Judge Glenn expressed worries about Celsius management members withdrawing assets before Celsius’ bankruptcy. The examiner is expected to look into insider transactions, too.  Alex Mashinsky, former CEO of the crypto lender, and Daniel Leon, former chief strategy officer, who both resigned recently, withdrew a combined $17 million in crypto from their accounts between May and mid-June, when Celsius halted all user withdrawals, CoinDesk reported this week. Celsius' current chief technology officer, Nuke Goldstein, also withdrew some $13 million, but then deposited the majority of it to another account.  According to U.S. law, insiders’ withdrawals may be subject to clawback up to a year prior filing for bankruptcy.

42422220,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ionh,1665168786,"Valkyrie Funds, Ark Invest Say Crypto Has Hit ‘Bottom’ Amid Recession Woes","On Friday the Labor Department reported U.S. job growth rose by 263,000 during September, which was better than expected but still lower than August’s 315,000 additional jobs.  So does the decrease in new jobs signal a change in Federal Reserve thinking, and how would that affect cryptocurrencies?  Asset managers, from Ark Invest and Valkyrie see crypto as having hit bottom, meaning it can go no lower in price, at a time when the Federal Reserve’s “tug-of-war” with the global macro environment could lead to continued interest rate hikes.  “Whether the Federal Reserve oversteps and makes a policy mistake, we’re essentially pricing in a recession,” Frank Downing, director of research at Ark Invest, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday.  Read more: US Jobs Growth Slows Less Than Expected; Bitcoin Slips From $20K  Steven McClurg, co-founder of asset management firm Valkyrie, agreed, adding that “we’re definitely in a recession.”  According to Downing, bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of “constructive developments,” referring to the small increase of “supply held by long-term holders.”  “The cost basis of those long-term holders has actually climbed above the cost basis of short-term holders, which historically has been a strong bottoming signal,” Downing said.  Read more: First Mover Americas: It’s Payrolls Day Again, and Bitcoin Holds Tight Near $20K  Nonetheless, crypto has “gone down more than the rest of the market,” McClurg said.  “The markets are clearly in a downward trajectory at the moment,” McClurg said. But “crypto is probably closer to the bottom than the S&P [500] or Nasdaq.”  In the near term, McClurg said, “prices will continue to go down across all risk assets until there’s a pivot from the Federal Reserve.”  The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee is likely to raise interest rates by 75 basis points at its next meeting in November, followed by a 50 bps rise in December and then upwards of 25 basis points two times after that over the next year, predicted McClurg.  Crypto separately managed accounts (SMAs) to hit the market  Despite Downing and McClurg’s bearish outlook in the near term, the fund managers are optimistic about the future of crypto.  The two asset management firms have each launched individual crypto-based separately managed accounts (SMA), which will primarily be managed by financial advisors who will serve as intermediaries for investors.  “We take that risk on for them and we manage that risk properly,” McClurg said. “Additionally, we have set it up to where they can move in and out of that product very quickly through a redemption or an order process.”  Read more: Valkyrie Funds to Offer Crypto SMAs, Challenging Ark and Franklin Templeton  Downing of Ark Invest, which recently said it would be working with Eaglebook Advisors to manage risk for its investors, is operating under a similar strategy where it takes on crypto risk while also holding onto the keys.  “Advisors will be able to invest their client funds with low minimums, [which] has direct integrations to existing portfolio management tools used by advisors,” Downing said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/07/valkyrie-funds-ark-invest-say-crypto-has-hit-bottom-amid-recession-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34a6bf53a39cd1f559425199b3dea8c5e11a6c4d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411338,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEG2,1665164610,"Powell’s Interest-rate Antibiotics Could Succeed, but Not Without Risk","There has been renewed speculation in recent days about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s commitment to its rate-hiking cycle. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been unwavering in his clear message that the beatings will continue until discipline improves: In August he said rates could keep going up “for some time,” and in early September that hikes would continue “until the job is done.”  That job, of course, is to get inflation back down to the Fed’s 2% target range, from the 8.3% consumer price index reading in mid-September. That print saw the curve bending further downward from the peak reading of 9.1% in June. (The next CPI report will come Oct. 13.)  I’ve seen a handful of optimists speculate that we could bend the curve so fast that we’d wind up seeing rates drop back down again in 2023. That includes more than a few cryptocurrency speculators who would love a rate cut, which would send capital back into “risk-on” mode and likely juice (highly speculative) token prices. But the idea that we’ll actually whip inflation that fast strikes me as verging on delusion – or what we in the cryptoverse call “hopium.”  What’s more interesting are the growing signs that rate hikes are slowing down the real economy, and tentative voices from within the Fed itself that suggest some (very mild) resistance to Powell’s unwavering rate-hiking agenda. This has been seized on by the hopeful, who would love to see Powell reinstate the Alan Greenspan-era “Fed put” after staggering stock market losses. Such a reversal still seems, at best, optimistic.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The flavors of hopium: A soft landing or a Powell capitulation?  The hopeful narrative does correctly identify the horns of the Fed’s dilemma: To bring inflation down, a central bank must by definition tighten the money supply to shrink both asset prices and the economy. The question is whether rate hikes can cure inflation with a sharp dose of interest-rate antibiotics that leave the economy healthy, or if Powell is committed to more radical measures that could risk killing the patient.  For now, within the U.S., rising interest rates haven’t proven fatal. Consumer spending, one of Powell’s main targets, remains relatively solid. Unemployment reached a historically low 3.5% in September. Lots of jobs are going unfilled.  Of course, that means different things to different people. While they’re good for workers, sticky unemployment and wages are one of the core factors making the Fed’s efforts to tackle inflation difficult. Here, as with supply chains, COVID-19 is the culprit. Wages and employment remain high largely because labor force participation is still 1% below February 2020 levels, thanks to factors from early retirement to long COVID. Raising interest rates isn’t going to counter those forces.  Read more: What the Black Plague Can Teach Us About Today's Jobs Report  Outside of the U.S., things look far grimmer – and U.S. interest rates are exacerbating those worries, particularly through devastating drops in dollar exchange rates worldwide. On Thursday morning, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund announced a pending downward revision in its global economic forecast. The United Nations issued a similar warning just a few days before. It’s not the Fed’s job to directly concern itself with international impacts, but a global slump could in turn slow the U.S. economy, so these signals must have some amount of resonance.  If you really squint, maybe you can connect those dots to a speech last week by Fed Vice Chair Leal Brainard that some saw as at least slightly more dovish than Powell’s party line. Among other points, Brainard warned that the effect of rate hikes can take time to reach the real economy.  From one angle, that might be a sotto voce call for caution in near-future hikes because impacts of the high-G launch from 0.25% in March to 3.5% by late September have almost certainly not fully trickled down yet. Of course, if you’re reading Brainard’s statement from Main Street, your takeaway might be a little more visceral: Hang on tight, things could get worse.  One looming X-factor is Europe’s possibly imminent energy crisis. With Russian oil largely inaccessible, winter could bring huge electric bills or productivity cuts, or both. The recent upheaval in U.K. bond markets has been cited as another sign of financial markets pushed to the brink by rising global rates – though you could also look at Prime Minister Liz Truss and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng’s ideological pipe-bomb of a fiscal policy agenda and see a quite inverse lesson about the value of predictability.  Regardless, one might argue that international markets are poised to do a bit of the Fed’s work for it: a more expensive dollar and an international recession could help U.S. inflation by pushing import prices down, and the U.S. is very import dependent.  More money, more problems  These and other factors, along with the drops we’ve already seen in U.S. inflation, could be interpreted as part of the case for Powell to pause rate hikes. The time-lag element of inflation measurement makes it all even more nerve-wracking because responding to lagging indicators could lead to an overreaction and an excessive economic contraction – a cure that kills the patient. (Analyst Omair Sharif recently made a particularly important point about the risk that lagging health care cost measurement is currently distorting CPI upward.)  But the simple truth is that 8.1% is still way, way above 2%. And there remain signs in the real economy that there’s room to tighten – including, like it or not, in crypto.  Read more: Is Powell 2022’s Paul Volcker? The Answer Matters to Bitcoin  Venture capitalists are still betting big on cryptocurrency and blockchain, despite growing competition from lower-risk bonds for marginal dollars. Crypto VC hit record levels in the first quarter of this year, before the extent of the crypto crash was clear and with interest rate hikes barely started. But the crash and further hikes didn’t scare them off: In the second quarter, crypto VC declined only slightly from that record high. I heard anecdotal signs of continued strength in VC numbers when I was at Messari’s Mainnet conference last month, and funding announcements for individual projects are continuing at a breakneck pace.  This is certainly great for crypto, and suggests deep faith in the sector among professional investors. But if you’re Jerome Powell, it all goes into one big pool called “speculative investing” that you might consider a proxy for excess funds sloshing around the economy.  The catch is that those funds also represent jobs, and even if Powell could target monetary tightening only to certain sectors or uses (which he can’t), he’d still be slowing down the economy. The real question is whether that slowdown can happen without either broad immiseration, or the kind of chaotic unwind that made the 2008 financial crisis so terrifying.  So far, the good news is that cooling both the U.S. and global economies has been, at a high level, a relatively gentle process. Even the sharp turmoil in U.K. bonds over the past week didn’t lead to credit or liquidity freezes in bond markets there, as analyst Toby Nangle told Bloomberg’s Odd Lots team. Former New York Fed President William Dudley told the Wall Street Journal that “so far, there haven’t been any really bad surprises.”  That is (again, so far) a vindication for reforms that strengthened bank capital requirements and other financial backstops after 2008. Those protections have meant air could be let out of the tires gently. On some level it’s remarkable, perhaps even an achievement, that the S&P 500 has declined nearly 25% since the start of the year without a frightening number of financial blowups or corporate bankruptcies.  On the other hand, it’s an open question just how much confidence we should gain from the lack of catastrophe “so far.” The battle against inflation is far from over. Arguably, it has barely begun. Gentle economic declines can become sudden, vacuumous sinkholes without much warning – and the risks that really matter are the ones that are hidden from talking heads like me. Otherwise, they wouldn't really be risks.  But while it’s reasonable to have some anxiety about a Fed overcorrection, it’s important to remember that the same mechanism that’s reining in the economy is creating headroom for revitalizing it if things do go south. While persistent inflation would make the decision much dicier, a Fed rate at 3.5% also means we now have a lot of room to lower rates to fight a future recession. That’s another way to think about Jerome Powell’s persistence: As he fights inflation today, he’s also storing up basis points for winter.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  On Thursday, a hundred police officers took to the streets of six Brazilian cities to serve search and seizure warrants against Francisley Valdevino da Silva, who is accused of running a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that raised $767 million.  At the time of publication, there was no news on whether he had been arrested. The justice also decreed that da Silva’s assets be seized and blocked.  According to a Brazilian Police report, da Silva, known as the “cryptocurrency sheik” and a former U.S. resident, raised more than four billion reals (US$767 million) by promising high returns through alleged crypto operations since 2016.  According to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement press release, the Brazilian Federal Police executed 20 search and seizure warrants in four Brazilian states in the case for crimes including money laundering and fraud.  The U.S. agency said that “the organization allegedly deceived investors in over a dozen countries by falsely claiming that they had developed fully functioning, cutting-edge cryptocurrency-related financial products.”  According to the Brazilian Police report, da Silva's lawyer said his client is cooperating with the police and had already made himself available.

42422216,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iohh,1665163292,It's Lonely in the Metaverse: DappRadar Data Suggests Decentraland Has 38 ‘Daily Active’ Users in $1.3B Ecosystem,"What’s going on in the metaverse these days, you might ask. Looking at two of the biggest companies with over $1 billion valuations, one data point suggests that users may not be returning every day. According to data aggregator DappRadar, the Ethereum-based virtual world Decentraland had 38 “active users” in the past 24 hours, while competitor The Sandbox had 522 “active users” in that same time.  It’s important to note that an active user, according to DappRadar, is defined as a unique wallet address’ interaction with the platform’s smart contract. For example, logging onto The Sandbox or Decentraland to make a purchase with SAND or MANA, each platform’s respective native utility token, is counted as an “active use.”  This means that DappRadar’s compilation of daily ""active users"" doesn’t count people who simply log in and interact with other users on a metaverse platform or drop in briefly for an event, such as a virtual fashion week. It also may mean that fewer transactions, like buying or selling a non-fungible token (NFT), take place on these platforms than the number of people that visit.  The largest number of daily ""active users” ever on Decentraland was 675, according to DappRadar. For The Sandbox, that number was larger at about 4,503.  Sam Hamilton, Creative Director at Decentraland, disputed the way DappRadar tracks daily ""active users” on the platform. “DappRadar doesn't track our users, only people interacting with our contracts,” he told CoinDesk, adding that the platform had 8,000 users on average per day, though he did not specify what makes an “active use” versus a more passive interaction. He noted that while Decentraland saw peak attendees in March, the number of “tourists and spectators” has since cooled down. “We are finding the core community of people returning every day is growing.”  According to Hamilton, the number of users on Decentraland can be more accurately observed by looking at a dashboard built by the platform’s community. The data measures ""unique visitors per day"" and looks at different periods of time between 7, 14, 30 and 90 days. From Oct. 3-9, the platform averaged 6,999 “unique visitors per day.” The same data tool measures the number of “parcels visited per day” and “marathon users,” which it defines as users with the most online time.  Following the publication of this article, Decentraland tweeted that it saw ""1,074 users interacting with smart contracts"" in September. It also logged 56,697 ""monthly active users,” noting that the Decentraland Foundation’s definition of an “active user” is “people who login and then move out of a parcel.” It added that “there might be discrepancies between DCL Metrics and Foundation data.”  The Sandbox also disputed the metrics used by DappRadar to measure daily active users on its platform. CEO and co-founder Arthur Madrid told CoinDesk that DappRadar’s metric only reflects transactions between users or a primary NFT sale and not other forms of meaningful engagement. In addition, he said that The Sandbox measures active users by looking at a number of metrics, including their usage over time and retention.  “An 'active user' is a user that connects over a period of time,” he explained. “A daily 'active user' is someone that connects at least once a day.""  “Imagine you only track the number of people paying for something at a cashier at a shopping mall,” he said. “That doesn’t mean there aren’t a lot of passerbys.”  In a follow-up tweet, Madrid said that measuring on-chain transactions does not capture the number of users on the platform.  DappRadar did not respond to a request for comment on whether its metrics more accurately reflect daily active users on Decentraland and The Sandbox.  It’s worth noting that Decentraland and The Sandbox each have high valuations. According to data from Messari, Decentraland and The Sandbox both have market caps of around $1.3 billion each.  Although the metaverse may be enough of a buzzword for companies to rebrand their names around its concept, some say mass adoption may still take a while.  Sasha Fleyshman, portfolio manager at digital asset investment firm Arca, told CoinDesk that metaverse platforms will be much more valuable to users when they actually operate as intended.  “Anyone telling you that there's a metaverse today that has worked is lying through their teeth,” said Fleyshman.

In July, skater Tony Hawk announced his virtual skatepark paired with an avatar collection in The Sandbox, which aims to bring fans from his $1.4 billion “Tony Hawk Pro Skater” video game to a new, more interactive platform. Set to run from October 19 to 23, the turnout of virtual skaters may be larger than the users purchasing Hawk’s NFTs in SAND.  “In my opinion, we're leaning towards a lack of product-market fit on that side … irrespective of their valuation,” said Fleyshman.

While these matters are outstanding, there can be no timeline established for resolution.”  According to figures self-reported from LFG, the foundation’s reserve’s currently total around $100 million. That’s a drop in the bucket of the estimated $60 billion in value wiped out by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.  Although LFG cited legal reasons for pausing its treasury distribution plans, Friday's statement comes after reports that South Korean authorities had frozen nearly $40 million worth of blockchain funds tied to LFG. ""I don't know whose funds they've frozen, but good for them, hope they use it for good,"" Terra founder Do Kwon tweeted in response.  LFG was established by Terra creators Terraform Labs in January with a mandate to protect the $1 peg of terraUSD (UST), Terra's ill-fated algorithmic stablecoin.

The report also said the millions of dollars continue to be sent to paramilitary groups that are often officially sanctioned.  The analyses involved separate findings from cryptocurrency-tracing firms Chainalysis, Elliptic and TRM Labs, along with investigators at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.  Chainalysis traced roughly $1.8 million in funding to the militias in just the past two months, the report said. In the five months prior, the groups received $2.2 million. Binance found that $4.2 million in crypto have been funneled to Russian military groups since February. The findings between Chainalysis and Binance didn't entirely overlap.  Despite tracing the funds, stopping their flow has proven difficult due to unregulated or sanctioned cryptocurrency exchanges, most of them in Russia.  “With the close cooperation of companies like Chainalysis and Binance, we can see all the wallets involved in this criminal activity,"" said Serhii Kropyva, former deputy of Ukraine’s Cyber Police and adviser to the country’s prosecutor general.

42420937,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvwb,1665158187,Global Crypto Standards Due Next Week Could Test Regulators’ Tech Mantra,"Next week could prove a turning point in the global regulation of crypto finance – and ministers from the world’s 20 biggest economies will potentially confront the system change posed by decentralized finance (DeFi).  The Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global watchdog, will set out plans for regulating crypto markets by the middle of next week – and it may have to consider whether to carry on sharpening the tools it already has in its toolbox or go in a whole new direction to rein in the ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi).  The FSB has an influential role in setting international norms – it wrote the current rulebook for financial markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Back in July it set out its crypto agenda, in the form of two consultations which it wants to present to G20 finance ministers ahead of a meeting next Wednesday and Thursday in Washington.  Many markets suffer from volatility – but the FSB is really worried about crypto instability filtering through to up-end the conventional financial system. That could happen, for example, if the instability undermines general investor confidence, if it affects short-term financing markets like money-market funds or if people started widely using a stablecoin to pay for everyday goods.  It’ll revisit its existing norms on stablecoins – crypto assets that seek to maintain their value with respect to fiat currency – which it first issued back in October 2020. FSB will also submit another draft report for “promoting international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches to other crypto-assets and crypto-asset markets” – something that could extend much further into the Web3 ecosystem.  The FSB’s existing norms on stablecoins are high-level, urging countries to ensure major stablecoins are included within regulatory oversight – and even those recommendations have seen patchy take-up.  Read more: Global Financial Watchdog FSB to Propose Crypto Regulations in October  This time it’s different  But there are a number of reasons to think this time round the standards will be both tougher – and better heeded.  The market has changed since 2020, when the main threat was the incursion of the Big Tech player then known as Facebook (now Meta), via its backing for the stablecoin it was developing, then known as libra (later diem, subsequently scuttled). This time real-life assets like tether (USDT) have become much bigger. They haven’t yet taken over the financial system, as some worried Facebook might do, but they pose risks of their own. The dramatic collapse of stablecoin terraUSD earlier this year vindicated many of the things the FSB had been seeking, such as the need to have a decent stabilization mechanism and keep proper reserves.  That suggests the FSB might not just review its stablecoin rules, but rewrite them.  Plus the FSB’s two most muscular members, the U.S and the EU, are now starting to act. They will likely want others to follow suit – to avoid crypto companies, as they see it, stealing their business by offshoring to less-regulated climes. (China, the G20’s other major economy, may well simply sit this one out, having more or less opted not to control crypto but to ban it.)  In the U.S., regulators have spent recent weeks issuing their own series of reports – requested by President Joe Biden – outlining how they intend to approach crypto. The Financial Stability Oversight Council this week cited the urgent need for stablecoin oversight and a regulator for non-security tokens like bitcoin (BTC). Clear guidance from the FSB could give a nudge to Congress, currently too bogged down by the end of the current legislative session and midterm elections to push on with legislation.  The EU, finalizing its own Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, is now looking to ensure that others are keeping up. Among the first public remarks she made after a deal was struck on MiCA back in June, the European Commission's financial-services chief, Mairead McGuinness, told CoinDesk she was hoping for greater international cooperation on crypto.  The EU lawmaker who led talks on the regulation, Stefan Berger, appears to agree with her.  “The EU will become a global standard-setter,” thanks to MiCA, Berger tweeted on Wednesday, suggesting he’d seen considerable interest in the law from people in the U.S. on his recent trip there.  New paradigm  Policymakers are certainly hyping what the FSB could deliver.  “In 2023, we will have a global, consistent and comprehensive framework to tackle crypto-assets,” French central bank Governor François Villeroy de Galhau said in a speech given in September, referring to the forthcoming norms.  And that framework could prove a boon to some in the industry. Take the case of Ripple, which is currently attempting to fight against a legal case mounted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging the XRP cryptocurrency is a security that should have been federally registered by Ripple.  That kind of regulatory uncertainty offers companies an unwelcome and unhelpful surprise, Ripple’s head of policy, Sue Friedman, told CoinDesk, and an international framework could help.  “We certainly don't want to create an ecosystem where an asset is considered a non-security in one jurisdiction but is blocked as a security in another,” Friedman said in an online interview.  “I don't think that they [the FSB] are going to go so far as to actually say what they consider a security versus what is not,” she added. “I fully expect a call for higher standards and international coordination, and we believe it makes a lot of sense.”  Yet it’s not immediately clear how the FSB will do that – thanks, in part, to the emergence of transformative technologies like DeFi .  Existing crypto laws largely extend existing financial rules, under the mantra of “same activity, same risk, same regulation.” That means stablecoin issuers have to prudently manage assets, and crypto wallet providers check the identity of their customers, just as banks must.  The aim of regulation should be “holding crypto assets, including stablecoins, to the same standards as the rest of the financial system,” the group of the world’s seven largest developed democracies said in May, apparently supporting a continuation of that steady-as-she-goes approach.  Yet piling obligations on regulated intermediaries may not be possible if there is no single entity responsible – say, because lending is done by a software protocol rather than a bank. The traditional approach may also miss the point given the novel – and inherently cross-border – risks involved in DeFi.  Supervisors in traditional finance obsessively monitor the balance sheets of huge banking or insurance behemoths. In DeFi, the individual entities involved may be much smaller, and the collapse of any one is unlikely to bring down the financial system – yet there are other threats, like that a single software bug could spiral out of control.  Read more: International Regulators Struggle With How to Oversee DeFi  That was certainly the conclusion of the Financial Stability Institute's Fernando Restoy back in September, when he suggested a wholescale rethink to deal with DeFi. His argument has since been echoed by John Berrigan, the Brussels official who runs the European Commission’s financial-services department.  “The intermediary in decentralized finance may not be something that you can regulate via behavioral incentives,” Berrigan said in an interview published by the commission Sept. 30. “It is a huge challenge and it will probably require some reflection – not just on the procedures for how we regulate, but on the essence of the regulations.”  Not everyone is so convinced there’s anything truly transformational about DeFi. Decentralization is often an “illusion” because consensus mechanisms often still involve a concentration of power, and there’s normally some kind of body in the middle on which regulatory obligations can be pinned, argued the Bank for International Settlements in December.  Faced with that skepticism, the FSB’s foray into DeFi seems likely, for the time being, to be tentative.  Jesse Hamilton contributed reporting.

42411342,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNETG,1665157029,What the Black Plague Can Teach Us About Today's Jobs Report,"As the world continues to agonize over inflation and the harsh spillover effects from U.S. efforts to fight it, today’s U.S. jobs report suggests interest rate hikes are having only a moderate impact on employment and, by extension, wage growth. The U.S. added 263,000 jobs in September, a mild decline from August, and the unemployment rate actually dipped from 3.7% in August to 3.5%, a historically low number.  This is rather stunning after eight months of aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve – hikes that are fully intended to cool down the overall economy, including damping demand for workers. Instead, the outcome so far has been a decline in asset prices by a third or more across the board, while wages and employment remain solid.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  CNBC’s Jim Cramer captured the sense of surprise this morning: “Labor number red hot ...”, he tweeted. “Nothing yet from rate increases … plenty of reasons to keep raising.”  Of course, that sounds worrying for financial markets, including crypto, and it is – continued rate hikes will add downward pressure to assets. But more broadly, strong jobs numbers are no bad thing: Mass unemployment is far worse for society than a dreary asset market, at least in the short term.  But how to explain the disconnect?  In simple terms: The U.S. lost an immense number of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. One study found 500,000 workers left the labor force after contracting COVID. Another study by the Brookings Institution concludes that between 2 million and 4 million Americans have left the workforce because of “long COVID,” or the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Of the more than 1 million Americans who have died of COVID-19, a large majority were workers.  Those numbers have very different methodologies, but together they give at least a rough sense of the impact of COVID-19 on America’s labor force of 165 million: Workforce losses could be on the order of 3%.  That’s a huge contraction that would help explain a lot about the job market right now. But it’s absolutely nothing compared to the public health crisis that arguably defined the modern world. The Black Plague killed as much as 40% of the population of Europe and created dramatic upheavals in the hierarchical, feudal labor relations that had prevailed before the plague.  See also: Is Bitcoin an Inflation Hedge? Investors Are Still Unsure  “[The] mortality destroyed more than a third of the men, women, and children … such a shortage of workers ensued that the humble turned up their noses at employment, and could scarcely be persuaded to serve the eminent unless for triple wages,” said one account written shortly after the plague.  Even the much smaller post-COVID labor contraction is seeing workers gain power in similar ways. The U.S. labor movement that had been gaining momentum before the pandemic has been pushed into overdrive, and workers have taken increasingly strong action to improve working conditions, including a mass walkout at an Amazon facility this week.  Many historians argue that, well beyond improving the lot of surviving workers, the Black Plague effectively ended the feudal system. COVID-19 might not have such sweeping impacts – but they’re a reminder that interest rates are an extremely blunt instrument being deployed to resist some very specific, and very strong, underlying material realities.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

The cryptocurrency often moves in the opposite direction of the majority of traders and makes a run for the liquidity pools created by over-leverage positions. In this case, retail traders might have jumped into the bullish price action experienced this week by taking longs in hopes of further appreciation. Bennett believes that with these players out of the way, the market might be readying for a bounce: BTC long liquidations run at $19,600, as mentioned yesterday in Discord.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell about 2% following the release of the report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the better-than-expected number gives the Federal Reserve less leeway to opt for a slower rate hike at the next monetary policy meeting in October. Easing off could have reduced downward pressure on prices for risky assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.  The jobs number reveals a significant slowdown in hiring from August, when the U.S. added 315,000 positions, but nevertheless could cause concern for central bankers who have been trying to cool down a very tight labor market for the bigger part of the year.  ""With this jobs report it seems clear we are on course for another significant hike from the Fed, with the market pricing in a 75 [basis point] rise in interest rates at its next meeting,"" said Paul Craig, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors.  Unemployment rate  The unemployment rate was forecast by economists to remain at 3.7% but dropped to 3.5% instead, which is a level last seen in July and could be partly due to a decline in labor force participation from 62.4% to 62.3%.  As higher wages add to inflationary pressures, another important number that Federal Reserve officials are paying attention to is hourly earnings, which rose 0.3% in August on a monthly basis, a negative sign for the Fed.  U.S. financial markets are down this year as policymakers have raised interest rates at rapid increments of 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage points, in hopes to bring 40-year-high inflation under control. In recent rate-hiking cycles, the Fed has rarely raised rates by more than 25 basis points at a time.  But Fed officials say they aren’t ready to back off, and one of the reasons is the tight labor market.  “The labor market demand is still outpacing supply,” Cleveland Fed Chair Loretta Mester said in an interview with CNBC last week. “We’ve got to moderate both the labor market and product markets if we’re going to get inflation back down. At some point, once we get real rates up and we see more of that moderation in demand, [...] then there’s some trade-offs and then you need to be concerned, have you gone too far or is this a good place to stop? We’re not at that point yet.”  Fed funds  Traders in the federal funds futures markets have started to bet that the central bank might pivot soon and stop the rate hikes, especially with signs of a cooling labor market. Several Fed officials have pushed back against that idea.  “We have more work to do,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Thursday. “Until I see some evidence that underlying inflation has solidly peaked and is hopefully headed back down, I’m not ready to declare a pause. I think we’re quite a ways away from a pause.”  UPDATE (Oct. 7, 2022 12:58 UTC): Adds updated price of bitcoin (BTC).

That increase, though, was small compared with its hashrate due to rising mining difficulty.The difficulty of mining is a closely-watched metric in the crypto ecosystem. It measures how hard it is to mine a bitcoin (BTC-USD) block based on the amount of participants and computing power (hashpower) used to mine and secure the blockchain. A higher difficulty tends to lower miners&apos; profitability.For Iris (IREN), its average operating hashrate jumped 24% to 2,729 petahashes per second from a month ago. That, coupled with higher energy costs led to a 6% decline in operating revenue, standing at $6.2M.Elsewhere, the miner, in an effort to raise capital, has recently agreed to sell up to $100M of ordinary shares to investment bank B.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below the $20,000 mark Friday, down almost 1% on the day, as traders in both crypto and stock markets awaited September’s jobs report in the U.S.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has spent the last four months hovering around the $20,000 mark with little movement either side.  “This could be really important for bitcoin that it has found a base around $20,000 that traders are seemingly comfortable with in these turbulent times,” wrote Craig Erlam, an analyst at Oanda, in a morning note. “It now looks like a very strong region of support that's been reinforced with every test below.”  Erlam said there could well be a case for this level forming a bottom for the cryptocurrency but, of course, another risk-off panic could put this theory to test.  Ether (ETH) was also trading down on the day slightly, but has been slowly making its way back up after the post-Merge drop.  A blockchain linked to the big crypto exchange Binance ordered a suspension on Thursday, after an estimated $100 million to $110 million in assets were moved off chain.  BNB Chain, composed of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain, tweeted the suspension on BSC from its official account, later confirming that the activity stemmed from a “potential exploit.”  Some $7 million of the total crypto has already been frozen.  BNB token is down 3.35%.  In the news, Citigroup’s director of blockchain and digital assets is leaving the U.S. bank to take a role at Six Digital Exchange, according to his LinkedIn page.  A report from Morgan Stanley said the market for cryptocurrency exchange products continues to grow, a sign that institutional interest in the digital assets sector remains strong despite concerns of a crypto winter.  Crypto lender Celsius Network’s top executives withdrew a little over $17 million in cryptocurrency between May and June 2022, right before the company suspended withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy, new court records show.

North Island is a crypto-focused investment firm that recently closed its second fund at $125 million. The plan entails purchasing the native token of Cosmos and investing in ventures growing within the Cosmos ecosystem. According to Travis Scher, a co-founder of North Island, developers have started to favor Cosmos &apos;quite aggressively&apos; over the past six months. Cosmos Blockchain Network The blockchain network Cosmos comprises flexible, application-specific blockchains. The Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol allows these chains to communicate. The Cosmos Hub is a separate blockchain protected by validators that stake ATOM, the native coin of Cosmos. The second North Island fund has made about 30 investments and is almost twice as big as the first one, completed in 2020 and valued at $70 million. The new fund anticipates investing in 30 to 40 businesses, mainly at the seed stage. Scher said. &apos;The fund is big than the last fund primarily because the opportunity set in crypto is meaningfully larger than it was in 2020.

42422219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ioph,1665141744,India's Central Bank Crystalizes CBDC Vision in Concept Note,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has published a 50-page concept note for the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The document is the first such comprehensive report by the RBI's Fintech Department, which was created in January 2022 with the responsibility of forming cryptocurrency regulations and creating a central bank digital currency.  The RBI said it will commence a pilot of the digital rupee for specific use cases soon, though it did not give a clear timeline. Earlier this year, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announceda digital rupee via blockchain and other technologies would be issued some time in 2022 or 2023. And just last month, RBI's Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said a digital currency pilot project would be launched later this year.  The digital rupee will provide an additional option to the currently available forms of money, the RBI said in its concept note. ""It is substantially not different from banknotes, but being digital it is likely to be easier, faster and cheaper.""  The central bank's note stressed the importance of identifying ""innovative methods and compelling use cases that will make CBDC as attractive as cash if not more."" It said it has been working towards a phased implementation strategy, going step by step through various stages of pilots followed by the final launch, calling the current zeitgeist a ""watershed moment in the evolution of currency that will decisively change the very nature of money and its functions.""  The RBI's motivations in creating a CBDC range from reducing operational costs involved in physical cash management, fostering financial inclusion, bringing resilience, efficiency, and innovation in the payments system, to boosting innovation in cross-border payments space, to providing the public with uses that any private virtual currencies can provide, without the associated risks, to offer availability and resilience benefits when electrical power or mobile network is not available in remote locations.  While re-emphasizing the dangers of cryptocurrencies as a threat to the stability of the financial system, the RBI has touted its CBDC as a ""risk free central bank digital money which will provide the users the same experience of dealing in currency in digital form, without any risks associated with private cryptocurrencies.""  The bank went so far as to say ""the inherent design of cryptocurrencies is more geared to bypass the established and regulated intermediation and control arrangements that play a crucial role of ensuring integrity and stability of monetary and financial eco-system.""  The RBI has maintained that banning cryptocurrency is the most suitable choice for India. In June 2022, Sankar said that CBDCs could ""kill"" whatever little case that could be for private cryptocurrencies.  The concept note comes at a time when India's once-burgeoning crypto ecosystem has faced difficult challenges, including stiff new taxes, a shadow ban on exchanges which served to send trading volumes sharply lower.Added to that were the global bear market in crypto, macro factors like inflation and the war in Ukraine, a probe against 10 exchanges, layoffs and the implosion of the policy body representing crypto interests.  The concept note released on Friday appears to go a step further than previous RBI statements, indicating more confidence in releasing both wholesale and retail CBDCs. A retail CBDC would be able to provide access to safe money for payment and settlement, said the bank, and a wholesale product has the potential to transform the settlement systems for financial transactions and make them more efficient and secure.  Getting to specifics, the RBI note indicates a preference the retail CBDC to be token-based, or closer to physical cash, while the wholesale CBDC would be account-based.  The RBI has not indicated a preference on whether it will choose a controlled database or distributed ledger technology for its CBDC. Instead, it has indicated a desire to be flexible to accommodate the evolution of the technology.

The partnership will see the exchange release crypto debit cards in 40 countries with a focus on Latin America, Europe and Asia, according to a CNBC report. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CNBC that crypto debit cards can disrupt traditional payment networks.  FTX first announced plans to roll out a debit card in January after rival exchange Coinbase released its own version last summer.  “Even though values have come down there’s still steady interest in crypto,” Visa Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu told CNBC.  Crypto payments have been a slow burner since the inception of digital assets more than 10 years ago. Price volatility and a lack of desire to use scaling solutions like the Lightning Network has perturbed retailers, but accountancy firm Deloitte believes that is soon to change with a prediction that 75% of merchants will accept crypto within the next two years.

There are more than 180 active crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF), exchange-traded-products (ETP) and trusts. Half of these products have launched since the bitcoin bear market, despite total assets dropping 70% to $24 billion from $84 billion, Morgan Stanley said in a research report on Thursday.  “The crypto exchange products market will continue to grow,” the report said, adding that the “bear market hasn’t deterred asset managers and financial companies from launching ways for their clients to get access to digital assets.” Fund launches accelerated in 2022 despite the decline in crypto prices, with eight new ETP launches per month on average in the last year.  Crypto ETPs are traded on exchange, much like equities, and track the performance of an underlying asset. Their popularity has been growing as they allow clients to invest in cryptocurrencies without having to invest in the underlying digital asset themselves.  In the U.S., WisdomTree (WETF) is the only publicly traded “pure-play ETF issuer,” the note said, and while it manages less than 1% of the total crypto ETP universe its market share of flows is 5%, and the “scale of its offering is well ahead of traditional asset manager peers.”  Morgan Stanley expects more crypto exchange-traded products to be launched around the world in the coming quarters, and while the focus will remain on bitcoin (BTC), new products will likely cover a large number of crypto assets and themes, it said.

In an announcement published on YouTube, the firm's CEO, Peter Wall, explained a number of steps Argo Blockchain has taken to improve its liquidity position in light of the ongoing crypto bear market.  ""Our profitability has been squeezed from both sides from higher energy prices to lower bitcoin price, that's resulted in a cash crunch for Argo,"" Peter Wall said.  In addition to issuing 87 million shares, which equates to around 15% of the business, Argo announced the sale of 3,400 Antminer S19 J Pro miners to a third party for a total of $7 million. The sale of mining equipment will cause a reduction in hash rate, Wall added.  Soaring energy prices coupled with a plunge in the value of cryptocurrencies has created a difficult environment across the mining industry.

So, can we expect a breakout entry opportunity? The BTC price action shows a bearish reversal from the resistance confluence of the declining trendline and the 50-day EMA. However, the retracement comes as a retest of the broken range we mentioned in our previous article. Should you avoid taking a bearish entry in Bitcoin? Key Points: The Bitcoin price action displays a bear cycle struggling to gain momentum from the resistance trendline. The retracement retests the broken consolidation range and teases a potential bullish reversal. The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $29.63 billion.

Currently, the Bitcoin price action displays a bearish reversal from the 50-day EMA to retest the broken consolidation range.

42422227,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ip1h,1665132063,Will Comatose Bitcoin Market Come Alive After NFP Data?,"Traders love volatility, which has recently gone missing from the bitcoin (BTC) market.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has been locked in the narrow range of $18,000 to $20,500, barring a brief spike above $22,000 around mid-September, according to CoinDesk data.  The question is whether the market will come unglued immediately after the release of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data – the monthly jobs report – later on Friday. The data will reveal how much of the Federal Reserve's liquidity tightening has affected the labor market and whether the central bank can afford to slow rate hikes in the coming months. The Fed tightening has roiled risk assets, including cryptocurrencies this year.  Past data suggests the payrolls figure affects the bitcoin market with a lag. In other words, the cryptocurrency could very well end the day within the recent range, only to see volatility pick up over the coming week.  The featured image shows that bitcoin has seen less than 5% percent price moves in nine out of the past 12 NFP days. The annualized returns on the past 12 NFP days have been 91%. That's within the 365-day implied volatility 12-month range of 70% to 95%, according to data sourced from Laevitas.  The annualized returns are arrived at by calculating the standard deviation of BTC's performance on the past 12 NFP days and then multiplying the same by the square root of 365. The implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence.  ""Bitcoin has returned exactly 0.0%, on average, on NFP days in 2022. So, traders might conclude that NFP days are non-events,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said. ""However, traders should be careful as the picture changes one week later.""  The chart shows bitcoin has declined in the week after the NFP seven out of nine times this year, producing an average return of -2.2%. That's in stark contrast to 2021, when bitcoin chalked up an average return of 2.3% in the week after NFP.  ""Based on history, today – when the employment data is released – matters less than how prices tend to react one week later. … Crypto traders should watch out …,"" Thielen noted.  History could repeat itself, with bitcoin seeing increased downside volatility in the next seven days if the September payrolls figure blows past expectations. That would force markets to price out hopes of the so-called Fed pivot in favor of slower liquidity withdrawal.  The tighter the labor market, the stickier the inflation and the less room the Fed has to slow tightening. Expectations are for 250,000 job additions following the 315,000 increase in August.  Analysts at ING expect markets to drift away from the Fed pivot speculation following the payrolls data.  ""Investors will look for any hint that the jobs market is starting to turn. We think it's too early for that, and our economists are in line with consensus in expecting the unemployment rate to stay at 3.7% with payrolls slowing but staying above 200k (consensus 250k),"" ING's FX strategist Francesco Pesole said in a note to clients.  ""DXY [the dollar index] could find its way back into the 113.00-114.00 region,"" Pesole added.

Bitcoin, Other Cryptos Slog Through Another Flat Day  By James Rubin  Bitcoin tip-toed around $20,000 on Thursday in its weeks-long minuet with the psychologically important threshold.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $20,000, down about 1.7% during the past 24 hours as investors returned to more of the macroeconomic wariness that has shaped their attitudes for most of the past year. BTC spent part of the day below this level after a surprising spike in weekly jobless claims. For one of the few occasions in the past few months, a poor economic indicator discouraged markets instead of spurring them higher.  Ether was recently changing hands over $1,350, also slightly down from the previous day, same time. Other major altcoins were mixed, although tilted slightly more red than green.  By early Friday (UTC), Binance Smart Chain's native BNB token tumbled about 4% after the blockchain with ties to the world's largest crypto exchange by volume suffered what it called a ""potential exploit"" that on-chain evidence suggests could be in range of $500 million. In a tweet late Thursday, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao wrote that the breach on ""a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub,"" had ""resulted in extra BNB, and that the company had ""asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC.""  Embattled crypto lender Celsius Network's CEL token was recently off about 18% after CoinDesk reported earlier in the day that former top executives, including founder Alex Mashinsky, cashed out $17 million before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  SUSHI was among the biggest gainers, rising more than 3% at one point a day after the announcement that asset management giant GoldenTree had invested about $5.2 million in DeFi protocol SushiSwap's governance token. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose by 0.26%.  Equities  After climbing promisingly earlier this week, equity markets returned to a more familiar slog with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falling 0.7, 1% and 1.1%, respectively. Investors will be eyeing Friday's U.S. unemployment and labor participation reports for September, although the former is widely expected to remain in the neighborhood of its current 3.7% rate, increasing the likelihood of the U.S. central bank continuing its current monetary hawkishness and a so-called hard economic landing.  In a speech at the University of Kentucky, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted surprisingly strong employment data earlier this week and the expectations that the U.S. economy will have created 260,000 new jobs last month – both signs that the economy has not slackened enough to consider more dovish policies. ""A jobs number in this range along with the job openings rate reported on Tuesday would show that the labor market is slowing a bit but is still quite tight. As a result, I don't expect tomorrow's jobs report to alter my view that we should be focused 100% on reducing inflation.""

So far, the data says not at all. Is there anything we can do with the technology, if it's a terrible way to hold value?  According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen,Three Arrows Capital’s Starry Night NFT is now worth a whopping 0.04% of what it was last year when the troubled crypto hedge fund spent $21 million assembling the collection. While ether and other digital assets have also tumbled in the previous 12 months, NFTs led the decline as market liquidity evaporated.  The drop offers compelling evidence that NFTs have yet to prove their usefulness or engage audiences in the long term.  NFT’s nature of preserving claims to create digital scarcity was touted as a perfect fit for the booming metaverse. These digital worlds that were supposedly the future, according to crypto VCs, needed land titles so buyers could have a sense of ownership.  As with all things crypto, there was a boom but also a bust: Land prices have cratered because it turns out that nobody cares for these crypto worlds with 1990s-era graphics. In the last 30 days Decentraland has 501 users, according to DappRadar.  Gaming tokens' decline  Play-to-earn gaming was another advertised use case. Axie Infinity and its contemporaries were supposed to be a way to make money and game, with crypto VCs claiming it also represents a new way for low-income earners in Southeast Asia to get a leg up. But that mirage has evolved and all we are left with is a form of “digital serfdom” where gamers in the Philippines end up making less than the country’s minimum wage. And in the West, gamers don’t care about the idea of virtual ownership; Ubisoft, which aped in last year to NFTs for its Ghost Recon franchise has suspended its efforts after the market showed minimal interest.  Data from Nansen shows that its index of the top 50 gaming tokens is down 91% on the year.  “The NFT Gaming sector has seen the largest drawdown in value and volume throughout 2022. Certain critics would argue this is reflective of the prioritization of financial incentives by NFT gaming projects instead of the focus on enjoyment,” the firm wrote in a recent report.  What about ticketing? Resale fraud is a huge headache for organizers of live events. In September, TicketMaster announced it was partnering with DapperLabs to explore NFT issuance for tickets. But it’s tough to see what this solves above and beyond TicketMaster’s existing marketplace and the company’s new policy for certain events to use dynamic QR codes via an app instead of paper tickets. After all, any sort of ticket sales will still be controlled by TicketMaster.  It looks like we have a technology without a use case.

The proof-of-stake blockchain has lost over 76% of its total value locked in the past eight months. The decline is alarming, given the decentralized crypto project&apos;s recent Vasil hardfork. The Cardano community welcomed the Vasil upgrade with high expectations. The hardfork was meant to upgrade the blockchain&apos;s performance and place it in a position to contend with other top DeFi projects. However, it seems that the update hasn&apos;t been able to deliver much bullishness for ADA holders. Related Reading: Why &apos;Rosy&apos; Earnings Estimates Might Hurt Bitcoin As Price Struggles At $20,000 Loss Of Staking Value For Cardano Based on data obtained from Defi Llama, Cardano&apos;s total value locked (TVL) has continuously decreased since its March height. It has now fallen below $80 million for the first time since January 2022. More specifically, Cardano&apos;s TVL was reported to be $76.66 million at the time of this writing. This figure reflects a 76.49% decrease from the all-time high of $326 million that it hit on March 24, 2022. This new figure has pushed the staking value of ADA to the levels it had in January 2022. Cardano is presently ranked 27th among all blockchains regarding the total value of locked (TVL).
