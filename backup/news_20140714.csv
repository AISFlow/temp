42397759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6aw,1405375909,8 Million Vericoin Hack Prompts Hard Fork to Recover Funds,"Digital currency exchange platform MintPal has suffered a successful hack attack that resulted in the loss millions of vericoins from its hot wallet.  The 13th July attack targeted a vulnerability in the site’s withdrawal system. The hacker, according to an official statement from MintPal, was able to circumvent internal controls and authorize a withdrawal request for the contents of the vericoin wallet.  Notably, the site’s bitcoin and litecoin wallets were also targeted by those behind the attack. However, owing to MintPal’s existing cold storage procedures for those wallets, user balances were not affected during the incident.  This result is potentially encouraging as hot wallet vulnerabilities have been a persistent issue among major bitcoin exchanges this year, with defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox providing perhaps the most noteworthy example of how connected wallets can be targeted by hackers.  MintPal is an alternative digital currency exchange registered in the UK that trades bitcoin, litecoin and popular alternative currencies such as vericoin and darkcoin.  Vericoin's controversial response  The breach resulted in the loss of roughly 8 million vericoins (VRC), or about 30% of the total coins in existence, a member of the vericoin development team told CoinDesk.  Given the extent of the damage, the vericoin development team opted to hard fork the coin’s block chain in order to reverse the theft transaction. This was performed, they said, in order to both prevent the loss of roughly $2m in investor funds and stop a fraudulent actor from holding 30% of the coin’s proof-of-stake network capacity.  The fork is now complete, with new wallets now available for download, the vericoin development team told CoinDesk.  In a statement, the MintPal team pledged to recoup all losses from the attack, including those from other exchanges who were impacted by the event, saying:  ""The biggest implication of the rollback is to the various exchanges who have accepted customer deposits and then had trades executed on those deposits. We have committed to our customers and to all exchanges that we will cover any losses faced as a result of the rollback.""  CoinDesk reached out to MintPal for comment but has not received an immediate response.  Anatomy of an exchange attack  The attack took place at roughly 7 am BST, and utilized a SQL injection to initialize the wallet withdrawal. Six hours later, the MintPal development team made contact with the vericoin team, after which time a solution - ultimately a hard fork - was sought and reached.  According to MintPal, only the vericoin wallet was affected during the attack. This includes the database containing sensitive customer information and passwords.  The company stated that a failure to secure customer vericoin balances in cold storage led to the vulnerability, saying:  ""We did have cold storage setup for VRC, however in this instance, due to an error for which only we can be accountable, we had transferred far fewer coins than was required, resulting in a large proportion of coins being left in the hot wallet.""  MintPal added that the company’s procedures have been changed to include stricter cold storage protocols as well as the institution of manual withdrawal clearances until the system has been cleared for all vulnerabilities.  Stolen coins returned  An initial attempt to roll back the block chain to reverse the vericoin theft was launched in the hours after the attack, which involved recreating the original block chain without the withdrawal from MintPal.  However, according to vericoin developer Patrick Nosker, older clients that were broadcasting the transaction resulted in the network mistakenly approving it, allowing the hacker to receive the 8m VRC.  A second hard fork was conducted on 14th July, an operation that also involved creating a transaction that moved the 8m VRC to a new wallet location. As a result, blocks containing the theft transactions were orphaned and remained unaccepted by the network.  Nosker told CoinDesk that the move was necessary to protect investors. However, he acknowledged the controversy behind the move and the frustration among those affected, saying:  “The community is clearly divided. Some think we are good guys for helping users keep their stolen coin. Others think we are bad for 'abusing' our dev rights to change the blockchain. We believe we are in the right as less than $4,000 worth of VRC were sent between the theft time and hard fork, while over $2m of VRC would have been sent otherwise.""  He added: ""We also didn't want one individual with the ability to 51% attack"".  At press time, MintPal has not yet reactivated its vericoin market. However, one of the site’s admins commented that the focus now is on identifying customers who suffered losses.

42397770,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6nj,1405371946,LinkedIn Co-Founder: Bitcoin is in My Five-Year Investment Plan,"LinkedIn co-founder, early Facebook investor and Greylock Partners partner Reid Hoffman has declared his enthusiasm for bitcoin in a new interview with CNBC's 'Squawk Alley'.  The interview  aimed to assess Hoffman's current opinion of opportunities in the market given his experience and success in early social media.  Notably, despite the suggestions by show hosts that such industries as wearable technology, healthcare and home automation were areas that investors should be considering for investment over the next three-to-five years, Hoffman suggested he is increasingly focused on bitcoin.  Indicating that the ecosystem has piqued his interest in the last six to 12 months, Hoffman lauded bitcoin, saying:  ""I think it's an incredible system that's created a ledger that is across – a distributed ledger across the whole world for it can be money but it can also be other things.""  Hoffman recently joined the board of directors at secure bitcoin wallet startup Xapo, an announcement that was made when the company reported $20m in new financing from firms including Greylock Parnters.  Bitcoin ownership  In the interview, Hoffman discussed his personal experience with bitcoin, confirming that he has purchased ""a few bitcoins"" to date in addition to his investment in Xapo.  Hoffman also dismissed suggestions that he may be worried about the price of bitcoin given the volatility that this indicator has experienced so far in 2014.  He added:  ""I don't check [the price] every day. It's more a question of a three- to five-year horizon, not a daily horizon.""  Despite this, Hoffman cautioned investors, echoing the familiar refrain that investors shouldn't put any money into bitcoin directly unless they are ""willing to lose the money"".  Platform for innovation  Hoffman further stressed that bitcoin's true innovation will be its platform, which he called its ""most interesting layer"".  Citing smart contracts as one such example of the innovation bitcoin entrepreneurs have yet to fully unlock, Hoffman said:  ""You can have bitcoin stand for something that isn't just a bitcoin. [...] It could mean your car. So then your car could be accounted for on a general ledger that is then – you know, can let you do electronic contracts. you could put liens against it, moving it all into the electronic age.""

42397756,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6Zx,1405362618,Innopay Report: Is Bitcoin Fad or Future of Payments?,"The implications of bitcoin’s effect on consumer finance, investment and banking are not fully understood, a new report from Innopay suggests.  The payments and transaction service consulting firm explored the nature of digital currency and its impact on a broad range of market sectors, tapping everyone from European central bankers to core members of the bitcoin community for insight. At its heart, the Innopay report points to a broad awakening within the global economy to the benefits of bitcoin and its underlying technology, but acknowledges that ignition remains held back by and large.  Apprehension about the security and stability of bitcoin, especially among banks, large companies and a broader subset of consumers keeps the clear benefits of digital currencies from achieving mainstream usage. The experts interviewed by Innopay agree that bitcoin will deeply affect how people transact with one another, but remained split on how digital currency technology will manifest in the years ahead.  Economist and CoinDesk contributor Tuur Demeester told Innopay:  “Just like the Internet has broken open the information market, one can expect the same paradigm shift to occur with cryptocurrencies on the financial market.”  Digital currencies were also seen through the lens of regional financial crises, consumer technology and the future of the internet. The rules of global finance, the Innopay report explores, could be fundamentally rewritten by the likes of bitcoin and other currencies.  Payments networks revisioned with bitcoin  One area explored in the report is the concept that bitcoin can change how businesses and consumers pay one another. At the center of this, Innopay notes, is the change in how financial parties trust one another. The evolving nature of this trust structure carries the potential for significant benefits – and complications.  As Demeester remarked, the number of bitcoin transactions continues to grow steadily but this fact does not preclude traditional payments networks from maintaining a significant role by comparison. However, he said that many of the core services offered by banks may be facilitated more cheaply and efficiently with digital currencies, suggesting that banks are at risk of market loss for their inaction.  He said:  “The traditional financial system is being challenged to step up their game in terms of efficiency because the bitcoin environment is removing middlemen.”  Others who spoke with Innopay were less convinced.  Kim Gunnink  , an official with the Dutch Central Bank’s Payments Systems Policy Department, said that the central bank views bitcoin usage today as “a fad”. Gunnink argues that bitcoin’s performance as a type of money is poor overall, citing its fluctuating value as a critical flaw that makes it ineffective as both a unit of account and a store of value. As well, the official said that the future of bitcoin transaction fees could pose a long-term issue.  On the other hand, Gunnink noted the growing influence of digital economies among businesses and consumers, leaving the door open for the technology to grow in usage. Gunnink added that the addition of new services and avenues for digital currency acquisition would ease adoption, saying:  “Cryptocurrencies could be gaining ground in the field of cross-currency payments, as a growing payment method for global online purchases or peer-to-person payments. To what extent this growth will become a reality is still unclear.”  Why bitcoin is held back  Innopay’s report also confirmed what many other observers have said about the barriers to bitcoin’s success. A mixture of uncertain regulation, poor consumer information and complicated means to acquire bitcoin makes it difficult for broader use to take off.  Dave Birch  , a director for IT advisory firm Consult Hyperion, remarked that governments remain cautious about passing definitive legislation about bitcoin because they both lack understanding of its underlying technology and fear missing out on future tax revenue. However, he predicted that governments will eventually see bitcoin’s potential to create “a dynamic and efficient economy”.  A lack of bank participation makes the situation even more untenable, but according to the report, bitcoin technology may one day find a strong ally in the global banking sector. Owing to the need to update legacy money networks worldwide – and the possible erosion of their core services – banks may have little choice but to embrace bitcoin.  However, it’s likely that this shift will manifest in the utilization of the protocol itself rather than bitcoin or another digital currency. But this isn’t necessarily a problem for bitcoin, as Innopay itself notes in the report’s conclusion:  “The quest to find better ways to do transactions often leads to innovations that open up opportunities, like we have seen in other industries and with other technologies.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/14/innopay-report-is-bitcoin-fad-or-future-of-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4c7db35fb8e236dbc2165c732a83f44a5413b6c-1200x494.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397766,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6gq,1405351554,Expresscoin Raises $150k in Funding from Bitcoin Shop,"Digital currency-only online retail outlet Bitcoin Shop has announced a $150,000 investment in cryptocurrency-buying service expresscoin.  The announcement marks expresscoin's first investment since its formal launch in June. Previously operating under the brand Cash Into Coins, expresscoin is aiming to market bitcoin to underbanked consumers by accepting payment methods including money orders, personal checks and wire transfers.  With the announcement, expresscoin will integrate its services with Bitcoin Shop to provide more ways for the website's e-commerce consumers to obtain digital currency.  Bitcoin Shop CEO Charles Allen indicated that the move is one that will expand his company's ability to cater to its customers, stating:  ""Our planned integration with expresscoin is a natural progression to provide another key element in our cryptocurrency ecosystem to go along with our investment and relationship with GoCoin for financial transaction processing.""  Expresscoin currently sells bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, blackcoin and darkcoin, while Bitcoin Shop accepts bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.  The Santa Monica-based company previously raised an undisclosed sum from an AngelList syndicate headed by Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce.  $1m investment option  Bitcoin Shop further indicated that the investment comes in the form of a $150,000 promissory note that values expresscoin at $9m using a pre-money valuation. The note also gives Bitcoin Shop the option to invest an additional $1m in expresscoin before 24th October of this year.  Bitcoin Shop provided additional details about how such an investment could be carried out, suggesting that such a transaction could take place in bitcoin.  The announcement read:  ""If exercised in full, the Option will allow the Company to own approximately 13% of ET [Express Technologies, Inc.]. The Company may exercise its Option in bitcoins in lieu of USD.""  Bitcoin Shop estimates its investment provides the company with a 2% stake in expresscoin at its current valuation.  Increasing shareholder sentiment  While providing a new way for expresscoin to reach consumers, Bitcoin Shop suggested the move will have benefits for, not only its customers, but its shareholders too. Bitcoin Shop announced its decision to go public in February, and has traded over the counter since that time.  Bitcoin Shop framed the move as one that would give investors another reason to consider investing funds in its operations.  The company said: ""By investing in ET, Bitcoin Shop not only continues to enhance their service offerings, but also adds a key differentiation strategy for their shareholders by providing indirect exposure to other key service providers in the cryptocurrency industry"".  Bitcoin Shop CEO Charles Allen will speak at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago this weekend.

42397777,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6rf,1405346824,Butterfly Labs Accused of Buying Blog to Hide Negative Search Results,"UPDATE (14th July 16:00 BST): Further comment from Buttcoin.org's founder has been added.      Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Butterfly Labs stands accused of buying out a blog that criticised its products in order to manage its online reputation.  While numerous companies have been accused of using nefarious tactics to remove or alter reviews on websites such as Amazon, if true, BFL's action would take whitewashing product criticism to a whole new level.  The claims have been made by the founder of the blog in question, reddit user 'borderpatrol’, who will only reveal his first name as Evan.  His site, Buttcoin.org, which aims to inject a little humour into the bitcoin world, has been in operation since 2011. According to its founder, Buttcoin.org recently received its millionth visitor.  Kansas-based Butterfly Labs manufactures a range of bitcoin-mining hardware. The firm has been plagued by complaints over the quality of some of its products, alongside frequent and long delays in shipments.  CoinDesk recently broke down the global statistics of complaints about the company received by the US Federal Trade Commission.  Anonymous purchase  Evan claims that Butterfly Labs bought his site anonymously for a five-figure sum, with the deal arranged by a man known as Jeff. Jeff requested that the company be transferred into his daughter's name, but never mentioned that it was being purchased on BFL's behalf, according to Evan.  Unhappy about the way the transaction was conducted, the founder said:  ""He explained that he wanted to keep the site like 'The Onion of Bitcoin', wanted me to keep writing for a minimum of 6 months. [...] The guy was going to buy my site and then let me still have control.""  However, as soon as the transaction was complete Evan's access privileges were revoked. In short, he was locked out.  Soon after, Evan said he noticed that Buttcoin.org's critical reviews of BFL mining equipment had now been rewritten to compliment the hardware in question – with headlines completely reversed.  He offers an archive of one example to prove the point, with The $22,484.00 Butterfly Labs Mini Rig bitcoin miner is a huge, broken, unstable piece of shit (archived article) now changed to read: The Butterfly Labs Mini Rig is a sexy Bitcoin mining machine (current article).  Several BFL articles were also edited in a similar manner, however articles critical of equipment from other manufacturers have remained in their original form.  Pointing the finger  Evan says his research has led him to believe that 'Jeff' is none other than Jeff Ownby, VP of marketing for BFL. He now believes that BFL bought the site in order to whitewash his critical product reviews which appear very high in Google's ranking for key BFL search terms, adding:  ""Buttcoin was ranking between 3-4 for the search term 'Butterfly Labs' and 'Butterfly Labs Review' and was usually #1 for 'Butterfly Labs Scam' and 'Is Butterfly Labs ligit' [sic]. It was obvious to me that the purpose of purchasing the site was to simply remove the negative articles that were destroying their search traffic and making them look bad.""  Evan now indicates that the site was sold some months ago, but his reddit post was a response to accusations that he had purposefully changed the articles ""to show BFL in a good light"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""If I knew it was BFL though I would have rather they bought the site and shut it down rather than change the message.""  CoinDesk has reached out to Butterfly Labs for comment and will update this story as more information arrives.
