42428163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL61Th,1511042370,"First Long-Term LedgerX Bitcoin Option Pegs Price at $10,000","LedgerX just initiated its first long-term bitcoin futures option.    Called a Long-Term Equity Anticipation Security (LEAPS), the trade was matched by the platform this morning and is set to expire on December 28, 2018.    Under the terms of the deal, the buyer has the right to buy bitcoin at a price of $10,000 at that date, or almost a 30 percent premium on today's price.    Yet, because the buyer only makes money if the price is more than $10,000 (called the strike price), the investment can be seen as a reflection of the level of confidence that the price will reach that level by the agreed upon date.  Such long term futures options have long been seen in the industry as a much needed sign of maturity, and could in part help pave the way for even more institutional money to enter the space.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, LedgerX CEO Paul Chou sought to position the milestone as just the first of many more before the cryptocurrency market can truly be considered mature.  Chou said:  ""There will be, I expect, a lot more trades down the line. This is the first one, but it at least gives you the first guess from different institutional traders as to what bitcoin's dynamics will look like from now until 2018.""    The trade option was listed by LedgerX late Friday night, and to Chou's surprise, two institutional investors agreed to the terms of the deal just one day later.    Under the terms, the buyer agreed to a price of $2,250.25 for the trade, meaning the seller collects that money if the price is less that $10,000 by the end of next year, and the buyer gets to purchase bitcoin at the strike price if it is higher.  Unlike a futures swap however, the buyer is not obliged to purchase the asset.  ""If the price goes to zero, you don't have to pay $10,000 for it,"" Chou said. ""But if a year from now it's at $20,000, then you can exercise your options.""    Based on LedgerX's own calculations (made using the Nobel-prize winning Black-Scholes financial markets model), the startup believes there is a 25 percent chance that bitcoin will reach that level in the allotted time.    Soft launch  While this is the first LEAPS financial instrument matched by New York-based LedgerX, they've been conducting increasingly high trade volumes since their soft launch a month ago.  As reported by CoinDesk, LedgerX traded $1 million in bitcoin derivatives its first week of trading, ending Oct. 20.  Since then, the first cryptocurrency firm to be granted a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license by the CFTC has posted a $1 million day, a $1.6 million day and on November 15, a record $2.6 million day.  Since LedgerX listed the LEAPS option at 5:30 Friday evening, Chou says they saw an additional $500,000 traded before midnight. ""That's for a holiday week too,"" he said. ""So we were shocked."" He estimates the company has conducted approximately $16 million in notional bitcoin transactions to date.  While the startup's numbers seem to indicated active early interest, legacy institutions such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) have both recently revealed their own similar plans.  Though Chou hopes to maintain his first-mover advantage, he said there's no hard date to launch into full operation. Rather, his team wants to make sure the platform scales well beyond the 1 million messages it sends per day before this milestone. He says he'd be ""surprised"" if that takes ""more than a month,"" concluding:  ""But it might be sooner.""

42428108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xTh,1511008819,ICOs on Our Terms and Conditions,"Zoe Dolan is a lawyer focusing on crypto and blockchain projects, fintech and start-up business representation, and constitutional rights and freedoms. She is an experienced federal trial and appellate attorney and the author of various books.  In this opinion piece, Dolan proposes a practical way to structure token sales that complies with securities laws and enhances value for all involved.      To help regulators and the public understand why cryptographic token sales (also known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs) are so revolutionary and integral to future economic development, it helps to start by defining our core proposition:  A token = value that powers a network.  One difference between old-school small business launches and startups and projects in the crypto space is that the latter are all about networks from the get-go.  In a classic business model, an ambitious conglomerate could start by, say, selling books out of a 30-year-old entrepreneur's garage, with the aspiration of growing into the largest retailer of consumer goods on the planet one day.  Crypto projects resemble this prototype in a fundamental way – seeking to scale up into a vast network from nothing. But there is a distinction: the bookstore remains limited to its retail stock, number of employees, and facilities – whereas crypto projects may begin by facilitating transactions that would already be taking place.  So: crypto business models are geared toward connecting community members who exist at this moment, and then activating these connections into immediate network expansion.  The holy grail here is, of course, to get as many people involved as early as possible and encourage them to become stakeholders in the project.  Stakeholders combine features of customers, investors, speculators, and network participants (traditional categories) all in one. By purchasing and holding a project's tokens, stakeholders are staking a claim within project territory. Value enhancement of the shared network resource – a token – flows to everyone involved: founders, token purchasers and developers alike, provided that longevity and sustainability stay in focus.  An ICO creates a community just like that.  In the old-school scenario, investors rely on a project's lead or core team to realize profits. In our world, growth is all about stakeholders.  Post-ICO, we suddenly see a big motley crew of smart people from any number of countries chomping at the bit to contribute to open-source code development, share about their interest with others, and signal to core team personnel and developers on matters ranging from business roadmaps to community guidelines to decisions at forks in the road (not just in the code) – not to mention whatever else we figure out how to optimize.  Let's call this whole phenomenon ""stakeholdering.""  Lessons from The DAO  My own view as a lawyer who works on crypto and blockchain projects continues to be that benefits can yield to all as we explain – over and over and over again, until either governments hop onto the same page or the page turns to a new chapter – that stakeholdering is what sets true, purposeful ICOs apart from the crypto space albatross: the poorly disguised, illegal, unregistered security offering.  By now everyone in the crypto community can recite the legal test designed to identify a security, as announced in 1946 by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. Howey: whether a scheme (the court's word) ""involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.""  The government’s most detailed crypto guidance to date – an analysis by the SEC of whether tokens offered by ""The DAO"" comprised securities – is encouraging, at least insofar as it appears to acknowledge that utility tokens may qualify as something other than securities.  Consider an excerpt from the SEC's analysis of the ""managerial efforts of others"" prong, where the action concentrates:  ""Investors' profits were to be derived from the managerial efforts of others – specifically, Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO's Curators … to manage The DAO and put forth project proposals that could generate profits for The DAO's investors.""  Think about what's going on here.  The SEC is about to determine– after looking at DAO token holders' limited control over project dynamics – that such tokens were securities because value derived so substantially from people other than token holders.  For the SEC, this conclusion flows from ""curator"" domination, castrated token holder voting abilities, and member dispersion and communication hurdles inherent in the DAO’s structure:  ""These facts diminished the ability of DAO Token holders to exercise meaningful control over the enterprise through the voting process, rendering the voting rights of DAO Token holders akin to those of a corporate shareholder. ... By contract and in reality, DAO Token holders relied on the significant managerial efforts provided by Slock.it and its co-founders, and The DAO's Curators.""  Stakeholdering, I would argue, is the differential that puts us in new territory.  Utility tokens, from Day 1  Imagine, if you will, a hypothetical crypto project to change the world for the better.  Say we envision a token, Utopia, that seeks to ""envalue"" (coining another word) the socioeconomic and political tenets of sustainability, community empowerment, and decentralization – by facilitating a network of members worldwide who share these principles.  For the beta, perhaps we could start with an ICO laser-focused on – pick a location: say, Boulder, Colorado – and then grow from there.  In beta-Boulder, we start connecting homeowners and renters with goods and service providers of like mind – everyone from interior designers to contractors to solar panel companies to plumbers who install tankless water heaters, and so on.  Utopia generates value from a symbiosis of shared social ideals and the network that hooks everyone up.  Meanwhile, in the alpha phase, Utopia holders around the world have been participating in the project from the beginning through signaling on questions of road-mapping, scaling, and community guidelines development and refinement – all while preparing to kick off their own local hubs and starting to trade with other members internationally.  This process comprises the utility of Utopia. Network value burgeons through the efforts of token holders all over – dispersed nodes or subgroups or whatever you want to call network members and communities – seeking to connect with one another and bring the value of Utopia up to benefit everyone.  Stakeholdering and member activity in alpha mean that tokens may assume functionality before a network begins to function.  Unlike the SAFT framework, in which security tokens are sold to fund the network and utility tokens are issued once it is built, Utopia tokens become utility tokens upon release.  Avoiding red tape  Now, from a legal perspective, do we really need an endless stream of token purchase agreements to effectuate Utopia? Meh. Overkill.  And is it really good – or, for that matter, even in a project’s interest – to limit participation to accredited investors, venture capitalists, and institutions within a quasi-security structure that replicates the very entrenched financial inequities that crypto seeks to redress? The idea seems counterintuitive at best, and possibly self-sabotage.  The terms and conditions for a Utopia token sale would be pretty short and sweet, and I'd think, covering basic matters such as a grant of rights to receive tokens, their projected functionality, and non-refundability.  And the thread weaving them all together would be a lesson that springs from the SEC's DAO analysis: network value created of the community, by the community, and for the community.

42428112,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xVh,1511005522,Millions Gone? Broker Takes Fire for Bitcoin Cash Freeze,"Editor's note: The author, a freelance writer in the U.K., has an account at Trading 212 and was in the BCH market on Nov. 12.      As the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash surged to a high of $2,500 last weekend, clients of Trading 212, a brokerage based in the U.K., Germany and Bulgaria, were sitting on fat profits, in some cases hundreds of thousands of pounds.  That is, until Sunday, when the cryptocurrency took a nosedive – and the firm suspended trading.  Unable to close their positions, the affected customers could only watch as the price of bitcoin cash fell more than $800 in under an hour. Trading 212 says the suspension lasted only 10 minutes, but according to the traders, that was all it took to erase in some cases sizeable gains.  Not taking it lying down, 54 customers went so far as to set up a WhatsApp group called ""People v 212,"" where they compared notes about how to reclaim their alleged missing gains.  All told, the Trading 212 clients – many of whom described their frustrations in interviews or emails – say they lost an estimated £10 million ($13.2 million), though some have settled their complaints with the company. For example, a group of traders from Cardiff, Wales, has accepted an offer to pay out a proportion, about 10 percent, of the profits they say they were owed.  Aside from temporarily preventing clients who had accumulated gains from cashing out, some said Trading 212 failed to execute their stop-loss or take-profit orders. The company, in turn, claims the customers whose orders were canceled had violated its contract terms.  ""Today we have settled with most of the affected clients,"" Borislav Nedialkov, a co-founder of Trading 212, said Friday.  Justin Galvin, one of the Trading 212 customers battling to get what they see as their rightful profits, blamed the company for the situation, however. In statements, he argued the firm simply took too risky a strategy in offering the product in a nascent market.  Galvin said:  ""In my opinion, they exercised too much risk by offering bitcoin cash to entice new customers only to have those traders beat the market by 100 times.”  CFD emptor  But while bruising losses are nothing new in the crypto space, these traders hadn't actually purchased bitcoin cash. Rather, they had entered into contracts for difference (CFD) with Trading 212. In a CFD, traders don't buy assets directly but take positions on price movements. (CFDs are banned in the U.S.).  The gains and losses are amplified because the brokers allow trading at 30x to 150x margins.  In short, these entities don't hold any of the assets that customers are trading on. In this sense then, CFD brokers operate in a world that is more akin to betting. (Indeed, many of the companies in the sector also offer spread-betting services, although not in Trading 212's case.)  These companies sometimes freeze positions for short periods to manage volatility, as Trading 212 did with bitcoin cash on Sunday. In such situations, there is little clients can do if the broker prevents them from adjusting their positions in the market.  The goings on at Trading 212, then, perhaps represent a collision of worlds, where crypto traders meet old-school middlemen.  ""In crypto, I exit with my bitcoin profits immediately. Never leave your winning chips on the table for the dealer to see,” said Clem Chambers, chief executive of company stock analysis site ADVFN.com.  Trading 212, however, is relatively new to the CFD broking game, launching its share-dealing and crypto service in June this year. Nevertheless, it has succeeded in attracting many young investors and traders. Its addition of eight cryptocurrency markets has helped it to expand.  Still, many investors may have been prone to act emotionally, perhaps either not understanding, or being wilfully unaware, of the terms of the investments in which they had entered. It may be that the company concluded the Cardiff-based traders were ""trading in concert"" given that they knew each other, although the company has so far brought forward no evidence.  Not used to the nature of the trading schemes that have sprouted up around the market, many were surprised, then, at the measures the company has taken.  Rickety markets  But Trading 212 isn't the only area of the crypto market to come under stress as a result of bitcoin cash's weekend ups and downs.  Bitcoin cash's price pullback happened at the same time as Korean exchange Bithumb began to have outages. In response, industry website CoinMarketCap stopped taking prices from the exchange, meaning 50 percent of trading volume worldwide wasn't shown in its charts.  Three thousand Korean customers of Bithumb have launched a class action lawsuit against the exchange claiming they suffered losses as a result of the two-hour outage.  Price swings of the magnitude seen in the bitcoin market on Sunday would possibly have triggered a trading suspension on stock exchanges, but this is crypto, where no such mechanisms exist. Having said that, the market is showing signs of maturing.  The introduction of bitcoin futures by derivatives market giant CME Group will go some way to bearing down on bitcoin volatility – although some incumbents in the futures markets worry that a crypto ""virus"" could jump the species barrier and initiate a pandemic in the ""real economy."" The outbreak of influenza at Trading 212 may be an early warning sign.  Regulators, it seems, are taking notice, though their main message is ""buyer beware.""  Following the incident, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a statement on the risks of cryptocurrency CFDs. But Trading 212's customers are unlikely to find any consolation in its words.  While the FCA regulates CFD brokers, it warned:  ""These protections will not compensate you for any losses from trading.""  Since then, Trading 212 appears to be taking steps to ensure a similar situation doesn't repeat, announcing it was raising the deposit level required to trade on margin.
