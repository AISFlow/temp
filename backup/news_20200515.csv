42404645,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXud,1589580751,"Blockchain Bites: Last Day of Consensus, Will Crypto Save the Internet?","Top Shelf    Consensus: Distributed ended on a high note with a keynote address from Juan Benet, founder of Protocol Labs, who granted a rare interview as he closed out the week-long virtual conference.      Speaking widely on the topics of decentralization and Web 3.0, Benet said, “the internet has become dramatically more important to us.” Over a 50-year time span, computing has gone from an idea to a “species altering technology.”      You're reading Blockchain Bites: Consensus Edition a twice daily roundup of all the notable news out of Consensus: Distributed. You can sign up for this, and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      But the internet’s present configuration is a huge problem. The underlying principles of an open and permissionless web, as originally intended, have become distorted by monolithic, centralized service providers, and given way to surveillance capitalism, data encroachment, hacking and content siloing.      Many of these problems were examined in an earlier session dedicated to current and coming models for media distribution – from newsmaking to music. “We are all creating and consuming content at a frantic pace, and using tech all the time to do so,” Lance Koonce, the workshop’s moderator said, by way of framing the conversation.      Different media have different revenue streams, said Chris Tse, founding director of Cardstack. And all of them are broken. The issue at hand is technology has claimed not only the media type, but also the audience and distribution.      Crypto and blockchain could contribute to a solution, though most of the featured guests were skeptical.      Speaking on the topic of misinformation, Kathryn Harrison, founder of the DeepTrust Alliance, cited a recent survey that found three-quarters of adults aren't sure they can accurately recognize fake news. And a plurality said misinformation impacts their trust in governments.      There’s no cryptographic solution, or new law, that could fix what is essentially a human problem, said Nadine Strossen, professor at New York Law School. But media literacy, fact checking and common sense are critical parts of any solution.      Tech works best if it can solve a small issue first, and then scale, said GiantSteps Media’s Bill Rosenblatt. Quoting Jeffrey Moore, a tech market strategist, he said “you need to solve a niche pain point problem for someone before you can go on and boil the ocean.”      “This ownership thing is a solution in search of a problem,” Rosenblatt said, speaking about wide-ranging identity solutions intended to revamp the web. Like Juan Benet’s.      “Web 3 is about creating a platform that is decentralized, that puts human rights foremost, and can build a much freer and open internet and lock it in place,” Benet said.      The core principles of Web 3.0 are about ensuring freedom of speech and assembly, data ownership and self-sovereignty. If you sacrifice on these at the outset, give way just a bit on the vision, it cascades down into what will be built.      Blockchain and cryptocurrency have already “changed the underlying guts and rails of major industries,” Benet said. For instance, fleek is allowing people to spin up decentralized websites, while Audius is reshaping music streaming while maintaining a “Web 2.0 quality user experience.”      The idea that started with Bitcoin, of establishing financial freedoms, has extended to all kinds of other industries, reshaping the possibilities of a shared computing platform.      But there’s a lot of work left to do.      And with that, we bid you adieu. Thanks for attending and reading.    The CoinDesk 50    The CoinDesk 50 is an annual list celebrating the most important organizations in crypto. We've been announcing five nominees per day, and have highlighted Binance, Cosmos, Brave, Bitmain, MakerDAO, Besu, Silvergate Bank, Bitcoin and the People’s Bank of China as particularly noteworthy. Read the full list here.    Money Reimagined    Earlier this week Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers claimed one of the problems with the current monetary system is “too much privacy,” at Consensus: Distributed. In his latest Money Reimagined newsletter, CoinDesk’s Chief Content Officer Michael Casey riffs on this theme.      “Despite [the current] surveillance system, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between $800 billion and $2 trillion, or 2%-5% of global gross domestic product, is laundered annually worldwide. The Panama Papers case shows how the rich and powerful easily use lawyers, shell companies, tax havens and transaction obfuscation to get around surveillance. The poor are just excluded from the system,” he writes.      Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are likely to only exacerbate surveillance into our financial lives. Unless they’re built using protocols and cryptographic tools that enable both privacy and security.      “Self-sovereign identity models and zero-knowledge proofs, for example, grant control over data to the individuals who generate it, allowing them to provide sufficient proof of a clean record without revealing sensitive personal information. But such innovations aren’t getting nearly enough attention,” Casey said.      You can read his full take here, or get it in your inbox by subscribing here.    Best Brella Background  Consensus Magazine    Excerpted from The Men Who Stare at Charts, Ben Munster’s exploration of technical analysis and the people who promote it:    Charts tracking the price of bitcoin dominate six buzzing monitors in the third-floor office of a rotting, centuries-old tower block in the heart of Kiev. A pattern emerges among the shifting forms and shapes, and Brian – a 33-year-old trader who asks we use only his first name – reacts swiftly, punching his extemporaneous analysis into a chatbox on the messenger app Telegram. He has identified the distinctive downward twist of a “falling wedge formation.” To those in the know, that means: The price is going down at a diminishing rate, and should presently head moooooonwards. Get the full story    Jess Klein dives into Generation Crypto, an ageless, country-less and class-less augment cohort aligned by a belief in decentralization and skepticism of received wisdom. This excerpt from her eight part series follows Jesse Grushack – The Burner – co-founder of Ujo Music, the Ethereal festival and one of the main organizers of Node Republik, a Burning Man camp for ConsenSys workers and Ethereum enthusiasts. Read the series.    Jesse Grushack started mining bitcoin in 2010, using all of his computer power over the course of three days to come up with 1/200th of a penny. Despite the discouraging start, Grushack’s interest in cryptocurrency didn’t wane; when he learned about a company called ConsenSys in 2015 via the New York City Tech Slack channel, he got in touch and got a job. “It was just a black website with the one-line description, ‘A decentralized venture studio building applications primarily on Ethereum,’” he recalls, “and I was like, wow, that means nothing.” Read on.    Jeff Wilser profiles David Birch, in The Man Who Forecast a Currency Cold War, excerpted below.    Fintech guru David Birch, a consultant and prolific speaker on the blockchain conference circuit, wrote ""The Currency Cold War: Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates and Hegemony,"" just in time for our global pandemic. He nailed the timing. For years Birch had his own pet theories about a clash of digital currencies. But “that was just me, just some guy talking about it,” he tells me in his British accent, which seems always on the verge of a sly joke. “And who cares, you know?”Then came Jackson Hole. In the fall of 2019, at a Jackson Hole, Wy., event Birch describes as a “Burning Man for people who run central banks,” the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said that perhaps it was time for some form of “synthetic hegemonic currency” to deal with what he called the “destabilizing dominance” of the U.S. dollar.This comment seemed to galvanize Birch. “The Governor of the Bank of England is emphatically not just some guy,” Birch says. He realized the Currency Cold War was not just his own pet theory – it was imminent. It might already be happening. And it has consequences. Which currency would society choose? Would it be one or many? Read the full tale.

42404656,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXlm,1589578152,JK Rowling Asks About Bitcoin. Accursed Crypto Twitter Scares Her Off,"JK Rowling probably wasn’t expecting to unleash the bitcoin community’s pent-up passion and imagination when she tweeted two sentences asking about bitcoin.      But the author of the Harry Potter series did. Responding to a tweet from CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen, Rowling tweeted: “I don’t understand bitcoin. Please explain it to me.” In just two hours her tweet had spawned 1,300 replies.      It took less than three hours for her to follow up with, “I don’t think I trust this.”      Lurking below the Twitter surface is a massive community of people who tweet about almost nothing except bitcoin and cryptocurrency day in and day out, dying to use their niche know-how for the good of the world. Rowling accidentally tapped into it.      In attempts to speak Rowling’s language, many started comparing bitcoin to the wizarding world from her books.      “Remember how He Who Must Not Be Named placed 7 [horcruxes] in different objects around the world in an attempt to immortalize himself, so that no one, not even the Ministry of Magic could stop him?” blockchain lawyer Jenny Leung tweeted.      He Who Must Not Be Named (aka Lord Voldemort) thought it would be unlikely anyone could find all seven horcruxes, making him impervious to destruction.      Similarly, under the hood, bitcoin is composed of thousands of nodes around the globe running the bitcoin software (although the number might be decreasing). It is hard to shut down because all of these nodes need to be shut down at once to derail the online currency.      Steven Zheng, a researcher at crypto publication The Block, focused his Harry Potter metaphor on the goal of bitcoin: giving users freedom to do as they please.      “Remember when Dobby was freed by a sock? Bitcoin is that sock,” he tweeted.      Dobby was a house elf in one of the Harry Potter books who desired nothing more than his freedom, but under the rules of Rowling’s world house elves must be slaves to their owners until they are presented with clothes.      A couple of other tweeters tried to describe bitcoin’s monetary policy by comparing it to the few financial elements scattered in a Harry Potter book.      Read more: CoinDesk 50: Why Bitcoin Is Still King      “Imagine if Gringotts ran on the Floo network,” said Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Cincinnati, referencing Gringotts, the sole bank in the wizarding world, and the Floo network, fireplaces that witches and wizards can use to transport themselves instantly to other places.      “Imagine digital gold Galleons, of which no Philosopher’s Stone could make more. In fact, there is a limited supply, and the only way to earn new Galleons is to compete in the facilitation of transactions using Galleons already in circulation. All without goblin central banks,” Lolli CTO and co-founder Matt Senter tweeted.      In short, bitcoin’s supply is fixed, and probably can’t be changed by any entity, as central banks are able to do around the world in attempts to spur the economy in times of crisis.      Even Tesla's Elon Musk, who is frequently impersonated on Twitter for crypto giveaway scams, weighed in.      But despite these attempts to sway Rowling, some of the analogies may have been a bit too convoluted. “Now I don’t understand bitcoin,” one bitcoiner responded.      And Rowling herself seemed unimpressed by the explanations she received.      “People are now explaining Bitcoin to me, and honestly, it’s blah blah blah collectibles (My Little Pony?) blah blah blah computers (got one of those) blah blah blah crypto (sounds creepy) blah blah blah understand the risk (I don’t, though),” Rowling tweeted.

42383750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKdJ,1589576253,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips as Stock Markets Close Lower on the Week,"Bitcoin’s steady price gains over the past few days ended Friday. With the halving in the rearview mirror, cryptocurrency traders could consider the impact of a continued global economic slowdown after new data showed retail sales dropped to record lows and unemployment numbers continue to worsen.      The world’s first cryptocurrency is trading below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish technical indicator. At press time, BTC was trading down 3.4% over 24 hours at $9,340 00:00 UTC Friday (4 p.m. ET). Bitcoin had experienced steady gains since May 13, yet stumbled in early trading at 02:00 UTC Friday, quickly dropping 5%. Since then, bitcoin clawed back some gains but continues to trend downward.      “Outside events are much more likely to impact bitcoin’s price, like a possible crash of the economy"" because of COVID-19, said Alessandro Andreotti, an Italian over-the-counter cryptocurrency trader.      Uncertainty still exists in equities amid the coronavirus pandemic, and stock markets have performed poorly this week on the murky economic outlook. Data confirmed that: a drop in retail sales by 16.4% in April, the worst since 1992, and U.S. unemployment claims up over 36 million in the same period.      See also: Money Reimagined: No, Secretary Summers, Money Privacy Is a Vital Freedom      The S&P 500 U.S. stock index closed down 2.2% for the week, its worst performance since late March. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of largest publicly traded companies ended trading down for the week 2%. For Asia, the Nikkei 225 of Japan’s largest companies ended the week down overall for the first time since April.      However, not all traditional assets are performing poorly. “Gold and silver are looking strong,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at crypto asset manager Koine. Gold is up 2.8% for the week.      “I think bitcoin will be strong, too,” Douglas added. While losing some steam Friday, there is confidence among stakeholders bitcoin can turn things around and its price rise steadily.      One trader points to less leverage in the derivatives market as a sign of that. “The number of open leveraged positions are down between 25%-50% across major exchanges since March,” said Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at crypto fund NEM Ventures.      On Seychelles-based derivatives exchange BitMEX, open interest hit as high as $1.1 billion back on February 9. Since March 12’s bitcoin price crash caused $700 million in automatic liquidations on BitMEX, daily open interest has dropped significantly. On Friday it was at $596 million.      To be sure, it appears derivatives traders have less of an appetite for leverage positions specifically on BitMEX, where directional bets can be levered up to 100 times collateral.      ”This gives us a good indication that if a sell-off begins to materialize, it will be of smaller magnitude than what we saw in March,” Pelecanos added.      Andreotti, the over-the-counter trader, says that despite his concerns about economic disruptions, he sees the upward trend for bitcoin to return soon. “I think it’s going to maintain the same demand. Prices might go up a little bit, around the $10,000 range,” he told CoinDesk.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Hot Again and Crypto Miners Are Hoarding – Or Are They?      The $10,000 level is a key price range to pique the interest of traders wanting to hit the buy button, according to Katie Stockton, an analyst at Fairfield Strategies. “A breakout above $10,000 level would likely give way to improved short-term momentum,” Stockton noted.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are in the red on Friday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), slipped 4.2% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Losers in 24-hour trading include bitcoin sv (BSV) in the red 4%, iota (IOTA) lower by 3.7% and zcash (ZEC) slipping 3.5%. Ethereum classic (ETC) was the lone winner, up 3.5%.

U.S. Treasury bonds were mixed Friday.

This episode is sponsored by ErisX, The Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Investment Fundhttps://grayscale.co/coindesk.    Niall Ferguson has called this moment an “age of experimentation” when it comes to currencies.      One of the unique features of this moment is the experiments are not limited to the traditional actors. It is not just nation-states trying to elevate their currencies in the face of the global dominance of the dollar, but non-sovereign monies born of decentralized networks that are plausible contenders in this game of currency thrones.      Bitcoin was a byproduct of the last financial crisis. This connection was immortalized in the message embedded in the genesis block: “Jan 03/2009 Chancellor on the brink of a second bailout for banks.”      See also: The Rise of the Dollar Killers      More than a decade on, in our new financial crisis, the size, scale and implications of that bank bailout seem positively quaint in comparison.      This episode looks at where bitcoin and other permissionless, non-state cryptocurrencies fit in the battle for the future of money.      It starts with a look at the bitcoin narrative in the wake of the market crash. With the most significant stock market correlation of its life, did bitcoin’s digital gold narrative evaporate alongside the S&P 500?      From there, we move to an asset that has been massively in demand since the beginning of the crisis: USD stablecoins. We explore whether this is simply an affirmation of the supremacy of the dollar or represents a more disruptive force in the global monetary order.      We conclude with a look at the relevance of bitcoin on the other side of the crisis. As the market moves from deflationary to inflationary, there are many who will be looking to hard assets and sound money as a cure. In that context, bitcoin could thrive.

42383745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKan,1589562652,"Money Reimagined: No, Secretary Summers, Financial Privacy Is a Vital Freedom","CORRECTION (30 May 14:14 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled Jaron Lanier's name.      It was a provocative way to start the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain event of the year.      In the opening session of Consensus: Distributed this week, Lawrence Summers was asked by my co-host Naomi Brockwell about protecting people’s privacy once currencies go digital. His answer: “I think the problems we have now with money involve too much privacy.”      President Clinton’s former Treasury secretary, now President Emeritus at Harvard, referenced the 500-euro note, which bore the nickname “The Bin Laden,” to argue the un-traceability of cash empowers wealthy criminals to finance themselves. “Of all the important freedoms,” he continued, “the ability to possess, transfer and do business with multi-million dollar sums of money anonymously seems to me to be one of the least important.” Summers ended the segment by saying that “if I have provoked others, I will have served my purpose.”      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      That he did. Among the more than 20,000 registered for the weeklong virtual experience was a large contingent of libertarian-minded folks who see state-backed monitoring of their money as an affront to their property rights.      But with due respect to a man who has had prodigious influence on international economic policymaking, it’s not wealthy bitcoiners for whom privacy matters. It matters for all humanity and, most importantly, for the poor.      Now, as the world grapples with how to collect and disseminate public health information in a way that both saves lives and preserves civil liberties, the principle of privacy deserves to be elevated in importance.      Just this week, the U.S. Senate voted to extend the 9/11-era Patriot Act and failed to pass a proposed amendment to prevent the Federal Bureau of Investigation from monitoring our online browsing without a warrant. Meanwhile, our heightened dependence on online social connections during COVID-19 isolation has further empowered a handful of internet platforms that are incorporating troves of our personal data into sophisticated predictive behavior models. This process of hidden control is happening right now, not in some future ""Westworld""-like existence.      Digital currencies will only worsen this situation. If they are added to this comprehensive surveillance infrastructure, it could well spell the end of the civil liberties that underpin Western civilization.    Yes, freedom matters    Please don’t read this, Secretary Summers, as some privileged anti-taxation take or a self-interested what’s-mine-is-mine demand that “the government stay away from my money.”      Money is just the instrument here. What matters is whether our transactions, our exchanges of goods and services and the source of our economic and social value, should be monitored and manipulated by government and corporate owners of centralized databases. It’s why critics of China’s digital currency plans rightly worry about a “panopticon” and why, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there was an initial backlash against Facebook launching its libra currency.      Writers such as Shoshana Zuboff and Jaron Lanier have passionately argued that our subservience to the hidden algorithms of what I like to call “GoogAzonBook” is diminishing our free will. Resisting that is important, not just to preserve the ideal of “the self” but also to protect the very functioning of society.      Markets, for one, are pointless without free will. In optimizing resource allocation, they presume autonomy among those who make up the market. Free will, which I’ll define as the ability to lawfully transact on my own terms without knowingly or unknowingly acting in someone else’s interests to my detriment, is a bedrock of market democracies. Without a sufficient right to privacy, it disintegrates – and in the digital age, that can happen very rapidly.      Also, as I’ve argued elsewhere, losing privacy undermines the fungibility of money. Each digital dollar should be substitutable for another. If our transactions carry a history and authorities can target specific notes or tokens for seizure because of their past involvement in illicit activity, then some dollars become less valuable than other dollars.    The excluded    But to fully comprehend the harm done by encroachments into financial privacy, look to the world’s poor.      An estimated 1.7 billion adults are denied a bank account because they can’t furnish the information that banks’ anti-money laundering (AML) officers need, either because their government’s identity infrastructure is untrusted or because of the danger to them of furnishing such information to kleptocratic regimes. Unable to let banks monitor them, they’re excluded from the global economy’s dominant payment and savings system – victims of a system that prioritizes surveillance over privacy.      Misplaced priorities also contribute to the “derisking” problem faced by Caribbean and Latin American countries, where investment inflows have slowed and financial costs have risen in the past decade. America’s gatekeeping correspondent banks, fearful of heavy fines like the one imposed on HSBC for its involvement in a money laundering scandal, have raised the bar on the kind of personal information that regional banks must obtain from their local clients.    And where’s the payoff? Despite this surveillance system, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between $800 billion and $2 trillionhttps://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/globalization.html, or 2%-5% of global gross domestic product, is laundered annually worldwide. The Panama Papers case shows how the rich and powerful easily use lawyers, shell companies, tax havens and transaction obfuscation to get around surveillance. The poor are just excluded from the system.  Caring about privacy    Solutions are coming that wouldn’t require abandoning law enforcement efforts. Self-sovereign identity models and zero-knowledge proofs, for example, grant control over data to the individuals who generate it, allowing them to provide sufficient proof of a clean record without revealing sensitive personal information. But such innovations aren’t getting nearly enough attention.      Few officials inside developed country regulatory agencies seem to acknowledge the cost of cutting off 1.7 billion poor from the financial system. Yet, their actions foster poverty and create fertile conditions for terrorism and drug-running, the very crimes they seek to contain. The reaction to evidence of persistent money laundering is nearly always to make bank secrecy laws even more demanding. Exhibit A: Europe’s new AML 5 directive.      To be sure, in the Consensus discussion that followed the Summers interview, it was pleasing to hear another former U.S. official take a more accommodative view of privacy. Former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said that “getting the privacy balance right” is a “design imperative” for the digital dollar concept he is actively promoting.      But to hold both governments and corporations to account on that design, we need an aware, informed public that recognizes the risks of ceding their civil liberties to governments or to GoogAzonBook.      Let’s talk about this, people.    A missing asterisk    Control for all variables. At the end of the day, the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency ultimately comes down to how much the rest of the world trusts the United States to continue its de facto leadership of the world economy. In the past, that assessment was based on how well the U.S. militarily or otherwise dealt with human- and state-led threats to international commerce such as Soviet expansionism or terrorism. But in the COVID-19 era only one thing matters: how well it is leading the fight against the pandemic.      So if you’ve already seen the charts below and you’re wondering what they’re doing in a newsletter about the battle for the future of money, that’s why. They were inspired by a staged White House lawn photo-op Tuesday, where President Trump was flanked by a huge banner that dealt quite literally with a question of American leadership. It read, “America Leads the World in Testing.” That’s a claim that’s technically correct, but one that surely demands a big red asterisk. When you’re the third-largest country by population – not to mention the richest – having the highest number of tests is not itself much of an achievement. The claim demands a per capita adjustment. Here’s how things look, first in absolute terms, then adjusted for tests per million inhabitants.      American leadership? You decide.    Global town hall    We’re grateful to the gods of randomness. Those who set the time for each quadrennial bitcoin halving decided to bestow on CoinDesk the opportunity to “host” the most recent one on Monday, May 11, the first day of Consensus: Distributed. (Even better, they put the change in the miners’ block reward – from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC – in the New York afternoon, right in the middle of a session moderated by the best people to discuss it: our research team, who’ve been all over why this event matters.)      That fortuitous occurrence left me with this question: Why were we all so excited about this supposedly predictable, expected event? I don’t think it’s entirely because the halving has historically been accompanied by price gains (in apparent defiance of the “efficient market hypothesis”), though the “number go up” force is strong within the crypto community.      To me, the halving is a powerful reminder that despite its (relatively) predictable timing, no one can stop this pre-programmed event from happening. The halving is a demonstration of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. At a time when the economic lives of seven billion people hinge, to no small degree, on the decisions of the 12 human beings who occupy the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee, the mathematical unstoppableness of bitcoin is kind of appealing, no?      “Negative rates.” Expect those two words to become a talking point, both in traditional financial and in crypto circles. In comments during a Peterson Institute online interview Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell played down the prospect of the Fed taking its target rate below zero. The stock market fell in disappointment that Powell was putting a limit on future monetary stimulus. But bitcoin markets read things differently, seemingly getting a bump from the very fact that the topic was even discussed. Perhaps, as a market, the latter is less mature than the former. Maybe crypto traders wake up to an idea long after it’s already priced into traditional markets.      But the diametrically opposed responses might also reflect completely different investment narratives and contexts. Undoubtedly, the stock market views negative rates as a big, unprecedented event. Yet, if equity traders are wishing for them, it’s not because they see them an existential challenge to the entire financial system – to think that way would be to bet against themselves. Many bitcoin investors, by contrast, are betting on the upending of everything. To them, negative interests could imply the U.S. is abandoning its “strong dollar” role as global monetary backstop, which could in turn deplete faith in fiat generally and move money into bitcoin. I have no idea whose perspective is right, but I’m quite certain we haven’t heard the end of the debate on the Fed going negative.      The blockchain-based identity model has a shot at legitimacy in the global financial system. The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a standardizing body for legal financial entity identifiers created by the Group of 20 nation’s Financial Stability Board is launching a pilot with Evernym, which uses the Sovrin protocol and blockchain technology to build self-sovereign credentialing systems. It’s a radical shift for GLEIF, which was founded by the central bank-led FSB to bring consistency to proofs of identity in the fast-moving global financial system to reduce the risk of fraud and boost efficiency. The idea of a decentralized identity management system is potentially quite important. Where goes identity, so too goes money.       Is bitcoin the answer for a global monetary system not longer served by the dollar standard? Airing Friday, May 15, episode 3 of The Breakdown: Money Reimagined examines bitcoin and permissionless stablecoins – both of which are forcing the global monetary system to examine deeply ingrained beliefs.      The Breakdown: Money Reimagined is a podcast crossover micro series exploring the battle for the future of money in the context of a post COVID-19 world.

But they're leery of blockchain.      London-based journal Central Banking, a specialized publication supported, among others, by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the European Central Bank (ECB), found in its inaugural CBDC survey released last week that 65% of respondents had actively researched digital currencies.      But the survey, conducted in February, found only one central bank would use blockchain as the basis for a CBDC. Described as a ""small African central bank,"" the survey noted that bank said it would only consider using blockchain ""if found to be the best available platform."" That and the other 45 banks were not identified.      Central Banking's survey doesn't delve much further into why central banks don't want to use blockchain. One North African central bank said it had concerns about blockchain's security and scalability issues. Whether this was an attitude held by other survey respondents isn't clear.      While most central banks dismissed blockchain, 71% of respondents said they would consider building a CBDC on DLT – a broader category of network architectures, blockchain being one of them – if they reached the issuance stage.      The survey added the caveat that the majority of central banks researching CBDCs had no plans to actually move forward with issuing one.      See also: CipherTrace Wants to Guide Central Banks on Their Digital Currency Projects      DLT includes private and permissioned networks, shared with a handful of known and trusted nodes. In the survey, banks indicated there was a trade-off with decentralization: distributed frameworks created operational resilience against a single point of failure; but there were also privacy issues, with more parties likely having ready access to confidential transaction data.      The survey also cites the Bank of England's CBDC discussion paper from March, which shows that while there are clear benefits to using distributed networks, they also represent a major shakeup of the existing monetary system, for which some financial institutions may be ill-prepared.      See also: Mauritius Central Banker Confirms Island’s Digital Currency Plans      This report doesn't offer many surprises about central bank intentions for CBDCs, but it indicates change may be afoot. Decentralization used to be considered a binary concept: It either was or it wasn’t. But that’s not a choice many new entities entering the space want to face.

42383731,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKLh,1589551226,CZ's Twitter Feed Swayed New CoinMarketCap Ranking That Put Binance on Top,"A month on from Binance buying CoinMarketCap for a rumored $400 million, the crypto price aggregation site has unveiled an exchange ranking system that gives its new owner the best score possible thanks, in part, to the CEO's Twitter feed.      ""We listened,"" said CoinMarketCap's new owner, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, tweeting the news out on Thursday. He was referring to the fact many traders had expressed concerns about exchanges artificially inflating volumes so they seem more prominent – known as wash trading. ""Now, I can finally have a clear view of the field and see who the real upcoming exchanges are, lol.""      CoinMarketCap's new metric focuses on web traffic. In a blog post this week, the price site – which received nearly 29 million visits in April – argued metrics including page views, time-on-site and bounce rate were a ""good intermediate proxy"" for determining how much of an exchange's activity was actually human.      Coincidentally, perhaps, Binance absolutely aced these new rankings. It achieved a perfect web score factor – 1,000 out of a possible 1,000 – which means CoinMarketCap believes 100% activity on Binance is human. In comparison, close rivals Coinbase Pro and Kraken achieved a web score factor of 972 and 856, respectively.      Lol indeed.      Decrypt reported Binance had been ranked 15 under CoinMarketCap's old exchange metric system. While the previous system had shown adjusted volumes, which excluded potentially skewed or suspicious data, the new rankings only show volumes supplied by the exchanges themselves.      On this metric too, Binancecomes in first place, with reported volumes at just under $8 billion in 24 hours, with both Kraken and Coinbase's volumes at roughly $450 million per day.      ""This exchange ranking is much more useable now,"" Zhao said in a follow-up tweet, adding they'll seek to better hone the new exchange ranking going forward. CoinMarketCap's blog post said the site is also designing a new algorithm that would use liquidity and orderbook depth to better detect disparities between actual and reported volumes.      See also: Binance Invests in Regulated Indonesian Crypto Exchange      CoinMarketCap was previously against the idea of using web traffic for ranking. Chief Strategy Officer Carylyne Chan had said in a podcast late last year, when it was still an independent firm, that web traffic was “not a good indicator” as many traders use API keys, which obfuscate data collected.      Chan, who is now CoinMarketCap's acting CEO, said on Twitter earlier Friday that web traffic would be ""only *one of many factors* that will make up the final algorithm. I have said *more recently* that speed is imperative, hence we're iterating instead of waiting months."" [Emphasis hers.]      Talking to CoinDesk, Chan said, ""We have been updating our ranking metric over the last year, as evidenced by our ongoing work with Liquidity Metric and Liquidity Score ... In this update, we have also explicitly stated that Web Traffic Factor is only one of many factors that will be in the final iteration of the ranking.""      CoinDesk asked Chan if Binance had been involved in the decision to alter the ranking system. She said the site ""used CZ’s Twitter presence and feed as a channel to gather feedback."" However, it was one of various inputs into the ranking methodology improvement process, which also included customer surveys.      See also: Binance Doesn’t Have a Headquarters Because Bitcoin Doesn’t, Says CEO      Some crypto traders aren't happy about the change. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, tweeted earlier Friday that Binance had ""abused"" its CoinMarketCap acquisition ""to manipulate the rankings.""

We've heard from former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers describe the current monetary system as too private, Governor Harvesh Seegolam of the Bank of Mauritius inch closer to a central bank digital currency and World Economic Forum Blockchain head Sheila Warren say digital cash might open the door for niche privacy coins.      So where does that leave us? With a full day of programming.      This is what my colleague Leigh Cuen will track throughout the day:    We’ve finally reached the last day of Consensus: Distributed and there’s still so much going on.If you haven’t perused the Sponsors section of Brella and talked with companies such as eToro, CME Group and Kraken, many of which are hiring, that’s a great way to start the morning. Then there’s a show on cryptocurrency in Japan, starting at 11 a.m. ET with experts from the Financial Services Agency Japan, Coinbase and Soramitsu Holdings. Japan is the quiet juggernaut in Asia, home to BTCPay founder Nicolas Dorier, the Bitcoin Core contributors of DG Labs, and a careful regulatory climate ever since the infamous Mt. Gox hack. As such, the market arguably has fewer scams coupled with a robust bitcoin community. Japan’s cultural impact on the global crypto industry shouldn’t be underestimated. After all, Satoshi Nakamoto is a Japanese alias. Next, I recommend Bailey Reutzel’s show about bitcoin mining, with Edge CEO Paul Puey and Alejandro De La Torre of Poolin at 3:30 p.m. ET. It’s titled “Subsidies and Secret Messages: All About Mining.” Then your brain will probably need a break from all that blockchain chatter. Luckily, we’ve got an after-party led by a group including the artist Josie Bellini, Travis Blane of ConsenSys and Reckless VR founder Udi Wertheimer. Starting at 5 p.m. ET, the virtual reality meetup will open with a panel about spaces, both virtual and physical. After that there shall be much avatar revelry, merrymaking and networking. If you’ve got a VR headset, check it out and post your experiences on social media using the hashtag #ConsensusDistributed. Thanks for joining us for the first virtual New York Blockchain Week!

Consensus Magazine    Generation Crypto Freelance journalist Jess Klein writes about an emerging psychographic of people who see the world through the lens of decentralization. In a series of eight profiles, Klein examines “Generation Crypto,” a diffuse grouping of people of all ages, races and sexes, bound together as “children of Satoshi.”      This excerpt examines the life of Shanga Mbuli, a father of six living in Kenya, who uses the little-known sarafu cryptocurrency in daily life. Read the full series here.      A 42-year-old father of six, Shanga Mbuli lives in the small Kenyan village of Miyani, just a few kilometers from the ocean, where he catches shrimp to sell to fellow villagers. The nearest city is Mombasa, but Mbuli’s life as a rural farmer doesn’t include many visits there. Most of his buying and selling takes place among other community members. Since 2017, he’s been using a community currency, called sarafu, established by the non-profit Grassroots Economics to exchange local goods and services.      Sarafu is a digital currency built on blockchain technology so users can trade it with trust. It was designed for villages that are full of people with goods and services to offer but little government-issued currency to spend. In Mbuli’s 6,000-person community, nearly all are registered with the Sarafu Network. Mbuli accepts sarafu in exchange for shrimp he catches and maize he grows on his farm, and uses it to pay for rice and services like transportation and maize grinding. He likes sarafu because he finds it to be secure, and it makes his community “more connected,” he told me one evening in mid-March while walking to the nearby river to fetch water. Kids passing by and roosters calling sounded in the background.      At that time, Kenya had just one confirmed case of coronavirus, in its capital city Nairobi. By the time we caught up again on Sunday, April 4, no cases had made it over to Mbuli’s rural community, but people there were preparing. City dwellers from Mombasa were returning to their families in rural villages like his in time for a shelter-in-place order to go into effect on April 11, and some could have been carrying the virus. Most in Mbuli’s village were readying to be confined to their homes for at least 21 days. Mbuli had stockpiled enough food for “at least two to three years.”      “People are now purchasing a lot of food through Sarafu so they can have a stock in their house to feed their families during the time of the virus,” Mbuli says. The day before we spoke, Mbuli sold almost 100,000 Kenya Shillings ($94) worth of maize in Sarafu, compared to the usually 15,000 or 20,000 worth he might sell daily.      Sarafu’s user numbers have gone up, too, with the return of people from Mombasa to Mbuli’s village. “Those in Mombasa weren’t registered, so more people have been registered this week and are using more Sarafu,” he says, since the currency is local. “The more you use Sarafu, the more you save Kenya Shillings,” which are often the only currency accepted at institutions like schools.      There’s another upside to using Sarafu over Kenya Shillings during the Covid-19 outbreak – users don’t have to touch it. They can just send Sarafu through their phones, a convenience that will likely outlast its temporary usefulness during a viral outbreak.

First Mover    Miners Hodl as Bitcoin Rallies Bitcoin is rallying again, though new data shows mining pools are hanging onto the cryptocurrency they mine rather than sending it to exchanges for a quick sale, according to the Korean analytics firm CryptoQuant. One possibility explaining this behavior is that the miner community might be expecting a big price rally at some point down the road, said Brad Keoun in the latest First Mover newsletter. Another is that miners might be worried the market is looking weak, or thin: If they transferred their bitcoins to an exchange en route to cashing out, the heavy surge in sell orders might cause prices to collapse.

42383737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKQj,1589547742,Visa Patent Filing Would Allow Central Banks to Mint Digital Fiat Currencies Using Blockchain,"Visa looks to be laying the groundwork for a future in which fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar could be easily turned into a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The California-based payments giant, which processes upwards of 100 million transactions every day on average, has filed a patent application for a process for turning physical fiat currency into a newly digitized version.      The filing, which was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in November and made public on Thursday, says the system would be able to mint digital fiat currency and keep a tally of all issuances on the blockchain. Managed by a ""central entity computer,"" the system would also remove physical cash from circulation.      See also: Bank of England: No Compromise on Our Principles for Any Future CBDC      By the sounds of it, newly created digital fiat would be the exact equivalent, like for like, with physical cash. The denomination and serial number would even be carried over into the new system. The patent also says some sort of ""trusted certificate"" would be required to mint the digital cash, presumably to keep issuance a tightly controlled process.      Visa doesn't give much away about what a ""central entity computer"" would be specifically, though the filing states: ""A central entity may be a central bank, which regulates a monetary supply.""      Part of its role, it seems, is to act as a monetary overseer, charged with managing volumes and ensuring the value of the digital currency always remains linked to the physical fiat. The central computer would also be the only one able to generate new digital cash; the sole gatekeeper for value entering the ecosystem.      There's no sense from the filing that other entities, public or private, would play a role in the ecosystem. Visa assumes the entity running the central computer would have the authority to take physical fiat currency out of circulation, and even destroy it.      It's important to stress that just because Visa has filed this patent application doesn't necessarily mean it is intent on developing a digital fiat currency system. What it does show, however, is existing electronic payments firms, ones that have done extraordinarily well in the existing legacy system, are now also exploring innovations in the realm of money.      See also: ‘Digital Dollar’ Reintroduced by US Lawmakers in Latest Stimulus Bill      On May 12, Visa was also awarded a patent for a detokenization system, a means to redeem an asset locked in token format.

42383740,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKRz,1589546343,CoinDesk 50: Bakkt – Financializing Bitcoin,"Bakkt's debut last September was one of the most eagerly awaited launches in crypto because it promised something groundbreaking and potentially momentous for the industry: institutional access to actual bitcoin.      The crypto-first subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange wouldn’t exactly buy or sell bitcoin for you, but its ambitious goal of offering the first physically settled futures contracts in the U.S. using a daily expiration structure almost promised to do just that. More important, this financialization of bitcoin could open the market to more types of traders (and speculators), offering skeptical firms that might not be able to trade bitcoin directly or the cash-settled futures offered by CME a new way of getting into the space.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    Not content with serving institutional clients bitcoin options and futures contracts, the Atlanta-based Bakkt is now planning a push into the retail market as the second phase of its rollout. And while it may not have the largest trading volume, its connections to the traditional financial markets as an Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) subsidiary give it a unique position among its competitors.      Bakkt was unveiled in August 2018 as a venture aimed at offering dally physically settled bitcoin futures contracts. Its plans changed over the next year – it now offers daily and monthly physically settled contracts, monthly cash-settled contracts and options – but the company went live with its first products in September 2019.      These products were available to ICE’s clearinghouse members, which include a number of traditional financial firms and Wall Street mainstays. Bakkt opened the door to these firms being able to purchase bitcoin, after a fashion.      “When you think about transacting on the futures exchange you’re operating within a [federally] regulated exchange,” then-CEO Kelly Loeffler (now a U.S. Senator for the state of Georgia) said at the time.    This financialization of bitcoin could open the market to more types of traders (and speculators)    Bakkt’s original vision also created some unique regulatory challenges. It planned to custody the bitcoin it offered through its contracts, which is not typical for commodity futures providers, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission J. Christopher Giancarlo hinted some eight months after Bakkt was first announced.      U.S. law stated that entities offering physically settled futures contracts had to custody the physical commodities at a state-regulated bank or trust, which Bakkt was not (at the time). Bakkt revised its plans and applied for a trust license under the New York State Department of Financial Services, which was granted in August.      “The … thing that’s important about a monthly contract is what it offers is the ability to take [snapshots] at different times throughout the next year so it adds spread trading … and timing of, for example the halvening coming up next year, the contract, you’ll be able to look out into that time period in 2020,” Loeffler told CoinDesk in August.      Now, just over seven months after launching its first physical contracts, Bakkt is focusing on streamlining rewards points and payments through digital currencies. The company announced in October it was creating a mobile application it hoped would let consumers transact using bitcoin and other tools or currencies.      The app itself isn’t live yet, but Bakkt has already begun testing mobile payments with Starbucks, one of its original launch partners, which now offers some users the chance to pay for their coffees using “Bakkt Cash” through the Seattle firm’s mobile app.      This phase of the project appears to harken back to Bakkt’s earliest days. In August 2018 the company announced it would be working with Starbucks to create “practical” applications for consumers.      The vision has evolved into an ambitious plan to unite loyalty programs such as airline miles and hotel points with gaming tokens and cryptocurrencies, creating a single payments tool. Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, said during an earnings call earlier this year that Bakkt could one day become a marketplace for these types of rewards points.      “We will be looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/15/coindesk-50-bakkt-financializing-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d4dc29bfa6512f6e65153cf981f10812baab3a4-1432x788.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383746,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKc3,1589545242,First Mover: Bitcoin’s Hot Again and Crypto Miners Are Hoarding – Or Are They?,"Bitcoin is rallying again, and some analysts are looking at a potential driver of even higher prices: new data showing that mining pools are hanging onto the cryptocurrency rather than sending it to exchanges for a quick sale.      But as with a lot of bitcoin analysis, the interpretation isn't always clear-cut; the data might be seen differently as a sign of a weak market.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Charts provided by the Korean analytics firm CryptoQuant show a slowdown in outflows from cryptocurrency mining pools, which essentially aggregate computing power to increase their collective chance of getting more bitcoin.      The Beijing-based F2Pool, for example, which currently accounts for 17.1% of the Bitcoin blockchain’s total computing power, witnessed an outflow of 139 bitcoins on Wednesday, the fewest in nearly six months, according to CryptoQuant. Of those, 29 bitcoins got sent to cryptocurrency exchanges, the fewest in at least a year.      Taken alone, the slowdown shows mining pools are hanging onto the bitcoin rather than transferring them to an exchange for a quick monetization.      But what it means for prices is trickier.      One possibility is the miner community might be expecting a big price rally at some point down the road.      Another is miners might be worried the market is looking weak or thin: If they transferred their bitcoins to an exchange en route to cashing out, the heavy surge in sell orders might cause prices to collapse.      Mining pools typically account for the highest percentage of coins sent to exchanges, so they tend to have a big impact on the market.      The dynamic is analogous to the delicate balance some central banks face when trying to build up foreign reserves or intervene in currency markets. Take the Reserve Bank of India, for example. When the market for the Indian rupee is strong and trending higher, it’s easier for the RBI to buy U.S. dollars without driving down the value of its own currency. If the central bank buys dollars while the rupee market is soft, the sell-off in the local currency only deepens.      The very exercise of studying mining pool behavior highlights the emerging field of “on-chain analysis,” in which data gleaned directly from the public blockchain network are aggregated, sorted and charted to map out where the money is flowing.      There are a lot of forces at play right now in the bitcoin market. Originally, the cryptocurrency was designed to be used in an electronic peer-to-peer payment network, but increasingly it has become popular among many investors as a potential hedge against inflation.      And while there's the possibly inflationary forces of trillions of dollars of emergency money injections by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, there's also the deflationary impact of the coronavirus-induced recession, the worst since the early 20th century.      With so much to think about, the thinking goes, on-chain analysis can provide additional clues on where prices are headed.      One issue for the analysts is the data can sometimes seem contradictory.      Another on-chain metric is the “miner’s rolling inventory,” or MRI.      This gauge measures changes in bitcoin inventory levels held by the miners. An MRI above 100% means miners are selling more than they mine, while a sub-100% reading indicates hoarding – selling less than they mine and building inventory.      On Wednesday the MRI stood at 114%, meaning miners were reducing inventory over the past 24 hours by spending more than they mined. The MRIs for one-week, five-week and 12-week periods also are hovering above 100%.      These signals might be an indication miners see the market as strong enough to absorb the extra selling pressure.      Such efforts to scrub the on-chain data and then interpret them show how cryptocurrency-market investors and analysts are scrambling to keep up with fast-evolving digital-asset markets that are in many ways similar to traditional markets, but in other ways fundamentally different.      ""Bitcoin is a bit [of an] alternative, and there aren't really established fundamentals for it,” Delphi Digital’s Yan Liberman said Thursday on a panel at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed conference, where analysts discussed different ways of slicing on-chain data.      In that context, he said, the specialized practice “kind of becomes fundamental for bitcoin.”    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,572 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,867 | 24-Hr Low: $9,262      Trend: Bitcoin is exhibiting high price volatility while heading into the weekend. The top cryptocurrency by market value fell from $9,750 to $9,262 during the 60 minutes to 03:00 UTC, only to rise back above $9,700 during the early European trading hours.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,590, representing an over 18% gain from the low of $8,100 observed a day before Monday's block reward halving. As such, traders may conclude that the pullback from recent highs above $10,000 has ended and the broader bull trend from March lows has resumed.      However, chart analysts suggest a convincing move above the $10,074 is needed to restore the bullish bias. ""Bulls need to close this week above the previous week's high to remain in full control,"" tweeted NebraskanGooner, a popular trader and an adviser to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      Indeed, a weekly close (Sunday, 00:00 UTC) above $10,074 would invalidate the buyer exhaustion signaled by the previous week's ""spinning top"" candle and restore the bull trend on the technical charts.      That said, the bullish weekly close may remain elusive if the cryptocurrency fails to hold at or over current levels according to renowned analyst Josh Rager. ""A failure to close (the day) above $9,550 would indicate a top has been made,"" Rager tweeted.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading above $9,550, having bounced up from $9,200 early Friday. However, the price bounce lacks credence due to low buying volumes and could be short lived. In fact, the entire rise from $8,100 to $9,940 seen earlier this week has been accompanied by anemic buying volumes.      All in all, a re-test of $9,200 in the next 24 hours cannot be ruled out.

42383747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKZX,1589543787,Bitcoin Options Trading at CME Surged to New Highs in Halving Week,"Investor interest in bitcoin options listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) peaked to record highs in the days after the recent halving event.      Bitcoin underwent its much-anticipated reward halving on Monday, at which point the reward per block mined was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.      On the same day, daily options trading volume on the CME jumped to $17 million, surpassing the lifetime high of $9.9 million set on May 6, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Notably, volume has continued to grow ever since.        On Tuesday, the CME set a new record of $30 million, which was smashed on the following day with a total tally of $40 million. The exchange recorded volume of $36 million on Thursday, marking a 2,000% rise from the volume of $1.7 million registered a week ago.      Volume refers to the number of contacts traded during a specific period. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before the specified date. A call option represents a right to buy, and a put option represents a right to sell.      CME has also recorded an over 270% rise in open interest over the last seven days.      Open interest, or the number of outstanding positions at a given point of time, hit consecutive record highs on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. The exchange closed trading on Thursday with $142 million worth of open positions.      The surge in both volumes and open interest represents increased institutional participation. “Options are one product that attract sophisticated traders,” Skew’s CEO Emmanuel Goh said at Consensus: Distributed on Thursday.      Sophisticated traders or institutions usually take positions in options to hedge their positions in the spot or futures market. For instance, prominent trading firms held long positions in the spot market and bought put options (bearish bets) to protect against a sudden downside move in the days leading up to the reward halving.      Also read: Bitcoin’s Price Has Bounced but Miners May Still Be Switching Off Post-Halving      Similar hybrid strategies may have boosted activity on the CME over the past few days. Moreover, investors had strong reason to hedge over the past seven days due to increased price volatility. Bitcoin fell sharply from $10,000 to $8,000 last weekend, catching some traders off guard. Prices then rose to almost $10,000 on Wednesday. Most analysts were expecting prices to correct after the halving.      The post-halving surge in activity on CME has been mainly driven by increased interest in call options. “It has been mostly calls expiring in May and June,” Goh told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. However, it is not clear whether investors bought or sold calls.      It looks possible that investors are hedging by accumulating puts. That's because the one-month put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, has increased from 4% to 12% in the last 24 hours, according to Skew data.      However, Skew’s option market metrics are based on data from Panama-based Deribit exchange – the largest options exchange by trading volumes. “We mark our implied vol curve and skew out the deribit market. CME might see a different dynamic,"" Goh said.      While activity on CME has surged this week, the exchange still contributes a very small amount of the aggregate options trading volume.      The Chicago exchange accounted for 17% of the total global trading volume of $205 million registered on Wednesday. Meanwhile, more than 70%, or $149 million, came from Deribit.      As seen above, options volume has risen on all major exchanges in the days around the halving.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/15/bitcoin-options-trading-at-cme-surged-to-new-highs-in-halving-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3488397e93351ed3a88de739300c35ce1824573b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the custodial services of BitGo, we want to make cryptocurrency utilization in India, safe and secure,” Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX, said in the announcement.      See also: Crypto.com Lands Record $360M Insurance Cover for Offline Bitcoin Vaults      According to BitGo CEO Mike Belshe on stage at CoinDesk Invest: N.Y. last year, the custodian processed at the time more than 20 percent of bitcoin transactions, meaning a sizable share of all on-chain transaction pass through its services.      Alongside a recent Supreme Court order overturning the Indian central bank's ban on banking services for crypto firms, CoinDCX said it saw an increase in trading volumes by up to 47% in the first quarter of 2020, while user signups were up 10-fold.      Weeks after the ban lifted, CoinDCX raised $3 million in a Series A round that was joined by investment firms Bain Capital and Polychain Capital, as well as BitMEX-owner HDR Global Trading.      With the local crypto industry now open again, investors and major exchanges have been eyeing moves into India. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said India was now entering a crypto ""renaissance"" and that he was seeking suitable investments in the nation.      And trading platforms such as Binance and Kraken have both indicated they would expand into the potentially huge market. Binance and its local exchange subsidiary WazirX launched a $50 million blockchain fund to boost local startups less than two weeks after the Supreme Court decision.

42383743,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKX1,1589529600,"Pantera Crypto Hedge Funds Are Losing Double Digits, Bitcoin Fund Is Up 10,000% to Date","Heavy losses are rocking alternative crypto-asset funds at Pantera Capital, one of the oldest cryptocurrency investment managers, and providing stark contrast to its bitcoin (BTC) fund’s gains.      Pantera Capital’s flagship bitcoin fund – a fund holding BTC since 2013 and bitcoin cash (BCH) since 2017 – lost 75.6% in 2018 and gained 87.7% in 2019, according to internal materials seen by CoinDesk. The last two years dragged the bitcoin fund’s all-time returns to 10,162%, down 54% from 2017’s peak of 22,321% but still exceeding returns at elite funds hundreds of times over.      On the newer end, three hybrid Pantera Capital hedge funds created in 2017 were solidly negative, suggesting access to deals was not indicative of investment performance and that novel coin vehicles were highly risky or hard for the firm to actively manage.      From inception to the end of 2019, a Pantera Capital digital asset fund that trades a hodgepodge of free-floating virtual currencies – like ether (ETH), XRP and zcash(ZEC) – lost 72.8%. An initial coin offering (ICO) fund, 42.2% under, lost roughly three times more than a long-term twin fund’s 14.5% decline. About $1 million to $5 million was allocated to each of Pantera’s nearly 40 ICO deals, the materials say.      Read more: Investors in Polychain Capital’s Crypto Hedge Fund Saw 1,332% Gains – If They Stomached the Dips      “A lot of the ICO assets are relatively young compared to bitcoin. And because of their relative youth, the expectation should be that it should take time for those assets to come into their own,” a Pantera Capital fund investor, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk.      The more exotic investments in the digital asset fund were ERC-20 tokens and contracts on Augur, a crypto-betting portal spawned by Pantera Capital co-chief investment officer Joey Krug. Dan Morehead, the first chief investment officer and formerly Tiger Management’s chief financial officer, founded Pantera Capital in 2013.      Pantera Capital did not respond to requests for comment. The cryptocurrency investment firm recorded $470 million in assets under management across seven non-venture and venture funds at the close of the 2019 fiscal year. The passive bitcoin fund had $110 million, the three hedge funds had $90 million and the three venture funds had $270 million.      Some $95 million was committed to the first two venture funds from 2013 to 2019. The third venture fund has been raising $175 million since 2018 to invest in cryptocurrency companies of all sizes. Notable venture investments include Bakkt, Bitstamp, ErisX and others.    Fund dynamics    Pantera Capital’s track record underscores how market forces can shape a fund’s performance.      The best year, 2017, propelled by a breakout run-up in cryptocurrency prices, delivered the bitcoin, digital asset and regular and long-term ICO funds returns of 1,565%, 145.6%, 347.6% and 6% gains, respectively. The worst year across the board – 2018, driven by a crypto-market comedown – cut 87.2% from the digital asset fund, 83.1% from the regular ICO fund and 9.6% from the long-term ICO fund.      The funds lost money again in 2019: 1.9% in the digital asset fund, 23.5% in the regular ICO fund and 9.6% in the long-term ICO fund. More time could turn the newer funds around, though, as strong gains in earlier years did to cushion the blow of 2014’s second-worst 58.1% loss for the bitcoin fund.      Read more: Bitcoin Dominance Is Making Investors Rich, Thanks to Crypto Hedge Funds      At least $100,000 is required to invest in the four Pantera Capital funds, which reportedly have Benchmark Capital, Fortress Investment Group and Ribbit Capital on their roster of limited partners, and which permit withdrawals quarterly from the digital asset and ICO funds and daily from the bitcoin fund.      Regulatory barriers could be to blame as much as the market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies. Some Pantera Capital ICO investments were arranged with Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), contractual arrangements that tend to shoehorn crypto-asset compliance into current securities laws.      The appeasement is no guarantee in the United States, Pantera Capital’s home base, and may explain shortcomings with the ICO investment model: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sidelined the SAFT framework in an injunction halting the Kik messenger’s $100 million offering of a Kin coin that was backed in part by Pantera Capital.      “There is no question the ICO environment has been affected by regulatory pressure,” the Pantera Capital limited partner said.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETH,BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Ada Hui,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/15/pantera-crypto-hedge-funds-are-losing-double-digits-bitcoin-fund-is-up-10000-to-date,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd35f24448ebb4b01e19553b7e8ef520d39bc8c7-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
