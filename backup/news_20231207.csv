21168321,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560645,1701993578,What Is Defi? An Explainer And Guide,"Decentralized Finance, commonly known as DeFi, is rapidly reshaping the landscape of financial transactions and systems in our increasingly digital world. This innovative approach to finance merges traditional monetary processes with the cutting-edge technology of blockchain, offering a more accessible, transparent, and efficient financial system. In this guide, we delve into the question “What Is DeFi”, we aim to demystify decentralized finance, illustrating its importance and impact in today’s financial and cryptocurrency landscapes. What Is DeFi? DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, represents a paradigm shift in the way we think about financial services. At its core, DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries. Unlike traditional banking systems that rely on institutions like banks and governments, DeFi operates on a decentralized network, typically using blockchain technology. This means that DeFi platforms are not controlled by any single entity and are instead maintained by a distributed network of computers. DeFi encompasses a broad spectrum of financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, investment, and insurance, all without the need for a central authority. This approach aims to democratize finance by making these services accessible to anyone with an internet connection, reducing costs, and increasing transaction speed and transparency. DeFi Explained: How It Challenges Traditional Finance DeFi stands in stark contrast to traditional finance in several key ways. The most notable difference is the elimination of intermediaries. In traditional finance, banks, brokers, and other financial institutions act as gatekeepers, controlling access to financial services and often creating bottlenecks. DeFi, however, uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions, effectively removing these intermediaries. This decentralization offers numerous advantages: Lower Fees: Without intermediaries charging for their services, DeFi platforms can significantly reduce transaction costs. This cost efficiency is particularly beneficial in cross-border transactions, where traditional banking fees can be substantial. No Central Point Of Control: In traditional finance, centralized systems create points of vulnerability, where failure or attack can have widespread repercussions. DeFi’s decentralized nature mitigates this risk, distributing operations across a blockchain network, enhancing security and resilience. Accessibility And Inclusivity: DeFi democratizes finance by providing access to financial services to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of location or status. This is particularly crucial for unbanked or underbanked populations who have limited access to traditional banking services. Transparency And Auditability: Blockchain’s transparent ledger allows for greater visibility into transactions and smart contract operations, fostering trust among users. The Role Of Blockchain Blockchain is the backbone of DeFi. It’s a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data cannot be altered retroactively. This technology enables the creation of smart contracts – self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts automate and enforce the terms of an agreement, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the chances of fraud. In DeFi, blockchain not only ensures the security and transparency of transactions but also allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that operate on this technology. These dApps provide various financial services directly to users, bypassing traditional financial institutions and reducing costs. The innovation of blockchain in DeFi represents a significant step towards a more open, inclusive, and efficient financial system, promising to revolutionize the way we interact with money. DeFi In The World Of Cryptocurrency DeFi within the cryptocurrency realm is a transformative force, redefining the very essence of financial transactions. This space, termed ‘DeFi crypto,’ is characterized by the utilization of cryptographic assets to power a myriad of financial services traditionally monopolized by banks and centralized institutions. Understanding DeFi Crypto The intersection of DeFi with cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as “DeFi crypto,” marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital finance. This synergy allows for the creation and management of financial products and services in a decentralized environment, free from traditional banking constraints and centralized control. DeFi crypto platforms enable users to lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings in a trustless manner. These activities are conducted via smart contracts, which autonomously execute the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries. The term “DeFi crypto” encompasses a wide range of applications and protocols that operate on blockchain technology, allowing for innovative financial solutions such as yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These DeFi protocols offer users complete control over their financial assets, with enhanced privacy and security, which is a significant shift from the traditional finance model. DEXs are at the heart of DeFi crypto activity. Uniswap, for example, stands out as a leading DEX, providing liquidity through an automated market maker (AMM) protocol rather than a traditional order book. It allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets, contributing to the pool and earning fees proportionate to their share. Other DEXes like SushiSwap have followed suit, iterating on Uniswap’s original protocol with additional features and incentives. What Are The Most Popular DeFi Blockchains? Ethereum, widely known as the leading blockchain for DeFi applications due to its early adoption of smart contract functionality, is not alone in the space. Several other blockchains have become significant DeFi players, with their popularity often measured by Total Value Locked (TVL). TVL in DeFi refers to the aggregate value of assets locked within a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. It signifies the amount of crypto assets, such as tokens, staked or deposited by liquidity providers in various DeFi platforms. TVL is a crucial metric for assessing the overall health and popularity of a DeFi protocol. It helps determine user demand and the protocol’s attractiveness to investors. Top-10 Blockchains As of November 11, below is the list of the most popular DeFi blockchains based on data from DefiLlama: Ethereum: Despite high gas fees, Ethereum’s TVL of $25.559 billion and daily active users amounting to 355.267 speak to its dominance and pioneering role in DeFi. It remains the largest and most widely used blockchain for DeFi, hosting numerous protocols like MakerDAO, Aave, and Compound. Tron: Tron’s significant TVL of $8.331 billion, coupled with its massive 1.59 million daily active users, underscores its popularity, especially in Asian markets. Its DeFi ecosystem is fueled by high throughput and effective community engagement strategies. Binance Smart Chain (BSC): BSC has attracted a considerable number of users, with 957.028 daily active users and a TVL of $3.004 billion, due to its compatibility with Ethereum’s assets and lower transaction costs. Solana: Known for its speed and low fees, Solana has a TVL of $561.84 million and 179.363 daily active users. It hosts Serum, a high-speed, non-custodial DEX, and other innovative DeFi projects that exploit its fast block times. Polygon: As a scaling solution for Ethereum, Polygon enhances transaction speed and reduces costs, with a TVL of $832.66 million and 346.808 daily active users. It serves as a sidechain that runs alongside the main Ethereum chain, hosting popular DApps like QuickSwap and Aavegotchi. Best Decentralized Finance Applications DeFi is home to a multitude of applications, each striving to offer unique and compelling financial services. Based on the latest data from DappRadar, here’s an overview of the top DeFi applications, distinguished by their Total Value Locked (TVL), which signifies the amount of capital they have secured within their respective protocols: Lido: At the zenith of the list with a TVL of $18.27 billion, Lido stands out as the most prominent liquid staking solution. It allows Ethereum holders to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity, facilitating participation in the network’s security without sacrificing asset accessibility. MakerDAO: With a TVL of $5.31 billion, MakerDAO is a trailblazer in the DeFi space. It’s a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that manages the DAI stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, and allows users to open collateralized debt positions (CDPs) to generate DAI. Uniswap V3: Commanding a TVL of $3.57 billion, Uniswap V3 is the latest iteration of the popular DEX, offering improved capital efficiency for liquidity providers through concentrated liquidity positions. Aave V3: Aave V3 has garnered a TVL of $3.27 billion and is known for its innovative approach in decentralized lending. It allows users to lend and borrow a diverse range of cryptocurrencies with varying interest rate options. Aave V2: Preceding its successor, Aave V2 holds a TVL of $2.96 billion. It introduced features such as collateral swapping and stable borrowing rates, which have been instrumental in advancing the DeFi lending landscape. DeFi Staking Explained DeFi staking is a process that involves locking up one’s cryptocurrency holdings to support the operations of a blockchain network and, in return, earning rewards. In DeFi, staking is not merely a support mechanism for the network, but also a way for users to earn passive income on their crypto holdings. This is achieved through various DeFi protocols that offer staking services. When users stake their cryptocurrencies within a DeFi protocol, they typically transfer their assets into a smart contract, which then uses those assets in various network functions such as validating transactions if it’s a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, or providing liquidity. The users’ staked assets help maintain the security and efficacy of the platform or network. In return for staking their assets, users receive rewards, usually in the form of additional tokens. The rate of return can vary widely, depending on the platform and the demand for the asset being staked. Some DeFi protocols also offer additional incentives such as governance rights, where users can participate in decision-making processes regarding the future development of the protocol. Platforms like Synthetix and Curve Finance exemplify DeFi staking. On Synthetix, users stake SNX tokens to mint synthetic assets, while on Curve Finance, users stake stablecoins to earn trading fees and CRV tokens. The complexity of staking varies across platforms, with some offering simple ‘deposit and earn’ mechanisms, while others may require active participation in governance or other network activities. What Is Liquidity Mining? Liquidity mining is a key concept in DeFi that incentivizes users to supply liquidity to decentralized exchanges and other financial applications by rewarding them with governance tokens. This process is fundamental to Automated Market Makers (AMMs), which are at the core of many DeFi trading platforms. In liquidity mining, users deposit two assets that form a trading pair into a liquidity pool. For example, a user might supply both Ethereum and USDC to the ETH/USDC pool. By providing liquidity, they enable other users to trade between these two assets more efficiently. The liquidity provider (LP) gets a share of the transaction fees generated from trades that happen in that pool, proportional to their share of the pool’s total liquidity. Beyond transaction fees, liquidity miners also earn additional rewards, typically in the form of the platform’s native tokens. These tokens can carry significant value and often grant holders governance rights, allowing them to vote on proposals that can affect the platform’s direction and tokenomics. The phenomenon of liquidity mining really took off with the emergence of Compound’s COMP token, which was distributed to users who borrowed or supplied assets to the protocol, kicking off the “yield farming” craze in the summer of 2020. While liquidity mining can offer substantial returns, it’s not without risks. Users can experience an impermanent loss when the price of your deposited assets changes. Additionally, smart contract vulnerabilities pose a risk, as exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to a loss of funds. What Is Yield Farming? Yield farming, a cornerstone activity within DeFi, is an investment strategy that involves staking or lending crypto assets to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. This process, akin to earning interest in a traditional bank, takes advantage of the intricate incentive structures built into many DeFi protocols. Investors engage in yield farming by adding their assets to a liquidity pool, which is essentially a smart contract that contains funds. In exchange for their contribution, participants obtain liquidity tokens, which they can subsequently utilize to garner additional rewards. The DeFi platform typically generates these rewards from transaction fees, or sometimes they come from new tokens released during a promotion. For instance, protocols like Compound distribute their native COMP tokens to users who lend or borrow on their platform. Similarly, users who provide liquidity to Uniswap’s pools earn a portion of the trading fees in addition to potential UNI token rewards. These incentives can be quite lucrative, leading to the rapid growth and popularity of yield farming within the DeFi ecosystem. Notably, yield farming involves high complexity and significant risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss (a change in the value of deposited assets compared to their value at the time of deposit), and the volatility of reward tokens. Yet, it remains a popular method for crypto-savvy users to potentially grow their holdings by leveraging the DeFi sector’s innovative protocols. DeFi Explained: Risks And Rewards DeFi’s allure is largely due to its high-yield opportunities and the democratization of financial services. Users can engage directly with markets, offering liquidity, borrowing, lending, and earning potential returns that far surpass traditional banking products. For example, protocols like Yearn.finance have popularized yield farming, where investors can earn rewards by staking or lending cryptocurrency assets. Yet, DeFi is not without substantial risks. One of the most significant risks comes from smart contract vulnerabilities. High-profile incidents like the hack of The DAO, where attackers drained $50 million worth of Ether due to a smart contract exploit, and the recent Poly Network attack, leading to the siphoning off of over $600 million (though largely returned later), highlight the potential for catastrophic losses. Market volatility can lead to the rapid devaluation of assets, as seen in the May 2021 market crash, where DeFi markets experienced significant stress. Furthermore, the absence of a regulatory safety net means there’s no FDIC insurance equivalent, leaving users fully exposed if their funds are lost or stolen. What Is The Future Of DeFi Crypto The trajectory of DeFi crypto is anticipated to be revolutionary, with potential integration into mainstream finance and the creation of more complex financial instruments. This integration could see the likes of Aave or Compound potentially working alongside or within traditional financial institutions, bringing liquidity and new lending mechanisms to the market. However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges that need addressing. Expected changes in regulatory frameworks could legitimize DeFi platforms by ensuring their compliance with global financial regulations. This could mitigate one of the most pressing risks: the uncertainty and the “Wild West” nature of the current DeFi landscape. The future also likely holds more advanced security protocols to prevent exploits and hacks, which have historically plagued platforms like dForce and Harvest Finance, resulting in losses worth millions. Improved security, alongside enhanced user experience, could help in reducing the entry barrier for less tech-savvy users, broadening DeFi’s appeal. Another anticipated development is the rise of “DeFi 2.0”, with protocols that address the issues of its predecessor, such as impermanent loss in liquidity pools or the sustainability of yield farming rewards. With these advancements, coupled with a possible increase in institutional involvement, DeFi crypto stands to redefine not only how we understand finance but how we interact with money in a digital age.

At the start of the week, the burn rate rose over 7,000,000% after more than 8 billion tokens were burned in a 24-hour period. This trend has not slowed down either given that the burn figures have continued to rise daily. Shiba Inu Burn Surge Continues Earlier in the week when the Shiba Inu burn saw one of its highest daily spikes, the total number of tokens burned had come out to just over 8 billion. At the time, this was a significant figure given that the burn rate had been slowing down over the last year. However, there has been a steady rise in the number of SHIB tokens that are being burned lately, which raises the question of what is driving the burn.

On Thursday, the burn tracker Shibburn reported that the 24-hour figure had crossed 10 million once again. This shows a steady recovery from Wednesday’s figures which had tanked significantly. Source: Shibburn As Shibburn data shows, the 10.34 million SHIB that were burned in the last 24 hours amounts to an 803.4% increase in the burn rate compared to the previous day. The majority of the burns have, however, come from a single wallet address. The address sent a little over 10.2 million SHIB to the burn address. This recent spike in the BURN rate has also added to the total amount burned on a weekly basis. The figure comes out to 8.497 billion, which is a 1,969.72% increase from the previous week’s figures. SHIB bulls struggle to maintain control | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com What Is Driving The SHIB Burn? The most significant burn for the week was the 8.2 billion burn, most of which came from a single address. This address was the ShibaSwap deployer wallet, which meant that the SHIB team was the one burning the tokens. Related Reading: 8 Green Candles: Here’s What Happened To Bitcoin The Last Time It Appeared The spike in the burn rate coincides with the increased usage of the Shiba Inu layer 2 blockchain Shibarium, which marked multiple milestones this week. As the usage has risen and more fees were collected on the network, the amount of SHIB to be burned rose drastically. Daily transactions on Shibarium have consistently come out above 7 million this week, bringing the total transactions on the network above 51 million. If this continues, then the burn rate could continue to rise as more usage of the L2 means more fees being burned.

Bitcoin traders fear ""bull trap,"" growing fear could propel BTC towards $50,000, Santiment said.  Bitcoin's [BTC] rally halted Thursday, ceding the stage to cryptocurrency majors ether [ETH] and solana [SOL] which led the crypto rally after surging to fresh 19-month high.  BTC dipped to $43,000 during the day following its breakneck climb to near $45,000 earlier this week, suggesting that traders took some profits after the largest crypto's breakout from $38,000 a week ago. Recently, bitcoin was changing hands at around $43,300, down 1.1% over the past 24 hours.  ETH, meanwhile, popped 5% over the same period and hit $2,372, its highest level since May 2022.  Its rally drove up the prices of other ETH-adjacent cryptocurrencies, making them the best performers of the day. Ether classic [ETC] appreciated 6%, while liquid staking protocol Lido's governance token [LDO] increased by over 11%.  Native tokens of Ethereum scaling networks Optimism and Arbitrum also gained 22% and 9%, respectively, during the day.  Solana [SOL] jumped over 8% to $69, the highest since May 2022, following a three-week cool-off since its mid-November local top.

""Traders are fearful that crypto markets may be in a bull trap at the moment,"" Santiment posted on X (formerly Twitter) Thursday, citing social media metrics.

Saylor, who has transitioned from CEO to head of Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy, posed a significant question to the Bitcoin community on X. Saylor’s inquiry was straightforward yet profound: “How high will BTC need to rise before you would consider selling a small portion of your Bitcoin?” This question, aimed at understanding the threshold that might trigger selling decisions, garnered extensive attention, with roughly 122,839 individuals participating in the poll. The answers, revealing the mindset of the Bitcoin community, ranged from moderate to extremely bullish sentiments. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Leap: Trading Guru John Bollinger Weighs In On BTC Ongoing Rally Surprising Results: Majority Eye $1 Million Bitcoin Threshold The survey results painted a fascinating picture of the BTC community’s outlook. While a minority of respondents, 18.8% and 14.1%, selected $250,000 and $500,000 price points, a significant portion of the community leaned towards much higher figures. Notably, 36.3% of voters indicated a price range from $1 million to never selling their Bitcoin holdings, highlighting a strong belief in BTCs long-term value. Additionally, 30.8% of participants marked $100,000 as their potential selling point. Saylor’s survey revealed the community’s predominant inclination to hold BTC until it reaches or surpasses the $1 million mark. Some were willing to hold indefinitely, reflecting a deep-rooted confidence in Bitcoin’s future. How high will $BTC need to rise before you would consider selling a small portion of your #Bitcoin? — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 6, 2023 Institutional Capital And Halving Events: Catalysts For A $1 Million BTC As the crypto space closely watches these survey results, the $1 million price point for Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a realistic possibility by many enthusiasts and experts alike. Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a vocal BTC advocate, recently supported this view. Mow agreed with the general sentiment of Saylor’s survey, stating that while “Balaji wasn’t wrong about BTC going to $1M,” he was perhaps wrong about the timing and the driving factors. Mow attributed the potential surge to a confluence of significant institutional investment and the impact of Bitcoin halving events. The halving, a scheduled reduction in BTC mining rewards, inherently limits the new supply of Bitcoin, thereby introducing a scarcity factor. Related Reading: Tether Strikes Gold In Bitcoin: Profits Soar Above $1 Billion Amid Bull Market Coupled with a projected influx of institutional capital into the crypto market, these factors could collectively catalyze Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented heights. Mow’s analysis aligns with the optimism reflected in Saylor’s survey, underlining a solid belief in Bitcoin’s capacity for substantial value growth. Balaji wasn’t wrong about #Bitcoin going to $1M, but he was wrong on the timing and the catalyst.

42391832,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwUFp,1701986124,This $28K Pixelated Avocado Could Add to Bitcoin's Raging Censorship Debate,"There's a debate raging among Bitcoin users and developers over whether to filter out transactions in NFT-like ""inscriptions"" minted using the Ordinals project, since they're not a core financial use in keeping with many advocates' vision for the original blockchain.  But over at the auction house Sotheby's, some of the images are considered high art: In an online auction that started this week, two low-resolution cartoon characters and a pixelated avocado are already fetching bids in the 10s of thousands of dollars each.  The three digital images come from the BitcoinShrooms collection of Ordinals inscriptions, by the pseudonymous artist Shroomtoshi, according to the Sotheby's website.  Nary a trace of irony permeates the auction's promotional materials, penned in a florid style of prose that could just as easily apply to a Renaissance masterwork.  ""Elegantly weaving the nuanced tapestry of Bitcoin’s history, culture and core technicalities, each unique, pixelated, and hand-crafted piece forms part of a masterful, yet playful guide to the revolutionary realm,"" the Sotheby's description reads. ""Shroomtoshi created a standalone digital art collection that captures the cryptocurrency zeitgeist through nostalgic and hyper-referential modes.""  The lowbrow-turned-highbrow project could reinforce just how valuable these NFTs-on-Bitcoin might be, at a time when some longtime developers of the original blockchain are taking steps to restrict transactions involving them.  Spam filtering  Over the past week, controversy emerged on social media after Ocean, a mining pool backed by Block Inc. head Jack Dorsey, who is the former CEO of Twitter (now X), implemented a node software that can filter out many of the transactions involving Ordinals.  Luke Dashjr, a developer guiding the project, pushed back against claims that the effort amounts to censorship, arguing that he's merely aiming to curb ""spam"" on the blockchain. He added that in his opinion, there's a ""vulnerability"" in the dominant Bitcoin Core software, since it fails to filter out these transactions.  Other Bitcoin users say the blockchain should be open to uses beyond financial applications.  A fresh round of acrimony exploded Wednesday and Thursday on X after the Bitcoin wallet Samourai posted that Ocean was also censoring its ""Whirlpool transactions,"" or those that are run through a ""coin mixer"" designed to enhance privacy by making the cryptocurrency hard to track.  Dashjr responded that ""this is a bug in your software, not an intentional policy on our end.""  Whatever the case, a digital image called ""Sovereign Individual"" – technically ""Inscription 716"" inscribed onto SAT number 628391241467003 – had already garnered 27 bids in the Sotheby's auction that runs through Dec. 13. The current bid is $50,000, according to the auction house's website, well above the original estimate of $20,000-$30,000.  The digital avocado, known as ""BIP39 SEED,"" has drawn bids up to $28,000, and a third image is already at $42,000.  Screengrab from Sotheby's website. (Shroomtoshi/Sotheby's)  In a statement on the Sotheby's site, the artist describes the collection as a ""pixelated recap of the first 13 years of Bitcoin, a homage to the 8-bit style of art that expresses a slight nostalgia for the 90s, a way to soil 10s of thousands of SSDs spread across the world with my art (->next level cyber-vandalism), a tool to raise awareness about Bitcoin and what I personally view as its core principles, an ironic way to vent at what I see as its annoying pop elements and aberrations.""

With the firm being one of the world's largest asset managers, I believe they are positioned well to capitalize on this change in markets (particularly from the SEC). This could potentially bring trillions in investment dollars for the Bitcoin ETF and any potential follow-on crypto funds. While BlackRock stock has trailed the market this year, BlackRock has demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Its diverse product offerings and historical prowess in creating low-cost, innovative ETFs position it well to pioneer a successful Bitcoin ETF. This move could not only augment its revenue stream significantly, owing to the management fees from a large-scale Bitcoin ETF but also solidify its role as a trailblazer in financial innovation. The recent settlement between Binance and U.S. authorities, easing regulatory concerns around market manipulation in the crypto space, further sets the stage for BlackRock's ETF approval. While regulatory hurdles remain a primary concern, BlackRock's industry clout, compliance track record, and strategic partnerships in the cryptocurrency realm, like its collaboration with Coinbase Custody Trust Company, enhance its prospects for SEC approval. I think the stock is a buy. Background Despite the rest of the stock market nearing all-time highs with the S&P 500 up almost 20% year to date, BlackRock's shares have been underperforming, remaining down from their all-time high . BlackRock's recent earnings have been somewhat disappointing, with significant share price underperformance compared to the broader market. I believe part of this can be attributed to the company's largest ESG fund, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, which has experienced substantial asset outflows due to its underperformance compared to benchmarks like the S&P 500. Market volatility and interest rate hikes have also affected BlackRock. While the company's Q3 2023 results showed a beat on EPS and revenue, asset inflows are slowing. Management knows they need to make changes. With these challenges, BlackRock has shown resilience by adapting to changing market conditions, such as benefiting from high interest rates to create demand for bond-alike products. Its diverse product offerings and ability to attract various types of investors have helped mitigate some market downturn impacts​​. I still strongly believe the long-term potential of the company remains strong, despite short-term uncertainties, thanks to its history of being a serial outperformer, largely due to its embrace of passive investments through low-cost ETFs​​​​​​. Why the Recent Binance Settlement Opens the Door to a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF The recent $4.3 billion settlement between Binance represents a significant turning point for the US cryptocurrency industry, potentially helping advance the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. I believe this settlement has helped address the SEC's concerns about market manipulation, which were a major hurdle in approving such ETFs. With this, the settlement with Binance (which has forced their founder to step down and hinder their ability to operate in the US) paves the way for the SEC to potentially approve BlackRock's proposed spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that could mark a substantial step towards mainstream crypto adoption and benefit one of the world's largest asset management firms​​​​​​​​​​. In this process, representatives from BlackRock have had discussions with the SEC, presenting plans for either in-kind or in-cash redemption models for its iShares Bitcoin Trust. These models are crucial for the approval process, with in-kind redemptions offering tax efficiency by avoiding the need to sell securities, which could trigger capital gains taxes. Such a structure is viewed as the ""cleanest"" for issuers and investors. This engagement indicates that the SEC might be nearing a decision on BlackRock's application, along with several other firms awaiting approval for their spot crypto ETFs​​​​​​. Why a Bitcoin ETF is Such a Big Deal The prospect of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock signifies a major shift in the investment landscape, akin to the advent of the first gold-backed ETFs. If BlackRock is able to gain entry into this space, I believe this will suggest a path toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, leveraging their substantial global influence in investment and advisory services (this will mean more Main Street retirement accounts could have Bitcoin in them). Their proposed Bitcoin ETF, aimed at directly tracking actual Bitcoin prices, presents a transparent and accessible investment avenue for both retail and institutional investors​​. BlackRock's extensive experience in developing innovative ETFs, including international and corporate bond ETFs, means they have the capability to successfully launch an innovative Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock is a household name in the asset management industry, so the potential benefits of such an ETF are considerable, including fostering institutional adoption, diversifying investment portfolios, and enhancing market stability and transparency. Furthermore, this isn't BlackRock's first dive into the cryptocurrency space. BlackRock's collaboration with Coinbase Custody Trust Company, which began in 2022, allows clients to buy cryptocurrency via the Aladdin platform and custody through the Coinbase Prime relationship . This partnership (in my opinion) will be seen as pivotal in ensuring market integrity and combating potential market manipulation​​ for an eventual Bitcoin ETF approval. Long Run Revenue Potential from a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF While the definite size of the ETF will be unknown for a while, there is large demand for an ETF to service Bitcoin in the asset management space. The global cryptocurrency market peaked at over $3 trillion in 2021. BlackRock currently sports 20% (in AUM) of the entire US stock market. Since BlackRock may become the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF if they were to launch (and scale) to a $1 trillion Bitcoin ETF (keep in mind again this is small compared to the overall stock market in the US which is $45 Trillion and we are assuming small overall portfolio allocations) the implications could be big. With a typical 0.30% management fee, the estimated annual revenue from this ETF would be approximately $3 billion. This significant potential revenue stream, of potentially $3 billion would be significant to the company given that total revenue for 2022 was $17.873 billion . Why I Think They Can Get to $1 Trillion In AUM From A Bitcoin ETF While $1 Trillion seems like a high estimate, I think we have to look at the presence and brand of BlackRock and how this affects retirement account asset allocations. For reference, BlackRock is one of multiple asset managers in the US vying for the competitive space of managing stock & bond funds. If they get approved for a Bitcoin ETF, they would be the only firm involved. Keep in mind that in a competitive market (US stock ETF asset management), the firm has about ~20% of the US stock market in its stock funds. So 20% in a competitive market makes it reasonable that they could reach 33% penetration in a market where they are one of the only SEC-approved Bitcoin ETFs. While this 33% market share will not happen overnight, I think this could happen over the next two years. Where the $1 Trillion will come from: Recent estimates show that there is over $36.7 Trillion in US retirement accounts as of November 2023. Most retirement accounts have no allocation to the cryptocurrency asset class as a whole due to the complications of buying crypto directly in an IRA or 401k (Fidelity goes in depth in this article). Current crypto ETFs use derivatives meaning the price action of the ETF may not mirror the underlying asset performance. The proposed BlackRock ETF solves this by giving investors (and financial advisors) a vehicle that can be easily placed in a retirement account without any complications. Already 90% of financial advisors receive inbound calls about cryptocurrency allocations into their clients' retirement accounts. Once these financial advisors have an easy vehicle that can allocate to Crypto (starting with just the largest -Bitcoin) into a client's retirement account, an allocation of just 2.73% of these retirement funds could generate $1 Trillion in capital for the Bitcoin ETF. For reference, some historical measures have shown that a 2-10% portfolio allocation to Gold is optimal. Bitcoin (through an ETF) could have a lower-end allocation and hit the $1 Trillion mark while not appearing to be an overallocation in an investor's account. Keep in mind that this doesn't include non-retirement account funds (normal brokerage account funds) or non-US funds that could use the BlackRock ETF as their way to invest from a global perspective. Even with a $1 Trillion infusion, BlackRock adding any outside investment capital to the cryptocurrency market will likely cause a large upswing in prices. Bitcoin's current market cap is around $853 billion . If Bitcoin hits the low-end optimal portfolio allocation levels that we've seen for Gold, the $1 Trillion infusion could have a strong upward pressure on prices given what the supply of Bitcoin is. This is because the supply of Bitcoin is very inelastic (demand is positively elastic ) due to the mechanics of the blockchain and the heavy presence of retail investors vs. institutional capital in the market right now. These investors have a lower propensity to sell (they believe Bitcoin could be worth multiples of what it is worth today). As such, when institutions like BlackRock add funds to the cryptocurrency market, this will likely create strong upside pressure resulting in overall market cap expansion. Valuation While the forward GAAP PE for BlackRock ( 20.93 ) is twice the industry average of 10.3, I think the company's stock has more room to run. BlackRock is unique in that they are a leader in the passive asset management industry. Their cash flows are more like a SaaS company than a typical financial institution. They have much lower credit/investment default risk than a traditional financial institution and their business model relies on making financial products that people want (centered around themes that are popular). The potential Bitcoin ETF is another example of this. If global institutions were to allocate their crypto assets to one of the most trusted asset managers on the planet (BlackRock), we could see over $1 Trillion allocated to the ETF. With a typical 0.3% management fee, this could unlock an incremental $3 billion in revenue for the asset manager. After applying the current forward price to sales multiple of 6.33, this would create an approx. $19 billion lift to their market cap. This implies about a 15% upside in market cap (and share price). Keep in mind this bull case doesn't factor in ETFs around other major cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) for example, or a recovery in the AUM of the fundamental business that BlackRock currently has. I think as equity prices remain higher we could see a strengthening of the underlying business (more on the ROA of this below), while an ETH ETF could be around the corner if they can earn the SEC's trust. What is BlackRock worth without the Bitcoin ETF? Even without the Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock's ROA (Return on Assets) for Total Assets stands at 4.54% , almost 4 times higher than the industry average. Since this business is about being an asset manager, its ability to operate with some of the industry's lowest-fee products while having a much higher return on those assets it manages is powerful. In my opinion, a company whose P/E ratio is twice the sector median but its ROA is almost 4 times the sector median is powerful. This tells me the stock still has room to run as passive ETF management trends continue to thrive and this robust business model continues to excel . Risks The biggest elephant in the room is the regulatory landscape. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a history of cautiousness regarding cryptocurrency-related products. Despite BlackRock's significant industry influence and expertise, the SEC's approval of their Bitcoin ETF is not assured. There are some estimates that BlackRock will hear back in January. Historically, the SEC has expressed concerns about market manipulation, fraud, and volatility in the cryptocurrency market. This is the core of the SEC's reluctance to approve Bitcoin ETFs, which has shown in its rejection of similar proposals from other firms in the past. For instance, the SEC has previously rejected applications for Bitcoin ETFs from firms like Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, citing concerns over fraud and manipulation in markets where the underlying asset is traded​​. However, BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with a well-established reputation and a history of compliance and innovation in financial products. Its reputation could very well be the thing that pushes it over the finish line in the approval process. The company's extensive experience in developing and managing ETFs across various asset classes lends credibility and its partnership with Coinbase for asset custody shows they can handle a cryptocurrency-based ETF. What If the ETF Does Not Get Approved? While the ETF's prospects look promising for BlackRock, it's obviously not a guarantee. If the SEC decides to decline the approval of the ETF I still think BlackRock has upside. As I mentioned before, the firm has a ROA that is nearly 4 times higher than industry averages. I think this justifies the current EPS multiple. Bottom Line BlackRock's potential entrance into the world of cryptocurrency with a Bitcoin ETF marks a turning point in blending traditional finance with cryptocurrency. Despite BlackRock facing market volatility and regulatory challenges, their solid market presence and ETF innovation expertise place it at the forefront of this emerging field and in potentially receiving SEC approval. The launch of a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could signal a major shift towards wider cryptocurrency acceptance and institutional investment, though it hinges on overcoming the SEC's historical caution with crypto-related products. Success in this venture could significantly enhance BlackRock's revenue, reshaping the crypto investment landscape and reinforcing its position as a leader in asset management after a series of ESG funds underperforming and its stock price relatively languishing this year.

Bitcoin Whales On BitMEX Have Changed Their Tune Recently An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the BitMEX whales were likely the ones helping fuel the latest rally. The relevant indicator here is the “Open Interest,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin derivative positions open on a centralized exchange. When this metric’s value increases, investors are opening up new contracts on the platform. On the other hand, a decline suggests the holders are either getting liquidated or closing up their positions of their own volition. Related Reading: Cardano Could See 70% Rally To $0.75, Analyst Predicts When Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest for two exchanges, BitMEX and Binance, over the past few weeks: Looks like the value of the metric has gone down for BitMEX in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The graph shows that the Bitcoin Open Interest on BitMEX had observed a sharp rise at the start of the month when the cryptocurrency’s price was still trading around the $38,000 level. This open interest increase followed a sharp rally for BTC towards the $44,000 mark. As is visible in the chart, the indicator’s value for Binance also registered an increase as the rally occurred, but BitMEX’s rise stands out as it was huge and pretty much happened in one go before the rally. Since BTC has hit its local top above the $44,000 level, though, the BitMEX Open Interest has plummeted, implying a large-scale closure of positions on the platform has taken place. On the other hand, the metric’s value for Binance has continued to stay high. The quant has also attached charts of another metric for the two exchanges: the “Funding Rates.” The funding rates keep track of the periodic fee the derivative traders on an exchange currently pay each other. When this indicator has a positive value, the longs are paying a premium to the shorts to hold onto their positions right now. This suggests that the traders on the platform share a majority of bullish sentiment. The BitMEX Funding Rates had been favorable for the duration that the Open Interest had been at high levels, implying that most positions had been extended. However, with the plunge in the indicator, the Funding Rates have returned to neutral values. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Overvalued Yet? What Historical Data Suggests Based on this pattern, the analyst thinks the BitMEX whales, potentially driving the rally earlier, have already taken their profits, as they closed up a large chunk of their positions near the top. The Open Interest hasn’t completely retraced itself yet, but the fact that most of these whales have decided to pull out may be a troubling sign for the rally’s continuation.

42391820,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwTGH,1701982116,Code Is Not (Always) Law,"A French court recently determined that Code Is Law. Essentially. And the decision — somewhat ironically for an industry that usually accepts that exploits happen (and may even be a necessary step towards advancing protocol security) — has put DeFi in a bind.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In February, the Avalanche-based automated market maker Platypus Finance was breached, with the thieves making away with $8.5 million. As is now routine, the attackers were quickly identified and the stolen funds traced down.  What happened next is somewhat atypical, with the ultimate results possibly setting a troublesome precedent: Platypus’ operators and community decided to pursue legal action against brothers Mohammed and Benamar M. (last name redacted in court documents).  While not the first time blockchain thieves have been brought to court, the situation is something of an enigma considering that crypto, at least as initially conceived, is designed to operate outside the bounds of the law.  The Bitcoin blockchain doesn’t need a money transmitter license to function, it just needs to exist. Likewise, since the earliest days of the crypto industry, the goal has usually been to design systems that work for all — open, global, censor-resistant platforms do what they do whether used by a crook or a saint.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | The Node  Key to this egalitarian standard has been the idea that the code is the code, and that is what matters most. Judges, regulators and politicians may try to set parameters around what types of financial services can be accessed and by whom, but in crypto, such restrictions cannot apply (except to the extent that centralized companies, like Coinbase, must implement KYC/AML procedures).  There is some debate whether Mohammed was being sincere when he argued in court that he was a “white hat” hacker, only looking to keep 10% of the proceeds for discovering a vulnerability in the code. He claimed he was an ""ethical hacker"" who took the ""endangered funds"" so the protocol would learn a lesson and plug its hole.  Likewise, there is an argument to be had whether Platypus acted rightly in seeking justice through the legal system. The victims certainly had a legal right to press charges, as any victim of a theft would. But if the system executes, it executes. And if the code is the law, then all users have to live with the fact that the code contained a vulnerability that was exploited.  Curiously, the French judge overseeing the case seemed to take that same view when dismissing the charges against the brothers. According to a Le Monde article, he compared the financial exploit of Platypus, which seemingly had an infinite money bug (accessible through a DeFi-native “flash loan”), to exploiting a vending machine to get extra bags of chips.  Many in DeFi are calling for Platypus to appeal the controversial decision by taking the matter to a higher court. Code may be code, but a theft is a theft, they argue, and restitution is justified. This seems to be a piece with the growing sense of maturity across the industry. A decade ago, it may have been OK to say crypto could self-regulate, that bad actors would be dealt with through the free market and that code reigns supreme.  “Stealing is bad,"" Rainbow's Mike Demarais said.  Today, after countless DeFi hacks, the proliferation of crypto scams and the implosion of exchange like Mt. Gox, it seems downright irresponsible and naive to say the code is the code and that is that. Personally, I think crypto’s change of heart is for the better: If the industry is to grow, it needs to integrate with the world, and that means integrating with the law.  At the same time, I recognize that what makes crypto powerful is that these self–executing platforms are extra-judicial. Bitcoin wouldn’t be Bitcoin if it started sanctioning or KYCing users, for instance. The tech itself, as the code is written, is opinionated. Crypto has a bias towards anti-authoritarianism and equality before the code.  But crypto isn’t a monolith, and this is a complicated topic that is foundational to nearly everything that has been built in blockchain so far. CoinDesk reached out to a number of protocol founders and industry expert lawyers to get their take.  See also: This Is How Scammers Can Drain Your Crypto Wallet  Neeraj Agrawal, head of communications at Coin Center:  “We've [Coin Center] always taken the view that cryptocurrency use is regulated by applicable laws”  Scott Lewis, creator of DeFiPulse, Slingshot and the Canto Network:  “I might be misunderstanding, the exploiting a vending machine is stealing though, right? Is that an example in favor of the code is not law side? Isn’t that the canonical ‘code is not law’ example? Using an error in someone’s code to take people’s money is not OK, and it shouldn’t be legal. Laws and rules around smart contract hacks are unclear and should be clarified, but making them all legal is not the answer""  Austen Campbell, Columbia Business School professor and former BUSD portfolio manager at Paxos:  “If crypto wants to go mainstream, it needs an environment where regular people can transact with confidence and know the rules of the system, not be at the mercy of exploits and hackers. It can’t be the case that everyone has to be a crypto expert.”  David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless:  ""Code is Law is a thought experiment, not a prescription.""  Christine Kim, Galaxy Digital vice president of research:  ""The idea that ‘code is law’ or that the rules enforced and not enforced by a smart contract have the final say over who owns the assets on a blockchain is untrue because in most cases, especially DeFi hacks, protocol teams like the Kyber development team will rely on law enforcement for the retrieval of user funds. When code fails, which happens with some frequency with DeFi protocols, the law is the law.""  Gwart, gwart of gwart:  “Code being law is increasingly difficult with the complexity of the system. It’s probably naive to say “code is law” in an absolutist way. My more interesting take perhaps is that these types of decisions, and maybe other decisions that lean on law being law, really make us as a crypto community think about the value of these systems if they are ultimately enforced by the state. I’m not sure what the “correct” equilibrium is here but I do sometimes wonder how valuable these tools can be if contracts are ultimately reliant upon common law or state law or whatever to work out these situations.”  Jon Rice, former editor in chief of Blockworks, Cointelegraph, Crypto Briefing:  “The concept of decentralization is about increased participation in our financial system, not about anarchy. 'Code is Law' is a tenet of DeFi that essentially absolves the deployer of responsibility, and passes it instead to the user. This isn't a recipe for greater participation, it's just another obstacle for the average user - and thus another hurdle for our industry in attracting both capital and users.  Conor Ryder, head of research at Ethena Labs:  “On one side I agree that we are lobbying for code to replace the need for trust, interpretations of law etc. Code is law does fit that narrative but I do think it’s too extremist.  Nathan Schneider, professor of media studies at University of Colorado Boulder, co-founder of the Metagov Project and creator of ""exit to community"" theory:  It is a shame that crypto disputes and bad behavior are largely being addressed in conventional courts. It is a reminder that crypto has so far failed on the promise of producing better forms of governance and accountability than what we had before.     Cami Russo, co-founder of The Defiant:  ""I interpret code is law as whatever the outcome is to code that is executed by smart contracts, cannot be interfered with and should be upheld both via social consensus around blockchains and also in actual courts. I think there is more nuance to the concept.     Nelson Rosario, founder of Rosario Tech Law and professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of Law:  “There will always be a space for Code is Law interpretations of on-chain activity, but whether that is good or not will likely be a case-by-case determination.”  Maria Bustillos, Brick House co-founder:  “In general I think it's not a bad idea to refer to the [Bitcoin] white paper; this tech was developed specifically to address significant weaknesses in legacy financial systems.”  Michelle Lai, Electric Coin Company board member and governance councillor and Synthetix:  “The code is law camp is slowly being coerced into compliance, for the sake of their freedom. I'm not saying i agree fully with code is law, nor with full compliance, but the Overton window shifted towards compliance for many projects that might have been more pro-privacy, due to the heavy handedness and cowboy behavior of some regulators.”  Eva Beylin, director of the Graph Foundation:  ""Code is law is not as binary as we're making it seem. Code can be law and also there are other laws that we abide by. In the case of the French decision it's quite frustrating that a precedent is being set that code is law = no other laws apply. For example, if someone enters the right code to break into your house, isn't it still called robbery/breaking and entering? Just because they followed the code (aka entered the pin), doesn't mean the act itself surrounding it was legal.  Jared Grey, Sushi CEO:  “Code is the law until it's exploited in the face of criminality, when the general rule of law supersedes. Tl;dr: I don't think you can excuse criminality through the use of technology. What is criminal is a wider discussion.”  Stephen Palley, litigation partner and co-chair of Brown Rudnick's Digital Commerce group:  “The catchphrase ""Code is Law"" comes from a book written by law professor Larry Lessig. His more nuanced discussion of this concept has become shorthand by people working on crypto projects to mean something like ‘anyone who interacts with a blockchain protocol should be bound by anything that results from that interaction -- the code, well or poorly written, determines and is the final boss of outcomes.’ Under this sort of rubric, thus, there are no mistakes and the concept of a hack or exploit isn't recognized. Whether or not U.S. courts will follow the French court's reasoning remains to be seen. You can get pretty far with terms-of-service or a user agreement, that will bind a user to consequences and to accept all results, whether expected or unexpected. It's less certain that a U.S. court will agree to consequences that involve conduct that appears fraudulent or illegal, as the general rule is that you can't consent to a crime. Now, there's a ton of nuance here that I can't unpack in a simple quote but I think we can expect some US Courts in some circumstances to bind users to the results of irreversible code, as long as the consequences of software errors are knowingly and voluntarily waived.”  General counsel for Alliance, Mike Wawszczak:  “Let's be clear about what ""code is law"" might mean to people like lawyers and judges. It cannot mean ""code trumps law"" or ""code is on equal footing as law."" Instead, it means something like ""the law defers to the outputs of code in its normal functioning, whether that code is well-written or not, whether the function was intended by the developer or not, whether other users of the code are affected in some way or not."" It's a deference, not a trump card.  See also: With Hacks at a Record High, Crypto Needs to Find Ways to Keep Users Safe  James McGirk, content lead at Spectral:  ""It's a shame we're moving away from our original principles,"" McGirk says, ""But it's a sign of maturity. Industry is starting to realize there's more to blockchain than digital rat poison.""  Jake Brukhman, founder of CoinFund:  “In general, I would say that code is law refers to transactional hardness and often lower counterparty risks associated with blockchains. This is a key and central innovation, but I also think it can work in tandem with traditional law. Blockchain primitives are tools in a toolbox. I think the comparison to a vending machine is meaningful, I’m just not sure what conclusion about code-is-law to take from it.”  Paul Dylan-Ennis, professor at the University of Dublin and CoinDesk columnist:  “The Platypus case brings us into direct contact with a contradiction in DeFi. On one hand, we want hackers to be punished. On the other, we are supposed to be building decentralized protocols that take the state out of the mix. Until we get clear on what Code is Law really means we’ll be confused by decisions from the traditional legal system. The way I see it, this case is another example of how we tend to have these concepts, but they are more like memes than well thought of principles. and we let the contradictions hang around w/o trying to solve them. I agree that the principle is worth keeping, though I'd veer to the side that says the problem is actually that the code is obviously not up to scratch to actually be our law.”  Brian Frye, professor of law at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law and conceptual artist:  “Code is law” is a helpful way to think about the efficiencies blockchain enables, but the market still has to take account of how the law understands property. Because the law doesn’t necessarily care about what the blockchain says.  Lex Sokolin, partner at Generative Ventures and CoinDesk columnist:  “We want to be in a place not just where code is law, but where law is code, and where arbitration and conflict resolution can happen through digital means. Until software can really deal with the many complexities of human behavior — perhaps through LLMs [AI software] — deterministic and narrow software implementations like smart contracts aren’t sufficient to resolve morally complex issues. That’s the precedent set by “the DAO” and it has served Web3 well. Further, law most often is the collective human wisdom codified through exceptions and errors. It is not recorded in a modern way, but it comes from timeless experience. Crypto needs a balance between anarchist caveat emptor and some semblance of communal rejection of immoral actions.”  Krystal Scott, artist:  “I do agree code is law is kind of the whole reason for everything in the first place. If everyone just started going to court we’re going to eventually just end up back in the exact bureaucratic structure crypto was invented to escape . But it is quite comical that the court just acquitted, perhaps the bureaucracy is also growing and adjusting with the space. Likely it’s all just coming together tbh crypto is becoming less of an outsider thing.""  Odysseas.eth, of Phylax:  I think that code is law is a silly idea because we give value to Ethereum. Ethereum has value and Ethereum's classic doesn't because we, unanimously, agreed that we want to do the fork to roll back the DAO hack. So, it's always the social layer that ends up giving value to things. Thus, it makes sense that if someone makes the code behave in a way that the original designer didn't want, then it's ok to pursue legal means. If someone breaks into my house, they make the door or window behave in a manner that was not intended (e.g. break when locked). that doesn't mean that as a society we accept that and say force is law.  Miguel Morel, CEO of Arkham Research:  “In the online world of decentralized finance it makes sense that code is law, one expects smart contracts to follow whats been written in the code without exception. However, humans who are the ones using these smart contracts exist in the physical world of jurisdictions and stately governance — this supersedes anything written in code, and therefore I’d expect it to take precedence over anything we believe in crypto.”  L0la L33tz, author:  “Humans have been trying to regulate our way of life for centuries, but math will always route around our systems. Code is the only law that is always enforceable. This basically means: Even if this case was decided differently, then the next person that writes [bad] code comes along, which will also be exploited, and there's really nothing that can stop them, and you can try to ‘enforce’ your law, but maybe they're smarter and won't get caught (i.e. escape the law).  Scott Fitsimones, creator of AirGarage:  “If you leave the front door and get robbed, it’s still a crime. Similarly, courts should uphold the intent of smart contract even if there was a programming error that led to an exploit. It’s a win for the whole ecosystem when there is justice and consequences for bad actors. The Platypus case sets a dangerous precedent that the legal system doesn’t apply to smart contracts. The French court is saying cops aren’t coming because the front door was left ajar.”  Arthur Brietman, co-founder of Tezos:  'Law is law, and depending on what the law says, it won't always align with code. But good law sets defaults, and minimizes the need for parties to enter into contractual agreements to depart from those defaults. This is, in a nutshell, the wisdom of Coase's theorem. By that standard, I do not believe that strictly following the code is the best a legal system can do, there is room to define meaningful abuse without introducing arbitrary discretion. This does not mean code is useless, shifting the burden of a legal complaint is huge! 'Defaults' are powerful.""  The Blockchain Socialist:  ""My view on code is law comes from both criticizing the original phrase from Lawrence Lessig and from actually talking to him in a podcast episode. Essentially code can act as an instrument of social control, but it is not equivalent to law. Real legal systems possess inherent ambiguities to accommodate diverse situations, which code often lacks. This inflexibility of code means it cannot foresee all potential scenarios where law might be applied, underscoring the limits of treating code as law where courts are used to tackle ambiguous situations. Rather than code is law, I prefer saying that code is political.""

According to data from Lookonchain, this Ethereum whale with almost $90 million in ETH recently woke up and decided to move its mountain of digital assets to an exchange. Although it is unclear the motive behind this transfer, it appears to be to take profit on a 670% gain over the past five years. Ethereum Whale Moves 39,260 ETH To Crypto Exchange The crypto market has had another flurry of price increases in the past few days, with Coinmarketcap’s Fear & Greed Index now pointing to an extreme greed of 81. Ethereum hasn’t been left out of the price gains, and the crypto is currently up by 11% in a 7-day timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shakeout Drives $190 Million In Losses For Over 81,000 Traders Amidst the price gain, a social media post by on-chain analysis tracker Lookonchain shows that a whale recently deposited 39,260 ETH worth $87.5 million to the crypto exchange Kraken. Further details from on-chain data show that the coins were acquired around June to August 2017. During this period, the whale address received 47,260 ETH acquired at an average price of $240 and worth $11.34 million in total at the time. However, the account has remained largely inactive since then, sitting on unrealized profit as Ethereum continued to grow in price. But now, the coins have made their way into Kraken. The massive transfer of funds from a whale’s wallet to an exchange typically signals them cashing out some or all of their holdings. In this particular case, the whale would make a profit of approximately $78 million if they decided to sell all their holdings on the exchange. An early $ETH whale appears to be selling ETH again after being dormant for 5 years. The whale deposited all 39,260 $ETH($87.5M) to #Kraken 30 mins ago. The whale received 47,260 $ETH($11.34M) at ~$240 from June to August 2017. If sold the whale would make a profit of ~$78M. pic.twitter.com/v0PI4LNTKO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023 ETH price succumbs to sell pressure | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Trend Of ETH Profit Taking Increasing? A massive transfer of funds naturally leads to speculation within the crypto community, and there seems to be an increasing trend of large ETH holders taking profits. Other social media posts from Lookonchain over the past few days have shown similar cases of large wallets sending their ETH to exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pushes Into Extreme Greed, What You Should Expect From Here For instance, a recent post showed the movement of ETH in wallet addresses belonging to defunct exchanges FTX and Celsius.

According to Whale Alerts, 16,944 ETH worth $38.14 million also made its way to Coinbase from a private wallet. 🚨 🚨 16,944 #ETH (38,148,363 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/XJYadmioyi — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 6, 2023 Even though Ethereum briefly touched $2,300 yesterday, it would seem the recent transfer to exchanges has had an effect on the price of ETH, as the crypto is trading at $2,269 at the time of writing, down by 1.5%. The crypto market remains largely unpredictable, but it would be prudent to wait to see if the crypto approaches and rebounds at the $2,200 resistance level. At the same time, a strong blast above $2,300 could signal bulls are still in control.

The closed-end fund seeks to entice institutional investors in part by offering a ""conservative"" 5% yield denominated in bitcoin, the press release said. Investors will contribute U.S. dollars to the fund, which will be converted to bitcoin, with fees being also charged in the cryptocurrency.  Private credit – where non-bank institutions lend money to enterprises and individuals – is already a massive business in traditional financial markets, and BlackRock forecasts the sector will grow to $3.5 trillion by 2028.  “A thriving Bitcoin economy is inevitable, but to realize this future and maximize its potential, robust capital markets are essential,” Zac Townsend, co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile Group, said in the press release. “This private credit fund offers unparalleled potential for institutional investors to unlock the full value of their BTC holdings without compromising their ownership, seizing a unique opportunity for optimized returns.”  The fund aims to raise $100 million from investors, The Block reported.  The company set up a bitcoin-based, artificial intelligence (AI)-aided life insurance business called Meanwhile Insurance and raised $19 million in an investment round earlier this year, Townsend said in an interview with CoinDesk TV this June. Investors included OpenSam Altman and Google's AI-focused Gradient Ventures, according to the press release.

21161008,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564424,1701975613,"Solana Ascending Triangle Formation Anticipates Price Surge, $90 Target In Sight","Since October 2023, Solana (SOL), often called the Ethereum killer, has seen significant network and price action growth. However, everything points out that the most notable growth in recent months has been in SOL’s price, which has surged over 368% year-to-date, taking the token from a low of $7.95 in 2022 to a now staggering $64.20, with an annual high of $68. But are these numbers reflective of fundamental growth, or are there discrepancies between price action and network progress? Growth In Network And Price Action Fuel Optimism According to Ally Zach, a research analyst at Messari, SOL has experienced significant growth since its December 2022 lows. The price of SOL has increased by over six times, while active addresses and Total Value Locked (TVL) have doubled. Initially positioned as a decentralized finance (DeFi) hub, Solana has diversified over time, introducing new infrastructure and tools, such as compressed non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have led to the emergence of new consumer applications on the platform. According to Zach’s latest report, throughout most of 2023, consumer apps served as the primary entry point for first-time users on Solana. However, early November’s “breakpoint event” reignited Solana’s DeFi sector. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Enough Capital? Experts On What Will Lead To ATH A series of airdrop announcements for major projects in the ecosystem, particularly the airdrop by JupiterExchange, propelled the DeFi sector to the forefront. These airdrops, coupled with new token launches, have boosted market caps and decentralized exchange (DEX) TVL, attracting users through the trading potential of these tokens. Notably, Solana’s new DEX users exhibit different behavioral patterns compared to airdrop farmers on other networks. Instead of high-frequency, low-volume transactions involving stablecoins, these users actively trade small and mid-cap tokens and spend more per swap. This suggests a more sustained and engaged user base, moving away from transient farming practices. DEXs play a crucial role in the decentralized finance ecosystem, deriving strength from the diversity and robustness of the surrounding apps and tokens. Ally Zach’s analysis suggests that Solana’s newest user base, including newcomers and veterans, is shifting away from typical airdrop farming behaviors. This shift indicates the potential for these users to become long-term contributors, strengthening the sustainability of the Solana ecosystem. Potential Solana Rally To $90 On The Horizon In addition to the potential long-term growth of the Solana network, the price of SOL is not far behind. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified an intriguing price pattern for SOL that indicates the potential for further gains soon. Martinez highlights an ascending triangle formation on the 12-hour chart of SOL, suggesting a continuation pattern that typically precedes upward price movements. The ascending triangle formation implies that SOL’s price has been consolidating within a tightening range, with higher lows and a resistance level of around $68.2. If SOL manages to sustain a close above this critical level, it could trigger a bullish breakout, potentially propelling the price toward the $90 mark. Related Reading: Binance CEO Disputes JPMorgan Chief’s Critique Of Crypto However, Martinez advises caution and emphasizes the importance of monitoring the $60 support level. Any signs of weakness or a breach of this level may trigger a spike in profit-taking by traders, potentially leading to a temporary price decline. In such a scenario, SOL could experience a dip, potentially reaching as low as $47.

The news came after the committee ""took stock of its review of elements of the prudential standard for banks' exposure to crypto,"" published in December last year.  Regulators globally have been working to increase supervision of crypto and mitigate risks posed by banks' exposure to private digital assets. Recently, Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank – which had links to crypto – collapsed, prompting regulators to more closely scrutinize bank involvement with the sector.  The Basel Committee wants to consult on criteria used to determine how risky crypto assets are. More specifically, it wants to consult on changes to the criteria for stablecoins to receive group 1b regulatory treatment, referring to ""cryptoassets with effective stabilization mechanisms.""  The initial December report separated its criteria for the risk treatment of crypto into two groups. Group one cryptos would meet the full set of classification conditions and would be subject to capital requirements. Group two cryptocurrencies include what the regulator sees as more risky assets like bitcoin [BTC], and it proposed for banks to cap their exposure to these types of assets.  ""The committee concluded that crypto assets that use permissionless blockchains create risks that cannot be sufficiently mitigated at present and therefore agreed to retain the existing treatment for such cryptoassets,"" the report said.

21159654,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564365,1701972017,"Cardano Could See 70% Rally To $0.75, Analyst Predicts When","An analyst has explained how Cardano may be heading towards a rally to $0.75 soon if the historical pattern is anything to refer to. Cardano Could See A Rally Of Over 70% In The Near Future As explained by analyst Ali in a post on X, ADA currently appears to be mirroring the same pattern as that between 2018 and 2020. Below is the chart shared by the analyst, which points out this similarity. Looks like ADA might be heading towards a break | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that ADA had been in a phase of consolidation inside a channel back between 2018 and 2020, and it would appear that the asset has been ranging in a similar fashion recently as well. There is one dissimilarity present between the two patterns, however, and that is the presence of the COVID-19 crash. This price plunge below the consolidation channel only happened because of the emergence of an anomaly in the form of the virus, though, so it might be safe to ignore it in the grand scheme of things. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Overvalued Yet? What Historical Data Suggests Cardano has recently observed a rally towards the upper end of the channel and the cryptocurrency is now trying to break out of it. Back during the previous consolidation period, a similar break took place, and it ended up leading to a very significant uplift for the cryptocurrency. “If this pattern holds, we could see ADA punching through the $0.45 resistance soon,” notes Ali. As for what trajectory the asset would follow after this break, the analyst thinks that a rally towards the $0.75 level could potentially happen by “late December.” From the current spot price, such a surge would mean an increase of more than 70% for Cardano. If the previous instance of the trend is anything to refer to, though, the rally would perhaps not end at just these gains, as ADA in fact eventually ended up registering a total increase of almost 3000% in the bull run that followed then. The on-chain analytics firm Santiment also discussed about ADA yesterday, revealing a possible instigator behind the latest price uptrend in the asset. The relevant metric here is the total number of ADA addresses carrying some amount of balance. The below chart shows how this indicator’s value has changed over the last few months: The value of the indicator appears to have registered some drawdown recently | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the chart, the total number of Cardano wallets observed a sharp decrease last month and what occurred alongside it was a rally in the price. In recent days, another decline in the indicator has taken place, although the scale is much smaller this time around. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin “Typically, declining wallets is a sign of small holders capitulating & selling to whales at a loss,” explains the analytics firm. ADA has observed an increase in the past few days, so it’s possible that this effect may be in action once more.

21159653,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564397,1701972010,Why Bitcoin’s Staggering 260% YTD Surge Could Be Just The Start,"The price of Bitcoin slowed down its ascend following a week of smashing critical resistance levels. However, the rally is likely in its early stages, with BTC preparing to see further profits in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shakeout Drives $190 Million In Losses For Over 81,000 Traders As of this writing, the cryptocurrency trades at $43,300, reclaiming levels last seen in 2022 before the crash to its yearly lows. In the weekly chart, BTC records a 15% rally, with Ethereum following the trend while other altcoins lagged behind the two most prominent cryptocurrencies. Spot Bitcoin Jumps 15% In December, Eyes On Potential SEC Approval The crypto market has witnessed another remarkable surge in Bitcoin (BTC), with a 15% increase in just the first week of December. According to QCP Capital’s latest market update, this growth takes BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) gain to 260%. This exponential rise is primarily attributed to the anticipation surrounding the approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On December 1st, the SEC announced that January 5th, 2024, will be the final deadline for rebuttal comments. This timeline sets the stage for probable approval in the week following. Although QCP Capital humorously notes that the significance of the 15th anniversary of Bitcoin’s Genesis block on January 3rd, 2024, might be lost on the SEC, the “market has certainly taken note.” As Bitcoin nears the $45,000 mark leading up to the expected announcement, investors are weighing how much of this news has already been priced. The post-ETF approval period will be critical, as the real impact depends on the actual flows from the ETF in its initial trading weeks. A ‘sell-the-news’ event is possible next year if expectations don’t match reality. Asian Buyers Re-Enter Market, When Altcoin Season? The December 1st announcement has also spurred renewed interest from Asian buyers, who had been less active in the preceding month. Notably, most of the recent spot gains have occurred during U.S. trading hours as investors in the country take positions in preparation for the SEC announcement. As the market prepares for the launch of the spot ETF, investors won’t find themselves short of options. With 13 applications for spot ETFs and several others for leveraged and options-based ETFs in the pipeline, the traditional finance ecosystem surrounding BTC (and soon ETH) is poised for significant expansion. QCP Capital anticipates that in a market characterized by low costs and tight spreads, structured products might emerge as a key asset class for generating alpha, similar to other markets like gold. The trading desk noted: This means that should spot BTC top on launch day itself, it will not stop the Traditional Finance ecosystem boom around BTC, and soon ETH – the likes of which we have been writing about for years now.

The real-time explorer tool is called ethernow.xyz, which gives insights into Ethereum mempool data and the block building process, and Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler described it as the Etherscan for pre-chain data.  The tool, made possible through a grant from the Ethereum Foundation, is supposed to solve ""observability"" challenges – helping researchers to understand why certain transactions fail or succeed, and how they are added to certain blocks.  ""Protocol developers can provide real-time visibility into application usage and predict increased or decreased volatility,"" Cutler told CoinDesk over Telegram.  The tool was first presented at the Columbia CryptoEconomics Workshop in New York on Wednesday.  Before transactions make it onto a block, they are added to a mempool, which is like a waiting room for transactions, before validators come in to organize them into a big group of transactions known as blocks. During this time, there are ways for third-party players to come in and organize these transactions in certain ways that could maximize some profits, known as Maximal Extractible Value (MEV).  Ethernow could ultimately help wallet providers give end-users feedback on transaction status, and provide suggestions for MEV protections, as well as help stablecoin issuers monitor potentially problematic transactions earlier in their lifecycle, Cutler told CoinDesk.  “It's the first real-time interface to see the inner workings,” Cutler told CoinDesk in an interview “But there are many opportunities for us to enhance and grow it.”  In October, Blocknative underwent a restructuring, resulting in a reduction of a third of its headcount, after ending its services related to its MEV-Boost relay due to poor economics.  At the time, Cutler told CoinDesk in an email that the company was “focused on extending our runway so that we have ample opportunity to pursue our Real-Time Observability thesis.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/07/blocknative-releases-new-ethereum-mempool-explorer-to-help-with-mev-protection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7173568c0962b49be44c0b863fb0bb8bede3a42f-1780x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Banks are becoming more positive about using crypto technologies such as programmable ledgers and smart contracts for the tokenization of money and real-world assets (RWA), the central bank said in the biannual report published Wednesday.  Tokenization, the process of issuing a digital representation of an asset, is a growing part of the crypto ecosystem and is forecast to become a $10 trillion market by 2030, according to asset management company 21.co. Last month, HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, said it plans to start a digital-assets custody service for institutional clients focusing on tokenized securities. Earlier this week, Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks sold 10 million euros ($10.8 million of tokenized green bonds on the Ethereum blockchain. And Archax, a U.K. registered crypto exchange, is planning on releasing an exchange for tokenized assets.  That increasing size could pose risks for the wider financial environment, the bank said. The boom could ""increase the interconnectedness of markets for crypto assets and traditional financial assets (since they are represented on the same ledger); and create direct exposures for systemic institutions,"" the report said.  While the risks are limited at the moment, the BOE said it will continue to monitor the trend and urged for more global cooperation. Regulators in the country are already trying to establish how best to regulate and accommodate fund tokenization.  ""International coordination can reduce the risks of cross-border spillovers, regulatory arbitrage, and market fragmentation,"" the report said, something that lawmakers have been asking for.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/07/asset-tokenization-on-blockchains-could-increase-systemic-risks-boe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37d516d037a417a9aca6023f8f959b492f32eebc-3226x1814.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to him, the crypto token could be worth close to $17 million in the future. Why One Bitcoin Could Worth $17 Million In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Harvey made a strong case for Bitcoin on why it could on why a price even greater than $17 million is likely. He referred to Bitcoin’s use case as a store of value and how it could further chop into the market share of other asset classes. He noted Bitcoin’s “tremendous upside” despite being a relative newcomer. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Pump Of Epic Proportions To $0.7, Here’s When Bitcoin is said to have 0.1% of the $871 trillion which are invested in global assets. Other global assets that hold a substantial market share include gold and silver, bonds, equities, real estate, and fiat money. Harvey believes that Bitcoin’s price could rally significantly as the foremost cryptocurrency becomes the most preferred option for people to preserve their money. Source: X Harvey stated that the monetary premium of those global assets highlights how much they are used as a store of value. The crypto pundit asserts that Bitcoin has the potential to capture the monetary premiums of other asset classes, which would see its price rise to $17 million with a market cap of $356.7 trillion. Source: X In his opinion, this is very likely because Bitcoin is a “superior form of property.” If it does happen, the crypto token could also end up capturing 41% of the $871 trillion in global assets. Harvey also provided a more probable scenario as to Bitcoin’s future price. He noted that the crypto token could still rise to as high as $415,000 per token if it captures 1% of global assets.

42391824,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwTan,1701968102,Jack Dorsey's Block Bitkey Bitcoin Wallet Comes to Market in More Than 95 Countries,"Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block (SQ) has unveiled its self-custody bitcoin wallet Bitkey for pre-order in more than 95 countries.  Bitkey consists of a mobile app, hardware device and a set of recovery tools, Block announced on Thursday.  The app allows customers to make bitcoin transactions via their mobile phone, while the hardware device stores their assets offline.  The app and hardware device form two of the three keys used to secure a customer's bitcoin, with the third stored on Bitkey's servers. The third key is used to verify transactions made by customers using only their phone (when they don't have the hardware device to hand) and to recover their wallet if they lose their phone, device or both.  Bitkey commenced beta testing over the summer ahead of the global rollout. Block announced in June that the wallet would connect to its payments platform Cash App and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) to facilitate buying and selling of BTC within the app.  Self-custody of crypto-assets became an increasingly significant area of concern for users following the collapses of numerous centralized cryptocurrency platforms, most notably FTX, but also Voyager and Celsius. Millions of users found out the hard way the truth in the old adage: ""Not your keys not your coins.""  Pre-orders of Bitkey are expected to be shipped in early 2024, Block said.

42391828,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwTvJ,1701967500,Crypto for Advisors: On-Chain Investment Tools and Vehicles,"As we covered in last week's newsletter, the advancements of Web3 are driving innovation across almost every industry, and TradFi is no exception. It's forecasted that an increasing number of investment products will be created and traded on-chain and in tokenized format. How do these products work, and where is the industry in this evolution?  The ways investors can participate in digital assets are evolving. Today, Jordan Tonani from Index Coop explains on-chain index products, how they work, and the investment exposure they provide to decentralized finance (DeFi).  Mike Cavanaugh from Regiment shares insights on the industry in our Ask an Expert section.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Will Diversified Indexes Gain Traction On-chain?  For the last 50 years, index products have been the primary way most people gain exposure to diversified baskets of assets. In Europe, 20% of managed assets are held in passive strategies, about half in exchange-traded products and half in index funds. Since 2015, passively-held assets under management have doubled, with around one-fifth of European retail investors holding such products.  Although most have yet to be made aware, index products exist on-chain as well We have been building such products since 2020, along with yield-earning, leverage and strategy tokens. We use the term “on-chain structured products” to refer to these types of tokens and we think they have a promising future.  For advisors and their clients, on-chain products offer simple, diversified, accessible exposure to some of the most important themes in digital assets. For now, many of these themes (like DeFi, the Metaverse, crypto, or liquid staking) are not widely available off-chain. Furthermore, these products are available to previously underserved constituencies globally (except in jurisdictions that impose restrictions on such products). And while it is sometimes possible for users to replicate the basic strategies of our tokens independently, doing so would mean numerous transactions, associated transaction fees and sometimes burdensome tax reporting requirements depending on where they live. With index tokens and on-chain structured products, users gain access to the most significant assets in a given theme with one purchase of one token. Users can redeem the index token with the underlying constituents at any time, and like most digital assets, index tokens can be traded permissionlessly 24/7.  Already these products have proved popular with a small segment of digital asset users. At the height of the 2021 bull market, our on-chain structured products captured over $550 million in total value locked (TVL).  While the current bear market has slowed the growth of this sector, recent upticks in digital assets prices and changes in the DeFi and TradFi landscape signal that momentum is returning to our space. The U.S. appears to be on the precipice of approving BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF and Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs which we think will stimulate demand and drive increased awareness of the value of digital assets and the importance of accessible instruments for users. That said, we think on-chain indices will be the more attractive proposition for a global, on-chain user-base because of increased transparency, enhanced security, global accessibility, automation, composability and liquidity.  Overall, we’re profoundly bullish on the potential of on-chain diversified indexes. This nascent sector is currently small, making up just .07% of the overall crypto market, but has the opportunity to grow quickly over the coming years. For advisors, familiarity with the growing options in this category will be critical in coming years as more and more people seek access to digital assets. The Index Coop annual state of the on-chain structured product market white paper provides more information on this space.  – Jordan Tonani, Index Coop  Ask an Expert  Q. If a spot bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC, what are the implications for other popular cryptocurrencies?  I think there will be interest in ETH, but I don’t see a scenario where there is a rush to launch ETF’s around everything. The expense to create an ETF is a large enough moat to deter most from entering the ETF market.  Q. The broader crypto market has witnessed a sharp rebound over the past couple months. Do you perceive this as a broader warming sentiment about crypto, or that it's mostly driven by anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF approval?  I do believe the buying interest is being developed by the warming sentiment around the BTC ETF; the interesting part is the HODLers – the people that have been long on BTC and remain long on BTC. They are not the natural sellers here, they continue to hold and selling scarcity with demand on the bid is causing considerable upticks into the daily market.  Q. Besides payments, what are some other use cases for cryptocurrencies that have captured your attention?  The tokenization of real assets is a major headline right now. We are seeing a lot of projects that are using blockchain technology to enable smoother transactions across many industries. Without getting into the specifics of the chain or specific projects (I'll save the shameless shilling…) we have noticed that real world problems are being solved by the tokenization of assets. Commercial real estate, supply chain logistics, ISP providers, data-governance in social media, HELOC origination ... .the problems that exist in these areas are being solved rapidly by blockchain based projects, and it’s a great time to be alive.  - Mike Cavanaugh, Regiment, LLC  Keep Reading  Next step in bitcoin spot ETF readiness - Blackrock received seed funding for ETF.

The debut price undercut futures traders' prelaunch estimates of around $1.50 per token on the perpetual futures trading platform Aevo.  Coinbase and Binance are also planning to list it.  JTO is a governance token whose holders will have some sway over Jito's treasury and fee rates. The protocol is rewarding past users with airdrops that start at 4,941 tokens and increase depending on how much they used its so-called liquid staking token (LST), jitoSOL.  Jito is the second-largest LST protocol for Solana users who want to trade and borrow against the SOL tokens they've locked up with validators. JitoSOL, its flagship asset, is basically a depository receipt for staked SOL. It generates yield from the Solana network's staking processes as well as extra revenue from Jito's MEV-style approach to auctioning blockspace.  The token's launch comes as the Solana ecosystem enjoys a rapid rebound in popularity as well as price. Solana's SOL has climbed 542% year-to-date with much of the price rise happening since mid-October. Many on-chain protocols are trying to take advantage of these favorable conditions with token airdrops that could drive yet more activity into their own products.  All those airdrops are helping fuel Solana's growth, too, Jito Labs CTO Zano Shermani said on Twitter spaces on Thursday. He said the new breed of projects learned the lessons of their predecessors who released assets with ""pretty bad tokenomics"" during Solana's previous bull market in mid-to-late 2021.  Only 10% of JTO's total supply is being distributed to airdroppers, who, notably, have an 18 month window to claim their treasure. Any unallocated tokens will go into a treasury controlled by Jito's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is managed by JTO holders.  The rest of the token supply is earmarked for Jito's investors and core contributors, as well as for efforts to bolster the Jito ecosystem.  The price is expected to be highly volatile on Thursday as more airdrop recipients claim their rewards and get the opportunity to hold or sell.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/07/even-small-time-jito-airdroppers-are-getting-thousands-of-dollars-in-jto-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6560d2d314c2918abd4b43bd8c920dc5d42115c1-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In that case, the developers are fighting Tulip's lawsuit alleging they wrongfully refused to help Wright's company retrieve billions of dollars worth of bitcoin it allegedly lost in a hack. In a preliminary trial, the court will be looking to determine whether Tulip does own the bitcoin, according to a High Court of England and Wales order posted on the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund website. The order is dated Nov. 15.  Wright, who has long claimed he is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto – a claim long met with widespread skepticism – sued the developers for refusing to build a backdoor mechanism to help Tulip Trading retrieve the coins it claimed to have owned and lost. The case was originally dismissed in March 2022, but reinstated on appeal.  ""Mr. Wright now not only needs to prove that he owns the bitcoin for the claim to proceed, he must also pay security for the developers’ costs of doing so,"" Timothy Elliss, a partner at Enyo Law, which represents most of the defendants, said in an email.  The preliminary trial, which is scheduled to take 15 days, will also seek to determine whether the alleged hack occurred and, if so, whether it deprived Tulip Trading of the private keys that controlled the bitcoin, among other issues.  The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is an organization funded by, among others, Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter (now X), Bluesky and Block (formerly Square).  CoinDesk reached out to Tulip's law firm Shoosmith for comment. Enyo Law said documents related to the case could be retrieved from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund website.

While optimism about what is looking like imminent U.S. regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is getting most of the attention as the reason for bitcoin's move to $44,000 from $27,000 at the start of October, sharp declines in interest rates have surely played a role.  Rate hopes have sparked gains across traditional markets as well, with the S&P 500 posting an 8.9% advance in November, long-dated bonds nearly erasing what had been historically large year-to-date losses, and gold rising to an all-time high above $2,100 per ounce.  Lower interest rates are thanks to market expectations that a continued slowdown in inflation and the economy will prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to not just pause its monetary tightening cycle, but rotate to cutting interest rates as soon as the first quarter of 2024.  While a pause certainly makes plenty of sense, to this point there's been very little evidence that the economy is slowing enough to merit such a quick shift by the central bank. For that, the Federal Reserve would likely need to see a sizable slowdown in employment gains – which are still averaging 212,000 over the past four months – or even one or two negative monthly prints.  Economists are expecting Friday's report to show a job gain of 185,000 in November, with the unemployment rate flat from October at 3.9%. A sizable miss to the downside is likely to reinforce bets about lower interest rates and might provide the fuel for bitcoin's run to $50,000. The flip side, however – jobs added of 200,000 or more – might prompt a reversal of those rate cut bets and take a chunk out of bitcoin's recent rally.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/07/bitcoins-next-move-might-be-decided-by-fridays-jobs-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e8452edb94bc484bebb35e45448b5b39c3fea53-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recovery of Coinbase's business is tied to the performance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. The use case for cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation and government failures is growing, but Coinbase's profitability is still uncertain. Coinbase may be on the verge of consistent profitability, but its EPS outlook is shallow compared to its stock price. At the beginning of the year, most investors had a bearish outlook on Coinbase ( COIN ). The stock lost tremendous value as cryptocurrency volumes slowed, and more investors and traders avoided the sector. Further, at that time, following the collapse of FTX, many were cautious toward crypto exchanges and viewed them as having high regulatory and liquidity risks. The latter issue was one of my primary bullish points behind Coinbase, as detailed in "" Coinbase May Soar In 2023 As Crypto Investors Flock To 'Safe Haven' Exchanges."" In January, I was bullish on Coinbase due to its low relative valuation and an outlook that its business would recover due to its higher regulatory standards (giving it a ""trust"" edge over private peers) as well as a bullish view on cryptocurrency, due to declining stability of the US dollar. Since that article was published, COIN has risen by a staggering 306%. Accordingly, I must take another look at the stock to determine whether or not it is still a viable or reasonable investment opportunity. Indeed, given its parabolic bullish movement in recent weeks, we must consider the possibility that it is rising in a speculatively-driven or short-squeeze-driven rally that will not last. COIN had higher short interest before this rally and retains a relatively high short interest level of ~13%, indicating a bearish sentiment on the stock and a high probability for a short squeeze, which appears to be a significant bullish factor behind the stock today. In my view, it is generally unadvisable for investors to try to catch a short-squeeze rally as they usually end in significant losses. Of course, there has been a fundamental recovery in much of Coinbase's business. For one, COIN usually trades as a proxy for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because its fee revenues will often directly correlate to the price of cryptocurrencies. Thus, to a great extent, we can only be bullish on COIN if we are also bullish on the primary cryptocurrencies traded on that exchange. Bitcoin and its peers have performed tremendously over the past two months, rising by around 70%. One fundamental cause is likely the decline in real interest rates and the related rally in gold, indicative of a decline in the US dollar's stability and potential renewed inflation, as was last experienced in 2020. Regarding Coinbase's primary operations, I believe the company still has ways to go and has not necessarily been as strong as earlier assumed. The company has slightly moderated its operating overhead; however, it has a ways to go before we can expect consistent profitability independent of a continued rise in cryptocurrencies. To me, it is given that Coinbase will fundamentally perform well if we see Bitcoin (and peers) reach a new all-time high, which is not unfeasible given the most recent shift in the monetary outlook. Even then, I would only buy COIN today if I could expect it would earn a profit without a rise in Bitcoin, which is not necessarily likely but still possible, given ongoing operational efforts. I believe COIN could continue to rise, but there is a high risk of reversal as short positions are pushed out. Cryptocurrencies and Monetary Policy Risk To a large extent, COIN will always be a proxy trade for Bitcoin and peers because transaction volumes and sizes usually change with crypto prices. As we've seen since their origin, cryptocurrencies are highly cyclical and are not clearly correlated to economic and monetary shifts; however, I believe they are becoming more economically driven as their market size grows. Fundamentally, cryptocurrencies are seen as a hedge against US and global inflation because they operate as currencies without central bank control. The possibility of widespread fiat currency failure in Western nations is the most significant speculative bullish argument for cryptocurrencies. However, the frequent and growing failures of many emerging market currencies, some of which are US dollar-hedged, have already caused many cryptocurrencies to become active operating currencies and wealth storage platforms in third-world countries, particularly in Africa and South America. As a result, some governments in those regions are now looking to ban or restrict their usage, which, to me, goes to show the use-case of cryptocurrencies as a potentially viable alternative against fiat currencies exposed to pro-inflationary government monetary policies. Further, cryptocurrencies are being used in countries with capital flight controls, such as China , where billions in cryptocurrencies are used to quietly move money out of that heavily controlled financial system. Of course, many billions in cryptocurrencies are also used in black-market transactions despite Western government efforts to halt such activity. I believe there is a growing argument that cryptocurrencies have a solid use case in the precarious global political and monetary environment. With many governments having extremely high debt, out-of-control deficit spending, and perceived corruption, there is potentially a tendency to dilute fiat currencies through money-supply growth policies, as last experienced in 2020-2021. The ""inflation tax"" is a quiet way for governments to lower debt levels in real terms while increasing revenues, making it the most viable way to reduce debt issues without austerity measures. Gold and silver are the oldest ways to protect against such actions, but cryptocurrencies have the benefit of being more suitable for online transactions. Unsurprisingly, this results in a relationship between gold, Bitcoin, and real interest rates. Real interest rates are interest rates on Treasury bonds after CPI inflation, as directly measured by inflation-indexed Treasury bonds. Real rates are tightly inverted and correlated to the price of gold, as lower returns after expected inflation make gold more valuable. Low real rates indicate pro-inflationary monetary policies, such as QE, and prolonged low rates. The last rally in gold and Bitcoin occurred in 2020 when real rates collapsed, causing many investors to look toward alternative assets to hedge against inflation risks. Inflation subsequently rose and is now slowly declining. Real rates appear very high but could theoretically be overstated if CPI inflation is understated . Regardless, we're now seeing a decline in real rates as investors expect a reversal in ""tight"" monetary policy, prompting a rally in gold and Bitcoin. See below: Data by YCharts In my view, it is too early to determine whether or not real interest rates will fall back below zero for a prolonged period. In the event of more bank failures and economic woes, I expect the Federal Reserve will shift back toward a pro-inflationary monetary policy as it consistently had from 2008 to 2021 during all periods of economic slowing. Specifically, I do not expect near-zero rates or QE but a reluctance to raise rates in light of a potential inflation rebound, potentially caused by ongoing geopolitical issues in oil-producing areas. While Bitcoin is not closely correlated to the price of oil, I believe a sharp rise in oil would be a vast bullish factor for cryptocurrencies as that could trigger a ""crisis"" for Western central banks forced to choose between economic stability and inflation, likely without the potential to maintain both. Can Coinbase Become Consistently Profitable? I have a bullish outlook on cryptocurrencies due to the perceived high risk of government failures to maintain stability in fiat currencies. It may still be some years before the US faces this issue, but widespread currency failures in developing markets are a more immediate catalyst. In comparison, Bitcoin is a significant target and Coinbase benefits from not being exposed to all cryptocurrencies. One can bet on COIN and benefit from the rise and fall of the entire cryptocurrency space. Fundamentally, in the long term, I believe other cryptocurrencies are more viable as currencies than Bitcoin . Still, COIN's value is more correlated to Bitcoin. See below: Data by YCharts Since January of 2023, we've seen Bitcoin and COIN rise in value together. COIN has had a ""beta"" to Bitcoin of around 1.2X this year, meaning a 1% change in Bitcoin may alter COIN's value by about 1.2%. That measure will change over time, but I generally expect COIN to be slightly leveraged to Bitcoin, particularly as long as it is on the cusp of profitability. Coinbase's fundamentals are also correlated to Bitcoin. Its sales, gross profit, and EPS per share have all generally tracked the price of Bitcoin since it went public. That said, its operating expenses continue to absorb all its potential profits. See below: Data by YCharts Last quarter, Coinbase had a gross income of $2.82 per share and an OpEx of $2.45 per share, meaning it lost around $0.37 per share in operating income, gaining some of that back through non-operating income. With relatively high short-term rates today, Coinbase should earn a decent non-operating income from cash positions. Still, in the long run, it will need to dramatically increase its sales or lower its operating expenses to become viable. In the past, when Bitcoin was around $45K, Coinbase had gross profits per share of around $4. If its operating overhead and non-operating income remain constant, I expect it should earn a quarterly EPS of about $1.5 (using a 30% tax estimate). EPS would differ from that figure because it may benefit from past negative income on taxes. The current analyst consensus EPS outlook for Coinbase in 2024 and 2025 is around $1.4, and the company is not expected to break even consistently until 2027. By 2032, analysts expect the company to earn an EPS of around $10 per share annually. Of course, the company's true performance will likely differ significantly as it depends on the volatile cryptocurrency market. In my view, the company's high operating expense is not necessarily an issue, but its stock-based compensation could be, as it accounts for ~40% of its annual income. Still, that is not a prominent figure compared to its market capitalization, so it is not diluting shareholders too much with this practice. That said, it is challenging to justify COIN at its current valuation, even with a solid long-term EPS outlook. Based on the current consensus, COIN's forward ""P/E"" in 2032 is 13.4X, and we should expect it to have reached maturity by a decade from now. At maturity, most stocks (depending on their risk) trade at ""P/E"" valuations of around 15X and often upwards of 20X during low-rate periods (see 2010-2021 ). There are many factors to consider, but the company trades at a very high valuation with that long-term EPS target. Even if its 2024 EPS is around $6, as I expect, its ""P/E"" would still be around 23X, which is high given it may not maintain that EPS level without a continued rally in cryptocurrencies. The Bottom Line Overall, I am neutral on COIN today. On the one hand, I expect the company will benefit from another wave of bullish activity in the cryptocurrency space. This wave appears to be fueled by a potential return to pro-inflationary monetary policies due to negative headwinds in global economic activity. Based on the relatively small decline in real interest rates, it may be that both Bitcoin and gold are getting ahead of themselves, as most Western central banks remain in a hawkish position. However, understandably, after the tremendous and rapid dovish pivot in 2020, investors and speculators may be quicker to buy monetary hedges in the event of a dovish pivot. My bullish view on cryptocurrencies is mitigated by potentially significant overvaluation in Coinbase. Based on reasonable conservative estimates, Coinbase may still be some years from consistent profitability and, even then, may not earn a huge profit compared to its current stock price. If we see Bitcoin rise over $100K, I expect Coinbase to make profits well above the consensus estimate, but that is certainly not a given. It is not necessarily likely Bitcoin can maintain such a high valuation in the long run without the collapse of more fiat currencies. Accordingly, I believe COIN is undervalued today only under the assumption of immense monetary instability over the next five to ten years. Is that possible? Yes, but we must keep in mind that a tremendous inflation shock (or hyperinflation) would also create business issues for Coinbase and the financial system it is tied to. To me, that is one of the most exciting points behind Coinbase, as it operates within a highly regulated financial system but generally benefits from issues within that system, making it unclear how it will perform given greater instability in the global financial system.

Morgan,"The rally in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could mean more losses for hedge fund short positions, according to J.P. Morgan’s Positioning Intelligence report. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is up 159.83% year to date, and up 24.02% from a month ago. The price of bitcoin and how hedge fund shorts perform can be “indirectly linked” because of how risk sentiment affects them. But, according to J.P. Morgan analysts, there could be a more direct link between them because of retail investors. Both Bitcoin and prices of securities shorted by hedge funds have risen because of the recent rally. But Bitcoin’s gain since early October has exceeded hedge fund shorts. ""Thus, given the large gap and lack of an independent jump in HF shorts, the rally in Bitcoin could be pointing to more upside (i.e. pain) for HF shorts,"" J.P Morgan said. Hedge fund shorts tend not to jump when Bitcoin was down or flat, the report said, and in the instances they have, that's been a sign that the shorts are “topping out"" and “has often coincided with more significant hedge fund de-grossing.” De-grossing is when funds sell longs and cover shorts Examples of that were January and June of 2021; August and mid-November of 2022; and early February, June, and July of 2023. “If macro data holds up well, there’s still room for recession fears to fade, which could lead to further upside, especially in the riskier pockets of the market (which HFs tend to be short),” the report said. “The main risks to this are poor macro data, a slowdown/reversal in retail flows into year-end, and overall positioning back to being modestly above average.” More on Bitcoin USD: Bitcoin: Liquidity Proxy Bitcoin Valuation: Four Methods Bitcoin And Stablecoins: The Monetary Gates Are Open Robinhood launches commission-free crypto trading in EU Bitcoin hovers near its most overbought levels in all of 2023 as it surpasses $44K",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/4044358-bitcoins-price-could-be-more-linked-to-hf-shorts-upside-than-thought-jp-morgan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=news,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21155909.jpeg

Binance CEO Disagrees With Jamie Dimon The Binance CEO recently defended cryptocurrencies by opposing the anti-crypto narrative promoted by the JPMorgan CEO in a hearing held on Wednesday. Teng took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his displeasure with Dimon’s narrative against crypto. Related Reading: Banking Giant CEO Trashes Crypto – Again – And Warns Of Ban: Here’s Why The JPMorgan CEO’s critics were set on the legitimacy and regulation of cryptocurrencies. According to Dimon, he has “never supported cryptocurrencies” and believes the “only real use case for crypto is criminals.” He further added that he would close down crypto if he had the power to do so. The CEO stated: I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, the only true use case for it is criminals. If I were the government I’d close it down. Teng underscored the need to compare the scope of illegal activity in cryptocurrency to that of traditional fiat money. He further highlighted the data compiled by Dr. Andrzei Gwizdalki from sources like the UN and the World Economic Forum. The data shows that illegal activities connected to fiat currencies are over 100 times bigger than crypto. According to the data, cryptocurrencies are linked to an estimated $20 billion in illegal activities. Meanwhile, fiat currencies such as the United States dollar are implicated in approximately $3.2 trillion in illegal activities yearly. However, due to the secret nature of money laundering, it is difficult to determine the total amount that has been lost. So far, Dr. Andrzei Gwizdalki believes the corruption and money laundering in connection with fiat “casts a dark shadow.” He also added that this is a reputation that the crypto space should not mirror. Furthermore, Gwizdalki has urged policymakers to be well-informed and handle real issues within their traditional systems. He believes using crypto for illegal reasons is “stupid and dangerous” since every transaction is transparently recorded. The Crypto Firm Faces Potential Collapse Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark has highlighted a potential collapse for Binance. Stark’s belief is due to the Binance plea agreement by the former CEO of the crypto exchange Changpeng CZ Zhao. Stark stated: The Binance Plea Agreement is Already Blowing Up. More Evidence of the Possibility of a Binance Collapse (And a 10-Year Sentence for CZ). He also highlighted Teng’s failure to provide answers to simple questions during an interview as another potential reason. In the interview, journalist Scott Chipolina asked Teng where Binance is headquartered, but the CEO refused to provide specific answers. Related Reading: Binance New CEO Affirms Strength In Company’s Fundamentals So far, Stark has voiced doubts about the exchange’s capacity to comply with the stringent DOJ/FinCEN monitoring and cooperation requirements. He believes that while investigations are still ongoing, the government will bring more accusations against Binance and Changpeng Zhao.

Experts On What Will Lead To ATH,"Trading firm QCP Capital has shared its thoughts on what could drive the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, to its all-time high (ATH) of $69,000. From their analysis, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have a huge role to play in all of this. Bitcoin Hitting $69,000 Dependent On Spot BTC ETFs QCP Capital stated that revisiting its ATH of $69,000 will depend on the “genuine flows the actual ETF will bring in the first few weeks of trading.” If the inflows are below par, the trading firm noted that it could set things up for the classic ‘sell-the-news’ moment. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Pump Of Epic Proportions To $0.7, Here’s When This assumption seems to stem from their belief that the news could already be priced in. They highlighted how Bitcoin has so far enjoyed incredible gains on the back of optimism that the SEC is going to approve these Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin has already risen to as high as $45,000 this month and is said to be up 15% MTD in the first week. With this in mind, QCP Capital is conscious of the fact that investors are most likely already positioned for an approval order by the SEC. If that is the case, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market will need something else to sustain this bullish momentum. That is why the trading firm has singled out liquidity flowing into these Spot Bitcoin ETFs as being key. Renowned Economist Peter Schiff had previously warned of a possible sell-the-news event when he mentioned that Bitcoin is unlikely to rally again once a Spot BTC ETF is approved. That is because he believes that the current Bitcoin rally is a result of many already ‘buying the rumor.’ As such, once approval comes, the next thing could be these ‘investors selling the news.’ BTC price recovers from flash crash | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Capital Expected To Flow Into These Spot BTC ETFs There is reason to believe that enough liquidity will flow into these Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin ecosystem to sustain the current market rally. Crypto research firm Galaxy Digital once published a report that stated that these funds could see $14 billion of inflows in the first year of launch. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Delivers Top 8 Altcoins To Buy On Binance Specifically, Galaxy Digital estimates that these funds will see an adjusted inflow of over $10 billion in their first month. These inflows should be enough to sustain Bitcoin’s rally as the research firm projects that Bitcoin’s price could see a 74.1% increase in the first year of these funds launching. Meanwhile, Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode is of the opinion that an approval order by the SEC will bring in a substantial influx of investors. They predict that about $70.5 billion could flow into Bitcoin due to increased demand from institutional investors.

42391831,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwU5Z,1701955712,Galaxy-Backed Gyroscope's 'All-Weather' Decentralized Stablecoin Goes Live on Ethereum Mainnet,"Gyroscope's GYD novel stablecoin went live on the Ethereum mainnet after testing on Polygon.  Venture capital firms Galaxy, Placeholder and Maven 11 invested in the project.  Gyroscope's ""all-weather"" stablecoin gyro dollar (GYD), which aims to keep crypto investors shielded from stablecoin failures, went live Thursday on the Ethereum [ETH] mainnet, the developer team told CoinDesk.  ""GYD is a means to protect against the risks of holding stablecoins, putting risk control on autopilot,"" the team said in an interview via email.  Stablecoins, in spite of their name, have been known to veer from their price anchors. In March, Circle's USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, temporarily depegged due to the collapse of banking partner Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). This in turn led Maker's DAI to drop, as a large part of that stablecoin's reserve assets were in USDC. Last year, the dramatic collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST marked the beginning of the crypto winter. Overall, large-cap fiat-backed stablecoins de-pegged from their price anchor more than 600 times this year, according to a Moody's Analytics report from early November.  Gyroscope claims to offer an alternative to centralized and algorithmic stablecoin designs, promising to protect holders against any de-pegging events.  It's a decentralized, non-custodial stablecoin that is fully backed by reserve assets and features an algorithmic mechanism to keep its price pegged to $1. The token was designed to segment the risks of each backing asset by storing them in segregated vaults.  Backing assets are stablecoins deployed in certain strategies such as yield-generating sDAI and USDC in Flux, and also support automated market-making (AMM) strategies like LUSD and crvUSD. As the stablecoin scales, the reserve has been designed to a large variety of strategies and assets, the Gyroscope team explained.  The token primarily targets decentralized finance (DeFi) users and features risk diversification rules, new oracle and circuit breaker systems and optimized minting and redemption bonding curves guiding the protocol on how to manage reserve assets for price stability, according to Gyroscope.  The launch followed a test period on Polygon and the opening of its liquidity pools (E-CLP), which attracted nearly $30 million in total value locked, the press release said.  The protocol raised $4.5 million in venture capital investment in a round led by Placeholder VC and Galaxy Ventures, with Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Balancer Labs co-founder Fernando Martinelli and others participating.  ""GYD is not a toy, but a stablecoin with aspirations to sit alongside Maker's DAI in the years to come,"" Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDC,ETH | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/07/galaxy-backed-gyroscopes-all-weather-decentralized-stablecoin-goes-live-on-ethereum-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eedf9946ce610aa6402d2dd18a44d683aab7061-1723x886.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum experienced significant growth, surpassing Bitcoin's increase for the first time since July. Other notable performers in the cryptocurrency space included Coinbase equity, DeFi tokens, and layer 1 smart contract platforms like Solana and Avalanche. In November, Bitcoin outperformed the S&P 500 due to investor interest and potential US Bitcoin ETFs, while Ethereum's growth also outstripped Bitcoin's. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. In November, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) outperformed the S&P for the third consecutive month, surging by 9% to reach an 18-month high. This uptrend was fueled by investors acquiring over $1 billion in EU-listed crypto ETNs and MicroStrategy adding another $600 million in spot Bitcoin. Notably, the imminent possibility of approval for various spot US Bitcoin ETFs in January is generating significant client interest and inquiries. Simultaneously, the US dollar experienced its most significant decline (-3%) since November 2022, prompted by evident signs of weakness in the Q3 earnings reports of major retailers like Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) and a softer labor market. This weakness in the US consumer sector raised expectations that the Fed might implement rate cuts as early as Q1. Separately, concerns about a disorderly wind-down of Binance ( BNB-USD ) diminished after the largest crypto exchange reached a settlement with the US DOJ, ensuring its continued operation. In a notable shift, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) outpaced Bitcoin with a 12% increase, marking the first time since July. The MVIS Digital Assets small-cap token (MVDASC) experienced a remarkable turnaround, soaring from negative year-to-date returns in mid-October to a year-end gain of +55%, although still trailing behind the +85% YTD gains of large-cap cryptocurrencies. Notable performers in the space included Coinbase ( COIN ) equity (+62%), DeFi tokens (+41%), and layer 1 smart contract platforms like Solana ( SOL-USD ,+54%) and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD , +89%). Centralized exchange tokens such as BNB lagged. Reflecting our ho-ho- hopes and expectations for a very strong 2024 for Bitcoin and other decentralized smart contract platforms, we are releasing separately our Crypto Predictions for 2024 blog.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. After a strong October (+21%), layer 1 blockchain tokens rose another 28% in November. Activity on blockchains and prices tend to be reflexive, resulting in a spike in fees for nearly all blockchains. As prices go up, speculators increase their activity, leading to more on-chain fees and increased demand to buy blockchain tokens to pay for gas. The principal winner in fee-generating usage was Bitcoin, whose fee share increased from 12.5% to 27.5%, with fees averaging around $4.5m per day. Ethereum maintained its market share of fees month-to-month, averaging around $7.6M. Ethereum activity was high enough in November that, once again, Ethereum became deflationary. In November, around 46k ETH were burned, and this ETH was worth $93M at the time of writing. Ethereum also saw an interesting blog post by a co-founder and spiritual leader, Vitalik Buterin, where he discussed resurrecting the Ethereum scaling solution Plasma and incorporating ZK-proofs to make Plasma more functional. While an informative post, Vitalik’s writing seems to correspond to an uptick in interest in alt-L1s with execution scaling embedded in their roadmaps, whereas Ethereum does not. Additionally, Ethereum validator entity Bitcoin Suisse saw 100 of its validators slashed for 1 ETH on November 14 due to inactivity, and this has catalyzed Ethereum community discussion. Most of the Ethereum community expressed concern on social media that there is a need to ensure slashing is applied to validators who act maliciously, not those who suffer outages outside their control. November L2 Daily Average Fees Source: Artemis.xyz as 11/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ethereum L2s had an interesting month as increased activity translated to higher fees across the board. Notably, the top fees producing L2 of November was Starknet, who averaged $199k in daily fees, barely surpassing Arbitrum at $191k and ZKSync at $178k. Part of the driver for Starknet is renewed speculation of a coming $STARK token airdrop that would accrue pro-rata for usage of Starknet. Interestingly, fees on Linea exceeded both Base and Optimism. A controversial addition to the L2 space is a project called Blast, which has attracted over $612M in just over a week. Blast, a project created by the Blur team, is contentious because it lacks a functioning chain or even a testnet. Blast is simply a 3/5 multisig wallet whose only functionality is to take deposits and stake them on Ethereum yield-generating projects like Lido. This is interesting because it brings up the fact that L2s, with ~$14B in deposits, are capital inefficient as those funds effectively sit on their bridges without earning any yield. This could spark an interesting movement to make those idle funds more dynamic in earning fees. Amid the uptick in L2 activity, OKX announced it will launch its own L2 to Ethereum built using the Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) CDK. Kraken noted publicly that it is considering launching its own L2 like Coinbase’s Base. Polygon also made headlines by partnering with Ethereum-rival NEAR to build zkWASM technology and announced a $90M incentive program called Polygon Village for developers to build on Polygon. Outside of Ethereum, the Cosmos community experienced further drama as controversial Prop 848 passed. The proposition, which cuts ATOM’s maximum inflation from 20% to 10%, received great pushback from both the Cosmos validator community and Cosmos co-founder Jae Kwon. In a post on Twitter, Jae Kwon threatened to hard-fork the Cosmos and airdrop a new Cosmos token to community members. This new Hub would effectively compete with Cosmos and cleave the community into separate projects. Hopefully, sparking renewed interest in the Cosmos amongst traders, the dYdX ( DYDX-USD ) chain went live with perpetual futures trading on its beta release. To support dYdX, CCTP has finally arrived on Noble, allowing Ethereum USDC holders to bridge their USDC to Noble and receive native USDC, which could be moved to dYdX. AVAX (+85.9%) Avalanche Daily Fees vs Daily Active Addresses Source: Artemis.xyz as 11/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Avalanche’s AVAX token was a top performer in November, having a mammoth (+85.9%) rally. Avalanche has made major efforts to attract financial entities to use its blockchain of blockchains and focused on the tokenization of off-chain assets. In November, those efforts partially paid off as Ava Labs partnered with JP Morgan’s Onyx and Apollo Global ( APO ) to build a proof of concept with the Monetary Authority of Singapore using Avalanche Evergreen Subnets. This will allow Onyx Digital Asset to access WisdomTree funds tokenized on an Avalanche subnet blockchain. Adding fuel to this price momentum for AVAX, Republic, a crypto-focused investment firm, will launch a tokenized fund called Republic Note on Avalanche. Republic Note attracted more than $30M in investment at launch. Other positive news for Avalanche included the launch of blockchain game Shrapnel’s token $SHRAP, which many speculate could be the first blockbuster crypto game. In November, Avalanche also saw a spike in fees that resulted in a 600% month-to-month increase in blockchain fees as transactions on Avalanche’s C-chain increased as much as 20x on several days. Most of this activity, over 95%, was due to ASC-20 inscriptions. Like Bitcoin inscriptions, these allow users to add any data to AVAX tokens using the extra data space in each transaction referred to as Call Data. While the flurry of activity was substantial, it was short-lived as transactions and fees reverted to their average after about a week. Remarkably, the spike in fee activity did not translate into a substantial increase in usership as daily active addresses peaked around 79k, which is just over double Avalanche’s average over the past two months. Solana (+51.2%) Solana DEX Volume Source: Artemis.xyz as 11/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The month of November began amid Solana’s annual developer conference, where several fascinating announcements and technology demonstrations took place. The founder of Solana, Anatoly Yakovenko, re-asserted Solana’s competitive positioning as a low-latency, high-throughput chain that would scale to meet the needs of hundreds of millions of users. To meet this vision, Kevin Bowers of Jump Trading introduced his team’s new Solana client, Firedancer, which was capable of processing more than 6M TPS using Solana’s existing network. To take advantage of this broad leap in capabilities, Sling Money, Backpack NFT, and Star Atlas discussed each project’s respective potential for payments, verified decentralized exchanges, and gaming. Token releases from several important Solana projects also helped Solana’s price. These included dominant MEV staking entity Jito ($JTO), 80% market share DEX aggregate Jupiter ($JUP), and price oracle with nearly total market share of Solana price feeds, Pyth ($PYTH). Due to the price performance of Solana and the anticipated launch of these tokens, a positive feedback loop of price and volume occurred on Solana, which surged DEX volumes by 320% month-to-month and resulted in Solana fees increasing 100% and usership up 50% compared to October. BNB (+1.0%) Layer 1 Daily Users, Market Share Source: Artemis.xyz as 11/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. BNB price action for November was not encouraging, but this is primarily due to the announcement of the DOJ settlement against Binance and Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Though the price of BNB initially rallied in relief after the news came out, the token began a downward spiral once it became clear that the charismatic and highly capable CZ would be leaving Binance, which may be a negative for the BNB chain’s future growth. Likewise, speculation is bouncing around crypto circles that the DOJ or the regulators in the US may push new allegations against the highly centralized BNB chain. The popular sentiment is that the US government will pursue a similar path in this case against Binance and BNB to what it did with BitMex. In the BitMex case, after presenting the entity’s founders with criminal charges, the US Government pressured the regulatory bodies in other countries to pursue action against BitMex. This supposition was partially confirmed on November 29 when the Philippines’ SEC argued that Binance was running an unregulated exchange and blocked access within the country to Binance. BNB’s on-chain metrics further demonstrate a deterioration in usage. Unlike most smart contract platforms in November, BNB saw usership decline (-4%). Another negative statistic for BNB is that its TVL increased only (+6%), making it one of the worst among smart contract platforms in November. Additionally, from the standpoint of market share of usership, BNB has been losing since early 2023, when it held 23%, and now it is down to around 16%. APT (-0.4%) Aptos ( APT-USD ) once again has struggled to find its footing amid the broader bull market despite the enormous potential of its technology. This has translated into very poor activity on its blockchain in November as daily active addresses are down (-44%) month-to-month, and fees have decreased (-16%) since October. This performance may be explained by the possibility that Aptos’s reputation is recovering from a 5-hour blockchain outage on October 18. Indicative of the tepid perception of Aptos, it only gained 19% in TVL compared to its main Move-based rival, Sui, who gained 129%. Going forward, Aptos’ major challenge is attracting a strong developer and user community. While Move is a fascinating, high-potential programming language for smart contracts, its growth has been stunted by the general crypto developer exodus and a lack of community on Aptos. Additionally, Move lacks the deep pool of developer libraries and tooling available on Ethereum and even Solana. As such, it will be an uphill climb for Aptos to get people excited about its ecosystem because it has not yet demonstrated that people will build applications that attract organic usage. DeFi Uniswap, Thorchain, & Curve 2023 Volume Source: DeFiLlama as 11/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The MarketVector Decentralized Finance Leaders index (MVDFLE) markedly outperformed $ETH in November, returning 41% as investors positioned themselves into tokens that will benefit from an increase in on-chain trading. Of the index components, Thorchain ( RUNE-USD , $RUNE) had the most impressive performance this month, +122%. $RUNE’s outperformance can be attributed to the significant increase in activity that has occurred on the protocol, as the decentralized native asset settlement chain saw new yearly highs in volume for the second month in a row. The increase in volume has rocketed the protocol up the decentralized exchange rankings, with Thorchain now recording the third most volume of any protocol, behind Pancake Swap and Uniswap. Similarly, $UNI ( UNI-USD ) saw an outsized return of 44% this month as the protocol maintained its strong market share. $MKR ( MKR-USD ), $LDO ( LDO-USD ), and $AAVE ( AAVE-USD ) returned 13%, 29%, and 21%, respectively. $CRV ( CRV-USD ) lagged behind the other decentralized exchanges, appreciating only 15% this month. $CRV’s underperformance can be explained by the protocol’s declining market share as the decentralized exchange saw only a slight increase in volume of 11%, significantly underperforming its peers Uniswap and Thorchain, which experienced increases in volume of 51% and 84%, respectively. Metaverse and Gaming The MarketVector Media and Entertainment Leaders index (MVMELE) returned 19% in November, slightly outperforming $ETH but seeing nowhere near the returns in DeFi, likely due to the continued lack of usage of metaverse ecosystems and value accrual to their respective tokens. Of the top metaverse tokens, $APE ( APE-USD ), $MANA ( MANA-USD ), and $SAND ( SAND-USD ) returned 19.3%, 19.4%, and 20% in November. While MVMELE didn't see jaw-dropping returns this month relative to $ETH, many tokens in the gaming/metaverse sector performed extremely well. This was likely a result of investors favoring smaller “moonshot” tokens that could have significantly more upside in a bull market than the higher-valued tokens that the index is composed of. This price action can be observed in tokens like $PRIME ( PRIME-USD ), $AURY, and $ATLAS, valued significantly lower than the mainstream metaverse tokens and rallied an impressive 181%, 200%, and 223%, respectively. NFTs The NFT market experienced a notable surge in activity this month, with the total NFT volume witnessing a substantial growth of almost 200%, reaching $906 million. This uptick can be attributed primarily to heightened speculation of Bitcoin inscriptions, which rose by an impressive 2300% to $373 million, surpassing Ethereum NFT volume for the first time. Simultaneously, NFTs on Solana demonstrated a robust increase in volume, rising by 165% to $76.5 million. Solana NFT investors mainly acquired Mad Lads and Tensorians in anticipation of these collections establishing themselves as the blue-chip NFTs on Solana. On the Ethereum side, $BLUR, the governance token of the leading NFT exchange by volume, observed a significant rally of 117%, reaching $0.50. This substantial movement can be attributed to the resurgence of NFT speculation and the unveiling of Blast, a new NFT-centric Layer 2 under development by the Blur team. Blast is set to focus on launching NFT-specific decentralized applications (dApps), such as NFT perpetual markets, and have low transaction fees to drive NFT trading. Furthermore, Blast intends to conduct an airdrop of the $BLAST token to participants in Blur Season 3. Notably, Blur Season 3 will deviate from past seasons, as rewards will be evenly distributed between NFT traders and Blur stakers, departing from the previous practice of exclusively benefiting NFT traders on the Blur platform. Since the announcement, approximately 362 million $BLUR have been staked, constituting roughly 33% of the circulating supply. Additionally, Blast garnered over $600 million in deposits to the contract within its initial week post-deployment, with these assets unable to be withdrawn until February. Distinguishing itself from other Layer 2 rollups on Ethereum, Blast introduces a unique mechanism whereby deposited assets earn yield through rehypothecation on the backend. Specifically, $ETH is exchanged into Lido's $stETH, and stablecoins are swapped into MakerDAO's yield-bearing $sDAI, with the yield produced from these tokens automatically blasted to user’s wallets.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, SBF, ether and SEC Chair Gensler all came up at the Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night. Pro-crypto candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said U.S. regulation needs to catch up to prevent episodes like FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried defrauding customers and Binance breaking sanctions laws. Ramaswamy announced a plan to drastically reduce the SEC workforce and relax regulations on the crypto industry, advocating for most cryptocurrencies to be treated as commodities outside the SEC's jurisdiction. ""It's nothing short of embarrassing that Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, couldn't even confirm in front of Congress whether Ethereum is a regulated security,"" Ramaswamy said. ""This is another example of the administrative state going too far.""  Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said the blockchain platform's much-hyped Saga phone has an uncertain future following disappointing sales since it went on sale in April this year. “We have to decide if there’s a place for a smart wallet, a much cheaper version that an iPhone user could use as a secondary device,"" he said during a podcast appearance. Yakovenko noted that advancements in mobile interfaces have significantly reduced the gap between specialized and regular smartphones. He added that he doesn't use his own Saga as his primary phone, instead using it as his ""NFT phone.""  More than 1,000 BTC mined during the early stages of bitcoin's history moved to trading desks and custodian services earlier this week, an instance of ""Satoshi era"" bitcoin being transferred. The coins last moved 13 years ago and were mined from block rewards at an estimated total cost of $100. They now have a market value of over $40 million. There were also instances of ""Satoshi era"" (the period when Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto was active in the community between 2009 and 2011) bitcoin being moved in recent months. In July a wallet that had been dormant for 11 years sent $30 million worth of BTC to other wallets. Long-time dormant BTC becoming active is seen by some as a sign of stirring optimism about growing bitcoin adoption.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the cumulative volume delta (cvd), or the difference between futures longs and shorts (or buyers and sellers), adjusted for open interest.  The CVD has declined for most major tokens, excluding BTC, XMR and ETH in the past seven days, a sign of net capital outflows or sellers outpacing buyers.  The data hints at a potential bull breather ahead.

21151928,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564357,1701952208,"Apollo Crypto Predicts Bitcoin Price Of $200,000 This Cycle, Here’s Why","Apollo Crypto, a renowned name in the field of cryptocurrency analysis, has recently released a comprehensive report predicting a significant surge in the Bitcoin price, potentially reaching as high as $200,000 in the current cycle. Authored by Henrik Andersson, the report delves into various factors that could contribute to this remarkable growth. A pivotal aspect of the report is the anticipated approval of the first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. Eric Balchunas, the senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, is quoted saying, “There is a 90% chance of an approval by January 10, 2024.” This development is seen as a significant driver for Bitcoin’s price increase. The report elaborates on the interest from prominent asset managers in Bitcoin spot ETFs, asserting, “In our view, it is likely that the SEC won’t give preferential treatment to a single ETF issuer; therefore several of them are likely to get approval at the same time.” Bitcoin ETF Inflow Estimate And Multiplier Effect A key element in Apollo Crypto’s analysis is the potential new money inflow into Bitcoin ETFs. The report estimates this by considering the total size of US holdings of equities at $64.7 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For December Surge As Historical Patterns Suggest Strong Upside Ahead It assumes that 10% of these investors would allocate 1% to Bitcoin ETFs, leading to an estimated inflow of $65 billion. This number is cross-referenced with the total US ETF market size of $6.5 trillion, where Bitcoin ETFs are expected to capture 1%, aligning with the $65 billion inflow estimate. The concept of the ‘Bitcoin multiplier’ is also central to the report’s analysis. This refers to the effect of each dollar inflow on Bitcoin’s market cap. The report cites the next BTC halving in April 2024, which will reduce the new supply of BTC, as a factor that could increase the multiplier effect. Referring to a Bank of America report titled “Bitcoin’s dirty little secrets,” Apollo Crypto notes, “For example, we estimate that a net inflow of just $93 million would result in price appreciation of 1%.” From this, they deduce a 114x multiplier effect as an upper bound but apply a more conservative estimate of 50x for their scenario. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Fractal Returns: Analyst Predicts Another Leg-Up With Price Target Combining the inflow estimate and the multiplier effect, the report concludes that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 per coin in this cycle: Putting it all together leads us to believe that we could see $65 billion in inflow to Bitcoin ETFs in the coming cycle. Applying a 50x multiplier effect leads to an increased market cap of $3.25 trillion in which case we would see Bitcoin trading at $200,000 per coin. We realize this is a bold estimate with a lot of uncertainty. Flow-On Effect On Ethereum The report doesn’t stop at Bitcoin. It also analyzes the performance relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum during the last bull market, using a specified period from September 2020 to November 2021. During this phase, the report notes, “Bitcoin increased 4.8x while Ethereum increased 9.8x; Ethereum increased twice as much as Bitcoin during this time.” This historical data is crucial as it indicates that Ethereum tends to have a higher beta, or sensitivity, to Bitcoin’s market movements. Building on this relationship, the report projects that if Bitcoin’s price were to quintuple – as suggested in their forecast from $40,000 to $200,000 – then based on the past market behavior, Ethereum could potentially experience a parallel and more pronounced surge. The report estimates, “If the relationship holds for the coming cycle and Bitcoin increases 5x, then Ethereum would reach $22,000.” At press time, BTC traded at $43,371.

The Global X Blockchain ETF has very high momentum today, but is currently overbought and faces technical resistance, and I highlight key price points. BKCH is a small fund with a concentrated portfolio, primarily focused on small-cap growth stocks in the blockchain and digital asset space. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is back. Each week, I review the Goldman Sachs Kickstarter report. Among the many revealing charts is the YTD total return and risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio) view. Guess what’s on top – Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is now up more than 160% on the year after hitting a bottom in June 2022, not far from $16k. With BTCUSD up about 50% from its low just two months ago, another rally of that size would send Bitcoin to within striking distance of its all-time high of $69k. Thus far on the year, BTCUSD is up about 160%, outpacing the S&P 500's 20% total return. I have a hold rating on the Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ) as I see near-term overbought conditions, a concentrated portfolio, and technical resistance on the chart during this often-favorable period on the calendar for the crypto space. Impressively, the ETF is ranked number 3 out of 2385 overall by Seeking Alpha. Bitcoin Boasts Big 2023 Returns Goldman Sachs For background, BKCH seeks to invest in companies positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of blockchain technology, including companies in digital asset mining, blockchain & digital asset transactions, blockchain applications, blockchain & digital asset hardware, and blockchain & digital asset integration, according to Global X . The issuer states that the theme is bigger than just cryptocurrency and that BKCH invests accordingly, with global exposure across multiple sectors and industries, though the fund is highly concentrated. BKCH is a small fund with just $104 million in assets under management and it pays a modest 0.6% trailing 12-month dividend yield . Share-price momentum has been stellar lately, however, as evidenced by its A+ ETF Grade by Seeking Alpha, and I will detail key price levels to monitor later in the article. What’s more, the fund’s 0.50% annual expense ratio is not overly expensive, though volatile price action over the last 12 months earns BKCH a poor F risk rating. Liquidity is mixed with the ETF – average daily trading volume is low at 43k shares and Global X notes that the fund’s 30-day median bid/ask spread is exceedingly high at 0.52%, so using limit orders is highly encouraged in my opinion. Digging into the portfolio, one of the reasons why the allocation is so risky is that it's primarily a small-cap growth fund. Just 4% of the portfolio is considered large cap and only 10% is in the value style. Thus, it is not so much macro/cyclical factors that could impact its performance but concentrated fundamental and technical swings within the digital technology and cryptocurrency universes. With a price-to-earnings ratio north of 30, it’s not cheap, though long-term EPS growth is reported above 16, making for a PEG that is not tremendously high. Global X notes the fund’s beta to the S&P 500 is high at 1.31 as of November 30, 2023. BKCH: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar You won’t find many ETFs with fewer holdings than BKCH. There are 26 total positions, and there is an extremely high 76% of total assets invested in the top 10 stocks – thus it's important to monitor trends in those companies, particularly the top four which comprise about half of BKCH: Coinbase ( COIN ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). BKCH: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Seasonally, December is one of Bitcoin’s best months of the year, and recent performance may have pulled forward typically robust year-end returns. January is actually BTCUSD’s second-worst month before big gains have historically taken place in February. These are key patterns to consider when timing your BKCH entries and exits. Bitcoin Seasonality: Strong December, Weak January Stockcharts.com The Technical Take It has been an incredible run for BKCH over the last two months. Notice in the chart below that shares hit a low of $21.20 in early October before they zoomed up to a recent peak of $39.29. A lot is going on in the graph, so let’s dig in. First, the July peak is the obvious resistance point at $44, but I also spotted an uptrend resistance line that comes into play just under $50 that investors should consider. What’s more, the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart underscores just how far and how fast the rally has come – at 80, it is the most overbought since the summer. But with a long-term 200-day moving average that is positively sloped, the bulls appear in control. Additionally, I see a bearish to bullish reversal underway – that began with the break of a downtrend line earlier this year and then a series of higher lows, forming a rounded bottom pattern (illustrated in yellow). I see support at the $21 mark, and perhaps $29 can offer more near-term buying support. Overall, the chart is constructive from a long-term point of view, but a retreat off overbought conditions would make sense here. BKCH: Bearish to Bullish Reversal, Near-Term Overbought, $21 Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on BKCH. Momentum is very high, and a long-term bullish reversal is in play, but it’s a very concentrated allocation at a high valuation today.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656537-bkch-bitcoins-surge-helps-blockchain-and-crypto-stocks-spotting-key-risks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21151936.jpeg

Ethereum's network activity is increasing, leading to higher gas prices and a return to deflationary dynamics as more ETH is burned than created. With spot ETFs possible in 2024, asset managers are underweight ETH. I suspect that will change next year. The crypto market is back. We have enjoyed broad rallies in the crypto coins and have seen large year-to-date increases in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), among others. Some cryptos are rallying with the market while others are benefiting from specific catalysts. For BTC, that catalyst is renewed interest from institutional investors as a spot ETF approval within weeks seems like a foregone conclusion. Data by YCharts This ETF optimism has allowed BTC to significantly outperform ETH, which itself is up an impressive 91% year-to-date. In this article, we'll look at updated network metrics for Ethereum, holder data, assess a new risk to consider, and get into investor flows for ETH. Network & Holder Metrics Activity levels on chain are picking up steam. Last week network transactions topped 1.1 million for the first time since early January. Network Transactions (Messari) This renewed interest in the network has driven gas prices higher. The result of this has been a return to ETH's deflationary dynamic. Even though Ethereum doesn't have a cap on coin supply like Bitcoin, Ethereum does have a token burn mechanism. When the network usage is high and gas prices (transaction fees) increase, there is a possibility that more tokens will be burned than created through supply emissions. With the resurgence in activity in the crypto market, more ETH is being burned than issued again after ETH briefly turned inflationary for much of September and October 2023. ETH Supply (ultrasound.money) Since ""the merge"" in September 2022, the total supply of ETH has gone down by nearly 300k ETH. While this is a small portion of the 120.2 million ETH in circulating supply, had ETH stayed on a proof of work consensus mechanism, we'd have seen the token supply increase by 3.1% in the time since the merge. Non Zero Addresses Dec 31, 2022 Dec 4, 2023 YTD Ethereum 92.34 110.01 19.14% Bitcoin 43.46 50.97 17.27% Source: CoinMetrics, millions From a holder standpoint, we've seen a nice increase in non-zero wallet addresses for Ethereum. In fact, Ethereum just crossed 110 million non-zero addresses at the beginning of December. While it's admittedly very close by percentage, ETH has seen a slightly larger year-to-date gain in non-zero addresses than Bitcoin. It's important to note, non-zero addresses are not the same thing as unique holders as it's possible for one person to control many different wallet addresses. But we can get a sense of holder motivations when we look at control of supply. ETH Supply Share (IntoTheBlock) Ethereum has a similar holder dynamic to Bitcoin. Long-term ""hodlers"" are consuming an increasingly large share of token supply. At 75.4%, hodlers have the largest share of token supply on Ethereum that they've ever had. The long-term trend is for this metric to continue rising. We don't generally see hodlers relinquish coins until a new price high has been made. Is Bitcoin The NFT Captain Now? In addition to stablecoin footprint and DeFi activity, one of the major areas where Ethereum has reigned supreme over all smart contract blockchains has been in the area of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Over the last month or so, we've seen market exuberance proliferate the NFT market once again. However, the market is a little bit different this time around. Certain ""blue chip"" projects on Ethereum like Bored Apes or CryptoPunks have experienced increases in volume. Meanwhile, we haven't seen participation in this NFT rally from other chains like Flow ( FLOW-USD ). Often times smaller chains lack the ability to replicate the success of a flagship project from the last crypto bull; in Flow's case, this would be NBA Top Shot. However, I suspect that a large part of this indifference to those smaller chains is due to the huge presence of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens that can now be observed on Bitcoin: 30 Day NFT Sales Volume (CryptoSlam) In the last 30 days, Bitcoin has been the top blockchain for NFTs when adjusting for wash sales. This is very interesting because Bitcoin has not historically been viewed as a smart contract blockchain. So seeing Bitcoin currently leading in this area is a new development that crypto investors should pay attention to. I've long maintained that most NFTs are junk, but there is a legitimate application for non-fungible tokenization in real world asset markets and for domain IP. If Ethereum loses the NFT crown to Bitcoin longer term, that would potentially diminish the attractiveness of Ethereum as an investment idea. Investor Flows There has been a lot of excitement about the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US market. The expectation for the approval of such a product has been a large driving factor for these recent returns. It almost feels as though larger investors have forgotten about Ethereum even though we're already starting to see spot ETF applications roll in for that asset as well from many of the same fund managers that want spot Bitcoin ETFs. If one takes the view that these products will be approved next year as well, then fund managers have quite a bit of catching up to do from an asset acquisition standpoint. Crypto Fund Flows (CoinShares) Consider how dramatic the net fund flow has been for crypto assets over the last two months as it has become increasingly likely we'll see a spot BTC ETF. The last ten weeks have brought in $1.76 billion of asset inflows. This small period accounts for almost the entire $1.84 billion net asset flow to crypto investment products year-to-date. Where it gets interesting is when we break it out by asset. Asset YTD Flows AUM Change Bitcoin 1,683 33,133 5.4% Ethereum 10 8,878 0.1% Solana 143 455 45.8% Binance ( BNB-USD ) -1 232 -0.4% Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) 3 116 2.7% Source: CoinShares, figures in millions USD, as of 12/1/23 BTC is clearly still the largest driver of institutional cryptocurrency exposure. Ethereum is the clear second favorite for fund managers, but the year-to-date fund flow for ETH only went positive within the last week . Fund managers have been more interested in Solana this year. It took eleven months for asset managers to feel comfortable buying Ethereum again. One possible reason for this could be that the current administration's SEC has been anything but clear when answering questions about how the agency views the asset. But the same SEC has stated SOL is an unregistered security and that hasn't hindered investment in 2023. Regardless, Ethereum has quite a bit of catching up to do from an asset allocation standpoint. Bitcoin Ethereum Combined Cap Market Cap $856.9 $270.9 $1,128 % of Combined Cap 75.98% 24.02% 100.0% Investment AUM $33.1 $8.9 $42.0 % of Investment Capital 78.81% 21.19% 100.0% Sources: CoinShares, CoinMarketCap, dollars in billions Consider the market caps for each coin and the share of investment capital that has been allocated to them. In the table above, I'm showing the circulating market caps for each asset and the combined value of those market caps. When we make the same calculation for the investment community, we can see asset managers are theoretically underweight Ethereum. A rebuttal to this process may say Ethereum doesn't have a spot ETF approval yet. But neither does Bitcoin. Closing Summary ETH is still a volatile and risky coin just like the other digital assets in the cryptocurrency market. Investors should be both patient and responsible with position sizing. The general election next year could theoretically be a turning point for the crypto industry domestically. However, if the SEC is run by the same people in 2025, that agency may remain antagonistic to the industry to whatever degree it can. For me personally, the strategy is the same. I think Ethereum will remain the leading smart contract ecosystem for stablecoin footprint and DeFi. Until that thesis falls apart, I'm still very bullish Ethereum long term.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656530-ethereum-has-catching-up-to-do?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21151052.jpeg

42391834,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwUAh,1701949171,Deloitte Taps Polkadot Ecosystem's Kilt Blockchain for Digital Shipping Logistics,"BANGALORE, India — A division of professional services firm Deloitte, one of the “Big Four” accounting firms, will use the Polkadot-based Kilt blockchain to offer logistics and supply-chain services focused on the shipping industry.  Ingo Rube, founder of the KILT Protocol, told CoinDesk in a fireside chat at the India Blockchain Week conference that Deloitte is working with Nexxiot, a supply-chain technology company, to offer a new type of logistics service called KYX.  KYX is a combination of Know Your Client (KYC) and Know Your Cargo – two processes that identify and verify the client's identity and their shipped goods, respectively. This system is built on the Kilt network.  ""Using decentralized and open-source solutions 'Built on KILT,' any entity could create a service built on a blockchain without having to deal with cryptocurrencies or needing blockchain experience,"" Rube said in a statement.  KILT Protocol’s native kilt (KILT) tokens are up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, data shows.  Shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd will be the first to implement KYX, followed by telecommunications giant Vodafone. Hapag-Lloyd is said to be equipping some 1.5 million containers with devices that can tracked to show that they are secure and have not been opened.  Computing giant IBM (IBM) previously undertook a project to improve supply-chain services in shipping using blockchain technology. IBM combined with shipping giant Maersk to form TradeLens in 2018 but shut it down in November 2022 due to a lack of commercial take-up.  Where the closing down of TradeLens coincided with the depths of the bear market - occurring the same month as FTX's collapse - such enterprise projects may now start to emerge again as the crypto and blockchain industry appears to be entering its next bull run.  Deloitte's work in blockchain technology goes back several years. In 2019, it unveiled a plug-and-play product for enterprises to develop blockchain-based services for clients. Earlier this year, the company became one of several participants in fintech firm Digital Asset's interoperable network providing a decentralized infrastructure for institutional clients, alongside BNP Paribas (BNP), Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), Goldman Sachs (GS), among others.

Related Reading: Crypto Expert Delivers Top 8 Altcoins To Buy On Binance Following this, traders on both sides quickly found themselves holding loss positions, and the liquidations pilled up. In total, over 81,000 traders were caught in the red, leading to more than $190 million in losses. Interestingly, the majority of these were from long trades who were betting on the price to continue to rise. Source: Coinglass Coinglass puts 73.74% of the total liquidations in the past day to be from long traders, meaning that around 45,000 traders were long this time around. The single largest liquidation event was recorded on the OKX crypto exchange across the ETH-USDT-SWAP pair which was valued at $2.12 million at the time of the liquidation. There was also a new entrant into the top 3 in terms of liquidation volumes. Naturally, Bitcoin and Ethereum led the pack with liquidation volumes of $47.12 million and $29.16 million. However, ORDI came in third position with $21.64 million in liquidations in 24 hours. Long Traders In Trouble As Bitcoin Tanks Long traders have continued to suffer the brunt of the liquidations in the last day, and the tides are still yet to turn against the bears. As Bitcoin’s price has briefly plunged below $43,000 and recovered back up toward $43,400 once more, the long liquidations are still piling up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pushes Into Extreme Greed, What You Should Expect From Here At the time of this writing, short liquidations made up 91.05% of the approximately $47.83 million in liquidations that have been recorded in the last four hours. This 4-hour liquidation trend is also being led by the same top three including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ORDI, all of which have seen a lot of volatility in the last week. If Bitcoin’s recovery continues to show high volatility, these liquidation volumes will continue to rise. The majority of the liquidations have taken place on both the Binance and OKX exchanges with $82.56 million and $60.51 million, respectively. ByBit exchange snags third position with $27.05 million in liquidations in the last day. Bitcoin is currently struggling to maintain support above $43,000, which explains why there has been an uptick in the liquidation trend in the last few hours. However, bulls are still ahead and continue to dominate as sentiment remains firmly in greed.

42391837,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwUQ5,1701945480,Here's Why Bitcoin's Famed Bull-Market Pullbacks Have Been Elusive During the Recent Price Surge,"BTC's bull run is characterized by stair-step price action, comprising a series of price gains and horizontal consolidations.  A spot-led rally and low leverage ensure the famed double-digit bull-market pullbacks remain elusive.  At least half of bitcoin's [BTC] 160% surge this year has materialized in just the past eight weeks.  The trend looks more impressive given its stepwise structure of a series of price rallies and horizontal consolidation runs. That starkly contrasts with past rallies, including the rally in late 2020-early 2021, when pullbacks of 20% or more were common.  Those pullbacks have remained elusive this time around, possibly because spot-market buyers have been in the driver's seat.  Read more: This Bitcoin Rally Feels Different. FOMO and YOLO Seem to Be Back  ""The bull market has been a clearly spot-driven bull market, with all major derivatives data relatively flat, futures premiums holding around 10%, and options IVs [implied volatility] not showing significant gains,"" options data tracking website Greeks.Live said on X. ""We have to put this rally and the news of the impending passage of the ETF in perspective; this spot bull market is very healthy, the downside is limited, and the bull market is here to stay.""  A spot market is where an asset is traded for immediate delivery. Derivatives involve futures and options, whose value is derived from the underlying asset, and these instruments are settled in the future.  According to CCData, spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized exchanges rose to an eight-month high of $3.61 trillion in November, with the share of derivatives declining for the third straight month to 73%. Data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant show bitcoin's spot-to-derivatives trading volume ratio jumped to nearly 0.10 from 0.05 last month, indicating increased activity in the spot market.  While derivatives still account for the majority of market volume, the degree of leverage in the system remains low, supporting the stair-step price ascent.  Derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, allowing traders to take bullish (long) or bearish (short) positions worth more than the amount they have deposited as a margin at the exchange. Leverage is a double-edged sword, magnifying both profits and losses. It also exposes traders to liquidations, or forced unwinding, due to margin shortfalls. Furthermore, mass liquidations often lead to exaggerated bullish or bearish moves, so the greater the use of leverage, the higher the probability of liquidations injecting volatility into the market.  The estimated leverage ratio, calculated by dividing the dollar value locked in active open perpetual futures contracts by the total value of coins held by derivatives exchanges, remains near April's low of 0.20, having peaked above 0.40 last year, according to data source CryptoQuant.  Most leading exchanges, including Binance, now offer 20x or lower leverage in derivatives trading, allowing speculators to establish long positions controlling 20 times the value of their collateral. That's significantly below the 100x available during previous bull runs. Such high use of leverage meant less staying power when things turned bad and vulnerability to liquidations-induced downside volatility, as observed during the 2020-21 bull run.  Besides, activity is now more concentrated in standard futures on the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and sophisticated traders rarely employ extreme leverage. Derivatives trading on the CME rose 18.4% to $67.9 billion in November, the highest in two years, according to CCData. CME also overtook Binance as the largest derivatives exchange, with open interest in BTC rising 21% to $4.11 billion.  Lastly, the use of coins as margin for trading peaked in 2021-22. Now, cash or stablecoin-margined contracts account for most of the open interest in BTC futures. Cash-margined contracts offer a linear payoff, while coin-margined contracts, where the collateral is as volatile as the trading position, create a greater liquidation risk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/07/heres-why-bitcoins-famed-bull-market-pullbacks-have-been-elusive-during-the-recent-price-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a52243af644b90d6fcfb7bb2ddf4d8b05abb0f-7757x3660.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain technology’s most valuable application is not through a token or coin but hinges on two distinct concepts: The blockchain itself — that, is the ledger responsible for providing the single source of truth — and the so-called consensus protocol, or how that truth is agreed to. Blockchain represents the real opportunity that investors should be talking about. By Andrew Almeida, CFA Background For the average person, the term “crypto” has become a catchall. It encompasses everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to Layer 0s, Layer 1s, Layer 2s, staking protocols, permissioned blockchains, public chains, Web 2.5, Web 3.0, and beyond. I cringe whenever someone asks me if I invest in “crypto.” The term is so overused and overapplied that it has become meaningless. But in the sphere of institutional investing, crypto pretty much means Bitcoin. That is what draws most of the attention. Since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, traditional finance (TradFi) has struggled to understand what it is, what it will be, and whether it is a viable investment asset. Like many others, I had my doubts. Over this same period, TradFi has wholeheartedly embraced exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has further reinforced the prevailing indexing framework: We start with the largest market cap and work our way down. Consequently, the industry remains in a state of anticipation, awaiting bitcoin-related cues on how to proceed. Institutional capital will probably stay on the sidelines until two crucial conditions are met: The SEC approves a bitcoin ETF, and we receive clear guidance on which regulatory body or bodies — the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), or some combination thereof — will oversee the various token assets. But this approach overlooks the blockchain’s fundamental significance and the opportunity it represents. As investment professionals, we have to move beyond Bitcoin and delve deeper into the realm of blockchain. Blockchain technology’s most valuable application is not through a token or coin but hinges on two distinct concepts: The blockchain itself — that, is the ledger responsible for providing the single source of truth — and the so-called consensus protocol, or how that truth is agreed to. Appchains These two concepts underpin blockchain-powered applications. This framework has profound implications. Trust develops because the inputs from all participants are validated, so every app user trusts the data on the blockchain. The security and continuous operation of the application does not rely on one central authority or its servers. Instead, a robust community of participants and a network of independent servers, guided by the consensus protocol, ensures its continued safety and viability. Any data that lacks validation is not recorded on the ledger. This could revolutionize application sharing. In TradFi, a central authority must validate information. In decentralized finance (DeFi), however, users themselves conduct the validation process as a community. They trust the data because they are part of the community that validates the data. Digital transformation already represents a substantial leap forward that has reduced or eliminated paperwork and led to significant productivity gains. But the removal of reconciliation will constitute a quantum leap and create exponential growth in both trust and productivity. Custody The custody question constitutes the principal differentiator between TradFi and DeFi. Where are our assets when they are on the blockchain? Just as banks don’t store our money in one dedicated place, on the blockchain, so long as the protocol is legitimate and adequately decentralized, the community validates our account, information, data, and balance. When we invest in TradFi, we need to complete know your customer (KYC) procedures at each institution we engage with. We take our ID from our wallet, input our information, and send money. But what if our wallet is an address on the blockchain and includes an authentication certificate? Instead of conducting these KYC procedures every time we open an account, we simply link our address to an application that confirms our data has already been authenticated. Conceptually, it resembles a quasi-“FINRA” chain: We complete KYC once and can seamlessly switch between investment managers. Such authentication increases both security and speed. Imagine a supply chain where the blockchain authenticates the quality of the good. We can trust this authenticated quality across the companies that participate in and validate an application chain as part of a community. This trust allows materials to move swiftly along the supply chain and instills more confidence in their quality. No Weak Links in the Blockchain As with any innovation, crypto has its share of bad actors and scams. But validated blockchains are helping companies scale operations and cut costs and can serve as the foundation for more secure and trustworthy technology. Blockchains are here to stay. Indeed, amid the ongoing hype surrounding artificial intelligence ((AI)), concerns about how AI systems are trained, what they are trained on, and the outputs they generate are ubiquitous. But blockchains can address some of these concerns. AIs often suffer from a “Garbage In, Garbage Out” problem: Their performance depends on the quality of their input data. With its validation and consensus capabilities, blockchain could prevent garbage from getting into the AI in the first place. So, disregard all the hype around crypto in general and Bitcoin in particular. Blockchain represents the real opportunity that investors should be talking about.

42391825,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwTl3,1701939027,"India Won't See Crypto or Web3 Bill for Another 18 Months, Senior Lawmaker Tells CoinDesk","India is unlikely to bring a crypto or Web3-specific legislative bill anytime soon and perhaps up to mid of 2025, said one of India's senior politicians, who oversees the financial evolution of the nation.  Jayant Sinha, Chair of the Standing Committee on Finance in India's Parliament and a Minister of Parliament from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was answering a question during a CoinDesk interview at India Blockchain Week in Bengaluru about when India could see a Web3-specific bill.  ""Regulators and policymakers are responsible, not just on the innovation side, which of course we want to encourage, but also on the safety side,"" Sinha said. ""We have to really find that balance and that balance is going to evolve over the next 12 to 18 months.""  Considerations for a crypto bill  Three specific considerations don't make it suitable for any crypto-specific bill to be introduced in parliament any time soon – considerations around evolving use cases in the space, the evolution of global standards given 2024 is the year of elections in India, U.S. and potentially U.K., and the emerging reality of industry evolution after the collapse of FTX and regulatory action against Binance.  ""I'm a bit of a broken record on this, which is whether it is Web3 or crypto, I want to first see the use cases that will really be powerful for India and that's point one,"" Sinha answered on a question from CoinDesk about when India could see a Web3-specific bill.  ""Point number two is global standards are still evolving and 2024 is the year of elections around the world. Many important countries, whether it's the U.S., the U.K., India, are going in for elections. So, I'm not sure in 2024 the standards will develop. We also have to see what's going to emerge from the (crypto) meltdown about whether some of these companies are going to survive,"" Sinha opined.  India's position on crypto came under increased scrutiny after Sept. 2023, when it pushed the G20 during its presidency to accept global guidelines for crypto without having its own legislation in place. India has kept a crypto bill in cold storage since 2021 but did indicate it will decide its position in the coming months. However, that position is unlikely to come through in the form of a bill at least in 2024, Sinha's remarks suggest.  Instead, India is likely to bank on a string of policy decisions that act as a defacto regulatory framework for the space and also align with the Financial Stability Board's recommendations by end-2025, Indian officials have told CoinDesk previously. India has already brought in anti-money laundering rules and a tax structure for crypto and that may be enough, an official told CoinDesk in August.  ""Cautious about crypto""  Sinha reiterated concerns sounded by India's central bank around crypto.  ""In India where we have capital controls when you can't freely trade the rupee for us to enable crypto assets is not really feasible,"" Sinha said. ""Unlike other economies like Singapore, or Korea or the US that have freely tradable currencies, and can get into crypto with a lot less trepidation. As far as India is concerned, we have to be very, very careful, very, very cautious when we talk about crypto. But crypto friends is just one use case for what is a revolutionary set of technologies that underlie Web3.""  Sinha also encouraged the audience which was made up of Web3 entrepreneurs, developers and enthusiasts in the space to propose a white paper or regulatory framework for India to consider.

Egrag’s analysis looks at the 12-hour chart of the XRP/USD trading pair, where a trend channel breakout could trigger a short-term buy signal. XRP Price Breakout Imminent? According to the crypto analyst, the price has recently been moving within a descending channel (DC). Now, XRP is at an inflection point that could have a significant impact on its price. Egrag has identified the structure as “DC B”, a bearish pattern where the asset has formed lower highs and lower lows. A key focus of Egrag’s analysis is XRP’s interaction with this pattern. Since the beginning of the chart pattern, the price has twice touched the upper trend line, which serves as resistance, and twice touched the lower trend line, which serves as support. Related Reading: XRP Price: Crypto Analyst Anticipates 65,000% Rally Signal Today Currently, the XRP price is about to retest the upper line of the trend channel for a third time. Should it succeed in breaking out of the downtrend channel, this would be an extremely bullish sign. From mid-July to the end of October, the price was already in a descending channel, which Egrag refers to as “DC A” in the chart. After XRP broke out of the downward channel A, the price rallied by over 50%. Something similar could happen now if history repeats itself. Egrag explained, “XRP seems to be mirroring its previous price action within a descending channel (DC). Check out the chart below to see how price is attempting to break out of DC B. The next challenge for XRP is to surpass descending channel B to reach Fib 0.5.” What’s Next? Should a breakout succeed, the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.7529 would be the next major resistance in Egrag’s chart. An upward breakout above this level could indicate the start of a trend reversal that could drive the price towards the $1.30 to $1.50 range. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Skyrocket 1,100% On This Signal: Crypto Analyst “A breakthrough past the 0.5 Fibonacci level hints at upward momentum, signaling a shift from a downtrend to a potential uptrend, instilling confidence. Pay close attention: Fib 0.5 at a price target of 0.7529c could be the gateway to a potential move towards 1.3-1.5$,” Egrag explains, suggesting that such a move would be an important indicator for traders. In conclusion, Egrag advises investors to keep a close eye on trading volume and overall market sentiment, as these factors will play a crucial role in the asset’s ability to reach and exceed these crucial levels. At press time, XRP traded at $0.63959.

Geometric Energy announced the DOGE-1 satellite in May 2021 as the payload of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket originally scheduled for 2022. The mission has been paid for entirely in dogecoin [DOGE] – a dog-themed meme coin that enjoys SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s vocal backing.  SpaceX has since received the requisite regulatory approvals to clear the launch, finally bringing DOGE-1 a step closer to reality, according to Geometric Energy founder Samuel Reid.  DOGE-1 is one of the two dogecoin-related missions planned in the coming months.  Earlier this month, Dogecoin developers said a physical dogecoin token could reach the moon in a space payload mission planned by Pittsburg-based firm Astrobotic.

We haven’t seen a ton of signal whether that’s a compelling enough thing to sell 50,000 units,” he said, saying that this was the magic number to determine the success of the phone.  ""I think 25,000 to 50,000 units to feel like there is a hardcore user base for developers to be compelled to ship applications,"" he continued.  The phone first went on sale earlier this year, and in August, its price was cut to $599 from $1000.  Yakovenko noted during the interview that advancements in mobile interfaces, particularly Progressive Web Apps and pass keys, have significantly reduced the gap between specialized and regular smartphones.  ""Progressive Web Apps bypass the App Store so developers don't need to pay the fees. They kind of have that side-loading feature even on iOS now,"" he continued.  Crypto phones have been previously tried by some companies but have seen limited success outside of their cult followers. Phone maker names from the big – HTC – to the small – Sirin Labs have previously failed in their efforts to create a crypto-forward smartphone.  Meanwhile, Yakovenko also said that he doesn't use his Solana Saga phone as his primary device.  ""I flip between this one and my iPhone because I've got too many business apps and stuff and connections,"" he said. ""So it's hard for me to support all the security certificates and stuff like that are kind of hooked up to my iPhone.""  The Saga phone is ""my NFT phone,"" he continued.

21145387,http://blokt.com/?p=37928,1701936048,A Beginner’s Guide to Monero – What Is XMR? [Updated 2023],"In celebration of Monero’s five successful years since launch, I’ve put together a short introductory guide to Monero . Monero’s goal is beautifully simple: a usable cryptocurrency for everyday payments, that functions as users expect . This includes protecting users from network attacks, large-scale surveillance, and most importantly being accessible anywhere. History Monero , ticker symbol XMR , was founded on April 18, 2014, by a Bitcointalk forum user operating under the alias “ thankful_for_today .” The project initially called ‘ Bitmonero ’ was a fresh launch of the ByteCoin and CryptoNote protocols, using their code base. Although ByteCoin and the CryptoNote technology it was based on had its flaws, it was one of the best privacy solutions available at the time, and subsequently, it attracted many developers and researchers. Shortly after CryptoNote’s creation, the core team forked the project away from the original creator, who wished to continue the project in ways the rest of the community disagreed with. Monero – Private Digital Currency Monero launched with poor mining code, relatively weak privacy, and many other limitations . Over the years, Monero has improved its protocol to make it more robust. Monero added RingCT for much better privacy, set minimum ring sizes , created a vulnerability response process , and implemented bulletproofs . Now, Monero has succeeded in building one of the largest open-source communities in blockchain and developed a mindset of continual improvement to tackle future challenges. Since its humble beginnings on the Bitcointalk forum, it’s risen through the rankings to count itself among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and is perhaps the most successful privacy coins to date. So, how have the developers, team members, and the wider community helped contribute to making Monero such a successful project? Developers and Community Monero has one of the most active development teams and community . Monero is stewarded by the Core Team , an unregistered organization that handles merge requests and maintains basic community infrastructure. Although the Core Team participates in discussions and helps set the vision , they do not make unilateral decisions . Decisions are usually made on GitHub issues, GitHub pulls requests and IRC meetings. Monero Community The community organizes into semi-autonomous workgroups based on function. Examples include the Community Workgroup , Research Lab , Malware Response Workgroup , Localization Workgroup, and Outreach Workgroup. Users are encouraged to join existing workgroups or to start their own . There is no shortage of work that the Monero project needs help with! Users and developers are encouraged to ask questions on the Monero StackExchange . Monero has the third most active StackExchange site of any cryptocurrency, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s a great resource, and we need the help of all our community members to answer questions. Privacy-Preserving Technology Monero is unique in that it is not built on Bitcoin’s code . Instead, it began with the CryptoNote protocol, but it has changed so much over the years that it is essentially its own platform. Monero is by far the largest cryptocurrency built on this code . Monero provides its transaction privacy in three ways: hiding the receiver, sender, and amount. Monero – Privacy Preserving Technology There is no way to send a Monero transaction that is completely public on-chain. Instead, users can share the view key with select parties to reveal details of the transaction if needed. This group can be as small or large as necessary. Firstly, Monero hides all addresses by using a stealth address system . Users essentially receive funds in one-time-use safety deposit boxes that only they can open. No other person knows which boxes are assigned to them or how much they hold (if anything). Likewise, Monero hides the sender by obscuring the source of funds. Ring signatures hide the true spent outputs (these boxes) among others in the blockchain. Furthermore, since these outputs are not associated with specific addresses, observers cannot tell what addresses these outputs are associated with either. Instead, nodes see that transactions are sent from possible sources of funds, which are themselves references to very little. Stealth addresses and ring signatures work together to hide the transaction graph effectively . Finally, Monero hides the amount with ring confidential transactions (RingCT). RingCT is based on confidential transactions for Bitcoin. Despite its name, this technology merely hides the transaction amount , not all transaction details. Luckily, Monero’s other defenses come to the rescue. Monero Mining Additionally, Monero has an accessible proof of work mining algorithm that is mineable on CPUs and GPUs. It has an adaptive block size to accommodate large spikes in transaction volume without growing unnecessarily or being trapped in an arbitrary constraint. Monero supports pruning , allowing old transactions to be cut down to about two-fifths of their size. Monero’s privacy, security, and scaling are always improving . Purchasing and Spending Monero Monero is a cryptocurrency with high utilit y and is meant to be used first and foremost for daily transactions rather than held as a speculative investment or store of wealth. Monero can be bought and sold on many exchanges , including Circle, Poloniex, Binance , Bisq, Bitfinex, and Kraken. Users should make sure that your investment in Monero is also an investment in the community ; consider supporting the fundamentals that give the asset value by donating to various community projects at the Community Crowdfunding System . Monero Community Crowdfunding System So, where can you spend Monero? As you may imagine, many of the services which accept XMR are also privacy-focused or are in an industry where users may wish to protect their identities . For example, there are a number of crypto casino websites which accept XMR, including CryptoLotto, Bitsler, and MoneroDice; as well as a number of VPN providers, e-cigarette providers, and privacy hardware merchants. However, it’s not purely privacy-focused services which accept Monero . You can even spend XMR on premium Thai coffee beans from Justroasted, buy portable solar panels from Mobisun, or get crypto themed clothing. Additionally, as Blokt previously reported, Fortnite players can also spend their Monero on the online merchandise store, to buy player skins, weapon mods, and more. Monero Wallets You’ve decided you want to buy Monero, but how do you store it? There are a number of options for users looking to securely store their XMR, including an official wallet for Windows, Max, Linux, and FreeBSD. All source code for these wallets is available on GitHub . Monero Wallets It should be noted that downloading the official Monero wallet will require users to sync the entire blockchain to their machine . For users who prefer a lite wallet, which is comparatively much quicker to set up, there are a few wallets which are officially recognized by trusted Monero community members. These include Cake Wallet, Monerujo , and Edge wallet for iOS and Android, or MyMonero for desktop users. Likewise, there’s a dedicated hardware wallet in the works for XMR, funded in part by Monero’s huge community, which would be a Ledger or Trezor type device focused on secure storage of XMR. How Can You Learn More About Monero? Monero has many community resources, but one of the best is a free copy of Mastering Monero . This is a good introductory guide for beginners and developers. Those interested in jumping into the granular details can also read Zero to Monero . How can you learn more about Monero? The Monero Community Workgroup holds monthly virtual Coffee Chats where users can ask questions and listen to the latest news.

Over 1,000 bitcoins from an early miner were moved to trading desks and custodian services on Dec. 4, on-chain data firm CryptoQuant shared with CoinDesk in a Thursday report. These tokens were previously moved 13 years ago, between August and November 2010, and were mined from block rewards at an estimated total cost of $100.

These bitcoin holdings have a market value of $40 million at current prices.

In July, a wallet that had been dormant for 11 years transferred $30 million worth of the asset to other wallets, while in August, another wallet transferred 1,005 BTC to a new address.  Such activity comes amid renewed optimism for bitcoin adoption as prices have more than doubled on a year-to-date basis.  It's believed bitcoin's price has been rising dramatically over the last few weeks because of anticipation around the approval of a possible spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S., traders pricing in expected rate cuts in the U.S. – which buoys risky bets such as technology stocks and bitcoin – and possible sovereign adoption as bitcoin-friendly leaders take the helm in major economies.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/07/early-bitcoin-miner-apparently-sent-1000-satoshi-era-btc-to-trading-desks-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1015dde522ef326b0be42591a52370d74f450a3f-6070x4047.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Short on time? Go straight to our top pick. For the best all-around Bitcoin betting experience, FortuneJack is our top pick. Play on FortuneJack Now Now, Bitcoin is shaking up the way we place bets – lowering fees, shortening withdrawal times, and making foreign exchange fees a thing of the past. Scroll down to view our list of the best Bitcoin sports betting sites of 2023. But there are so many bitcoin sport betting sites to choose from, that sometimes it’s impossible to find one which is secure, fun to play, and offers a wide variety of sports to bet on. That’s why we’ve reviewed five of the top bitcoin betting sites for 2023, and we’re going to give you our complete breakdown of their pros and cons. But first, let’s take a quick look at what Bitcoin sports betting is, and why you should give it a try! What is Bitcoin Sports Betting? Like crypto gambling and bitcoin casinos , sports betting (also known as sportsbook) lets you gamble and place bets with cryptocurrencies. The most popular crypto used for betting is Bitcoin, however, there are multiple operators that let you place bets with a variety of cryptocurrencies. Just like placing bets on traditional sportsbook operators, such as Coral or William Hill, Bitcoin sports betting lets players place a bet on the outcome of a real-world sporting event. When we say ‘real-world’, we mean any event played competitively between two or more players – because as we’ll find out a little later, you can also use Bitcoin betting to speculate on video game tournaments, or ‘Esports’. Sometimes, bet makers will let players place wagers on other events, such as the outcome of an election, the results of reality TV series, or even the weather. Bitcoin sports betting generally offers lower or non-existent fees for deposits and withdrawals, much faster transaction processing times, and greater transparency. This means that players will often get their winnings instantly, without waiting days for withdrawals like on many traditional betting sites. There are also huge benefits to those who want to protect their privacy online, as most Bitcoin betting websites won’t require personal or payment information from you in order to start playing.

FortuneJack FortuneJack’s sportsbook is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world. Established in 2014, FortuneJack is a hybrid crypto casino and bitcoin betting site, with a massively popular sportsbook feature. Self-styled as the “number one” bitcoin betting and gambling site, FortuneJack is indeed one of the largest and best-known crypto gambling sites on the web, attracting thousands of users every day. Unfortunately, FortuneJack restricts access to players from the United Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and the United States – although you may be able to bypass these restrictions with a VPN . At the time of writing, December 2023, FortuneJack is hosting daily rewards, challenges, and other activities as part of a New Years festivities event. Which Cryptos Does FortuneJack Support? You can only place bets on FortuneJack using cryptocurrency. There are no other ways to credit your account, so if you want to start using the site, make sure you know how to buy Bitcoin – if you don’t, follow our guide here . One of the features many players love about FortuneJack is their huge number of supported crypto assets, which is particularly useful if you have a lot of crypto dust leftover in your wallets. These include: Bitcoin Ethereum Dash (DASH) Litecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) Monero (XMR) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Tron Zcash (ZEC) Many of the sites on our list accept a range of different cryptos, which is handy for those who also hold digital assets as a speculative investment – as some days it might make more sense to place a bet with an alt-coin rather than Bitcoin, or vice versa. FortuneJack Sportsbook Place bets on FIFA, the Premier League, UEFA and more on FortuneJack. FortuneJack has a hugely comprehensive sportsbook feature, with access to more games and tournaments than most people probably ever knew existed! Players can place bets on popular football leagues from around the world, such as FIFA, the Premier League, and national leagues like the German Bundesliga and the Belarusian Premier League. There are also betting opportunities for other popular sports, such as American football NFL leagues, the NBA basketball league, tennis matches, and baseball. If niche sports are your favorite to place bets on, you won’t be disappointed. FortuneJack offers plenty of choices, including: Cycling Golf Snooker Darts Volleyball Badminton Handball There’s also the opportunity to bet on cultural events, such as upcoming elections, reality TV results, and much more at different times of the year. With such a large variety of events to choose from, it’s easy to see why FortuneJack has become the most popular Bitcoin betting platform. Is FortuneJack Safe? As one of the longest-serving sportsbooks and bitcoin casinos, FortuneJack has built a solid reputation for transparency and safety, both with users’ funds and with the stability of their betting platform. Deposits and withdrawals are processed instantly on FortuneJack, which is great news following a big win, or when you’re racing to place your bets ahead of a match – there’s no waiting for lengthy bank transfers, and FortuneJack never withholds your winnings. FortuneJack Verdict Not only is FortuneJack easy to sign-up and get started with, but it’s also one of the safest and most well-established crypto betting sites – easy to use even for beginners. Although FortuneJack doesn’t offer Esports betting, it’s Bitcoin sports betting is one of the most comprehensive and feature-rich in the world. We don’t feel that a lack of Esports makes FortuneJack any less enticing – in fact, it’s the perfect Bitcoin sports betting site for those who know exactly which sports games they want to place a bet on, and want the opportunity to do it in Bitcoin. Play on FortuneJack Now 2. CloudBet Cloudbet has a traditional sportsbook betting interface and plenty of game choice. CloudBet is one of the longest-serving Bitcoin sports betting and casino sites, launched in 2013. The site offers traditional sports betting, Esports, and a large Bitcoin casino which you can read more about here . The site has recently started offering Bitcoin betting on Esports matches, which has made the site hugely popular, and seriously enhanced the betting experience CloudBet offers. While CloudBet used to be a true Bitcoin betting site, supporting just two cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and one of its early forks, Bitcoin Cash, it has now expanded its support with many additional cryptos added. CloudBet now supports BTC, ETH, BCH, USDT, USDC, PAX, PAXG, LINK, DAI, DASH, DOGE, and LTC, along with even more new coins announced in February 2022: CloudBet Addition Of Crypto Coins announced on its blog CloudBet Sportsbook Choose from sports betting, esports, or casino games on Cloudbet. CloudBet was among the first operators to offer Bitcoin sports betting, with their sportsbook feature launching at the same time as their casino in 2013. Over the past seven years, CloudBet has constantly remained at the forefront of crypto sports betting, offering a huge range of sporting events and all major tournaments. Major tournaments players can bet on at CloudBet include: NBA basketball tournaments NFL American football Rugby Union matches UEFA and other major football tournaments Players can also place Bitcoin bets on darts, boxing, mixed martial arts, table tennis, and a huge range of other sports on CloudBet. One of the features we think is particularly useful is CloudBet’s ‘In-Play’ section. This view shows players every single live game taking place around the world, and while games are still in play, CloudBet users have the opportunity to place a bet with the latest odds. Odds are constantly changing for live games, indicated by green and red flashing bars on the odds table for each game. It’s quite an innovative feature, as it allows players to make the most of opportunities when odds suddenly change. CloudBet Esports Betting There’s a massive range of Esports matches on Cloudbet, including e-soccer! CloudBet’s range of Esports titles is outstanding, which is one of the key reasons the site still remains so popular even into 2023. Alongside all of the popular Esports titles that other sites offer, such as Dota 2, CS:GO, and League of Legends, CloudBet also lets players place bets on FIFA cyber matches, NBA cyber, and other niche Esports. The Bitcoin betting site has such a focus on Esports, that they’ve even launched their own dedicated Discord server to discuss upcoming tournaments, share tips about bets, and discuss the outcomes of games. Is Cloudbet Safe? It’s fair to say that Cloudbet has one of the most transparent and trusted user safety protocols of any Bitcoin sportsbook. As we mentioned, Cloudbet is one of the oldest Bitcoin gambling sites, staying true to its roots in the early blockchain scene and sticking to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. When you trust your assets with Cloudbet, they use their hard-earned expertise to keep your funds safe. They achieve this through dedicated cold storage wallets, which keep your funds offline in highly secure hardware wallets, virtually impervious to would-be attackers and Bitcoin thieves. Cloudbet only uses hot wallets to process user withdrawals, moving just a fraction of their player’s pool of assets online at any one time. This protects each user against losses, even in the event of an attack. Cloudbet Verdict There’s a reason this veteran Bitcoin gambling site has powered on all the way into 2023 – it’s a feature-rich site with a massive range of popular sports, Esports, and unique games to bet on. If you’re an Esports fan who likes to feel part of the action, then Cloudbet is definitely the place for you, why not check out their Discord server to see which games are in play right now? Built by blockchain experts, Cloudbet can easily claim to be one of the safest destinations to bet using Bitcoin, and its transparency on fund security is refreshing. Play on CloudBet Now 3. Sportsbet.io With a license in both the United Kingdom as a standard betting site, and in Curaçao for Bitcoin betting, Sportsbet.io is one of the leading Bitcoin gambling and casino sites. The site is owned by mBet Solutions, the same provider that runs Bitcasino.io, a highly popular crypto gambling site. The Sportsbet.io team has years of experience delivering sportsbook solutions to traditional fiat betting, and now they’ve pivoted to provide betting solutions for Bitcoin holders. Sportsbet.io accepts players from multiple jurisdictions and offers free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals. Which Cryptos Does Sportsbet.io Support?

Players can deposit and play with the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Litecoin (LTC) Tron (TRX) Ripple (XRP) Tether (USDT) It’s easy to create an account on Sportsbet, and all you need to provide is your email to get started – so there’s no need to reveal your personal information.

With one of the largest sportsbook features of any Bitcoin betting site, Sportsbet.io offers some of the best opportunities for players who enjoy betting on anything from huge football matches to chess tournaments, or even horse racing. Sportsbook.io has created an attractive and easy-to-use Bitcoin sports betting platform, which has one of the best user interfaces out of all the Bitcoin betting sites. Along the top of the site, there’s an easy-to-navigate bar where players can access all of the sports betting options. It’s easy to see the odds of any bet, and players can also place multiple bets at one time using Sportsbet’s ‘Multibet’ feature – which makes it quite easy to set all your bets for the day at once. Sportsbet.io Esports Esports stands for ‘electronic sports’, and covers any game or tournament played through video games rather than a traditional ‘real-life’ game. A huge and growing spectator sport, in 2019 an estimated 1.57 billion people watched at least one Esports match. These multiplayer games, where single players or teams compete for huge cash prizes, are becoming a popular game type to place bets on, and cryptocurrency lends itself particularly well to this new digital sport. Sportsbet.io were among the first Bitcoin betting sites in the world to offer players bets on Esports titles, first for eSoccer – virtual football games played around the world – and more recently they’ve added a whole host of other popular Esports titles. Now, Sportsbet offers multiple major Esports games that players can place a bet on, including: CounterStrike: GO (CS:GO) Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA 2) King of Glory League of Legends Rainbow Six StarCraft 2 Placing a bet on an Esports game is similar to other real-life sports betting, and players can also place bets mid-game through Sportsbet. Is Sportsbet.io Safe? As part of the mBit group, Sportsbet.io is considered one of the most professional and safe Bitcoin sports betting sites in the world. The site is registered in the Isle of Man and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission – one of the strictest and most trusted gambling regulatory bodies in the world, so customers can rest assured that they are protected when playing. Likewise, Sportsbet’s regulated nature means it’s open to players in the United Kingdom through the Sportsbetio.uk site, which many other Bitcoin betting sites aren’t. If you need a hand, Sportsbet.io offers 24/7 live chat support to all customers. Sportsbet.io Verdict Sportsbet.io is a feature-rich Bitcoin betting site, with plenty of game options, tournaments, Esports, and sportsbook features to keep players entertained. The winning feature of Sportsbook.io has to be its regulation status. As one of the few Bitcoin betting sites registered and regulated in the UK, it’s not only one of the safest sites, but it’s also open to UK players without jumping through hoops – a huge plus. Play on Sportsbet.io Now 4. Stake.com A new competitor, Stake.com have created one of the best user experiences in Bitcoin betting. Launched in 2017, Stake.com is one of the youngest Bitcoin sportsbook sites on our list. The site offers a massive range of Bitcoin sports betting, as well as a casino section dedicated to crypto gambling, with a decent range of games. Originally a pure Bitcoin casino, Stake.com launched its brand-new sportsbook feature in December 2019 after signing a two-year deal with Sportradar – a leading sports data company based in Switzerland – to license their Betradar software. Players will immediately notice that Stake.com is one of the most modern-looking and visually-appealing Bitcoin betting sites, with a really simple and intuitive user interface – making this Bitcoin sportsbook site perfect for beginners. So, is this newcomer to the Bitcoin betting space poised to be a serious competitor in the future? Let’s find out. Which Cryptos Does Stake.com Support? Like some of the other crypto betting sites on our list, Stake.com only supports payments in cryptocurrencies on their site – there are currently no ways to credit your account in fiat. But, players can credit their account in a range of cryptocurrencies, including: Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin Ripple Tron BitcoinCash To start playing, you only have to provide a username, password, and email address, so there’s no need to give away your personal information if you’d rather preserve your privacy. Alternatively, you can easily signup with Facebook, Google, or Twitch. Stake.com Sportsbook Stake.com has plenty of tournaments to choose from on its sportsbook. As Stake.com’s sportsbook is operated by Betradar, there’s always live games and plenty of betting options to choose from. Because of their partnership, even though Stake’s sportsbook feature is brand-new, it’s incredibly well designed and easy to use. Likewise, all of the game data is pulled directly from Betradar, providing one of the most up-to-the-minute coverage of all major sporting events. Stake.com also regularly has betting bonuses, such as double winnings on certain games, which are fairly rare among the other Bitcoin betting sites we’ve looked at. Stake.com Esports Betting Bet big on your favorite Esports tournaments with Stake.com. If you’re a big Esports fan, then Stake.com is well worth checking out. The site features some huge Esports leagues and tournaments from some of the leading competitive games in the world. The full list of Esports tournaments you can bet on at Stake.com includes: Counter-Strike Dota 2 League of Legends King of Glory Rainbow Six Starcraft Is Stake.com Safe? Stake.com is a Crypto Gambling Foundation verified operator, which is committed to providing provably fair and transparent betting. There’s no mention of how users’ funds are stored safely on Stake.com, however, its partnership with Sportradar, one of the industry’s largest sports betting operators, is a good sign that the betting site takes its technology seriously. Nevertheless, as Stake.com is still a fairly new and unproven Bitcoin betting site, players should use caution before transferring a large amount of crypto to the platform. Stake.com Verdict It’s still early days for Stake.com’s sportsbook, but overall the betting site is shaping up to be one of the most exciting places to place bets in Bitcoin. We really loved Stake.com’s interface, which was no-frills and easy to navigate, great for beginners or experienced users alike. With its professional backing by Sportradar, Stake.com is sure to continue innovating and providing quality sportsbook content over the next couple of years. Play on Stake.com Now 5. 1xBit 1xBit.com is a feature-rich Bitcoin betting site with some unique betting options. Established in 2016, 1xBit.com has grown into one of the most popular destinations for crypto sports betting, mainly due to its huge range of supported cryptocurrencies and massive event coverage. Bets on 1xBit.com are placed entirely in cryptocurrency, and there’s currently no way to place bets using fiat, but this is perfect for those looking to preserve their privacy. 1xBit.com offers no-fee deposits and withdrawals for players, an attractive feature that makes betting with Bitcoin an even more cost-effective way to play. Which Cryptos Does 1xBit Support? There’s a huge range of crypto’s supported on 1xBit, over 20 in total, including large market cap cryptos such as: Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Ethereum (ETH) Monero (XMR) Litecoin (LTC) Dash (DASH) Ripple (XRP) Users can also credit their account with smaller market cap coins like NEM and Verge, and even stablecoins such as Tether (USDT). Players can deposit through LocalBitcoins.com, Crex24, CoinCheck, NovaDAX, Luno, and over 50 other crypto payment providers. 1xBit Sportsbook Gamer’s looking to place a bet on a sporting match will be spoilt for choice on 1xBit, with a massive variety of both popular and niche games to bet on. 1xBit enables Bitcoin betting on major sporting events such as football, tennis, rugby, basketball, and American football, but also other game types which have typically been favorites among bettors, including: Horse racing Greyhound racing Boxing UFC tournaments Motorsports Golf Cricket Darts There’s also plenty of other niche sports players can place bets on, like surfing, hurling, sailing, chess, and water polo to name a few. In total, 1xBit offers Bitcoin sports betting on over 30 different sporting events. Special Bitcoin Betting on 1xBit Another popular feature of 1xBit is their sometimes weird and wonderful collection of specialty betting opportunities, some of which can’t be found anywhere else! These include crazy wagers such as ‘Company to put human beings on Mars first?’, where players can bet big on the likes of SpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing, or the US Space Force; or even totally out of this world bets such as the discovery that the Earth is flat by 2025! However, 1xBit’s bets aren’t all that crazy. There are also some very timely and relevant betting opportunities, such as whether there will be a creation of a COVID-19 vaccine by May 2022, or whether Eminem will appear to give a 30-minute video concert to his fans during Coronavirus lockdown. The huge number of specialty bets is a unique feature, which makes 1xBit.com stand out among competitors, despite having many of the same Esports and sports titles. 1xBit Esports Betting 1xBit.com provides a massive range of Esports betting. Like other bitcoin betting sites on our list, 1xBit.com also offers players the opportunity to place bets on Esports matches. 1xBit features betting for both electronic versions of traditional sports, like football tournaments and basketball, and also a huge range of video game tournaments – over 300 separate leagues to choose from at the time of writing. There cover most major Esports titles, including: CS:GO DOTA 2 King of Glory League of Legends Overwatch Rainbow Six StarCraft 2 Is 1xBit Safe? There’s not much information about 1xBit’s safety practices and fund custody on its site, which may be a little off-putting at first. However, we think the betting site, which has been running for over four years without a security breach, is generally a safe and secure site to use, with good user reviews overall. It’s also very easy to get hold of a 1xBit customer service representative through its live chat feature, which is very useful if you run into an issue while placing a bet. 1xBit Verdict If you’re a more advanced Bitcoin betting enthusiast, then you’re probably going to love 1xBit.com. Its massive range of betting options really goes above and beyond the standard Bitcoin sports betting, so it’s suitable for regular players looking for something a little different. However, as 1xBit.com is quite crypto-heavy, and offers a lot of different betting options, it’s probably going to be a little overwhelming for players who are brand-new to the Bitcoin betting world. We also think that 1xBit’s interface is a little busy, with many major features slightly harder to find than other sites. Play on 1xBit Now Which Is the Best Bitcoin Betting Site for You? So, who takes home the crown? Let’s take a look at which site comes out on top for a few different features, and then name an overall winner. Largest Variety of Betting Options If you’re looking for Bitcoin betting with a little more variety, you’re going to want to check out 1xBit.com . We highly recommend their special betting types, which are totally unique and definitely sure to inject a little bit of fun into your betting experience! Similarly, 1xBit.com has the most supported cryptos of any site on our list. If you’re an alt-coin maximalist, or you don’t want to spend your Bitcoin, you can still access 1xBit’s huge range of betting options through another digital asset. Overall, 1xBit.com wins for variety, but it’s mainly suited to experienced players. Easiest to Use FortuneJack is without a doubt one of the easiest Bitcoin sports betting sites to navigate and use. Their simple interface will be highly familiar to players who are already used to traditional betting sites, and it’s easy to place bets and create an account. Looks-wise, Stake.com has also created both an easily navigable and visually exciting betting site, which focuses on simplicity and usability – and it looks great on mobile too. There’s a handy button to show all live games in the top left-hand corner, which makes tracking the status of your open bets incredibly easy. Stake.com’s chat feature, which connects you with other live players on their site, is also a very fun feature that we think other bitcoin betting sites could learn from, and it’s a great way to pass the time while you’re waiting for a bet to settle or a match to finish. For beginners, Stake.com is a perfect choice, as the options are slightly more limited than FortuneJack, so you can learn the Bitcoin betting ropes with ease. For intermediate and advanced players, FortuneJack is definitely the perfect choice. Most Secure CloudBet is one of the most secure Bitcoin betting sites, guaranteeing high-level fund security for users deposits. Likewise, their long track record of delivering an excellent and safe sportsbook experience is a massive attraction to some users. We think that other Bitcoin sports betting sites could learn from CloudBet and be upfront with users about how funds are stored when they’re on the platform, as most other sites don’t communicate this – which could be off-putting for some crypto enthusiasts. FortuneJack is also a highly trusted and safe betting site, with an impeccable security record and a dedicated customer service team on hand to help with any issues. Which Is the Best Site for Sports Betting? For an all-around great Bitcoin sports betting experience, FortuneJack is our overall winner. Its position as one of the leading and most-trusted bitcoin betting sites has been solidified through access to a massive range of sports and tournaments, as well as a good variety of niche sports. Play on FortuneJack Now FortuneJack doesn’t currently have an Esports section, which is slightly disappointing given the growing popularity of video game tournaments, and the huge amount of spectators who tune-in globally to watch them. Nevertheless, it’s long-running position as the leading Bitcoin sportsbook, alongside its regular addition of innovative features and a seamless user experience, puts FortuneJack firmly in first place. If you’re looking to start your Bitcoin betting experience, we’d highly recommend giving FortuneJack a try! Disclosure: Blokt strives to provide transparent, honest reviews, and opinions.

According to the most recent data, the token’s trade volume has increased by more than 900% during the last 30 days. The ORDI coin has experienced a downward trend since its entry onto the market. It began trading at around $10 in June of this year and gradually dropped back to slightly less than $3 by mid-September. Related Reading: XRP Greed Index Soars, Backed By Robust $1.3 Billion Volume – Good For Price? Strong Performance: The BRC-20 Token ORDI The token’s decline marked the bottom and the beginning of the subsequent bull market, which drove the price up to its all-time high of $66 on November 5. The previous few days have seen a phenomenal increase in the price of ORDI, and since Bitcoin has recently performed well and crossed $44,000, ORDI is also rising quickly. ORDI price up an impressive 180% in the last week. Source: Coingecko The ORDI token, which is based on Bitcoin Ordinals, has achieved triple-digit monthly and weekly percentage growth, making it the first BRC-20 token to surpass a $1 billion market valuation. Tokens based on Bitcoin are comparatively new in the digital currency space. These tokens leverage the Bitcoin network to produce a variety of digital assets, in contrast to Bitcoin, which is mostly used as electronic money. This change broadens the use of blockchain applications beyond the initial intent of Bitcoin. Casey Rodarmor introduced the initial version of Bitcoin Ordinals in January. The protocol made it possible to add content to the blockchain of Bitcoin. Ordinals currently trading at $55.30 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com An important factor in the development of the two different types of tokens—fungible and non-fungible—was the introduction of the Ordinals mechanism. In particular, this creative process has played a significant role in the development of BRC-20 tokens, which are a class of fungible token with characteristics similar to those of Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard. Like BRC-20s, fungible tokens are interchangeable and frequently linked to simpler use cases, such as enabling different decentralized applications and transaction processing. Source: CoinCodex BRC-20 Coin ORDI And Bitcoin’s Resurgence Trading in Ordinals decreased significantly in October after reaching a peak in the preceding month, but it increased again once Binance declared it will list ORDI. The Ordinals Inscription Service, which Binance Pool introduced in August, makes it simpler for users to engrave extra data on the Bitcoin blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulldozes Past $44,000 – Is $45K Next This Week? Meanwhile, in the event that investors perceive the saturation and sell in order to book profits, the price of ORDI is expected to find some support at $60. Since the meme coin is now tracking the price movement of Bitcoin, eventually the rise in BTC will halt, which would prompt additional selling by investors seeking to validate their gains.

Dimon, well-known for speaking his mind, straightforwardly called for a complete ban on digital currencies, linking them to criminal activities without holding back. The CEO didn’t mince words at a Senate hearing alongside seven other big bank bosses: “If I was the government, I’d close it down.” In response to a question from Senator Elizabeth Warren, he stated that he was adamantly against all forms of crypto, including bitcoin. Dimon expressed worries that terrorists, drug dealers, and rogue states would use them as a means of finance and declared he would shut it down if he were in charge. Even though Dimon’s bank is deeply engaged in blockchain—the technology that powers the $1.6 trillion cryptocurrency industry—his comments are the most recent assault against the industry. Related Reading: XRP Greed Index Soars, Backed By Robust $1.3 Billion Volume – Good For Price? Dimon Bashes Crypto In earlier remarks, Dimon referred to bitcoin as “a hyped-up scam,” a term he subsequently withdrew. In addition, he had compared it to a “pet rock.” In spite of his subsequent admissions of remorse, he continued to use the term “decentralized Ponzi scheme” to describe bitcoin and other digital currencies following his previous tirades. Dimon and other banking leaders, including Brian Moynihan of Bank of America Corp., have asserted that their institutions have measures to stop terrorists and other criminals from utilizing them. In contrast, Warren advocated for the extension of anti-money-laundering regulations that banks presently enforce to digital assets, specifically the cryptocurrency market. Every single CEO expressed agreement. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.55 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com According to sources, JPMorgan completed its first blockchain-based collateral resolution as recently as October in a deal with BlackRock and Barclays. With its JPM Coin, a proprietary stablecoin that enables users to execute blockchain-based payments, JPMorgan was a pioneer in this space. JPMorgan said in the next two years, the token may handle up to $10 billion in daily transactions, up from its current level of about $1 billion. The price of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market valuation, has increased by more than 150% this year to about $44,000-plus, according to market tracker CoinMarketCap, despite calls for a government clampdown. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulldozes Past $44,000 – Is $45K Next This Week? Cryptocurrency Critique Unites Senator With Bankers Warren took advantage of the session to criticize the cryptocurrency sector by collaborating with Republicans and prominent bankers. Naturally, Dimon does not have the power of a government and cannot independently initiate the ban of cryptocurrencies. Being the leader of a private financial company, he may only make suggestions and voice opinions; he cannot implement significant policy changes. Nevertheless, it demonstrated an unusual convergence of interests between the crypto industry and the senator from Massachusetts, a long-time enemy of banks, who claimed that cryptocurrency was supporting illegal transactions. The price of bitcoin, the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency in the world, has increased by more than 150% this year and crossed the $44,000 barrier on Wednesday, according to the most recent market data, despite calls for a government shut down.

The price is trading above $43,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There are two bullish trend lines forming with support near $43,900 and $42,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely setting up for a fresh increase above the $44,000 level. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price started a major increase above the $42,000 resistance zone. BTC surged and even broke the $43,200 resistance zone. A new multi-month high was formed near $44,465 before the price started a minor downside correction. There was a move below the $44,000 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $39,475 swing low to the $44,465 high. However, the bulls remained active above the $43,200 support zone. Bitcoin also trades above $43,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Besides, there are two bullish trend lines forming with support near $43,900 and $42,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The second trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $39,475 swing low to the $44,465 high. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $44,250 level. The first major resistance is forming near $44,450, above which the price might rally toward the $45,000 level. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $45,000 resistance might send the price further higher. The next key resistance could be near $46,200, above which BTC could rise toward the $47,500 level. Short-term Dips In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $44,250 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $43,900 level and the trend line. The next major support is near $42,550, below which the price might test the second trend line. If there is a move below $42,000, there is a risk of more downsides. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $41,200 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $43,900, followed by $42,000.

42391842,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwcwN,1701916623,"Binance, SBF, ETH and Gensler Get Mentions at Republican Presidential Debate","Crypto got a mention at the Republican presidential debate Wednesday night held in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, when Vivek Ramaswamy was asked about his crypto policy.  The question directed towards Ramaswamy referenced the recent guilty plea of former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who was recently charged with breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws.  ""Fraudsters, criminals, and terrorists have been defrauding people for a long time,"" Ramaswamy began. ""Our regulations need to catch up with the current moment.""  ""The fact that SBF was able to do what he did FTX shows that whatever they have is the current framework isn't working,"" he continued.  Ramaswamy is one of the few politicians to specifically make crypto part of his campaign.  Ramaswamy announced a plan to drastically reduce the SEC workforce and relax regulations on the crypto industry, advocating for most cryptocurrencies to be treated as commodities outside the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) jurisdiction, CoinDesk recently reported.  ""It's nothing short of embarrassing that Gary Gensler, the SEC [chair], couldn't even confirm in front of Congress whether Ethereum is a regulated security,"" Ramaswamy said. ""This is another example of the administrative state going too far.""  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – who originally ran for president as a Democrat and is now a declared Independent – proposed exempting bitcoin from capital gains tax, backing the dollar with assets like gold and bitcoin, and supporting the right to self-custody bitcoin and run blockchain nodes, aiming to strengthen the dollar and encourage financial innovation and privacy.  Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) also got a mention during the debate, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis saying that they'll be ""dead on arrival"" if he's elected president. CBDCs were apparently one of the hottest issues in Florida's politics over the summer, with more phone calls reportedly coming into his office on the topic than the usual wedge issues.

21135587,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564253,1701914410,"Solana Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Wallets, SOL Back To $140?","Solana (SOL), the fourth-generation blockchain, has staged a remarkable comeback, looking at on-chain metrics. Citing Artemis data, Step Data Insights on X noted that Solana’s daily active wallets flipped Ethereum’s, the pioneer smart contract platform. This development is when SOL prices have been ripping past resistance levels in the past few months. Solana’s Resurgence Continues, Daily Active Wallets Flips Ethereum According to Step Data Insights, Solana’s daily active wallets currently hover at around 400,000, slightly edging past Ethereum’s. This spike in activity suggests that Solana is attracting a growing user base, and more people are keen to explore its ecosystems, comprising DeFi, NFTs, and other protocols. Additional data from Artemis shows that Solana also eclipses Ethereum in the number of daily transactions. Although Ethereum leads in DeFi total value locked (TVL), Solana’s low fee and scalable environment could explain why users opt for this high-performance network. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin Overall, the Solana recovery could triggered by recent favorable price action in Q4 2023. To quantify, Step Data Insights notes that SOL has risen by over 210% in the past three months. During this time, ETH’s gains have capped. The analytic platform states that the coin only rose by 39%. To illustrate, in the last three months, SOL rose from around $17 to peak at approximately $70. Meanwhile, ETH expanded from roughly $1,500 to peak at about $2,300, recorded on December 6. This recovery points to increasing investor confidence. However, time will tell whether SOL will extend gains in the sessions. From the daily chart, prices have been moving horizontally for the better part of H2 November to early December 2023. The immediate resistance line is at $70. With the SOL moving inside a bull flag, any upswing above November 2023 highs will be the building block for a possible leg-up that will lift SOL to April 2022 highs of $140. Spot Bitcoin ETF Hopes, Firedancer Lifting Solana Altcoins, including Solana, have been racing higher as the crypto market recovers. Following a court ruling, SOL is relatively firm despite the FTX estate being permitted to liquidate the coin in the secondary markets to repay creditors. Related Reading: Solana-Powered Helium (HNT) Spikes By 145%, Analyzing The Drivers Of The Surge Hopes of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the first Bitcoin ETF have also benefited Solana. However, the recent release of Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, on testnet has supported SOL. The client will make the network more resilient and performant. Firedancer will go live in the H1 2024. Once it goes live, the new client is expected to improve Solana’s reliability.

21132325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564260,1701907203,Bitcoin Poised For December Surge As Historical Patterns Suggest Strong Upside Ahead,"As the eagerly awaited Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) verdict approaches, excitement and anticipation continue to grow in the cryptocurrency market. According to a report by K33 Research, the upcoming decision, expected between January 8 and January 10, has been a significant factor behind Bitcoin’s positive momentum since October. Institutional demand remains robust, with traditional investors strongly interested in adding long BTC exposure. Bitcoin Set For Bullish December? Bitcoin has displayed a notable tendency to surge higher in the lead-up to major events, creating a sense of enthusiasm and driving prices upward. This phenomenon has been observed across various significant milestones in the cryptocurrency’s history. According to the report, examples include Bitcoin’s peak coinciding with the launch of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) BTC futures in 2017, its spike coinciding with Coinbase’s public listing in April 2021, and its peak on the day El Salvador declared Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. Similarly, Bitcoin reached its peak on the date of VanEck’s spot ETF deadline in November 2021. These instances highlight the potential for Bitcoin to experience significant price movements as the ETF verdict draws near.

BTC exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed inflows of nearly 40,000 BTC in November, while CME open interest reached and maintained all-time highs. Futures premiums have also surged to 20%, indicating the strong interest from institutional players. In contrast, retail participation has shown signs of stagnation. Offshore flows have remained shallow, and Bitcoin-denominated open interest in BTC perpetual contracts is currently at yearly lows. These factors suggest that institutional flows continue to be the driving force behind Bitcoin’s solid market strength. Based on the historical pattern of event-driven price movements and the sustained institutional demand, the report maintains a positive outlook for Bitcoin in December. As the ETF verdict approaches, K33 Research’s report suggests that the narrowing time window is expected to fuel enthusiasm and drive prices higher. However, it is worth noting that once the event occurs, prices may experience a temporary surge before potentially stabilizing, according to the report. BTC’s Bull Run Indicator Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a significant development in the Bitcoin market that suggests a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. According to Martinez, the Realized Price of Bitcoin has surpassed the Long-Term Holder Realized Price, signaling an increase in market momentum and attracting new investors willing to purchase Bitcoin at higher prices. Martinez’s analysis highlights that similar occurrences in the past have preceded substantial price surges, further fueling optimism regarding Bitcoin’s future performance. The Realized Price of Bitcoin refers to the average price at which all previously transacted coins were acquired. It considers the price at which each Bitcoin unit was last moved on the blockchain. On the other hand, the Long-Term Holder Realized Price focuses specifically on coins held by long-term investors, providing insights into their average acquisition price. When the Realized Price surpasses the Long-Term Holder’s Realized Price, it suggests that newer investors are entering the market and are willing to buy Bitcoin at higher valuations.

Specifically, the cryptocurrency surged 12,736%, 4,474%, and 819%, respectively, following similar events. In addition to Martinez’s bullish outlook for BTC, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has demonstrated relatively stable price action above $44,000 in the past hour. This stability increases the potential for continued upside and consolidation above key levels, positioning Bitcoin for further gains and surges in the future. It remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency will see any corrections following its impressive 16% surge over the past few days.
