In a recent client note, published by finance blog Zero Hedge, chief technician Sheba Jafari, offered his view on the digital currency. It's a rare moment for Goldman, which doesn't regularly cover developments around bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.  In a recent market color report on June 12, the banking giant suggested its investor clients to be cautious about a near-term high bitcoin price of $3,134. Further, Jafari suggested that clients consider the market bullish again when the price falls to between $2,330 and $1,915.  Jafari wrote:  ""It's on track to forming a bearish key day reversal if today's (June 12) close settles below 2,749. It will also form a key week version if Friday's close is below 2,475. Both daily/weekly oscillators are diverging negatively. All of this to say that the balance of signals are looking broadly heavy.""  The note comes amid record-breaking highs for bitcoin, which briefly surpassed the $3,000 mark this week, as well as cryptocurrencies like ether, which touched $400 last weekend.  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $3,018.55 on June 11, only to fall to a recent low of $2571.32 on June 12 at 18:00 UTC.

42400008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPmf,1497375311,Bitcoin Developers Publish BIP For 'Dandelion' Privacy Project,"Researchers looking to beef up bitcoin’s privacy features have released a new proposal on GitHub.  Dubbed ‘Dandelion’, the project has been pitched as a privacy-enhancing modification to bitcoin's transaction propagation mechanism. First launched in January this year, Dandelion is currently running on the bitcoin testnet for trial and feedback. More information can be found in the official Bitcoin Improvement Proposal here.  According to an email on the bitcoin development mailing list written by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, the project is aimed at obscuring the original source IP of each bitcoin transaction by breaking the transaction proceeds into two phases: ""stem"" and ""fluff"".  As Miller explained:  ""During the stem phase, each node relays the transaction to a single peer. After a random number of hops along the stem, the transaction enters the fluff phase, which behaves just like ordinary transaction flooding/diffusion. Even when an attacker can identify the location of the fluff phase, it is much more difficult to identify the source of the stem.""  According to the letter, Dandelion's backers also include a faculty member from University of Illinois, Pramod Viswanath; two graduate students, Surya Bakshi, Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan; and one post-doctoral student, Giulia Fanti.  The work has taken place amidst the wider backdrop of development around privacy improvements, a goal to which projects such as MimbleWimble have advanced in recent months.

42399992,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPar,1497367802,Wanted: Police Seek Six OneCoin Promoters in India,"Police in Mumbai have issued a look-out notice as they seek the arrest of six individuals connected to OneCoin, the digital currency scheme widely believed to be fraudulent.  The Hindu reported earlier this week that four Indians and two Bulgarians are wanted in connection with a widening investigation into OneCoin. The scheme's backers are accused of duping local investors through events, sparking a series of arrests in April.  The investigation is said to be lead by the Economic Offense Wing, which has issued look-out notices – used to alert immigration border checks to keep an eye out for certain individuals – in the past during its OneCoin investigation.  ""If any of these six accused either try to fly out or come back to the country, we will be able to nab them,"" Shivaji Awate, senior police inspector with the Economic Offense Wing, said in a statement.  India isn't the only country seeking to stymie OneCoin.  Germany effectively banned the scheme's promoters from the country in April, a move that closely followed the forced closure of a payment processor connected to OneCoin. BaFin, Germany's top finance watchdog, also froze bank accounts containing €29m as part of that crackdown.

42400000,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPfm,1497364213,BIP 148 + SegWit2x? A Bitcoin Scaling Compromise Might Not Be So Easy,"Could two of bitcoin's more polarizing scaling proposals unite?  As demand for alternative blockchain assets continues to grow, some technologists are starting to wonder if a more collaborative means of solving one of the network's long-perceived problems could be achieved.  The idea is that two of the better-known scaling proposals, SegWit2x and BIP 148, might be equipped to work together given that both are attempting to upgrade the network with Segregated Witness (SegWit), a network optimization first proposed by developers in 2015.  Yet, each project is currently paving the way for a scaling optimization differently, and in ways that are ultimately incompatible with the other.  BIP 148, for example, is moving ahead with its user-activated soft fork (UASF) that would seek to push SegWit live without explicitly asking miners for support. SegWit2x, meanwhile, plans to pair SegWit with a 2 MB block-size increase, boosting transaction capacity further by tweaking the bitcoin's underlying rules.  And that collision could lead to a split – one that turns bitcoin into two competing assets. Adding to the drama is that the upgrades are set to take their next steps at around the same time.  If all goes according to plan, users will be able to begin running SegWit2x on 21st July. Likewise, BIP 148 will be triggered on 1st August, an event some are calling ""Bitcoin Independence Day"". Yet, because of the incompatibility between the two proposals, those that begin running SegWit2x could end up on an entirely different bitcoin network than those running BIP 148, with entirely different bitcoins trading at an entirely different value.  Split protection  So, how likely is this more adversarial scenario?  Advocates of BIP 148 are saying their proposal is going to activate no matter what. Since people are already running the code for the bitcoin improvement protocol, there's no way to alter it or put it back in 'Pandora’s box'. So, with that in mind, several developers have argued that SegWit2x should adopt BIP 148 to avoid a split.  John Light, who works with bitcoin payment startup Abra, is one of those advocates, contending in a recent blog post that ""BIP 148 does not violate the spirit of the [SegWit2x] agreement, since it both activates SegWit and in no way prevents signatories from running code for a 2MB hard fork once it’s ready"".  The idea is that, if the goal is activating SegWit, then why not join forces rather than risk a split?  Light told CoinDesk:  ""That will ensure that there are no more unnecessary delays in activating SegWit. The sooner we get SegWit, the sooner the 2 MB hard fork is activated.""  But, there are other ideas for keeping the network from splitting up.  Bitcoin developer James Hilliard recently proposed 'split protection' that requires less miner support for SegWit than past proposals. Effectively, if a majority of miners run it a split would be avoided.  ""I think split protection could be the closest we get to a 'golden ticket' to maximize compatibility between BIP 148 and Segwit2x,"" Reddit moderator BashCo said, echoing the sentiments of some other bitcoin developers.  'Scope creep'  BashCo could be right, but it's hard to say what will happen given that there's some resistance to BIP 148 in the bitcoin community.  When asked whether SegWit2x would be compatible with BIP 148, Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik, one of the developers who's been leading the charge to SegWit2x, didn't suggest this was a top priority.  Garzik told CoinDesk:  ""We're really trying to stay laser-focused on what the participants agreed to, building, testing and getting review for that: SegWit + 2MB hard fork. As a general rule, we want to avoid scope creep.""  'Scope creep' seems to have already become a problem for the project. On its GitHub pages, Garzik has waved off various requests for a variety of extra features given the short time frame he was assigned for the project.  Still, he has been open to feedback – seemingly in favor of incorporating another proposal, BIP 91 (from Hilliard), aimed at ensuring that SegWit2x's implementation is compatible with the estimated 83% of bitcoin nodeshttp://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/segwit.html that are already running the version of SegWit that was deployed last November.  Plus, SegWit2x is an open-source project, meaning it relies on input from volunteers. The alpha version will be released this week, on 16th June, at which point outside developers can leave additional feedback.  So many forks  Adding to all the complexity here is that each proposal on its own might result in some users forking off onto their own network.  If a majority of mining pools don't flag support for SegWit, BIP 148 will lead to the creation of two separate bitcoin assets. Meanwhile, if users decide not to upgrade to 2MB, SegWit2x will lead to a split as well.  Now, more than ever, there seem to be more efforts that could lead to splits, which is one reason why this current group of proposals have vehement detractors.  Still, while the thought of a split is worrisome to many stakeholders, bitcoin’s scaling debate has seen plenty of false alarms. In the past, other developers and users have suggested they would like to split off from bitcoin, but none, so far, have actually followed through.  Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow, for one, doesn't think it's possible to mandate that all users uphold the hard fork portion of the SegWit2x agreement – the part that could lead to a split. Other developers have argued that it's impossible to mandate that everyone switch to the 2MB version at a technical level.  Because of these technical complications, some in the community doubt that the companies that signed on to the SegWit2x proposal will see through with making the 2MB upgrade.  ""Basically it's a promise that can't and won't be kept,"" Mow argued.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the SegWit2x proposal. DCG also has an ownership stake in Abra, Blockstream and Bloq.

Amidst a wave of uncapped initial coin offerings (ICOs) that has found relatively untested projects out-raising even the most well-known industry startups, some investors are seeking to temper the speculation. That's the case for entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, whose latest venture Civic turned down the opportunity to collect millions more in sales.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the startup has already sold $33m in Civic tokens (CVC) – eight days before the official offering was to take place.  In interview, Lingham, the company's founder and CEO, explained that as a result, investors in the pre-sale will now effectively return one-third of these tokens so that investors who couldn't participate in any preliminary offerings are able to get a fair shot at purchasing.  Lingham told CoinDesk:  ""We don't want the vanity headlines, where it all happens in pre-sales and behind the scenes. We don't want to be sold out in 30 seconds, we want to be distributed to as many people as possible.""  This means even with the outsized demand for the project, 33% of the 33 million CVC tokens the project has sold will be headed back to the market in the formal ICO.  ""All the buyers that have sent an allocation in bitcoin and ether to us, we're going to release a part of it to [the market]. Whatever doesn't sell out, the [pre-sale] buyers are going to get,"" he said. ""It was a smart way of ensuring buyers if we didn't sell out.  As detailed in the firm's public statements and white paper, the remaining assets will be divided between the company itself and as-yet-undefined opportunities to advance a future ecosystem.  CVC tokens will still retail for $0.10 each, a price that was also fixed for pre-sale investors. According to Lingham, even funds that participated in the pre-sale – and investors in its traditional equity round – paid the same price that crowdsale participants will ultimately be offered on 21st June.  Further, crowdsale participants will also be required to verify their identities via Civic, a feature that Lingham said will both reduce fraud and showcase the company's technology.  Announced on 20th May, Civic's service aims to rethink web logins, providing a decentralized means for internet users to verify components of their identity without exchanging personal data. As such, the service is positioned as a potential alternative that adds more layers to the experience via the power of a blockchain system.

42379522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PPd,1497312927,The #Flippening: Will Ether 'Pass' Bitcoin And What Would It Mean?,"No stranger to strange milestones, the cryptocurrency sector may soon see a historic first, one that could upend long-held perceptions of its market.  Branded 'The Flippening' by market observers, this new hypothetical is defined loosely as the point at which a competing blockchain network could replace bitcoin as the largest and best capitalized blockchain. Sparked by increasing inflows in cryptographic assets, the concept has already seen a dedicated hashtag and website.  Given that bitcoin invented and popularized blockchain systems, the development could herald a time of new diversity and experimentation for the nascent sector that, until recently, was largely defined in context of bitcoin.  At earlier points in 2017, bitcoin accounted for more than 80% of the total cryptocurrency market share, though this figure has been higher than 90% at times.  However, so-called alternative cryptocurrencies have drawn robust inflows this year, causing their total market cap to reach a record high of roughly $117bn today, a more than 500% year-to-date increase, according to CoinMarketCap.  So, will the event come to pass? And if so, what will it mean?  Analysts queried by CoinDesk largely believe ethereum's ether token is most likely to spur the change, given it has increased 3,000% this year with no signs of slowing.  Indeed, ether's market cap has been drawing steadily close to bitcoin's amid a broader uptick in interest for so-called 'tokens' based on the platform, with the two cryptocurrencies worth $35.9bn and $43.7bn at the time of report.  Still, while some analysts focused on the promise of the ethereum network, others emphasized the perceived difficulties bitcoin has encountered of late as the reason this development could be likely.  Developers and entrepreneurs building on bitcoin are still trying to figure out the best way to resolve its ongoing scaling dilemma, a matter which some allege is limiting the cryptocurrency's use as a medium of exchange. (Though, perhaps benefitting its use as a store of value).  Currently, blocks in bitcoin's blockchain can only include up to 1 MB of transaction date, meaning that they can only process a fixed number of exchanges. Thus far, proposals to increase the block size have failed, and efforts to implement Segregated Witness – a solution that would reduce the total size of each individual transaction and allow more of these to fit into blocks – have failed to gain the needed support.  Other proposals have largely proved short-lived or polarizing.  ""Bitcoin is still stuck at [the] scaling dilemma,"" said Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool. ""If some kind of agreement were achieved, [bitcoin] could regain much of its dominance.""  However, the bitcoin community has not yet found a solution, so ether is benefiting from the situation, he said. As markets respond to these developments, Rupsys expects ether's market capitalization, or the total value of its available token supply, to surpass bitcoin's.  Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to scale, has to an extent become ""a victim of its own success,"" said Tim Enneking, managing director of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Fund.  He also noted that ether has benefited from coming into existence after bitcoin, telling CoinDesk:  ""Ether has learned and has fewer problems – as well as a comprehensive, coherent (more or less) roadmap going forward. It also has leadership. Bitcoin has none of that. And first-mover advantages dissipate if one doesn't continue to innovate.""  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange service CryptoCompare, was also optimistic that ethereum could become the dominant blockchain.  ""Ether has a strong chance of surpassing bitcoin due to its strong network effect and ability to negate the governance issues that bitcoin has been subject to,"" he said.  ICOs crucial  Some market observers emphasized the key role played by token sales (or ICOs) when explaining why ether's market cap might surpass that of bitcoin's.  As these offerings allow participants to exchange bitcoin and ether for digital 'tokens' that grant exposure to new ventures, investors purchasing these tokens (contracts on the ethereum network) frequently use ether because they don't want to miss out.  Further, the concentration of ether in the hands of a smaller set of startups is creating new economic pressures on the network.  ""This keeps many ethers locked up in new projects and [fewer] ethers are available for trading,"" Rupsys noted.  Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem offered a similar sentiment, noting: ""Right now, an immense supply of ETH gets locked up due to [ICOs]."" This ""severely reduces supply,"" and with each offering, more tokens are ""locked up"", he explained.  Still, projects using this method of fundraising are going to sell some of the ether tokens they raise to pay for development, he said, meaning sell pressure could increase should this begin in earnest.  Bubbles and potentials  While many analysts provided optimistic assessments of ether's future, some expressed concerns that the cryptocurrency is in bubble territory.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub, asserted that ether's price is tied heavily to the ICOs that use the alternative asset protocol.  ""I personally think ether price is incredibly overpriced, and that many of the ICOs funded will not deliver on all their promises. When that unravels, it's likely to cause a substantial crash in the ether price,"" he said.  However, he did leave open the possibility that ether's market cap could surpass bitcoin's, depending on how much success ether-based ICOs produce.  Still, analysts also emphasized the influence both networks could have on the world.  While bitcoin could revolutionize the world of currency, ether could have more a wide-ranging influence through its use of smart contracts.  Mati Greenspan, senior markets analyst at asset trading platform eToro, spoke to this potential.  He added that, given its expansive goals, it might be likely for ether to surpass bitcoin in terms of market cap, though it may not have the largest network effect by other means.  Greenspan concluded:  ""The development of both bitcoin and ethereum have far-reaching implications for our future world. Respectively, bitcoin and ethereum represent the future of money and the future of the internet.""
