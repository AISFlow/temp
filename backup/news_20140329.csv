42425578,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFBh,1396110842,The Benefits of Bitcoin in International Travel,"Nick Tomaino is on the business development team at Coinbase, and is also a first-year business school student at the Yale School of Management.  Prior to that, he worked in venture capital, most recently for Softbank Capital.    _________________________________________________________________      Bitcoin is an open payment network that anyone in the world with an Internet connection can use.      The open, global nature of bitcoin has tremendous advantages over existing financial infrastructure for international travellers. These advantages became clear to me during a recent trip to South America.      Below are some of the problems that international travellers currently deal with.    Hassle of currency conversion  When travelling to foreign countries, it can be a major hassle to convert to local currencies and carry around local cash. I traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, on my trip and had to worry about exchanging currency three times (when both entering and leaving a new country).  Wouldn't it be great to be able to eliminate one of the major hassles of international trips? As a global currency used by consumers and merchants worldwide, bitcoin eliminates the need for dealing with multiple currency conversions and carrying a lot of cash.  High fees  In addition to the hassle of dealing with currency conversion and carrying cash, it can also be quite costly to get cash and make payments in new countries. During my time in Brazil, I incurred three approximately $15 ATM fees to withdraw Brazilian Reals from a local bank – a $10 charge from my large US-based bank, in addition to $5 from the local Brazilian bank – for each withdrawal. I incurred one $15 ATM fee in Buenos Aires, as well. Additionally, I was charged a fee every time I used my card to make a purchase.  The twelve times I swiped my card to buy something ended up costing me $36 dollars. The high fees I paid ($96 in total) on my trip highlight the massive friction that exists between existing payment networks worldwide.  An open, global payment network reduces friction and fees. As the world continues to become more inter-connected, I think this will become a more obvious benefit of bitcoin.        Payment fraud  When you use your credit card internationally, you give unfamiliar foreign merchants your payment credentials. These merchants can either intentionally or unintentionally expose those payment credentials to criminals.  While I was in Buenos Aires, I purchased water at a convenience store. The following day, I got a call from my bank telling me I had hundreds of dollars of fraudulent charges made with my debit card.  The unfamiliar merchant in Buenos Aires must have exposed my payment credentials to a fraudster. My bank account was compromised, and while the charges were covered, my bank told me it would take five to seven business days for them to mail me a new debit card. This left me without access to my bank account for a week in a foreign country.  Luckily, I had another card to cover me from the rest of the trip, but I’m not sure what I would have done if I did not. This is a scenario I suspect is all too familiar for many who have travelled internationally.  The solution  Bitcoin solves many problems that international travellers currently deal with. It eliminates the hassle and fees associated with converting to local currencies and carrying cash, and it securely protects the payment credentials of consumers to avoid fraud risk and the potential to lose bank account access in a foreign country.  While it is tough to travel with only bitcoin on international trips at the moment, the rapid merchant adoption of bitcoin is changing this.  Travel-focused merchants such as CheapAir.com, BTCTrip and Pointshound are just a few merchants generating significant bitcoin sales from international travellers. As more travel related merchants accept bitcoin, and consumers continue to realize the huge efficiencies that bitcoin provides, I expect the travel space to continue to lead bitcoin adoption.  Next time I travel internationally, I hope to be able to leave my credit and debit cards at home.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Nicholas Tomaino,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/29/the-benefits-of-bitcoin-in-international-travel,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/419f361a96877540af7e1dc70b1dc7647505fb9a-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425569,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZEth,1396101956,Bitcoin is Key to Empowering Small Businesses,"Small businesses are the bedrock of the American economy. Today, more than half of all workers in the US are employed by businesses with less than 500 employees, and they create some 66% of new jobs as well.  Despite their importance to the economy, however, small businesses have faced serious hurdles in successfully competing on the Internet. Bitcoin has the potential to finally unleash them and fuel their growth, but first we have to ensure that the currency is trustworthy through smart regulation.  Founders looking to build a new company today have access to many effective platforms they can use to go from vision to delivery. Flextronics accelerates product development by assisting companies in managing their supply chains. Once built, companies can sell their products on top of Amazon Web Services, easily scaling their server resources with demand.  Finding customers is much easier because platforms like Facebook and Twitter provide tools to engage potential audiences. Finally, once customers are ready, FedEx and UPS provide full logistics services to ensure that products are available and delivered on time.  While small businesses have had all of these platforms available to them for years, one area has been sorely lacking: payments. Today's financial infrastructure is ill-suited for the online and mobile commerce that increasingly is at the core of business.  Issues like fraud and identity theft deeply harm small businesses, which can't easily manage their financial risks. Credit card chargebacks made sense when most commerce was in-person and local, but in a globalized consumer market, such policies are cumbersome. Compared to large companies, small businesses simply don't have the resources to accept payments online easily across the world.  As I discussed this week at CoinSummit, we now have the payment infrastructure we need with bitcoin. Together with other enabling platforms, bitcoin stands to provide small businesses with the leverage they need to aggressively compete in the marketplace.  This ""economies of unscale"" means that entrepreneurs from San Francisco to Mumbai can create a business that can rapidly grow with just a handful of people and a dream for the future.  [post-quote]  This has not been the case since the Industrial Age started two centuries ago. Scale has been the key watchword in building profitable companies, since large enterprises have the resources to develop proprietary systems, giving them unfair power in the marketplace.  They also have the ability to spread the cost of business processes and inefficiency over a greater number of sales. Entire categories of businesses, from manufacturing to the delivery of high-quality services, could only be conducted in near-monopoly conditions, and thus, innovation often fell by the wayside.  That's why I was excited to meet with so many passionate bitcoin entrepreneurs at this week's CoinSummit. The world economy is on the cusp of transformation. To get to the promised land though, bitcoin founders are going to have to take a very different approach than they have in the past in supporting the progress of the cryptocurrency.  Unlike the cavalier attitude that built the Internet services we use every day, bitcoin entrepreneurs must instead actively engage with regulators to ensure that consumers (and businesses) are properly protected.  Bitcoin has a plethora of thorny issues that have to be addressed in order for it to reach mass adoption. Consumers need the ability to hold secure digital wallets, and the bitcoin market itself needs better stability mechanisms. Since transactions in bitcoin cannot be reversed, entrepreneurs must develop a framework for adjudicating issues about returns or refunds.  Regulators are not necessarily against change, but they are often understandably worried about unfamiliar technology. Founders should see this as an opportunity and not a threat. Only through the intersection of technology, finance, and government can we be sure to build a system that will meet the needs of all stakeholders.  For these reasons, General Catalyst invested in the Series A round of Circle, which is building out the key infrastructure around bitcoin to make it safe and secure for everyday use. The co-founder of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, who built platform companies in the app server and Internet video markets, believes that Circle can create a two-sided platform that allows consumers to safely buy, store and use digital currency and businesses to accept transactions without risk of volatility.  We also invested in online payments company Stripe, which will soon allow its customers to accept bitcoin payments in lieu of credit cards.  If we can build trust in bitcoin, we can begin to empower the economies of unscale that will ensure that its ubiquity reaches the levels enjoyed by Visa and Mastercard today. That will mean that entrepreneurs across the world can accept payments from anyone, anywhere, with limited fees and headaches. That's a revolution for small businesses, and our economy as well.

42425572,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZEzh,1396096949,Court Grants Order to Freeze Hashfast's Bitcoin Wallets,"UPDATE (2nd April 12:30 GMT): HashFast issued a response to the Temporary Restraining Order via its blog, claiming that the plaintiff in question has never purchased any products from the company. The plaintiff, Cypher Enterprises, has in turn denied this and posted response to the bitcointalk forums here and here. Obviously this is a matter for lawyers to negotiate and possibly a judge to decide, so CoinDesk will not be updating this page any further.  Feel free to read the backgrounds from both sides' perspectives, and remember that honesty, transparency, and open communications channels are always the best way to conduct bitcoin business.  ____________________________  A court in Fort Worth, Texas, has granted a temporary restraining order to freeze the bitcoin wallets of ASIC mining hardware manufacturer HashFast Technologies LLC and HashFast LLC, after a customer claimed it failed to deliver hardware on time or negotiate a refund.  The TRO was part of a wider lawsuit filed against HashFast on 27th March by Cypher Enterprises, who claim it ordered and paid HashFast for several items of bitcoin mining hardware in early October last year. The complaint says HashFast failed to meet its promised delivery date later that month, prompting Cypher Enterprises to cancel its orders.  No refund  Cypher Enterprises had paid for the majority of the orders for the 'Baby Jet' mining hardware in bitcoin but said HashFast had failed to offer or pay a refund of any kind, or even reply to the cancelation.  The complaint, which has a Background section with the question ""What the heck is a Bitcoin?"" also contains an attachment of 30 pages of bitcointalk forum discussion detailing the history of the story from July-August 2013. HashFast had promoted the new hardware on the forum and even invited potential customers to tour their workplace in order to promote transparency.  At the time of the order, on 1st October 2013, 1 BTC was worth around $126.  It continued that HashFast had stated on the forum that in the event a refund was necessary, it would pay in bitcoin. After failing to meet the original delivery date it promised to ship no later than 31st December, a date it also missed.  HashFast response  In order to be ""transparent and open with [...] customers, partners, vendors, and friends"", Tim Wong, chief marketing officer at HashFast, responded to the allegations in official statement on HashFast's blog:  ""A plaintiff that never purchased any products from Hashfast Technologies was granted a TRO from the Tarrant County District Court, Texas. This was granted ex parte: Hashfast Technologies was not provided notice of the proceeding or given the opportunity to hear the allegations or respond to them.""  He continued: ""If and when Hashfast Technologies is served with any court documents in this matter, it will bring these facts to the attention to the Tarrant County District Court, and vigorously defend against this attempt at profiteering and unjust enrichment.""  Wong added that further updates will be issued via the company's twitter account and blog.  Changing the game  The granting of a court order to freeze bitcoin assets of mining hardware companies who fail to deliver on time could have ramifications in an industry beset by delays as small and inexperienced participants grapple with issues related to cutting edge hardware design and production.  ""Outside of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings, I'm not aware of any other Texas courts which have entered a restraining order like this,"" said Cypher Enterprises' lawyer, Robert Bogdanowicz.  ""It speaks to the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies and a growing understanding of their value and importance to businesses.""  Several mining hardware startups have struggled to deliver product anywhere near the promised time, in a field so time-critical that even a month's delay can render an expensive purchase worthless due to bitcoin's constantly increasing difficulty rate.  HashFast, which had been under threat of legal action over the delays since the beginning of this year, was founded just last year and promotes itself on its website as ""an industry leader in bitcoin mining technology"".

42425588,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFVh,1396094162,11 Top Bitcoin Memes,"Bitcoin and viral memes are two of the greatest gifts of the Internet.  Hence, it makes perfect sense to pay tribute to both in a rundown of the best bitcoin memes making the rounds on cyberspace.    1. Let's establish who the bitcoin owners are:        However, thanks to a little something called 'anonymity', we'll never really know exactly who owns what, although some have tried.    2. They took the blue pill:        While it may take Neo some time to get ready, you can already buy lots with your bitcoins.    3. Bitcoin is going to be explosive:        But could it be worth more than an ounce of gold?    4. You can go places with bitcoin:        The Caribbean, Mount Everest, the Moon … oh the places you'll go!    5. But not everyone loves bitcoin:        In fact some people really hate it. Like this guy. And this one too.    6. What we are all wondering:        It might be these guys in Asia.    7. This could be their strategy:        All hail Queen B? These contenders are catching up. Some did really well last year.    8. There were definitely some winners in bitcoin:        If you want to know exactly what happened with the value of bitcoin, then make sure you read this.    9. And then there was Chuck Norris:        But sadly, lots of other people were not able to do so.    10. Rejoice! The chosen one has been found:        Maybe not. But, this is what Newsweek speculated.    11. Just in case the man didn't make himself clear enough:        Because one does not simply find Satoshi Nakamoto.  Got your own favourite?

42425581,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFDh,1396055537,Coinbase Launches App Store in Push for Developer Integration,"Coinbase has launched an app store, showcasing firms that have integrated with its wallet service.  On the firm's API page, it explains that it allows submissions from applications conducting ""all major bitcoin operations"", that exchange bitcoin to local currency, send and request bitcoins via email or bitcoin address, and create bitcoin wallets. It also allows merchant apps, and apps that provide access to raw bitcoin network data. Microtransactions are permitted, too.  Among the first apps to be included in the app store are OSX-based wallet Hive, and Gliph, a mobile app for making bitcoin payments, both of which have integrated with Coinbase. BitTip, the Reddit bitcoin tipping app, and a Coinbase Wordpress plugin are also on the site.  And Coinbase Trader, an app that allows for the automated buying and selling of bit coins through Coinbase, is also listed.  The company did not to respond to queries about how closely those using its API would be security vetted, or any other criteria that it was using for inclusion in the store.  This appears to be part of a wider push for Coinbase to build a developer community for its bitcoin infrastructure, which exists off the block chain and includes a wallet, email-based transfers, and a merchant payment processing service. The company recently ran its BitHack competition, in which it awarded $18,000 in prizes. It announced the winners today.  The winner of that app, CoinPlanter, is an Android app that uses geotagging to let people store, share, or retrieve bitcoins based on their location. People can 'dig' while at any location to see if someone has left bitcoin to pick up. The tool, which received a $10,000 first prize, has some marketing potential for companies wanting to cash in on the geotagging craze and integrate the concept with their own campaigns.  The second prizewinner, Aircoin, got $5,000. It is a mobile app that lets people send bit coins to others nearby, using a drag and drop visual interface.  Finally, Coinery.io is an online site for selling digital products in bitcoin. The Coinbase-powered site charges no fees, it says. That site got $3,000.  None of these apps were listed in the Coinbase app store, although another entrant to the contest, Bitfluence, was listed on the app store. That service lets you use your Twitter identity to send and receive bitcoin, is listed on the site.  Coinbase has suffered from its own app store woes in the past, falling foul of Apple's notorious anti-bitcoin stance. Apple removed its mobile iOS app from the app store in November, less than a month after it was launched.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/29/coinbase-launches-app-store-in-push-for-developer-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92125d8431a7e8978c624fe9f089ce29a2de6a31-2838x1580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
