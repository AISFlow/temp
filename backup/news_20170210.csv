42427350,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1eBh,1486749613,International Securities Regulators Publish Blockchain Research,"The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), a cooperative group of global securities markets regulators, has published a wide-ranging research paper that includes findings on blockchain tech.  The 70-plus page paper, published Wednesday, casts a wider net on the world of fintech, exploring areas such as peer-to-peer lending and robo-advisors. It comes just under a year after IOSCO declared its intention to study blockchain more closely.  Though largely a broad overview of the different approaches to blockchain seen in the past several years, the paper does outline some of the barriers to adoption facing the securities industry today as it explores use cases and tests prototypes.  One section of note focuses on the challenges related to smart contracts, a perhaps prescient warning given the collapse of The DAO – an ethereum-based smart contract that aimed to act as a funding vehicle – last summer.  The IOSCO report in particular highlights the risk of problems arising from both the automated nature of the tech as well as those developing the contracts themselves. As shown by the case of The DAO, an oversight during coding can have disastrous results.  The report argues:  ""Smart contracts in theory reduce human error through automation. However, if an error occurs, it is more difficult to resolve as the operations are linked and embedded in the blockchain, and are self-executing according to the code written in the smart contracts. Also, smart contracts introduce a different type of human error: coding error.""  While the report itself doesn't issue any specific recommendations to IOSCO's global membership as it relates to blockchain, it more generally advocates for the use of stronger surveillance technology and cooperation among national-level agencies.  Such steps, the organization goes on to note, can help resolve some of the larger issues that impact the process of regulating technologies that transcend international borders.  ""While firms can operate globally, regulation is overseen within national or sub-national borders,"" IOSCO writes. ""This may create challenges in terms of regulatory consistency, as well as cross-border supervision and enforcement. It also creates a potential risk of regulatory arbitrage.""

42427361,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1ePh,1486745727,Charts: How an ETF Approval Could Impact Bitcoin's Price,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.  In this guest feature, Woo explores how the bitcoin market might react if a long-awaited ETF was approved and millions in new capital were injected into the market overnight.  This infographic of bitcoin's price is something I've been pondering today.  It tells bitcoin's often dramatic price story in fundamental trend lines that abstract away some serious doses of speculative activity.  There's a lot in this chart, so lets break it down:  In late 2015 through to May 2016, we saw a three cats and a moon consolidation pattern play out over six months after a multi-level marketing (MMM) pyramid scheme took bitcoin price action through some exciting times.  By early June 2016, we saw a speculative bubble (marked in green above) as the market sought to price in the upcoming block reward halving event. This was to be the second halving event, slashing payout and therefore the supply of new bitcoins from 25 BTC every 10 minutes to… well, exactly half to 12.5 BTC.  Leading up to this, many people were afraid miners would exit (taking their protective hashing power with them), and that the block processing would slow and the price could crash. This did not happen. What happened was simply that the markets saw less sell-side pressure from miners who had fewer newly minted coins to sell. (The blue trend shows the steeper rate of price appreciation this had on the markets.)  Finally, what we may be seeing from Q4 2016 to present is the market undergoing a much larger and longer speculative phase for the upcoming bitcoin ETF decision. If approved, hundreds of millions at a minimum are expected to be poured into bitcoin. Understandably, the blue-shaded area in our infographic would then be drawn out.  If this story is fundamentally correct, the picture it paints is quite useful.  Methodology  Using this data, we can deduce the impact of a controlled reduction in bitcoin supply on price, and because of this, we can use it to extrapolate changes as a result of new capital inflow.  The diagram above traces two price trajectories, and they etch out the price impact of two monetary dilution policies.  Every 10 minutes, blue supplies 12.5 BTC onto the markets, while green supplies 25 BTC. The difference between the two trend lines at any point in time will give you the price impact from their differences in supply.  The difference between the two trend lines at any point in time will give you the “fair value” price impact from their differences in supply. I say “fair value” as in reality bubble mania would take hold and we’d see a party session above the new baseline and probably another very long three cats and a moon consolidation.  First, a note about the accuracy of this method.  As any chartist and trader can attest, placement of the trend lines is an art, so bear in mind the actual results are subject to significant errors.  Nevertheless, let's see if the results make any sense…  Fundamental priceThe fundamental baseline price of bitcoin, without any speculation on the day of the ETF decision came to $900.  Fundamental ROIOur trend lines indicate bitcoin's return on investment made a step change from 97%pa to 188%pa after the block halving event, which saw monetary inflation reduce from 10% to 4%.  ETF price impact and market capitalisationsRunning through different capital injection scenarios, we have predictions of between $1,090 for a $300m capital injection to $3,200 for a $2bn FOMO stampede. In comparative terms, gold ETFs account for 0.6% of gold market cap while a single $300m ETF inflow would account for 2% of bitcoin market cap.  Current market speculationNeedham and Company published a report early this year estimating that an ETF approval was likely below 25%. However, at the time of writing, the newly released BitMex EFT prediction market is expecting a 33% chance. We've seen speculative bitcoin pricing in the range of $1,050-$1,150 and success probabilities of 25% to 33%, figures that are in line with a $500m-$1bn capital injection from ETFs. In such a scenario, we would see bitcoin's market cap swell to $20bn-28bn.  What does this mean in terms of March 2017 price action?When the results become known on 11th March, the markets will respond sharply due to speculative pricing*. Let's say the price of bitcoin is $1,090 leading up to the announcement. An approval decision could see an immediate $380-$570 price climb**, conversely with a negative decision slash the $190 speculative premium towards the $900 baseline. How much would depend on sentiments toward yet another shot at ETF approval.  * The short-term price would be driven by speculators, as an actual ETF fund would source the majority of bitcoins from over-the-counter markets. This means it would take some time before the impacts of reduced supply reached the bitcoin exchange markets.  ** At 25% chance price should calculate as $900+$190*4 whereas at 33% probability the calculation would be $900+$190*3  How does this compare to other reports?  Needham and Company  <25% chance of success  $300m capital inject in the first week  No price target.  At 25% chance and a speculative pricing of $1100 pre-decision, my model would predict $1bn of longer-term capital injection and a fundamental valuation target of $1700. This is within ballpark.  Seeking Alpha  35% chance of success  Price target $3,678  Probability adjusted price $1,645.  If probability adjusted price is in fact $1,645, my model would predict a fair value price target of $3,125 (and $2.2bn of ETF capital).  Given their target likely accounts for speculative overshoots that always plague price mania, the two are moderately in agreement.  In this case the speculative overshoot would need to be 18%. Seeking Alpha comment the markets are undervaluing bitcoin by a wild margin (67% at the time of the report).  This piece is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice.

42427338,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1dth,1486740927,Illinois Legislator Calls for Blockchain Working Group,"A draft resolution submitted to the Illinois legislature has proposed the creation of a working group dedicated to blockchain technology.  House Resolution 120  , filed on Wednesday by state representative Michael Zalewski, would establish a 12-person group focused on researching the tech. Public records show that the resolution has been referred to the House Rules Committee for consideration.  At its heart, the draft calls for Illinois to investigate how state and local-level governments can utilize blockchain – work that is already being done, in a way, by a consortium of government agencies in the state. State officials have also developed a regulatory framework for businesses looking to work with digital currencies like bitcoin.  The resolution states:  ""...the Illinois Legislative Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force [will] study how and if State, county, and municipal governments can benefit from a transition to a blockchain based system for recordkeeping and service delivery…""  The text suggests a degree of synergy between that effort and the work that would be done should the legislative group be approved. Some of its members would be drawn from agencies like the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the the Cook County Recorder of Deeds – offices that have already begun exploring use cases of the tech.  If approved, the task force would be required to submit a detailed study to the legislative no later than 1st January of next year.  Specific areas of research would include ""opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain and distributed ledger technology"", as well as research into the types of public and private blockchains in existence today.  The group would also weigh ""how current State laws can be modified to support secure, paperless recordkeeping"", according to the measure.  Notably, the draft resolution comes days after two legislators in Hawaii called for a similar undertaking.

42427352,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1e7h,1486737325,A Bitcoin Hard Fork? The Science of Contentious Code is Advancing,"Bitcoin developers are probing deeper into how best to execute a so-called hard fork, a contentious upgrading tool that's been at the heart of the nearly $16bn network's most divisive debate for years now.  The issue is that to be used cleanly and without unintentional consequences, a hard fork requires all the digital currency's miners to move to a new blockchain, or version of its transaction history. One case study of what can otherwise happen came last summer, when ethereum inadvertently split into two networks after executing a hard fork some users disagreed with.  That's not to say that all hard forks have the same outcome.  Interestingly, the following two ethereum hard forks went according to plan, as they were non-contentious changes to fix attacks on the network, perhaps demonstrating that they can go well if all participants agree.  Meanwhile, against this backdrop, some in the bitcoin community have long been calling for a hard fork to increase transaction capacity by raising the blocksize parameter to 2MB or more, with Bitcoin Unlimited being the latest software to take up the call for action.  One impediment is that, since increasing the block size is a contentious change, a similar ethereum-like split could occur in bitcoin if a hard fork were executed.  For that reason and others, the engineering consensus seems to be that more research needs to be done before giving it a try in bitcoin.  BitmainWarranty's James Hilliard, who has tested code for Bitcoin Core, said that, though he's generally “conservative” on the issue of a hard fork (as are the most active contributors), there might be a potential need for one in the future, especially since it's the only way to make certain types of changes.  Hilliard told CoinDesk:  ""I think research is definitely helpful as it gets us closer to being able to do safe hard forks.""  Of late, there's been an uptake in research in this direction, with some bitcoin code contributors continuing long-standing studies into how a hard fork might be used.  Lengthy analysis has been posted to the bitcoin developer mailing list over the last couple of months, and there's now even an open-source website filled with links to notable public hard fork research.  Bitcoin developers appear to be approaching the option carefully, looking into a range of considerations, such as how to safely execute such a change.  Hard fork proposals  Along those lines, a batch of new hard fork proposals have been released in the last few months.  None have received much support in terms of near-term execution, but they have generated discussion and show an uptake in attention.  Perhaps most notably, Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau, who has been perhaps the most prolific in terms of posting hard fork write-ups to the mailing list, just this week coded up a second experimental hard fork, called 'Spoonnet', with new features that bitcoin currently doesn't have.  He hinted that trying to activate it right now, without unanimous consensus, would not lead to positive results.  ""Trying to activate it on testnet will get you banned. Trying to activate it on mainnet before consensus is reached will make you lose money,"" he wrote.  Despite the long write-up and code accompanying it, he mentioned that there are plenty of details to iron out before Spoonnet is ready to use, such as ensuring that wallets in the post-hard fork world would support transactions on the new network.  Lau’s other hard fork proposal, called Forcenet, codes up a type of hard fork known as a 'soft-hard fork', that makes old nodes follow the new rules, based on an earlier proposal by Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr.  It puts into practice a new block header format that adds room for more data, among other things.  Then, there are some hard fork proposals that relate more specifically to the block size debate.  Dashjr posted two hard fork proposals last month, one of which proposes an initial optional decrease to the block size that would switch to a steady increase to 31 MB.  Hilliard pointed out that hard fork research pertaining to the block size in particular has been going on for a while. He drew up with his own hard fork proposal last February, though perhaps owing to the speed of R&D, he said he wouldn’t vouch for it because it’s ""overly complicated"".  Dangers considered  Notably, few of the newer proposals are related to making hard forks safer. For instance, addressing the issue that stakeholders could lose money (or see the value of their investment decline) if the blockchain splits.  One such proposal is for a 'hard fork warning system', with which wallets and miners can warn others in the case of a hard fork.  ""With a hard fork warning system, users and merchants may stop trading when there is abnormality on the network until they are able to make an informed decision,"" Lau explained, mentioning that this might have been useful in former unintentional bitcoin splits, as well as that of ethereum.  Further, replay attacks featured heavily in the aftermath of ethereum’s fork and resulting blockchain split. In a nutshell, because the transaction histories were the same on each resulting network, users could send transactions on both networks, which caused confusion – at least up until the issue was fixed.  Proposals from Dashjr and Lau grapple with this issue using different techniques.  Interestingly, even the details of this protective action were cause for disagreement, with Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo arguing in response to Lau’s bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) that replay attack protection should be mandatory rather than opt-in.  Hilliard noted that another safety measure would be to have a ""reasonably long"" activation timeline of a year or so.  Scaling hurdle  As far as for what reason to carry out a hard fork, the block size debate continues to be the elephant in the room.  In Hilliard’s opinion, the block size is not a good enough reason to hard fork, at least right now, where the split in opinion could manifest in two networks, and increasing the block size could increase the burden of running a volunteer node.  He added:  ""The question is not, 'Should bitcoin scale?', the question is 'How can we scale bitcoin without breaking it?'""  Still, figuring out a way to carry out hard forks safely might be beneficial, as there’s no other way to make certain technical changes to bitcoin.  ""Fixing tech issues would be a good reason, in my opinion,"" Hilliard said.  He pointed to a long list of bug fixes and other potential changes on the so-called 'hard-fork wish list', including header format changes that would ""make it so that miners mining on pools can't withhold blocks"".  One other such change could bundle in what Lau called a ""secondary block header"", which could store new data that, for one, could potentially boost the security of SPV nodes (which store less data than regular nodes).  ""None of the core devs are really against hard forks, they are just conservative,"" Hilliard said.  Lau similarly indicated that it could happen as long as most one day agree with a change.  ""When the vast majority of bitcoin users believe the system is too inefficient (in many aspects, not just transaction throughput) and they believe the benefits outweigh the risks, a hard fork will happen,"" he said.  Hilliard, though, doesn't seem to be in a hurry, noting that it might take a while to find a solution that everyone agrees with.  He concluded:  ""I'm not entirely convinced we really need to do one in the near future.""

42427354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1eHh,1486734762,Ethereum Job Market Colony Enters Beta,"A new decentralized platform for work collaboration has now entered the beta stage.  Colony, a project developed on top of the open-source ethereum network, announced earlier this week that it was opening its doors to developers and enthusiasts.  Those using the platform can create or join 'colonies', earning incentivizing tokens for performing tasks in the form of bounties. The thus-far private beta comes less than a year after Colony netted $10,000 at the the Consensus 2016 Proof of Work showcase competition, at which the startup won unanimously.  According to a blog post, Colony is now looking for feedback as it fine-tunes the platform.  The startup wrote:  “This is the early beta feature set: task management with payments (your own Colony token) and transaction records. Do you have an organization that is looking to become open externally and collaborate with talent outside of your organization? If so, we’re still looking for great people to try our first version of the product once it’s built.”  Colony went on to emphasize that the beta represents “a limited subset of the eventual functionality” – this is to say, users have the ability to assign various tasks and apply budgets for them. Future features like integrations with payment service Stripe and other tools such as Slack and GitHub are in the works.  For now, Colony said, the plan is to let users play with the platform and see what sticks.  “Our goal is to learn. We want to put something into users’ hands so we can learn as fast as possible about what works, what doesn’t, and what to prioritize next,” the startup wrote.

Announced today, BitBays, BTC100, BTCTrade, CHBTC, HaoBTC and Yunbi have all enacted changes to their withdrawal capabilities, a move that comes days after the exchanges were called to meet with the Beijing office of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank.  Notably, the policies issued differ from the more stringent halt of bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals imposed by Huobi and OKCoin, which will stop these services for one month. Only CHBTC indicated it would suspend bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals for this duration.  In statements issued by BTCTrade, BTC100 and HaoBTC, the exchanges said that bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals would now be delayed, though they did not indicate they would halt any services.  All indicated yuan deposits and withdrawals would be unaffected, and that anti-money laundering (AML) upgrades were the impetus for the decision.  HaoBTC noted that its new policy was implemented to restrict the ability of its wallet users to deposit yuan, buy bitcoin and then send the digital currency within 48 hours. It also said it would now charge a 5% fee on all deposits.  Others gave more clarity, as BitBays estimated its withdrawals would now take one hour and 10 minutes.  ""We are very sorry about that,"" the exchange said.  Of all the firms, Yunbi, one of the region's more prominent exchanges for the alternative digital asset ether, perhaps provided the most straightforward explanation of how the new process would work, indicating it would report suspicious activity to regulators.

42427334,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1dph,1486731622,Project Jasper: Lessons From Bank of Canada's First Blockchain Project,"Carolyn Wilkins is the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, where she oversees the central bank's strategic planning and economic and financial research. She also represents the bank on the Financial Stability Board.  In this CoinDesk Opinion piece, Wilkins looks back on key takeaways from nearly six months of distributed ledger learnings, asserting that more healthy collaboration is needed to advance incumbent use of the technology.  It's not surprising that central banks have developed a keen interest in fintech and distributed ledger technology (DLT).  We want to understand the implications for our mandates – monetary policy, currency issuance and financial stability – and also for the financial technology we use ourselves to run our business.  Private investment in DLT platforms and test cases goes well beyond digital currency applications. A whole new industry sees promise for wholesale and retail payments, trade finance, securities trading and finance, regulatory compliance and more.  But, with great promise comes a host of technical and policy issues that need to be examined and resolved before DLT applications in core parts of the financial system are ready for prime time.  There's no better way to understand an innovation than to collaborate with experts around the world and to get in at the ground floor and experiment.  That's why over the last year, we've extended our work beyond fundamental research on electronic payments to contribute to the global fintech regulatory agenda, experiment directly with DLT and exchange views with innovators in the industry.  Meet Jasper  Project Jasper is our DLT flagship experiment, first revealed last June in a speech in Calgary. It's a joint initiative between Payments Canada, the Bank of Canada, major Canadian banks and R3. We've built and are test driving a simulated wholesale payment system using a DLT-based settlement asset (dubbed 'CADcoin' or 'settlement coin').  The experiment will be ongoing until later this spring, but already it has taught us a lot about how the technology would have to improve to win a horse race with our current Large Value Transfer System.  The project team had two clear objectives. The first was to see how the test system could meet international standards for systemically important payments infrastructure that would be set if the system were ever to go live (ie the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMIs)).  The Bank of Canada cares about this because of our oversight role in systematically important systems.  The work done to date has shown that the test system could meet the PFMIs concerning collateral, credit risk, money settlement and liquidity risk. There are some important gaps, though, with respect to settlement finality, operational risk, as well as access and participation requirements.  The team is now looking at a new platform build to see if these gaps can be addressed.  The second objective was quite simply to collaborate with the private sector on a concrete DLT application. So far, the project has yielded important mutual insights.  Key lessons  Overall, the Bank of Canada has gained a better understanding of how the private sector might interact with and adapt to such a system.  We learned a lot about issues that matter to participants, such as scalability, consensus mechanisms, legal issues, data privacy and transparency, as well as cybersecurity.  We’ve also gained some other important insights that will be relevant to the business case for this type of DLT application:  Most cost savings appear unlikely to come in the core system itself, but rather more likely through reducing bank reconciliation efforts. The initial design is quite collateral intensive while the current system is already highly efficient.  There's the potential for more savings if other applications could be built on top of a core cash payment distributed ledger system (eg financial asset clearing and settlement, trade finance).  In an actual production system, trade-offs will need to be resolved between how widely data and transactions are verified by members of the system, and how widely information is shared.  While DLT may aim to reduce concentration of risk, a substantial amount of centralization would still be required (eg permissioning of nodes and setting of operational standards) if applied to wholesale payments systems.  More generally, the Jasper experiment is helping us better understand the business imperative of those who provide and use financial services. It is crucial that financial institutions, new entrants and policymakers to work together to unlock the full promise of fintech.  As I said last June, together we can support a smooth evolution to tomorrow’s financial system – safe, sound and serving the people who rely on it.

42427358,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1eJh,1486726222,"Bitcoin, Blockchain and Trump: Where Do We Go From Here?","Former counsel to bitcoin exchange Gemini, David Brill, is a fintech lawyer with more than 20 years of experience.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Brill shares his insights from the American Bar Association (ABA) Conference on Derivatives and Futures Law, at which he spoke in January.  The regulatory environment for blockchain and bitcoin (as well as the overall securities environment) is in flux as US President Donald Trump's administration begins to gather momentum.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have already been working for several years on various digital currency-related policies, and now it appears the organizations' to-do lists are about to grow.  Trump has an ambitious agenda when it comes to financial regulations, including repealing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act and Volcker Rule, while implementing the Federal CHOICE Act. But the regulatory bodies will likely need to figure out ways to implement a wide variety of changes, with a static or smaller budget than previous years.  Recently, I spoke at The American Bar Association Business Law Section, Derivatives and Futures Conference where the impact of Trump was top of many of the attendees' minds. Hosted in Naples, Florida, by the ABA, the goal of the conference was to have an open dialogue between business lawyers in private practice, senior in-house counsel and various federal agencies.  Attendees of the event included the acting chairman of the CFTC, J Christopher Giancarlo (via teleconference), who has embraced Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' slogan as part of his own agency agenda. Also there were a number of lawyers from the SEC, the National Futures Association and representatives from large law firms and investment banks.  Fresh off the inauguration of President Trump, the sentiment of the attendees generally speaking was hopeful that the new administration would be favorable to the business community.  Pointing to a number of statements made by President Trump, there was optimism that some of the more burdensome financial laws passed in the prior administration would be scaled back or repealed, enabling banks to more efficiently conduct their operations.  However, over the course of the event, it also became very clear to me that funding constraints will potentially play a major role in what regulation we will see in the blockchain and bitcoin space.  The cost of savings  Given President Trump's ambitious agenda (which includes rolling back major pieces of Dodd-Frank, eliminating two regulations for every new regulation enacted and keeping a potentially static budget for the SEC and the CFTC), the agencies seemingly will need to be judicious in how they use their resources.  What does this mean for blockchain and bitcoin?  Since the CFTC is currently working with only three of five commissioners, and acting chairman Christopher Giancarlo is awaiting confirmation, it will take time to assess and implement any changes.  Giancarlo has a background in markets, and has publicly embraced a more collaborative approach to blockchain. He has spoken about his willingness to leverage technology and supports having ""savvy teams"" work with fintech companies.  With resources at a premium, the CFTC may need to employ a cost benefit analysis on any additional regulation. With this pragmatic view in mind, it seems likely in the short term that the CFTC won't have the bandwidth to focus much on blockchain and bitcoin.  In this scenario, I see blockchain being supported by the CFTC in various forms, including dedicated support, collaboration and perhaps the creation of a regulatory sandbox, akin to what is in place in the UK.  For bitcoin, any scarce resources will likely be for enforcement actions and to ensure certain types of impermissible options and futures trading are prevented.  A global movement  The populist movement that led to the 'Brexit' and President Trump will also have an effect on how blockchain is regulated overseas. The result could be a realignment of regulatory strategy in other regions.  In Europe, amid the uncertainty over the exit of the UK from the EU, fintech companies, including those focused on blockchain and bitcoin, will have to recalibrate their approach to doing business in Europe.  A number of companies that were planing to passport their business into the EU through Luxembourg or other fintech-friendly jurisdictions will also now need to work directly with the UK.  The UK, with its fintech-friendly regulatory sandbox, and Ireland, seem to have the most to gain in this regulatory realignment. We may see a number of blockchain companies move their headquarters or significant operations to London and pursue opening offices in Ireland as a passport into the EU.  Major changes in the political landscape are likely to affect how blockchain and bitcoin companies do business going forward.  In the US, we have witnessed a number of cross-currents on what financial regulation will look like going forward.  With President Trump’s ambitious agenda and focus on deregulation and federal hiring freezes, will the regulatory environment keep up with rapid changes to blockchain and bitcoin? Will we see companies apply for and receive fintech charters? Is a regulatory sandbox for blockchain companies in the US on the horizon? Will a bitcoin ETF be approved?  Only time will tell – but 2017 is shaping up to be a very interesting year.
