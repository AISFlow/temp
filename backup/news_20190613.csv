The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the social media giant has signed on more than a dozen backers for its GlobalCoin cryptocurrency, a stablecoin that has been developed in secrecy for more than six months. Each of the new backers will invest roughly $10 million in the project as part of a governing consortium for the cryptocurrency.  Stripe, Booking.com and MercadoLibre are part of the project, according to the Journal, though the report does not specify what their roles are.  Facebook announced it was launching GlobalCoin last December, though the company indicated that it was looking at cryptocurrency as far back as the end of 2017. The crypto is expected to be a stablecoin that will operate within the company's messaging infrastructure – WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger.  However, Facebook has been tight-lipped about what exactly GlobalCoin will be used for, though the BBC suggested that Facebook may look to retailers, allowing its users to purchase discounted goods using the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency would be used to transfer value directly from Facebook to the retailer, cutting out credit card companies in the middle, which BBC suggests would help the retailers' profits.

42382134,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfHt,1560463245,Rhode Island Looks to Adopt Blockchain For Government Use,"Rhode Island issued a request for proposals aimed at exploring the viability of blockchain technology to improve state operations. This comes on the heels the state relaxing certain security laws for blockchain businesses.  Is the second-most dense state by population looking to become a hub for the crypto industry?  Director of the Department of Business Regulation Liz Tanner said in a statement she believes blockchain represents the modernization of government and would enable bureaucratic efficiency in the state. She also said Rhode Island’s initiatives were inspired by the adoption of blockchain by overseas governments.  The request for proposals is not looking for specific answers to specific problems, but is keeping an open mind to the possibilities of the emerging technology. A memo following the RFP states, “Suggested areas of application... include antifraud, contracts, medical marijuana, records, notarization, registration and licensing, investigative evidence control and more.”  Brenna McCabe, director of public affairs for the Department of Administration in Rhode Island, told Government Technology that this long list of possible applications is meant to entice more bidders, all of whom are required to submit two proofs of concept for blockchain application.  McCabe said state officials did not want to stifle the ingenuity of the industry by limiting the scope of the RFP.  It’s only after the state receives proposals that they can conceive of what the technology offers. “With proofs of concept, [Rhode Island] can gain a better understanding of the maturity of blockchain technologies and platforms, as well as potential sustainability in state government operations,” the memo stated.  The proposals will be reviewed by a technical evaluation committee composed of staff from various state agencies. “The initial contract period is estimated to begin Aug. 13 for a time period determined by the winning bid(s),” according to the RFP.  Anticipated problems will stem from laws, regulations and licensing structures that would require changes to allow for blockchain use, said McCabe. Though state leaders will have a better idea of what needs to be tweaked once proposals are reviewed.

42382149,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfVj,1560457800,$6 Million in Stolen Binance Bitcoin Is On the Move Again,"Hackers are now accessing wallets containing cryptocurrency stolen from Binance in May. Coinfirm, the company that tracked the original few moves in early May has spotted a massive outflow from the original hoard of wallets created on May 7, 2019.  Coinfirm's co-founder., Grant Blaisdell, wrote:  The attack was conducted using diversified techniques including viruses and phishing. According to Binance, stolen funds constituted approximately 2 percent of total BTC holdings of the exchange. In order to prevent user’s funds from being affected and guarantee stable work of the platform, Binance used its SAFU fund to cover the loses. The Secure Asset Fund for Users was established on July 14, 2018 and consists of 10 percent of all trading fees.  According to Coinfirm, the hackers then moved 1,060.64474480 BTC or $6,148,122.40 in a number of hops, shedding value each time. On June 7, 2019, the hacker moved the $6 million from this wallet, called bc1q2r..., to this wallet, bc1q65..., shedding an odd $15.84 dollars into this small wallet and adding $2 million to the total. It's not clear why this small an amount ""hopped"" out of the wallet.  The next hop moved 1,040.95915580 BTC ($8,242,840.00) into this wallet, shedding $155,861.00 into another wallet, 1JSfJ.... This shows a concerted effort to break up the bigger wallets into smaller chunks.  Finally, Coinfirm saw a final hop of 1,021.53182514 BTC ($8,089,010.00) into this wallet, again shedding $153,835.00 into this wallet. The remaining BTC ended up in ""bc1qcgwn2nv906k3rws803zhxwq3crfgjvnzjejgyq"" and has not moved since.  This pattern of hops and ""shedding"" suggests either some sort of side payment to other parties or further efforts at laundering the cash using what appears to be a series of calculated moves aimed at scrambling the source of the funds. Given each of these wallets are now being watched carefully by legitimate exchanges it could be quite difficult - but not impossible - to convert these wallets to fiat.

42382146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfUT,1560456028,New Monero Botnet Looks Like Last Year's Outlaw Attack,"There’s another Monero mining botnet that’s targeting China. Or maybe it’s one we’ve seen before.  Bloggers steeped in the hacker-verse recently exposed a URL spreading a botnet that looks suspiciously like one unleashed by the Outlaw hacking group last year. The Outlaw outfit -- a name coined by its discoverers at Trend Micro, who translated “the Romanian word haiduc, the hacking tool the group primarily uses” -- is infamous for its previous release of a Perl-based shellbot that infiltrates through weaknesses in the Internet of Things.  The new attack, uncovered by Trend Micro’s honeypot security systems, has been restricted to computers based in China so far. The malware is spread through a malicious URL which bundles in a Monero-mining script and a backdoor-based exploit.  Trend Micro estimates that hackers have used crypto-jacking to mine $250,000 per month in Monero.  The Outlaw botnet uses a brute force attack and Secure Shell (SSH) exploit to give the attackers remote access over victim’s systems. A more detailed report of Outlaw’s previous attack showed that once the attackers have access, the malware executes commands to download and install the cryptocurrency miner payload. Additionally, if the malware detects cryptocurrency miners already installed on the system, it will delete them to reduce competition for system resources.  The security experts also noted that the backdoor component is also capable of launching distributed denial-of-service attacks which would allow the cybercriminals to monetize their botnet not only through mining, but by offering DDoS-for-hire services.  However, because the scripts haven’t been activated, Trend Micro believes the hackers are still in the testing and development phase. They suggest the malware may be laying dormant until future editions of the botnet are released.  This comment lead TheNextWeb to speculate whether the botnet has mined any cryptocurrency or made any successful attacks yet.

42382145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfQh,1560453916,"Circle Is Closing Its Mobile App, Circle Pay, This September","Circle announced Thursday it would be discontinuing its mobile app, Circle Pay.  In a blog post, the company announced a multi-phase wind-down wrapping up on September 30, when remaining funds will be turned over to states or countries, in accordance with local laws. Starting on July 8, only withdrawals will be allowed on the app.  The company says the five-year-old product saw demand, but that stablecoins have proven to be a better focus.  Circle spokesman Josh Hawkins told CoinDesk via email:  ""Circle Pay is a popular social payment app that has seen significant organic growth over the years across the U.S. and Europe. But now that we have USD Coin and an open, interoperable stablecoin standard through CENTRE, it makes sense to sunset our first-generation effort and transition full focus to wallet services that take a bigger step toward reaching our original vision for a free, open and transparent global payments network.""  The news came on the same day that CENTRE, the consortium created by Circle and Coinbase to advance USDC, began opening itself to new members.  Circle was founded in 2013 with the idea of making payments with cryptocurrency as easy as using apps like Venmo. In 2015, it became the first company to earn New York's controversial BitLicense.  The company released a bitcoin wallet in 2014 that would eventually lay the foundation for what became Circle Pay.  When the app first integrated fiat payments, CEO Jeremy Allaire told Wired in 2015: “If I say I believe in the bitcoin movement and I want to hold bitcoin instead of dollars, but a friend doesn’t necessarily care about bitcoin ... Circle will convert any money that friend sends me to bitcoin.”  In 2017, Circle made withdrawals to debit cards from the Pay app free.  The company has announced cost-cutting measures in recent months, including 30 layoffs in May.

42382133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfE7,1560451563,Binance Says It's Launching a US Exchange With FinCEN-Registered Partner,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is launching a U.S. division.  The Malta-based company said Thursday it is setting up Binance US, a new trading platform specifically targeting U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services. The platform will be operated by BAM, while using Binance's wallet and matching engine technologies.  The exchange did not provide a firm timeline for the launch.  The move would represent the first formal entry into the U.S. market by Binance, although residents have already been able to access its trading platform.  According to Bitwise Asset Management, Binance processed some $250 million in bitcoin spot transactions over the past 24 hours, while CoinMarketCap reports $1.7 billion in crypto transactions at the exchange overall.  In a statement, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said ""we are excited to finally launch Binance US and bring the security, speed, and liquidity of Binance.com to North America,"" adding:  ""Binance US will be led by our local partner BAM and will serve the U.S. market in full regulatory compliance.""  Mystery partner  It is unclear who BAM Trading Services is. The company did register as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), with an address listed in San Francisco, California.  However, the registration document notes that ""FinCEN does not verify information submitted by the MSB,"" and the document ""reflects only what was provided directly"" to the regulator.  Under the terms of the MSB registration, the company has only registered to conduct business in California.  BAM Trading appears to be working with Koi Compliance, the ""fully-managed solutions"" wing of over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trader Koi Trading, since BAM's mailing address on the FinCEN registration is c/o Koi. Binance Labs invested $3 million in Koi Trading on January 24.  In a press release, an unidentified ""representative from BAM Trading Services"" was quoted as saying ""it is an honor to partner with Binance ... leveraging its tier-one security and technology in tandem.""  ""We are committed to providing a secure and compliant platform, and beginning the start of a fruitful alliance with Binance,"" the unnamed representative said.

42382132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qfBb,1560450601,BRD Partners With Wyre to Build Bank Transfer Wallet Feature,"BRD, a mobile wallet company, announced today that US customers are now able to purchase bitcoin, ethereum, and Dai using bank transfers. This feature is supported through a partnership with Wyre, a blockchain payments provider, and over 1,700 US banks.  Company representative Spencer Chen expects this partnership and product launch to close the divide between wallets and exchanges, and allow the company to become a player in the market for cryptocurrency entry.  “We’re more competitive with Coinbase than ever,” he told CoinDesk.  The announcement comes amid a period of growth for the wallet provider, which completed a $15 million round of series B funding in 2018. Since the start of 2019, BRD saw a doubling of transactions performed on its platform, a tripling of the number of existing, free users to premium customers, and the expansion to 170 countries.  BRD showed early promise in the field. In 2017, it received $32 million in an ICO, among the top 40 launches at the time. The upstart also saw early backing by SBI Holdings, a well-regarded Japanese venture capital fund. Despite BRD’s impressive funding line, the company still has negative cash flow.  “Profitability has not been a concern,” explained Chen. “Our investment roadmap is to first bring more banking services to the crypoto world, more mobile capabilities… and expand geographically.”  Chen said as a decentralized company, their products are easier to scale internationally. He also said the partnership with Wyre will expand the company’s footprint in the U.S., already BRD’s largest market.  The partnership with Wyre was forged six months ago, based on the young company’s tenacity.  “Wyre has a vision of being Stripe for crypto,” Chen said. Forgoing a retail presence, Wyre is able to dedicate its attention to powering the ecosystem’s infrastructure and making consumer apps work, instead of competing, he said. Founded in 2013, Wyre has managed $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency assets and completed over $1 billion in commercial FX payments.  BRD itself oversees, without taking custody, over $6 billion in crypto assets for two million customers, making it the ""most trusted"" mobile wallet available, according to a company statement. Though, “We’re not a monolith,” Chen said, the company is still looking for growth opportunities.  With the new bank transfer feature existing BRD users will be able to avoid traditionally high prices to convert their assets, and those looking to enter the space will have another affordable option to consider. Linking accounts will reportedly take five minutes.  “We’ve consistently heard from US customers about the frustrations regarding the lack of innovation and simplification from current market leaders, namely Coinbase,” said Aaron Lasher, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-founder of BRD. “While more well-funded players have become more custodial and centralized, BRD has remained unwavering in its mission to bring the core value of the blockchain to the masses: Decentralized and Inclusive.”  “There are a lot of young players in the ecosystem. It’s a relatively young industry,” Chen said.

The central questions asked in the survey are: who uses cryptocurrencies… and how? At this point, it should be disclosed that BitBay is the corporate owner of BitBay Pay, a cryptocurrency payments provider.  BitBay was founded in 2014 by Sylwester Suszek as the first Polish cryptocurrency exchange. The firm now serves over 800,000 clients and employs over 200 people.  Ten questions, 2,582 BitBay respondents.  First, the unsurprising news given the paucity of females in cryptocurrency tech: over 90 percent of survey respondents were male, more than 50 percent were below the age of 40, and the largest demographic were males between the ages of 31 and 35.  The majority of respondents owned more than one currency -- the most popular being BTC, with a 70 percent hold rate -- and over half owned more than four different coins. Every third BitBay user also has ETH, Lisk and Ripple.  Nine out of ten respondents consider digital currency to be a safe means of performing transactions, though the vast majority of respondents have not made a purchase using cryptocurrencies. Only 25 percent made at least one transaction. Of those that used cryptocurrency as a currency, 15 percent bought electronics, three percent bought food, and two percent used it to travel. Keep in mind that the regulatory position of cryptocurrency in Poland and much of Central Europe is still in flux.  The first two categories also appear among the most common answers to the question related to future purchases. Over 50 percent of respondents also declared that they would like to be able to pay with cryptocurrencies for automotive services.  The last question asked about user confidence. Over 90 percent believe that cryptocurrency payments will become increasingly popular.  This is a limited sample and a limited set of questions but it does point to the growth of interest in the technology but considerable uneasiness as exchanges seem to shutter overnight in the country.

42382106,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qclt,1560433127,Bakkt Reveals Bitcoin Futures Contract Details Ahead of July Test Date,"The Intercontinental Exchange's pending bitcoin platform Bakkt plans to begin testing its two futures contracts on July 22 of this year.  In a blog post that likened Bakkt's launch to the Apollo 11 moon landing, chief operating officer Adam White wrote Thursday that the platform will ""initiate user acceptance testing"" for its bitcoin futures contracts, which will be listed and traded by its parent company. Bakkt announced last month that it would begin testing in July, though it did not provide a specific date at the time.  In addition to the date, ICE provided new details for Bakkt's monthly contract, as well as updated the contract specifications for its daily contract.  Both contracts will see a minimum price fluctuation of $2.50 per bitcoin (with each contract containing one bitcoin). Trades may be executed at $0.01 per bitcoin, with a listing cycle that can last for as long as 12 months (for the monthly contract) or 70 consecutive eligible contract dates (for the daily contract).  Final settlement for both contracts will be at the Bakkt Warehouse.  Stepping back, ICE announced last year that it would be launching physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts. Unlike cash-settled contracts, such as what CME Group offers, customers receive an actual bitcoin on the contract's expiration, and not the fiat equivalent to bitcoin's price.  On Thursday, White wrote that Bakkt's mission is "" to support the development of trusted infrastructure for securely transacting in the new market for digital assets.""  The exchange initially announced potential launch dates last year and January of this year, though both were delayed due to a lack of regulatory approvals. The delay appears to stem in part from Bakkt's plan to warehouse its own bitcoin and clear trades through the ICE clearinghouse.  Bakkt has not yet announced a final launch date.  The company first revealed last month it was self-certifying its futures contracts, which included a daily contract that was previously announced and a monthly contract that was not.  ""This is no small step,"" White wrote Thursday. ""This launch will usher in a new standard for accessing crypto markets.""  He added:  ""Compared to other markets, institutional participation in crypto remains constrained due to limitations like market infrastructure and regulatory certainty. This results in lower trading volumes, liquidity, and price transparency than more established markets like ICE’s Brent Crude futures contract, which has earned global trust in setting the world’s price of crude oil.""

42382116,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qcvx,1560430838,Circle and Coinbase Open CENTRE Stablecoin Network to New Members,"Cryptocurrency firms Circle and Coinbase are a launching bold effort to make money as easy to move around the world as internet data and content.  In a press release sent to CoinDesk on Thursday, Circle said that, since the initial launch of the CENTRE consortium's US Dollar Coin (USDC) stablecoin, the two firms have been working to build and finalize what it's calling a ""membership-based framework and governance scheme for the development and growth of money on the internet.""  More formally called the CENTRE Network, the scheme is envisioned as a provider of new open standards to facilitate this dream.  According to Circle:  ""Ultimately, we foresee a global economic transformation that is made possible by programmable money. People and businesses will be able to enter into diverse economic arrangements with anyone in the world easily and safely. The global digital currency age aims to make the movement of value accessible and free for everyone on the planet so that more people and businesses can participate in economic activity and value exchange.""  CENTRE aims to enable crypto assets to function across multiple blockchains, both public and private.  While blockchains may proliferate and compete across many different use cases, they would ""benefit from a common interoperable fiat stablecoin for major currencies that is anchored in a full reserve, transparent and compliant governance scheme,"" Circle said.  As such, CENTRE is building standards that will work with a diverse, open and heterogenous ecosystem of chains, aiming to enable developers and blockchain protocol projects to build CENTRE implementations on their blockchains.  Jeremy Allaire, Circle co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk:  ""Circle and Coinbase are advancing a vision to make the movement of value more accessible and transparent, empowering more people and businesses around the world to participate in economic activity and value exchange.""  There are caveats, however. Members of the network will need to jointly contribute to the development of the CENTRE technical standards and open source software that support its protocols.  Member firms will also need to be licensed and regulated in the area of electronic money services in their operating jurisdictions. Circle cites banks, trust banks and money transmitters as examples.  Additionally, members must comply with regulatory requirements where they operate and must further meet the technical and operational requirements of the group's protocols.  No other partners beyond Coinbase and Circle are currently attached to the project, said a Circle spokesperson.  For those passing the high bar that's been set, CENTRE's issuing members will have the option to generate returns on reserve assets allocated to them, as well as create revenue by developing financial products and services based on CENTRE stablecoins.  Thus far, the firm said, more than $795 million in CENTRE's first stablecoin USDC has been issued, while over $11.9 billion has been traded on over 40 supporting exchanges such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Binance and Bitfinex.  CENTRE plans to grow its stablecoin support beyond the U.S. dollar, introducing new options across ""leading global reserve currencies."" It will also add new issuers and reserve custodians for these currencies.  The group ultimately imagines a ""new global digital currency"" that is backed by a basket of future reserve currency stablecoins – one that might also include bitcoin, the firm said.  It concluded:  ""The combination of these global digital currency tokens and open, permissionless public blockchains with smart contract infrastructure will form the foundation for a 21st century digitally-native global economy that empowers people everywhere to participate and grow value.""

As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitrefill just closed a $2 million seed round led by Coin Ninja, with participation from litecoin creator Charlie Lee, Fulgur Ventures and BnkToTheFuture.  Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho told CoinDesk his Stockholm-based startup plans to expand its offerings across jurisdictions to provide “worldwide coverage within the year.”  In a press release, Lee said Bitrefill services make it easier to “make a living” with cryptocurrency and that the startup’s participation in the lighting network ecosystem “opens up even more potential for bitcoin and beyond.”  Bitrefill’s Thor service, for example, allows people to give lightning channels to someone else with no setup on the recipient’s side. According to 1ML.com, Thor is the top service increasing lightning network capacity in terms of value, with almost $19,000 worth of bitcoin, and the top service provider running nodes on the network.  Although Carvalho declined to state how much revenue the 16-person team earned so far in 2019, he said the sector of the business that sells gift cards for cryptocurrency is growing rapidly. This seed round brings the company's total funding to $2.4 million from firms including Boost VC and others.  With regards to broader plans to deploy this capital in 2019, Carvalho added:  “We intend to continue offering additional new Lightning Network services, and to collaborate with more Bitcoin businesses to grow the network.”  Team image courtesy of Bitrefill",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | SPONSORED,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/13/bitcoin-startup-bitrefill-raises-2-million-funding-for-global-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0231a9a4a8a33c16e952b4b159bc82b50d7ec7e7-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qcsB,1560427249,'Monopoly'-Style Blockchain Property Trading Game Raises $2 Million,"FinLab EOS VC Fund and several angel investors have invested a combined $2 million in Uplandme, maker of a digital property-trading game running on top of the EOS blockchain.  The funds will be used to support the development and launch of Upland, which is currently available in beta, and will become widely available later this year.  Billed as ""'Monopoly' meets blockchain,"" as in the classic Parker Brothers board game, the game enables players to buy, sell, and trade imaginary properties based on real-world addresses. The twist is that instead of paper cards, it uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or digital collectibles similar to CryptoKitties, to confer ownership of an asset.  Unlike most digital games, however, properties that are recorded on the blockchain throughout the gameplay will be truly owned by the players, not the gaming company, Uplandme says. And just like in real life, land in this virtual realm has a fixed supply.  ""We expect that the game momentum will be driven by the simple fact that there is a natural scarcity of available properties because they are based on real-world addresses,” said Uplandme co-founder Dirk Lueth.  Lueth and his partners, Mani Honigstein and Idan Zuckerman, aim to disrupt the $50 billion market for casual (mass market) games.  “One game night, while playing Monopoly and watching the Netflix series ‘Stranger Things' we got thinking about a property game in a parallel universe and realized how properties that are based on real-world addresses can be the perfect collectible NFT,"" Lueth told CoinDesk.  Community chest  Angel investors in the seed round include Kai Bolik, co-founder and CEO of Gameduell, a gaming community with more than 70 games and 130 million players worldwide; Jan Sprengnetter, CEO of Sprengnetter Group, a property valuation provider; and Markus Ogurek, a former vice president of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  The lead investor, FinLab EOS VC Fund, is backed by Block.one, the company that built the EOS blockchain, and FinLab AG, which focuses on investing in German financial technology companies.  “We invested into Uplandme, Inc. because we like the genuine idea of a virtual property market powered by the EOS Blockchain and the very experienced and passionate team behind it,'' said Stefan Schuetze, managing director of FinLab EOS VC Fund.  To be sure, Upland is one among many blockchain-based games in various stages of development.  Upland players will be able to trade their properties on a marketplace for an in-game currency called UPX. Beta testers are currently able to trade properties in a virtual San Francisco.

But whereas MediLedger builds upon a private version of ethereum called Parity, the IBM/Walmart project will use Hyperledger Fabric – a sign that Walmart isn't yet committed to any single platform.  Big retailers broadly are clearly getting more comfortable with blockchain technology and exploring multiple options. Earlier this week, it emerged that Target is participating in a Hyperledger supply chain tracking project called Grid, while also pursuing its own blockchain project called ConsenSource.  Walmart was already one of the most prominent companies in the world to adopt distributed ledger technology (DLT), as a participant in IBM's Food Trust. That system is now out of testing and is used in the wild to track the movement of fruits and vegetables from the farm to the grocery aisle.  But the Bentonville behemoth is still early in its explorations of the pharmaceutical use case.  “We are learning, which is the point of these pilots, but our ultimate goal through both is to create a safer, more transparent supply chain for our customers,” said Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis.  Spurred by FDA  These pharmaceutical DLTs are coming to light at this moment in time because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now completing its approval of platforms for inclusion in a government-mandated pilot program.  The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) requires firms to be able to identify, track and trace prescription medicines and vaccines distributed within the U.S., down to a fairly granular level on the packaging of these products.  The new drug pilot will build on the work Big Blue has already done with Walmart, said Mark Treshock, IBM's blockchain solutions Leader for healthcare and life sciences.  “The project with KPMG Merck and Walmart, even though it's a pilot, is going to be leveraging the production blockchain platforms that we have developed for Walmart with FoodTrust and also with Maersk in TradeLens,"" he said, adding:  ""So, it's not just a science experiment.”  While he clarified food and drugs would not co-exist on the same blockchain, Treshock said FoodTrust relies on the same sort of data standards such as GS1, as is commonly used in life sciences.  Competing chains  On the subject of Walmart participating in a Hyperledger pilot with IBM and at the same time working with Mediledger’s ethereum-based blockchain, Eric Garvin, co-lead at MediLedger, said it was not surprising since Walmart and IBM collaborate on FoodTrust.  “Many pharma companies are participating in multiple pilots,” he said. “The strength of the MediLedger pilot is that it includes a diverse mix of industry companies (all segments of the supply chain, large companies, small companies, brand manufacturers, generics) and has the greatest support with at least 20 companies involved.”  The FDA’s mandate for drug tracking lists “interoperability” as a key requirement and putative benefit of digitalizing the supply chain, raising the question of whether competing enterprise blockchain protocols can be made to communicate with each other – or if businesses will eventually have to consolidate platforms.  IBM’s Treshock took a philosophical view on this, telling CoinDesk:  “We feel it's less about the technology, whether Hyperledger or ethereum – although that is certainly important – and more about interoperability at the business model level, by that I mean coming together and creating open networks.”  Walmart pharmacy image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/06/13/retail-giant-walmart-enters-second-drug-tracking-blockchain-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1885fdb6c252fa118e2b3a2176178905592c8921-1500x1033.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382127,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qd7H,1560423600,Bitcoin Price Eyes Chart Pattern That Kicked Off Bull Market in 2015,"View  Bitcoin's 50- and 100-candle moving averages on the three-day chart look set to produce a bullish crossover – a sign of bull market momentum. Back in October 2015, the same cross marked the start of a long-term bull market.  This time, BTC has already rallied more than 180 percent ahead of the bull cross. As a result, we may not see a big move to the higher side immediately following the confirmation of the bull cross.  Prices could rise to $8,400 in the next 24 hours, having witnessed a bearish channel breakout on Wednesday. A break below key 4-hour chart support at $7,910 would weaken the case for a rise to $8,400.  A long-term bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time in nearly four years.  The 50-candle moving average (MA) on the three-day chart is trending north and could soon cross above the 100-candle, confirming a bullish crossover – the first since October 2015.  A bullish crossover, as the same suggests, is a strong indicator of bull market momentum, according to technical analysis theory.  In reality, however, both bullish and bearish crossovers tend to lag prices. After all, the MA studies are based on historical data.  Even so, the upcoming bullish crossover warrants attention due to the fact that bitcoin broke into a 2.3-year long uptrend with the bullish crossover of the same averages in 2015.  3-day chart (2015)  BTC’s bear market ran out of steam at lows near $150 in January 2015, following which the price remained largely trapped in $200-$300 range for nine months before confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a move above the July 12 high of $318 on Oct. 28.  Notably, the 50- and 100-candle MAs had produced a bullish crossover on Oct. 16 – twelve days before BTC broke into a bull market.  The cryptocurrency then charted a steady stream of bullish higher lows and higher highs over the next two years to reach a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.  More importantly, lows near $220 seen ahead of the bull cross haven’t come into play till date.  3-day chart (2019)  The 50-candle MA could soon find acceptance above the 100-candle MA, confirming a bullish crossover.  This time, however, BTC may not immediately see a sharp rally as the cryptocurrency has already gained more than 185 percent in the last six months.  The relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over from overbought territory, signaling scope for a price pullback and is currently teasing a downside break of the trendline representing the uptrend from December lows. So, a temporary price pullback could be in the offing.  It is worth noting that the picture was somewhat different in 2015 with BTC stuck in a $100 range for nine months to October during which the averages bottomed out.  Further, the cryptocurrency was up just 67 percent from the bear market low and the RSI was reporting bullish conditions with an above 50-print when the crossover happened on Oct. 16, 2015. Put simply, BTC had room to rally on confirmation of the bullish crossover.  As for the next 24 hours, BTC may remain bid, having ended an eight-day long trading range of $7,500-$8,100 with a bullish breakout on Wednesday.  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $8,113 on Bitstamp, representing 1 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart  BTC found acceptance above $8,100 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday, confirming twin bullish cues – a falling channel breakout and a sideways channel breakout on the 4-hour chart.  As a result, the cryptocurrency has scope for a rally to $8,400. So far, however, the upside is being capped by the 100-candle MA, currently at $8,188.  The case for a rise to $8,400 would weaken if the repeated rejection at the 100-candle MA ends up sending prices below the ascending trendline support, currently at $7,910.

According to a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent published by FINRA on June 10, Kyung Soo Kim had been working at Merrill Lynch and was registered with the watchdog as a general securities representative through the firm from March 2014.  However, in December 2017 – the month bitcoin reached its all-time high of $20,000 – Kim formed a company called S Corporation to engage in crypto mining activities.  He also struck a deal with another firm to build and operate computer hardware and software for the mining effort, and transferred funds to that firm to pay for its services.  However, Kim failed to provide written notice of the mining venture to his employer at the time, Merrill Lynch, thus breaking two of FINRA's rules, numbered 3270 and 2010.  These specify that business activities outside the FINRA-registered employment must be declared in writing, and that FINRA-associated individuals must ""observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.""

42382118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qcxD,1560416712,John McAfee's New Crypto Trading Platform 'Magic' Goes Live,"Noted cybersecurity expert and eccentric crypto fan John McAfee has just launched a cryptocurrency trading platform.  Dubbed ""Magic,"" the site is touted as allowing users to ""trade cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges within a single dashboard, automatically and manually.""  Notably, the exchange appears to be non-custodial, with users' crypto holdings remaining on eight other exchange platforms. When a trade is executed, funds are transferred from those accounts to complete the transaction. To set this up, users will need to plug in APIs from their other exchanges.  In its guide to using the platform, Magic lists Binance, Kraken, Poloniex, Huobi, Bittrex, HitBtc, Exmo and Livecoin as the supported exchanges.  Two ""portals"" are on offer, one for normal spot trading, the other for ""shadow trading,"" in which a user's trades will be set to mimic those of pro-level traders who are ""ranked by the community by their trading success,"" McAfee indicated in a tweeted image.  Other features include the ""set and forget"" ability to set buy and sell orders at the same time. Users can also use the platform to make auto trades on their behalf. There are no jurisdictional restrictions on who can use the exchange.  Regarding the security on offer, the Magic's FAQs say that the site is hosted on ""top grade"" Amazon Web Service servers that come with DDoS protection and can ""scale on demand.""  The site also reads: ""We are only releasing this platform to the public after extensive testing and auditing processes that stretched months.""  Magic seems to have faced a DDoS attack even before launch. In a pre-launch tweet, McAfee quipped:  ""McAfeeMagic.com still under attack. New I.P. address in Texas. The more this goes on, the closer we get. Amazon AWS servers are ""learning"" the attack and will be up shortly. Catch up on work, make out with your partner or ""flash"" a random stranger and video while you wait.""  It should be noted, we don't recommend taking his advice.  Just 10 days ago, McAfee also announced he would launch a cryptocurrency dubbed the ""McAfee Freedom Coin"" this autumn.  Somewhat confusingly, he said at the time:  “The McAfee Freedom Coin is designed to confront the problem of exchange head-on… It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it’s natural market value is free, completely, to grow.""  However, the token does not seem to be linked to the operation of new exchange, at least not yet. The Magic site says it will use the fuel (ARB) ERC-20 token from a project called Arbitraging.

42382124,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qd3V,1560412844,"14 Banks, 5 Tokens: Inside Fnality's Expansive Vision for Interbank Blockchains","The Takeaway:  With $63.2 million in fresh funding from 14 banks, Fnality is building tokenized versions of five major fiat currencies.  The digitized fiat would be fully collateralized by cash held at central banks and is meant to solve the ""cash on ledger"" problem faced by other financial blockchain projects.  The consortium says it is open to working with JPMorgan, whose JPM Coin project has similar aims.  Fnality's tech partner, Clearmatics, is building these systems on a private version of ethereum.      Fnality International is building the missing link in the banking blockchain.  Formerly known as Utility Settlement Coin (USC), the newly rechristened U.K.-based project is developing blockchain versions of five major fiat currencies: the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the euro. Led by former Deutsche Bank executive Rhomaios Ram, the consortium boasts an ample budget, having just raised $63.2 million from 14 shareholder banks.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Ram and other bank and tech executives involved in Fnality shed some light on the previously secretive project's plans – starting with the role these tokens, still referred to as USC, would play in the enterprise blockchain ecosystem and the wider financial world.  What's the point of representing fiat currency, the very thing bitcoin sought to usurp, on a blockchain? According to Ram, it's a means to an end, not an end in itself.  He pointed to the many private blockchain projects trying to tokenize wholesale markets, either at the proof of concept stage or close to production. All are lacking one thing: fiat currency on the ledger.  In other words, it's all well and good if a stock or bond zips around on a distributed electronic network, but if the cash side of the trade is being done the old-fashioned way, it'll still take days to settle, defeating much of the purpose.  Hence, the USC would address what many in the industry have come to refer to as the ""cash on ledger"" problem. To Ram, the funding round disclosed last week was an important validation of this idea. He told CoinDesk:  “The real story here is that a committed group of investors believes they have found the answer to the cash leg. Now that’s a giant marker for pushing the tokenization of wholesale markets.”  Bridge to JPM Coin?  To be sure, megabank JPMorgan Chase (not one of Fnality's shareholders) has similar ideas for JPM Coin, the fiat-backed cryptocurrency it is developing for its clients to send each other money.  “We really think this cash token is the foundation for enabling other enterprise blockchain applications,"" Christine Moy, executive director and head of JPMorgan's Blockchain Center of Excellence, said at Consensus 2019 last month, ""We've been researching enterprise blockchain now for about four years; many different use cases varying from supply chain finance to financial markets and all of them need a payment leg.""  But JPMorgan, massive as it is, is just one bank.  Ram said he and his team “definitely anticipate several banks producing their own individual coin for their own individual ecosystem."" Although not Fnality's primary goal, there would still be a need for the equivalent of correspondent banking between an ecosystem of bank coins, he said.  So, if JPM Coin were to be joined by a hypothetical Barclays Coin, for example, Fnality's token, known as USC, could operate as a bridge between these.    “As well as existing asset-side DLT projects (e.g. bond issuance and collateral tokenization), we can imagine USC being compatible with and having benefit for something like JPM Coin, where owners of the JPM Coin may want to transfer their holdings to another bank coin,” said Ram. “In other words, we could act like a tokenized correspondent channel.”    While JPMorgan wouldn't comment for this article, there's clearly some mutual admiration:    Thanks @_JohnWhelan ... still need that central bank level money tho! Excited to see your Utility Settlement Project continue progress and momentum. #puzzlepieces        /cc @clearmatics @hyder_jaffrey @bankersplumber https://t.co/fEgQEuANvR    — Christine “Not Giving Away JPM Coin” Moy (@cmoyall) February 17, 2019      Secret sauce  But more crucial to Fnality's plan is connecting each decentralized market infrastructure (one for each currency jurisdiction) to a corresponding central bank.  Stepping back, trade settlement today requires businesses to hold accounts in multiple locations to handle cash and securities, splintering liquidity and leading to a mess of post-trade pipes and buffers that kick in and delay the settlement of the trade.  Cash held in reserve at a central bank being brought onto a blockchain would cut through the Gordian Knot tying up each jurisdiction, making settlement instant, removing counterparty risk and freeing up capital, Fnality reckons.  Exactly how this will be achieved involves a complex mix of regulatory and technical issues – a process Ram described as “a journey of discovery.""  On the legal side, the new name hints at Fnality's secret sauce, according to Robert Sams, CEO of Clearmatics, the consortium's tech partner.  Describing how the system will work, he told CoinDesk:  “Legal settlement finality is happening inside the system's blockchain rather than across the books of a legacy settlement institution. This might appear to be a subtle distinction, but it's what turns a cryptographic key pair into cash itself. It's a foundational distinction.”  USC vs CBDCs  Flying under the radar for most of its four-year existence, Fnality has invited speculation about how cross-border tokenized fiat will be collateralized at the central bank level.  Hyder Jaffrey, strategic investment and fintech innovation manager at Swiss bank UBS, one of Fnality's shareholders, pointed to an important difference between so-called central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects and what Fnality does.  Jaffrey told CoinDesk:  “Central bank digital currency is issued by the domestic central bank and hence backed by the central bank itself. The USC is commercial bank money. The design of it allows it to carry some of the characteristics of central bank money. Ultimately, how we are achieving that is through the cash collateral backing the USC sitting at the domestic central bank. It's a nuance but it's very important.”  Commercial bank and central bank money have different characteristics: the former carries credit and commercial counterparty risk; the latter carries sovereign risk. Fnality is exploring an uncharted path between the two, Sams said.  “Money is usually in the form of either commercial bank money (the liability of a commercial bank) or central bank money (the liability of a central bank),"" he told CoinDesk. But USC ""is a tokenized asset that has similar credit risk properties to central bank money, without being a substitute for central bank money.”  Design and roadmap  Clearmatics’ blockchain architecture for Fnality is a private version of ethereum called Autonity. A distributed state transition system, where all participants on the chain keep a continually updated record of the blockchain's full state, is essential to ensure the system's resiliency, Sams said.  Such a full-broadcast system has been tested at the central bank level, by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and it raised some performance issues.  However, Lee Braine of the CTO office of the investment bank at Barclays, another Fnality shareholder, pointed out that volumes in the wholesale interbank space that Fnality is targeting are very different from retail bank payments and as such the performance characteristics would also be very different.  While many market infrastructures tend to centralize parts of their blockchain solutions for the sake of efficiency, the resiliency aspect is at the heart of much central bank research with universities and others, Braine said.  Looking ahead, Fnality’s complex roadmap will see things begin to come to fruition in 2020, the company said. (Aside from UBS and Barclays, its shareholders include Banco Santander, BNY Mellon, CIBC, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, ING, KBC Group, Lloyds Banking Group, MUFG Bank, Nasdaq, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and State Street.)  Speaking practically, the first products may be simple payments, said Braine. Then it would move to more complex currency swaps, for example, as in classic foreign exchange, or involving some kind of security, formalized as delivery versus payment (DvP), meaning both sides of the trade are completed simultaneously.  “As you move down that roadmap you get greater value, but it's also the case that you need to integrate with market infrastructures to get more value,"" Braine said, concluding:  ""So you can imagine looking across clearinghouses and exchanges, and thinking ahead a few years from now, you see the scenario where more of them are using tokenized assets.”  London subway via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/13/14-banks-5-tokens-inside-fnalitys-expansive-vision-for-interbank-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9af512796aac9e061fae3db5c0eaef6727bec67-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382126,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qd0z,1560398435,Could Bitcoin's Lightning Power Mobile Communications? This Startup Thinks So,"New research from mobile mesh networking company goTenna explores how mobile communications can be decentralized with the help of bitcoin's lightning network.  Technologists have long explored how to use cryptocurrencies and blockchains to build programs where users are more in control of their data. GoTenna, the company behind mesh network devices for internet-less connections, is exploring a novel approach.  To that end, the GoTenna team has released a new paper describing how decentralized mesh networks for sending ""mobile communications"" (such as text messages) could be powered by bitcoin micropayments. What's more, they've establised a new subsidiary Global Mesh Labs LLC to move forward with this goal.  ""80 billion mobile messages are sent each day via carriers and [Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]. Mobile mesh networks offer an anti-fragile, decentralized alternative that can extend connectivity to places centralized networks can’t,"" the project website argues.  One hurdle to mesh network adoption is that people aren’t really incentivized to run the infrastructure required to relay data across the network, the paper argues. GoTenna attempts to fix that by describing a new “trust-minimized” protocol with bitcoin’s lightning at the center, called Lot49, which would pay users for relaying data.  ""Any node can earn a reward for relaying data for others and by being at the right place at the right time,"" the paper, written by goTenna engineer Richard Myers, explains.  The proposal is reliant on a couple of bitcoin proposals that have been widely discussed, but haven't yet been incorporated: Schnorr and sighash_noinput. Before building and trying out the protocol, these things will need to be added, if the bitcoin community agrees that they are good changes to make.  One is Schnorr, a much-anticipated, new bitcoin signature scheme that was first proposed years ago, and has seen progress recently through the release of test code.  “To reduce incentive protocol overhead we propose using signature aggregation, simplex payment channel updates and payment channels formed between mesh nodes within direct communication range,” the paper explains.
