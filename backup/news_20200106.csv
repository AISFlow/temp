42431368,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN237h,1578345891,Taking the TON Out of Telegram,"Last week, the U.S. government took out a key Iranian military leader. As the world – and the markets – reacts to the news, some are asking, What happens with bitcoin? With global instability on the rise, will more people turn to bitcoin as a safe-haven asset? Will speculators drive the price up on that narrative even if it doesn’t bear out in reality? If Iranians use crypto, will that draw the attention and ire of regulators?      In a different area of the industry, Telegram has released updated information about their forthcoming crypto token TON. Most notable was the bombshell that the token would not be integrated into Telegram Messenger – which was, of course, the predominant logic behind the more than $1.7B that was invested in the TON presale.      Finally, we discuss the dust up around Nakamoto.com, a new crypto journal that was almost immediately accused of affinity scamming and censorship. Is it a case of overzealous bitcoin defenders or does the critique hold merit?",NEUTRAL,TON,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | TON,Nathaniel Whittemore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/06/taking-the-ton-out-of-telegram,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d4fd88862e19ca2811f8548376a7ba1c8c4f75b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431373,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN23Jh,1578345591,Bitcoin as a Safe Haven? US-Iran Tensions Rekindle Debate,"Bitcoin’s recent price jump after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general has rekindled a long-running debate among investors: whether it will work as a safe-haven asset like gold in times of heightened geopolitical and economic turmoil.      The cryptocurrency changed hands around $7,500 on Monday, up about 10 percent since Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani, was killed in a lethal drone strike authorized by U.S. President Donald Trump. U.S. stocks fell on the news as investors worried the conflict between the two nations might escalate into a prolonged and damaging war.      For some market analysts and investors, bitcoin’s rally served to underscore the digital asset’s perceived value as a hedge against inflation, historically an economic consequence of major wars. Oil prices jumped in the aftermath of the killing, given Iran’s status as one of the world’s major producers, potentially a harbinger of higher gasoline costs at the pump for U.S. consumers.       “Acts of violence and war can create inflation and have demonstrated that in the past,” said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, which analyzes crypto markets. So heightened violence now could portend higher demand for bitcoin, he said, adding a major caveat: “To the extent that bitcoin is a hedge against inflation.”       In traditional investing, a safe haven asset is one where the price typically rises when traders are fearful of increasing risk, or in the face of convulsing stock markets; money is pulled from riskier assets and shifted into “safer” like gold or U.S. Treasuries, expected to be a more reliable store of value.       One theory among bitcoin investors is that while the cryptocurrency lacks gold’s luster or long track record as a store of value, it shares the key property of being difficult to mine; the supply of new bitcoin is strictly regulated by its 11-year-old original programming code.       What’s more, some bitcoin advocates note the private data addresses, or “keys,” needed to spend the cryptocurrency would theoretically be far more portable than gold bars in a tumultuous, war-torn or even simply hyperinflation-racked world.       But even among fully committed crypto traders, it remains an open debate as to whether bitcoin actually trades like a safe-haven asset.       Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, emailed clients a chart from the data provider CoinMetrics showing the correlation between bitcoin and gold - accepted by most investors as a traditional hedge against inflation - had recently swung from negative to positive.       But in a follow-up exchange with CoinDesk, Greenspan said the correlation looks “weak.”      “It’s not a very strong correlation at all,” according to Greenspan. Based on data compiled by CoinMetrics, the correlation coefficient over a one-year time period between gold and bitcoin is now a mere 0.15, up from -0.04 back in May 2018.      In the case of Iran, there’s speculation locals might try to shift money into bitcoin to shield their wealth from inflation. That might occur as the country becomes more economically isolated from global finance.       Even Iran’s leaders are contemplating using cryptocurrency as a way to offset pressure from sanctions. In late December, President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech in Malaysia that Muslims need their own cryptocurrency to “save themselves from the domination of the U.S. dollar and the American financial regime.”       Michael Novogratz, CEO of the investment firm Galaxy Digital and one of the most closely watched investors in the crypto space, tweeted Sunday that the “the more I analyze this Iranian situation,” the more bullish the case becomes for gold and bitcoin.       “Mideast less stable,” Novogratz tweeted. “Equals more volatility.”       In an email to clients on Friday, Ryan Selkis of the data provider Messari acknowledged some of the most hyperinflationary periods of modern history occurred around the end of major violent conflicts like World Wars I and II and the Cold War.       However, Selkis argues bitcoin is a “risk asset” and would be among the first things investors liquidate “in the event of an uptick in global economic and regulatory uncertainty.”       “That cyclical pain could be exacerbated by further crackdowns on the industry,” Selkis wrote.       Not all cryptocurrency observers are convinced tensions with Iran have anything to do with the recent rally. Adam Vettese, U.K. market analyst for trading platform eToro, noted Monday in an email that while some market observers say the recent rally “affirms bitcoin’s status as a safe haven,” the price reaction might have simply been “a technical move off support at $7,000.”       That means the price was essentially just bouncing off a perceived price floor of $7,000, as determined by traders scrutinizing price charts for patterns, using a subjective practice known as technical analysis.       “There’s no way” the term safe haven applies “in the same sense as gold,” according to Vettese. “Cryptoassets in general are considered high risk and therefore such a description is a contradiction in itself.”       The safest bet is this debate in the bitcoin market won’t be settled anytime soon.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/06/bitcoin-as-a-safe-haven-us-iran-tensions-rekindle-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c57ebb0313975ea04265dfc89765142b0877583d-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new service, translated from the Chinese as Open Network, will enable users to develop and deploy applications without building their own blockchain platforms, according to a Chinese media report by STCN, a state-owned daily newspaper.      It is part of Baidu’s enterprise blockchain network Xuperchain and aims to attract smaller users with lower cost and technological barriers.      The move also fits into the Chinese government’s embrace of blockchain and its desire to encourage its use by smaller businesses throughout the country.      Baidu said the cost for using the new service can be as low as 1 yuan (US14 cents) with its quantity-based fee structure until March, according to the report. To simplify the process to build applications, the new service allows customers to use smart contracts templates and other functional components designed to increase efficiency.      According to the company’s website, the Xuperchain network has nearly 3.5 million users and has processed over 450 million transactions. The network has seven masternodes including Tsinghua University and streaming services giant iQiyi to help and verify transactions on the platform.      Baidu announced in May it would make its Xuperchain network open source to the public and look into the potential challenges its prospective users could encounter.      The new service is not the company’s first effort to help developers build their own applications. In February, Baidu Cloud launched Baidu Blockchain Engin (BBE) to tackle storage and computing issues for developers when they try to build applications.

42383140,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uEJz,1578331351,AuthenTrend's AT.Wallet Offers Fingerprint Security in Ultrathin Package,"LAS VEGAS — A Taiwanese security company called AuthenTrend is trying something new in the ultraslim wallet world. Its first product? A cold wallet the size of two credit cards back to back that features an e-ink screen and fingerprint-based security.      The thin plastic wallet uses biometrics to temporarily unlock the device in order to display a QR code for deposits along with current crypto balances. The device comes with a USB ""case"" that allows a person to connect it to a computer as well as low-energy Bluetooth support for syncing with iOS and Android devices.      The device, called the AT.Wallet, will be available in the U.S. in February, said Vice President Zake Huang.      AuthenTrend makes devices for bank security and this is its first cold crypto wallet. The device holds private keys and includes a 24-word mnemonic recovery system. Huang said the company would support ""bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ethereum"" and can add other currencies such as ripple in the future. You can view wallet balances on the screen by pushing a button on the back of the device.      It's difficult to test the security of this kind of wallet without tearing it apart but the ""public"" functions – namely the e-ink screen – are designed to offer as low an attack surface as possible. Without the app, the device can only display basic information about your wallet, including balance, and only when you activate the biometrics. The device is new and is currently being tested with customers, so you probably shouldn't put your entire BTC hoard onto this thing.    Given its size and battery life, however, I suspect this might be a good ""walking around"" wallet for those who want to stick something into their real, physical wallet. Like Bobby Lee's Ballet card, portability and usability are key here. The AT.Wallet still has a way to go – the app crashed multiple times on enrollment – but the form factor and biometrics make it a competitor to the EAL5+ security chip-powered D'CENT Biometric Wallethttps://dcentwallet.com/overview/specification.html and the card-like CoolWallet S. The company is working on desktop versions of the software.    Huang didn't offer pricing for the device and said the company is planning to sell it primarily on Amazon.

42383124,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uE3d,1578329885,Telegram Tries to 'Clarify' Gram Crypto Project Amid Ongoing SEC Fight,"Telegram will not integrate a crypto wallet into its messaging app, at least until it gets the green light from U.S. regulators, the company said Monday on its official website. The announcement comes ahead of Telegram’s CEO deposition in Dubai on Tuesday.      The post, which appears to be the first official notice addressing the TON blockchain project, is signed by “The Telegram Team” and describes the relationship between Telegram and TON.      “In light of recent events, we wanted to take the time to publicly clarify certain aspects of the TON Blockchain and Grams as we continue to prepare for a successful launch of the project,” the post reads, apparently referring to the lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) brought against Telegram in October.      The statement purports to detail Telegram's dedication to legal compliance, even as the company fights the SEC on claims that it intended to flood U.S. capital markets with unregistered securities.      “Grams are NOT investment products and there should be NO expectation of future profit or gain from the purchase, sale or holding of Grams,” the notice reads, adding that the tokens don’t represent equity in Telegram, dividend rights or governance rights in Telegram “and its affiliates,” although it’s not specified what entities are meant by this term.      “Grams won't help you get rich,” the post says.      More significantly, Telegram changed its plans to make grams readily available to all Telegram users. According to the new notice, the wallet for the tokens will only be available as a stand-alone app, which has been recently released in beta.      In October, Telegram published its Terms of Service for the wallet, saying Gram Wallet would be integrated into the messenger in addition to the standalone product at the time.      “Telegram may integrate the TON Wallet application with the Telegram Messenger service in the future to the extent permitted under applicable laws and governmental authorities,” the posts says, seemingly indicating that for now, users will only be able to use the standalone product.    Public comments    Telegram's post also addresses its past lack of comment on the TON project.      Telegram “has been careful not to speak publicly” about the project, which raised $1.7 billion in a closed and secretive token pre-sale in 2018, “to ensure that the TON Blockchain and Grams can operate in a way that is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations,” the post explains.      The team confirmed Telegram had been working on the TON blockchain and gram cryptocurrency since 2017, according to the post.      ""We hope that as a result of this project Grams will become a true complement to traditional currencies, improving the speed, efficiency and security of everyday commercial transactions globally,” the post reads.      Perhaps to make up for this past reticence, Telegram's blog post insists TON will be a decentralized network, which the company may not ""develop any applications or features for ... or otherwise contribute [to] in any way"" once the network is live.      Telegram’s employees also won’t use their own grams to participate in transaction validation and on-chain voting, the post says.      “This voluntary decision was made in order to avoid any perception that Telegram or its employees can or will exercise control over the TON Blockchain following its launch,"" it explained.      Telegram is also ""under no obligation"" to establish a TON Foundation, the organization designed to “promote and support the TON Blockchain,” according to the early marketing materials, the post said.      According to Telegram's communications with the SEC in 2018, the company also previously considered changing the functions of the TON Reserve, another entity Telegram would launch to maintain the supply of gram tokens.      The post also warned against buying future tokens on the unofficial secondary market that flourished after the pre-sale was completed. “Grams don't exist yet, nobody can buy or sell them before we announce the launch of TON Blockchain. Don't get scammed,” the notice says.      Perhaps most notably, Monday's post seems to be attempting to retroactively negate any previous marketing materials about the project, saying, ""Please note that the below is intended to supersede and replace all prior materials or communications regarding the TON Blockchain and Grams.""    Waiting for Durov’s testimony    Telegram has been fighting the SEC’s attempt to halt the launch of TON altogether. In October, the company secured approval from TON investors to postpone the launch until the end of April, after a previously scheduled Oct. 31, 2019, to give Telegram time to resolve its legal fight.      The SEC demanded Telegram’s employees, including CEO Pavel Durov, testify in the depositions for the case. Durov’s deposition is scheduled to take place on Jan. 7 and 8 in Dubai. Telegram Vice President Ilia Perekopsky, known to have an active role in the $1.7 billion fundraiser, should have been deposed on Dec. 16, according to the court order, and the investor relations officer Shyam Parekh on Dec. 10.      A short excerpt from Parekh’s deposition has been released by the SEC, in which he explained that roughly 70 percent of TON's presale backers and 90 percent of its Stage A fundraisers had approved pushing the launch date.      Few backers opposed the delay, with the balance of investors simply not responding, he said.      On Friday, the SEC requested Telegram's bank information to see how it spent the $1.7 billion it raised during the token presale. Telegram's attorney, Alexander Drylewski, in another filing responded that the company has already provided ""a detailed breakdown of all expenditures it made between January 1, 2018 and January 31, 2019.""      SEC attorney Jorge Tenreiro, however, insisted Telegram did not provide all the information the SEC sought, such as how much Telegram paid its underwriters.      ""The SEC also has evidence that certain entities tendered invoices to Telegram for commissions ranging between 10 percent to 15 percent to Telegram based on the sale of certain Purchase Agreements, purportedly on the basis of contracts between those entities and Telegram dated in June 2018,"" the SEC filing says, emphasizing the data is important for the nature of the litigation:      ""These documents undermine Telegram’s claimed affirmative defense that the Offering was exempt under Regulation D. First, Telegram either raised more than the $1.7 billion for which it claimed an exemption, or it did not raise $1.7 billion as of March 29, 2018 and the later funds may have been raised through underwriters.""      According to a court filing by Drylewski, Telegram again opposed the SEC's request to provide the information on ""every single transfer to and from"" Telegram as ""irrelevant, overly broad and unnecessary.""      On Monday Judge P. Kevin Castel of the U.S. District Court in New York declined the SEC's motion for Telegram to disclose bank records before or during Durov's deposition, according to a report from Inner City Press. Instead, the judge ordered Telegram to file a proposed schedule to disclose the information, or at least review for privacy concerns, the requested bank records by Jan. 9, after the deposition is scheduled to take place.

The app helps consumers interested in supporting sustainable coffee businesses to make informed choices. In particular, it can be used to promote ethical and environmentally friendly coffee suppliers.      ""The aim is humanizing each coffee drinker's relationship with their daily cup,"" said David Behrends, Farmer Connect founder and president. ""Consumers now can play an active role in sustainability governance by supporting coffee farmers in developing nations. Through the blockchain and this consumer app, we're creating a virtuous cycle.""      Coffee has a long and complicated supply chain. Once grown it has to be shipped, roasted and packaged before finally ending up on retailers' shelves. With so many participants, supply information can become fragmented, making it extremely difficult for consumers to discover where their coffee originated from with any great accuracy.      Thank My Farmer isn't the first initiative using blockchain to make the coffee supply chain transparent. The Ethiopian government last year said it was exploring how to use blockchain to track its coffee exports together with IOHK. Starbucks said last May that it would begin using Microsoft's Azure blockchain providing consumers with a ""complete view"" of its supply chain.      Thank My Farmer uses IBM's blockchain to standardize the information and make it accessible in one place. Consumers scan QR codes on the side of the coffee jar to look at the origins of their purchase and can choose to make additional payments to the farmers who grew the beans.      ""This project is another example of how blockchain technology can enable a channel for real change,"" said Raj Rao, IBM Food Trust general manager. ""Blockchain is more than aspirational business tech, it is used today to transform how people can build trust in the goods they consume. For business, it can drive greater transparency and efficiency.""      Initially available for selected brands in North America and Europe, IBM plans to expand to other coffee producers as well as offer new initiatives, such as support pages for consumers to donate to the local communities where their coffee is grown.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/06/ibm-blockchain-app-promotes-virtuous-cycle-for-sustainable-coffee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e466c0985d7752ba25b87eef646352d3cc974def-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Signature announced Monday it would be linking its Signet payments platform to Prime Trust's multi-asset settlement platform, creating a new service offering ""real-time"" settlements for digital asset trades.      ""Any Signature Bank commercial client participating on the Signet platform has the ability to make instantaneous payments in U.S. dollars, any time without transaction fees,"" said Joseph DePaolo, Signature Bank president and CEO in a press release. “The relationship we have forged with Prime Trust will allow their clients to immediately settle their transactions through the revolutionary Signet platform.""      The service will allow institutional clients from both companies to make payments directly to one another at any time, without third parties or transaction fees.      The Signet system launched in December 2018 after winning approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). It opened to Signature's commercial clients, who need a minimum account balance of $250,000, on Jan. 1, 2019. By February, the bank already claimed to have on-boarded more than 100 clients who were sending each other millions of dollars in crypto transactions daily.      State-licensed trust company Prime Trust launched its settlement network back in July as an alternative to Signature. Having generally attracted an exchange clientele, including Bittrex and Huobi, it is the only publicly known financial services provider for Binance.US, Binance's American partner company.      The list of banks willing to work with cryptocurrency companies remains short over compliance and risk concerns. Hence, market share is mostly concentrated in a handful of specialized providers at which competition is heating up.      The cryptocurrency exchange CEX.io, which uses Signature Bank, moved some of its retail and smaller payment operations to rival banking provider Silvergate back in November.

With cryptocurrency trading surging worldwide, ""it is no longer possible to stop crypto-asset trade,"" said the PCFIR, as per a report by Business Korea on Monday.

Institutions would also be allowed to offer other cryptocurrency services such as trading.      ""The Korean government has to gradually allow institutional investors to deal in crypto assets and promote over-the-counter (OTC) desks dedicated to institutional investors’ trade,"" the committee said in the report.      To support such a move, the nation's fintech sector should develop custody solutions for cryptocurrency to avoid a reliance on foreign custodians, said the PCFIR.      Addressing crypto exchanges, the committee said the government should look into bringing in a licensing scheme or guidance. The industry is currently loosely controlled via guidance given to banks and a South Korean financial watchdog under the Financial Services Commission is also reportedly aiming to directly supervise exchanges.      Other suggestions from the PCFIR included, notably, that bitcoin might be directly listed on Korea Exchange, the nation's securities bourse, and that the terms ""cryptocurrency"" and ""virtual currency"" could be brought together under the umbrella term crypto assets.

42383137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uEHT,1578312922,Bitcoin Mining Power Hits Fresh All-Time High,"Bitcoin's hash rate reached record highs this week amid rising prices and anticipation of the miner reward halving later this year.      Based on a rolling seven-day average, the hash rate has risen sharply from approximately 93 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Dec. 30 to more than 106 EH/s on Jan. 5. The best day overall was Jan. 1 when the hashing power exceeded 119 EH/s, surpassing the previous record of 114 EH/s set back in October.      Bitcoin's hash rate has increased considerably over 2019, rising from a weekly average of 40 EH/s at the beginning of the year to 80 EH/s by September.      That shift corresponded with the rise in bitcoin's price from roughly $4,000 to more than $10,000 over the same timeframe. The hash rate first crossed the 100 EH/s milestone on Sept. 26, but it wasn't until late October that it stayed above 100 EH/s for more than a day.      A plus-100 EH/s rate has become an increasingly frequent sight, with only one day so far this year reporting under the new benchmark.      Hash rate is a measure of the processing power dedicated to a blockchain. A high hash rate means more miners are working on the bitcoin network, suggesting it is increasingly economically viable at both the current bitcoin price and difficulty level. A report published in September predicted bitcoin's two-week average hash rate would cross 100 EH/s at the end of 2019.      Bitcoin's difficulty level automatically adjusts to ensure block time stays broadly at around the 10-minute mark, regardless of how many miners are working on the network. It adjusts every two weeks, the last being on Jan. 1 when it increased by 6.75 percent, the largest since September.      Plummeting cryptocurrency prices in 2018 forced many miners to shut up shop, with only the largest able to remain profitable. The industry faced an existential crisis as recently as last April when a government agency in China – home to more than two-thirds of all bitcoin mining operations – called mining ""undesirable.""      However, the situation looked brighter for miners last year as the bear market faded. More than half a million new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) rigs are estimated to have come online in Q3 2019, following a summer in which the bitcoin price more than doubled.      In recent days, bitcoin prices have taken an upturn, rising nearly 10 percent from lows near $6,850 seen on Friday. The rise may have set the cryptocurrency up for a bullish trend shift, charts suggest, further encouraging miners.      2020 is set to be a crucial year for many miners looking to increase their capacity. Bitcoin's block reward is expected to halve to 6.25 BTC in the coming months. While Bitmain is expected to make job cuts in anticipation of a drop in revenue, according to Chinese media, other companies are significantly scaling their operations.      U.K.-listed mining firm Argo Blockchain announced Thursday it had acquired more than 3,600 new bitcoin ASICs, more than quadrupling its total mining capacity. The news caused the company's share price to rise by 6 percent on the London Stock Exchange.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/06/bitcoin-mining-power-hits-fresh-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37af51ecc770881013346f695cbeaface570201-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uEMV,1578309179,Bitcoin Eyes Price Breakout Amid US-Iran Tensions,"View    Bitcoin may be drawing haven demand on U.S.-Iran tensions, according to prominent analysts, and could soon confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart with a UTC close above $7,580.  A daily chart indicator is reporting the strongest bullish bias in two months. A breakout would create room for at least a $1,000 rally.  A failure to hold above today's low of $7,342 would weaken the case for a breakout.    Bitcoin is drawing bids amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and could soon rise above key resistance at $7,580, confirming a short-term bullish breakout.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,530, representing a 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices are now up nearly 10 percent from lows near $6,850 registered during the Asian trading hours on Friday.      Notably, the cryptocurrency picked up a bid at lows near $6,850 after the U.S. launched an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport, killing top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.      Tensions escalated over the weekend, with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promising revenge and President Trump warning Tehran against retaliatory actions.      Through all this, bitcoin remained bid and hit a two-week high of $7,580 earlier Monday.      Hence, many in the investor community think the U.S.-Iran tensions are powering gains in bitcoin. After all, the cryptocurrency is considered as digital gold by the likes of Michael Novogratz, the founder of the cryptocurrency asset management firm Galaxy Digital. Novogratz tweeted on Sunday:      Backing Novogratz's view is popular trader Holger Zchaepitz, who expects bitcoin and gold to continue rising on the back of tensions in the Middle East.      While Novogratz and Zchaepitz consider bitcoin a safe haven, trader Ran NeuNer believes the cryptocurrency is still an uncorrelated asset and could be the best hedge against risk intensification.      With the safe-haven narrative strengthening, bitcoin looks set to scale resistance at $7,580.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart (Bitstamp prices). A UTC close above $7,580 would confirm the breakout (a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change) and open the doors for $8,735 (target as per the measured move method).      The breakout looks likely, with the 14-day relative strength index hovering at a two-month high of 56.00. A reading above 50 indicates bullish conditions.    Weekly chart    The long-tails attached to the hammer candle created in the seven days to Dec. 22 and the last week's doji candle indicate seller exhaustion and support the case for a breakout on the daily chart.      Even so, the bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious, as prominent analysts like @BitBitCrypto and Peter Schiff think the cryptocurrency has rallied since Friday due to speculators buying on the hope that bitcoin will attract haven demand from traditional investors.      So, an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout could end up trapping bulls on the wrong side of the market or may remain elusive if that flow dries up.      A failure to hold above today's low of $7,342 would validate the bearish view put forward by the descending 10-week moving average and likely yield a re-test of $6,850.

42383138,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uEIj,1578304800,We Still Don't Know Bitcoin's Real Volume,"Galen Moore is a Senior Research Analyst at CoinDesk. The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      Fake volume became one of crypto assets' leading narratives of 2019, as a U.S. regulatory application for an exchange-traded product (ETP) followed the work of earlier researchers in showing how as much as 95 percent of lit markets' reported bitcoin trading volume might be fake. That's resulted in conservative estimates of bitcoin volume that are probably far too low, and a condition of uncertainty as to how much bitcoin is actually being traded.      You could think of fake volume as a natural feature of crypto's novel market structure, in which:    liquidity is divided among many competing exchange venues  trading fees are high relative to other asset categories  exchanges provide data for free    In crypto markets, data is a marketing tool instead of a revenue source, and some exchanges have been shown to use it that way, exaggerating volumes in order to enhance their perceived liquidity.      These realities and the data presented by researchers like BitWise in its March 2019 ETP application have led market data aggregators to adjust their volume representations. The chart below compares adjusted daily bitcoin volume figures for the month of November offered by two such aggregators, Messari and Nomics, against the unadjusted reported daily volume figures offered by CoinMarketCap, historically the best-known market data provider.      The discrepancy between the two examples of adjusted bitcoin volume shown stems from the list of exchanges each data aggregator includes. Messari limits its ""real"" bitcoin volume number to the 10 exchanges identified in BitWise's ETP application. Nomics rates 32 exchanges high enough on its ""transparency rating"" metric to include them in its ""transparent volume"" aggregate.      In its October response to an application for ETP approval by BitWise, a San Francisco-based fund manager, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted exchanges that BitWise excluded as fake are likely supporting some volume of real trading activity, a ""gray area"" that BitWise conceded in a reply to comments on the application.      The SEC's response specifically mentioned HitBTC, Huobi, OKEx and a handful of exchanges based in South Korea, which were excluded due to capital controls there. Nomics' adjusted bitcoin volume number includes HitBTC, but not Huobi, OKEx or any of the larger South Korean venues.      Anecdotally, traders say excluding liquid markets wholesale doesn't make sense – especially Huobi and OKEx. ""I’ve traded on OK since 2013, and it’s executable,"" said Dan Matuszewski, former head of trading at Circle, a Boston-based developer of financial products in crypto. ""That liquidity is there. Those markets are actionable. Do I think the number is 100 percent true? Absolutely not.""      The chart above shows that, at least on Huobi, some bitcoin-base pairs are nearly as liquid as they are on Coinbase, according to order book data provided by Kaiko. Real daily bitcoin volume in November was probably somewhere between the $1.97 billion ""transparent"" volume that Nomics reported and CoinMarketCap's unadjusted average daily volume figure of $22.56 billion – and even though Nomics' number excludes some major exchanges, it probably gets closer to the truth than the unfiltered data on CoinMarketCap.      To some extent, it doesn't matter. Aggregate bitcoin volume is a general data point, unlikely to inform a specific investment decision. In crypto's fragmented markets, volume at specific venues, selected for their relevance to geographies or categories of investor, may be better signals. For example:    Coinbase's cash market volumes as an indicator of new retail participation  Activity on localbitcoins or regionally dominant exchanges  CME and Bakkt bitcoin futures activity as an indicator of US fiduciary institutions' participation    However, a reliable figure for bitcoin's aggregate volume is important when establishing market infrastructure such as volume-weighted indexes. The crypto asset category's inability so far to settle on such a number is an indicator of its immaturity. When media organizations emerged on the internet, their new approaches to revenue also brought new questions as to which information could be trusted.

42383117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uDyb,1578301200,Closer Look at SEC ‘Accredited Investor’ Revamp Suggests Little Will Change,"For the first time in nearly 40 years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is lowering the barriers to investing in private securities. How much lower is unclear, however.      Three of the five SEC commissioners voted to publish a proposal for updating the definition of “accredited investors,” a category of individuals and institutions that are allowed to take part in private financial markets, on Dec. 18. The general public has 60 days from the proposal’s publication in the Federal Register (the official record for the U.S. government) to comment on whether the securities regulator should approve the expanded definition.      The proposal was lauded by many in the cryptocurrency community, who hoped the new definition would allow individuals to participate in unregistered token offerings based on how well they understand the products, not arbitrary standards of wealth.      However, though the proposal lists a number of criteria and considerations the SEC is evaluating, the final expanded definition might not widen the pool of new accredited investors all that much, industry lawyers said.      “So far it appears that this expansion of accredited investor status is mostly applicable to Wall Street insiders such as licensed brokers or ‘knowledgeable employees’ of private investment funds,” said Zachary Kelman, a partner at Kelman Law. “It’s not as expansive as people would like to think.”      While the proposals look promising, “as in all things, the devil is in the details,” said Drew Hinkes, general counsel at Athena Blockchain and an attorney with Carlton Fields.      The text provides a tentative framework for which credentials from academic institutions would qualify, including an examination or series of exams administered by a self-regulatory organization.      That part “could have a massive impact,” Hinkes said.      But according to the full text of the proposal, the SEC would have to designate the specific certifications, designations or credentials that would qualify an investor.      “Does that mean anyone with a four-year degree from an accredited university, which would probably include millions of new investors, or is it limited to Ph.D.s, which would probably not be material?” Hinkes said. “We'll find out when we get more details from the commission. For now, it's promising but not yet actionable.”    The proposal    The SEC proposal touches on recommendations stretching over a decade, with some of the amendments stemming from a 2015 report and others reaching as far back as 2007.      Some $1.7 trillion was raised in 2018 in Rule 506 offerings, including equity and debt, compared to $1.4 million raised in registered offerings, the text said, indicating significant demand for these types of exempt offerings.      “We are mindful that an overly broad definition could potentially undermine important investor protections and reduce public confidence in this vital market,” the proposal said. “At the same time, an unnecessarily narrow definition could limit investor access to investment opportunities where there may be adequate investor protection given factors such as that investor’s financial sophistication, net worth, knowledge and experience in financial matters, or amount of assets under management.”      Commissioner Hester Peirce said investors' sophistication – that is, their understanding of the markets they’re investing in – should be used to determine accreditation status.      “Our current definition includes investors that spend their days cruising around in a Ferrari that Daddy bought them, yet excludes investors whose weeks are spent earning money and weekends are spent figuring out how best to invest it,” she said in a statement.      However, Commissioner Allison Lee, who voted against the proposal, said in a statement the proposal could create some “serious risk to retail investors,” citing elderly individuals and retirees as examples.      Similarly, Christopher Gerold, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, said the proposal could expose retail investors “to the significant potential harms associated with unregistered, illiquid offerings” with no ongoing disclosures.      The proposal ""offers several changes to the definition, but few if any improvements, and clearly misses an opportunity to provide meaningful reform to this outdated standard,” he said.    Historical context    While expanding the definition of “accredited investor” to include more individuals and entities is widely being hailed, the framing of the conversation online has largely ignored the term’s historical context, Kelman said.      Under current law, an accredited investor is an individual with $1 million in assets or at least $200,000 in annual income; a married couple with at least $300,000 in annual income; banks, savings or loan institutions defined under the Securities Act of 1933; brokers or dealers defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; licensed small businesses; state plans with at least $5 million in assets; employee benefit plans with at least $5 million in assets; or a few other entities.      Historically, the status was granted to the wealthy as “a function of practicality rather than privilege,” Kelman said.      “The exemption for wealthy investors is premised on their financial latitude to lose their shirt without posing systemic risks such as bank runs and financial crises,” he said.      To be clear, Kelman said the proposal “represents a step in the right direction,” but treating it as a question of accessibility rather than systemic risk ignores that the concept of an “accredited investor” (if not the specific term itself) was created in the wake of the Great Depression.      “In my view, shifting the premise of the accredited investor status from ‘systemic risk mitigator’ into ‘investor IQ test’ raises a question as to why investors need SEC protection at all,” he said.      Indeed, Peirce said the move “takes some important first steps” in updating the definition by factoring in “an investor’s actual sophistication,” rather than finances.      Likewise, Commissioner Elad Roisman appeared to support moving away from the historical approach, calling wealth a “crude measure” of an investor’s ability to make decisions about which markets they participate in.      “I doubt that even the Commission who first adopted Regulation D would argue that they came up with perfect criteria for who should qualify as an accredited investor,” he said. “Did anyone consider the outcome that only the wealthiest Americans would have access to investments that would have the most upside for growth over time?”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/06/closer-look-at-sec-accredited-investor-revamp-suggests-little-will-change,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
