Argentine users have complained the app will not allow them to buy, sell or hold bitcoin as Strike users in other countries can. The company made no mention of supporting only Tether at the time of its Tuesday launch announcement.  In a tweet Strike trumpeted the move into Argentina with CEO and founder Jack Mallers promising “a superior financial experience,” adding that Strike would “use the world's open monetary network, #Bitcoin, to give hope to the people of Argentina.”  Strike’s push into Argentina is part of a wider initiative to expand into Latin America. The company said in its announcement that users would be able to make remittance payments, receive bitcoin tips on Twitter and use Strike's peer-to-peer transaction services.  ""In lesser developed markets where the majority of the population doesn't have access to a bank account, or where Strike has yet to establish sufficient banking relationships, Strike uses a US-Dollar stablecoin to represent the dollar cash collateral balance for the user that interfaces with the Bitcoin monetary network,"" Strike told CoinDesk in an email.  One Argentinian user, Nicolás, told CoinDesk the app can receive bitcoin payments but immediately converts the cryptocurrency to USDT. He said the Strike wallet only holds USDT. Another Strike user in Argentina, Adam, tweeted that the app was “a disappointment,” describing the app as a custodial wallet that works only with tether under Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.  At the time of publication, Strike had not addressed user complaints on its Twitter account or website.  Adam wrote the app has on- and off-ramps that allow users to connect to the cryptocurrency, such as sending USDT and then receiving bitcoin via the Lightning Network.  Nicolás said that he was able to send funds from his Strike wallet to an exchange in Argentina, after which he received bitcoin.  Responding to Nicolás, Luis David Esparragoza, a journalist for Spanish-language media Criptonoticias, said that Strike sends tether, not bitcoin, to Bittrex, a crypto exchange that holds and transfers Strike's funds.  The company did not answer whether it uses the Lightning Network to make bitcoin transactions or whether it sends USDT to Bittrex and that exchange then converts it to bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency was roughly flat over the past 24 hours and up about 3% over the past week, compared to a 5% gain in ether.  Some traders and analysts remain cautious despite the brief price bounce off $40,000 earlier this week.  ""Price swings are all happening on wafer-thin volumes, which can amplify price movements,"" Q9 Capital, a Hong Kong-based crypto investing platform, wrote in a briefing on Friday. ""No fresh capital is coming in and nobody is willing to sell or buy,"" Q9 wrote.  ""Attempts earlier in the week to form a rebound are encountering more substantial selling, further indicating seller pressure,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Kuptsikevich is especially concerned about further declines in ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin. If momentum continues to deteriorate, he anticipates a worst-case scenario of $1,300-$1,700 ETH, which is roughly 50% below current price levels.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $43212, +1.15%    ●Ether (ETH): $3308, +1.22%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4663, +0.08%    ●Gold: $1816 per troy ounce, −0.29%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.77%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  But not all corners of the crypto ecosystem are experiencing a slowdown in trading activity.  Non-fungible token (NFT) trading volumes continue to soar. For example, OpenSea, a large NFT marketplace, is on pace to exceed $6 billion in transactions by the end of the month.  And dogecoin (DOGE), the popular dog-themed meme coin, surged almost 14% on Friday after electric-car maker Tesla went live with accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for merchandise. DOGE is up about 20% over the past week.  In observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in the U.S. on Monday, Market Wrap will return on Tuesday, Jan. 18.  Long-term bitcoin holders unfazed  Some investors are still holding bitcoin for the long term despite the recent sell-off. The chart below shows an increase in the net position change among long-term bitcoin holders this month. Accumulation of BTC around current price levels could be a bullish sign.  The increase in long-term holder positions ""gives a positive outlook for bitcoin's price,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Sotiriou expects BTC to rebound to the $45,000-$46,000 price range in the coming days.  Altcoin roundup  Short traders on Dogecoin lost $8M: Dogecoin (DOGE) traders lost more than $11.69 million in total to liquidations in Asian morning hours as the meme coin surged 16% in the past 24 hours. The total includes leveraged traders betting on an upside losing another $4 million on margin calls. The figures were much higher than liquidations on bitcoin or ether futures, which usually see the most losses among all cryptocurrencies. The price rally came as electric-car maker Tesla went live with dogecoin payments for merchandise early Friday. Tesla fans can now purchase belt buckles, whistles, chargers and a quad bike using the meme coin on the official store, as reported, according to Shaurya Malwa. Read more here.

Others in the cryptocurrency community describe the phenomenon as “free money.”  “‘Wen token?’ is one of the most asked questions in crypto,” Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan told CoinDesk. “What’s great about the Airdrop Futures is that it can combat asymmetric information. You can see the probabilities according to an actual free market. It’s a really powerful idea.”  According to a Polymarket tweet on Wednesday, Airdrop Futures said it would support prediction markets for 19 prominent crypto projects that have not yet released a token.  These include non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and wallet applications MetaMask and Rainbow, among others.  As of Friday afternoon, Polymarket data put the odds of MetaMask airdropping a token before March 31 at $0.32 and the odds for OpenSea at $0.22. If the project airdrops a token before the deadline, buyers of the “yes” outcome would receive $1 and vice versa.  Meanwhile, speculators are bullish that NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club would release a token before the deadline, putting BAYC’s odds at $0.67.  Degen edge  One potential application of Airdrop Futures is that it could help calm airdrop anxiety by allowing users to hedge against the risk of not receiving an airdrop from a project they have spent a considerable amount of time and resources using.  For example, a user could buy the “no” option for the projects they use, but still receive tokens if the airdrop happens – a win-win outcome.  Polymarket’s Airdrop Futures is deployed on Polygon and uses the decentralized oracle protocol UMA to resolve the bets.  Since its launch approximately 24 hours earlier, the market’s volume totaled just over $75,000.  Polymarket has come into the crosshairs of U.S. regulators in recent months. The site settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to pay a $1.4 million fine. The CFTC ordered it to shut down operations in the U.S.  As Polymarket put in a tweet about the airdrop market, “Trading unavailable in US.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING | AIRDROP,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/14/wen-token-polymarkets-new-airdrop-futures-market-has-answers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31baf213ff00c0f111e703c26a6d0894f5b3d5bc-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411850,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgavU,1642189731,"Crypto Discord: Where to Go, What to Know","For anyone interested in cryptocurrencies, Discord can be a good place to acquire information, ask questions and exchange ideas. In addition, channels dedicated to individual projects and coins can be a valuable way to educate yourself about a protocol before investing any money into it.  First off, let’s unpack the language of Discord.  Servers: A “server” is simply the term used to describe each independently operated community. Anyone can start their own server, from a place to hang out with a couple of friends to massive projects with communities in the hundreds of thousands. These are then subdivided into smaller ""channels"" which are basically chatrooms within the community intended for a certain topic or activity.  Channels: Within different servers, you will typically find independent chat rooms dedicated to things like development announcements or upcoming events. Once you start participating in channels and get to know other users, you may add them as friends, start private chats or even private servers for trusted groups. For instance, within the ""Breakers"" discord server (where fans of CoinDesk’s ""The Breakdown"" podcast with NLW meet), there are channels to discuss news, the latest episode, markets, regulations, memes and more.  Finding the right Discord channels can seem daunting because there can be what seems like an overwhelming number of choices and the volume of chatter within some servers is astronomical. It’s also important to be mindful that a lot of the messages you’ll receive on Discord will likely be from scammers attempting to access your funds by convincing you to visit fake websites, disclose your private keys/ seed recovery phrase or download malware.  Remember, anyone can start a server so the existence of one should not be relied upon as a sign of trustworthiness or legitimacy  Why Discord servers matter  The primary draw of a Discord server is being part of a large group of people who share similar interests. It can be a great way to gauge social interest in a project as well as receive updates. Moreover, it can help keep you focused on topics that most interest you.  Similar to joining a regular chat room, a Discord server can simply be a place to have a good time and engage with other enthusiasts around the world. However, you should be careful about exchanging sensitive information or clicking links your new “friend” sends your way in a private conversation. Just because you might’ve shared an interesting conversation about a cryptocurrency you’re both keen to invest in doesn't mean you should abandon basic security procedures. These include:  The existence of a server does not imply trustworthiness.  Never give anyone on Discord your login information, private keys or wallet seed phrase, even if they claim to be trying to help you.  Spend time getting to know the community and leaders associated with a project before giving them money – especially if any participants seem to be pressuring others to invest quickly, such as by saying that you might ""miss the opportunity"" if you wait. etc.  Read More: How to Stay Safe and Avoid Common Bitcoin Scams  Finding and joining different servers  One appealing aspect of Discord is that you can access the application through a PC application, mobile application or web browser. Moreover, it lets you join as many servers as you like without having to own multiple instances of the app. The look and feel of Discord may remind you of AOL or MSN Messenger – in this case, though, every circular icon on the far left-hand side is a server instead of an individual person.  Finding Discord servers to join will depend on which projects you are interested in. The Discord channel for bitcoin - or, more specifically, the Bitcoin subreddit - can be found on the Reddit page. Similarly, other prominent cryptocurrency projects with a subreddit will have the official link to a dedicated Discord server in their ""Resources"" section on Reddit.  Reddit is a ""message board"" where you can engage with a global audience interested in specific cryptocurrencies or projects. It is somewhat similar to Discord, although it lacks the real-time chatting function that Discord provides.  As you can see, by hovering over the /r/Bitcoin Discord link, joining the server happens by clicking the URL. Every URL is an invite code – similar to a free attendance ticket – that anyone can use. Clicking the link will take you to the Discord interface and allow you to access the server via the web browser or through the desktop/mobile client.  If you can’t find a subreddit on your topic of interest, you can often find out who the moderator is for a server by searching for the name of the server/channel + Discord + Mod. Once you’ve found the right person, you can message the moderator of the server directly to get an invite link.  Common best practices  When joining a Discord server, or multiple servers, you may find yourself overwhelmed with notifications rather quickly. Bot accounts often greet newcomers – these are AI chatbots that perform certain commands or tasks such as issuing a greeting when a new member joins via a channel or direct message – and can be a nuisance when getting started.  One good option for beginners is to go into the server settings and turn off private messages. If you want to engage in a private conversation, you will have to take the initiative to reach out first, but it will prevent spammers and potential scammers from talking to you.  To turn off this option, take the following steps:  Click the server on the left-hand side for which you want to turn off Direct Messages (DMs) from server users  Click the downward-facing triangle next to the server name and select ""Privacy Settings.""  Move the slider for ""Allow direct messages from server members"" to the left so it becomes gray.  Click ""Done""  Repeat these steps for any other server where you wish to disable DMs from server members.  You will still receive regular server notifications if you are tagged in a message or if there are important announcements, giveaways, etc.  How to avoid Discord scammers  While turning off DMs can reduce the number of notifications on Discord, it serves another purpose. Just like a traditional chat room, every Discord server can contain members with nefarious goals. More specifically, they may target server newcomers with a message or clickable link that will put you in harm's way.  Never trust links sent by strangers on the internet, just as you wouldn't accept candy from a random person in the street.  Other common best practices  The same principle applies even if you start to trust a stranger on Discord. While some people may be genuine, others may try to obtain sensitive information from you or even steal your cryptocurrency. Instead, focus your conversations on:  Exchanging ideas and opinions  Technical queries  Engaging in dialog in the ""general"" chat room of the server  You should never disclose your personal wealth on Discord – or any public forum for that matter. This includes telling someone which cryptocurrencies you own or how much you own. It can put a target on your back and encourage scammers to focus their attention on you.  The hidden chambers of Discord servers  A growing Discord trend is restricting server access depending on ownership of certain tokens, NFTs or other specific qualifications.  If we take the non-fungible token industry as an example, users are free to join the Discord channel of any NFT project out there. However, they may not be able to see all of the accessible channels unless they can verifiably prove they own at least one from the collection.  Channel access can be tied to Discord user roles, with NFT holders receiving special roles, and thus access to channels hidden from regular users.  For example, NFT holders may have unique roles that grant access to :  NFT holder giveaways (separate from public giveaways)  Dedicated chat channels for NFT holders  Access to project announcements and previews before the general public is informed.  Discord is also a crucial platform to foster discussion among members of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). One example is the FWB (Friends With Benefits) Discord, which is used to host events, publish newsletters and facilitate group chatting. However, one can only join the chat room if you own 75 FWB tokens or more, making it an “exclusive” club. The members of this and other DAOs use these channels to discuss matters regarding the governance, mission and other matters of importance to the community.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-discord-where-to-go-what-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ec825cece313060c89989404f5c2b51c75defa8-3711x2622.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411841,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaV2,1642187372,"What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained","The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is booming and the numbers are only trending up. According to DeFi Pulse, there is $95.28 billion in crypto assets locked in DeFi right now – up from $32 billion the year before. Leading the DeFi race is the Ethereum-based Maker protocol, with a 17.8% share of the market.  One of the main catalysts for this sector's exponential growth can be attributed to an ROI-optimizing strategy unique to DeFi known as yield farming.  Where it started  Ethereum-based credit market Compound started distributing COMP to the protocol's users in June, 2020. This is a type of asset known as a ""governance token"" which gives holders unique voting powers over proposed changes to the platform. Demand for the token (heightened by the way its automatic distribution was structured) kicked off the present craze and moved Compound into the leading position in DeFi at the time.  The hot new term ""yield farming"" was born; shorthand for clever strategies where putting crypto temporarily at the disposal of some startup's application earns its owner more cryptocurrency.  Another term floating about is ""liquidity mining.""  The buzz around these concepts has evolved into a low rumble as more and more people get interested.  The casual crypto observer who only pops into the market when activity heats up might be starting to get faint vibes that something is happening right now. Take our word for it: Yield farming is the source of those vibes.  We're going to start off with the very basics and then move to more advanced aspects of yield farming.  What are tokens?  Tokens are like the money video-game players earn while fighting monsters, money they can use to buy gear or weapons in the universe of their favorite game.  But with blockchains, tokens aren't limited to only one massively multiplayer online money game. They can be earned in one and used in lots of others. They usually represent either ownership in something (like a piece of a Uniswap liquidity pool, which we will get into later) or access to some service. For example, in the Brave browser, ads can only be bought using basic attention token (BAT).  If tokens are worth money, then you can bank with them or at least do things that look very much like banking. Thus: decentralized finance.  Tokens proved to be the big use case for Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain in the world. The term of art here is ""ERC-20 tokens,"" which refers to a software standard that allows token creators to write rules for them. Tokens can be used in a few ways. Often, they are used as a form of money within a set of applications. So the idea for Kin was to create a token that web users could spend with each other at such tiny amounts that it would almost feel like they weren't spending anything; that is, money for the internet.  Governance tokens are different. They are not like a token at a video-game arcade, as so many tokens were described in the past. They work more like certificates to serve in an ever-changing legislature in that they give holders the right to vote on changes to a protocol.  So on the platform that proved DeFi could fly, MakerDAO, holders of its governance token, MKR, vote almost every week on small changes to parameters that govern how much it costs to borrow and how much savers earn, and so on.  Read more: How Yield Farming on Curve Is Quietly Conquering DeFi  One thing all crypto tokens have in common, though, is they are tradable and they have a price. So, if tokens are worth money, then you can bank with them or at least do things that look very much like banking. Thus: decentralized finance.  What is DeFi?  Fair question. For folks who tuned out for a bit in 2018, we used to call this ""open finance."" That construction seems to have faded, though, and ""DeFi"" is the new lingo.  In case that doesn't jog your memory, DeFi is all the things that let you play with money, and the only identification you need is a crypto wallet.  On the normal web, you can’t buy a blender without giving the site owner enough data to learn your whole life history. In DeFi, you can borrow money without anyone even asking for your name.  I can explain this but nothing really brings it home like trying one of these applications. If you have an Ethereum wallet that has even $20 worth of crypto in it, go do something on one of these products. Pop over to Uniswap and buy yourself some FUN (a token for gambling apps) or WBTC (wrapped bitcoin). Go to MakerDAO and create $5 worth of DAI (a stablecoin that tends to be worth $1) out of the digital ether. Go to Compound and borrow $10 in USDC.  (Notice the very small amounts I'm suggesting. The old crypto saying ""don't put in more than you can afford to lose"" goes double for DeFi. This stuff is uber-complex and a lot can go wrong. These may be ""savings"" products but they’re not for your retirement savings.)  Immature and experimental though it may be, the technology's implications are staggering. On the normal web, you can't buy a blender without giving the site owner enough data to learn your whole life history. In DeFi, you can borrow money without anyone even asking for your name.  DeFi applications don't worry about trusting you because they have the collateral you put up to back your debt (on Compound, for instance, a $10 debt will require around $20 in collateral).  Read more: Which Comes First: DeFi Utility or Yield?  If you do take this advice and try something, note that you can swap all these things back as soon as you've taken them out. Open the loan and close it 10 minutes later. It's fine. Fair warning: It might cost you a tiny bit in fees.  So what's the point of borrowing for people who already have the money? Most people do it for some kind of trade. The most obvious example, to short a token (the act of profiting if its price falls). It's also good for someone who wants to hold onto a token but still play the market.  Doesn’t running a bank take a lot of money upfront?  It does, and in DeFi that money is largely provided by strangers on the internet. That's why the startups behind these decentralized banking applications come up with clever ways to attract HODLers with idle assets.  Liquidity is the chief concern of all these different products. That is: How much money do they have locked in their smart contracts?  ""In some types of products, the product experience gets much better if you have liquidity. Instead of borrowing from VCs or debt investors, you borrow from your users,"" said Electric Capital managing partner Avichal Garg.  Let's take Uniswap as an example. Uniswap is an ""automated market maker,"" or AMM (another DeFi term of art). This means Uniswap is a robot on the internet that is always willing to buy and it's also always willing to sell any cryptocurrency for which it has a market.  On Uniswap, there is at least one market pair for almost any token on Ethereum. Behind the scenes, this means Uniswap can make it look like it is making a direct trade for any two tokens, which makes it easy for users, but it's all built around pools of two tokens. And all these market pairs work better with bigger pools.  Why do I keep hearing about ‘pools’?  To illustrate why more money helps, let's break down how Uniswap works.  Let's say there was a market for USDC and DAI. These are two tokens (both stablecoins but with different mechanisms for retaining their value) that are meant to be worth $1 each all the time, and that generally tends to be true for both.  The price Uniswap shows for each token in any pooled market pair is based on the balance of each in the pool. So, simplifying this a lot for illustration's sake, if someone were to set up a USDC/DAI pool, they should deposit equal amounts of both. In a pool with only 2 USDC and 2 DAI it would offer a price of 1 USDC for 1 DAI. But then imagine that someone put in 1 DAI and took out 1 USDC. Then the pool would have 1 USDC and 3 DAI. The pool would be very out of whack. A savvy investor could make an easy $0.50 profit by putting in 1 USDC and receiving 1.5 DAI. That's a 50% arbitrage profit, and that's the problem with limited liquidity.  (Incidentally, this is why Uniswap's prices tend to be accurate, because traders watch it for small discrepancies from the wider market and trade them away for arbitrage profits very quickly.)  Read more: Uniswap V2 Launches With More Token-Swap Pairs, Oracle Service, Flash Loans  However, if there were 500,000 USDC and 500,000 DAI in the pool, a trade of 1 DAI for 1 USDC would have a negligible impact on the relative price. That's why liquidity is helpful.  You can stick your assets on Compound and earn a little yield. But that’s not very creative. Users who look for angles to maximize that yield: those are the yield farmers.  Similar effects hold across DeFi, so markets want more liquidity. Uniswap solves this by charging a tiny fee on every trade. It does this by shaving off a little bit from each trade and leaving that in the pool (so one DAI would actually trade for 0.997 USDC, after the fee, growing the overall pool by 0.003 USDC). This benefits liquidity providers because when someone puts liquidity in the pool they own a share of the pool. If there has been lots of trading in that pool, it has earned a lot of fees, and the value of each share will grow.  And this brings us back to tokens.  Liquidity added to Uniswap is represented by a token, not an account. So there's no ledger saying, ""Bob owns 0.000000678% of the DAI/USDC pool."" Bob just has a token in his wallet. And Bob doesn't have to keep that token. He could sell it. Or use it in another product. We'll circle back to this, but it helps to explain why people like to talk about DeFi products as ""money Legos.""  So how much money do people make by putting money into these products?  It can be a lot more lucrative than putting money in a traditional bank, and that's before startups started handing out governance tokens.  Let's use Compound as an illustration. As of January, 2022, a person can put USDC or tether (USDT) into Compound and earn around 3% on it. Most U.S. bank accounts earn less than 0.1% these days, which is close enough to nothing.  However, there are some caveats. First, there's a reason the interest rates are so much juicier: DeFi is a far riskier place to park your money. There's no Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protecting these funds. If there were a run on Compound, users could find themselves unable to withdraw their funds when they wanted.  Plus, the interest is quite variable. You don't know what you'll earn over the course of a year. USDC's rate is high right now but it used to hover somewhere in the 1% range.  Similarly, a user might get tempted by assets with more lucrative yields like USDT, which typically has a much higher interest rate than USDC. The trade-off here is USDT's transparency about the real-world dollars it's supposed to hold in a real-world bank is not nearly up to par with USDC's. A difference in interest rates is often the market's way of telling you the one instrument is viewed as dicier than another.  Users making big bets on these products turn to companies Opyn and Nexus Mutual to insure their positions because there's no government protections in this nascent space – more on the ample risks later on.  So users can stick their assets in Compound or Uniswap and earn a little yield. But that's not very creative. Users who look for angles to maximize that yield: those are the yield farmers.  OK, I already knew all of that. What is yield farming?  Broadly, yield farming is any effort to put crypto assets to work and generate the most returns possible on those assets.  At the simplest level, a yield farmer might move assets around within Compound, constantly chasing whichever pool is offering the best APY from week to week. This might mean moving into riskier pools from time to time, but a yield farmer can handle risk.  ""Farming opens up new price arbs [arbitrage] that can spill over to other protocols whose tokens are in the pool,"" said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant.  Because these positions are tokenized, though, they can go further.  This was a brand-new kind of yield on a deposit. In fact, it was a way to earn a yield on a loan. Who has ever heard of a borrower earning a return on a debt from their lender?  In a simple example, a yield farmer might put 100,000 USDT into Compound. They will get a token back for that stake, called cUSDT. Let's say they get 100,000 cUSDT back (the formula on Compound is crazy so it's not 1:1 like that but it doesn't matter for our purposes here).  They can then take that cUSDT and put it into a liquidity pool that takes cUSDT on Balancer, an AMM that allows users to set up self-rebalancing crypto index funds. In normal times, this could earn a small amount more in transaction fees. This is the basic idea of yield farming. The user looks for edge cases in the system to eke out as much yield as they can across as many products as it will work on.     Why is yield farming so hot right now?  Because of liquidity mining. Liquidity mining supercharges yield farming.  Liquidity mining is when a yield farmer gets a new token as well as the usual return (that's the ""mining"" part) in exchange for the farmer's liquidity.  ""The idea is that stimulating usage of the platform increases the value of the token, thereby creating a positive usage loop to attract users,"" said Richard Ma of smart-contract auditor Quantstamp.  The yield farming examples above are only farming yield off the normal operations of different platforms. Supply liquidity to Compound or Uniswap and get a little cut of the business that runs over the protocols – very vanilla.  But Compound announced in 2020 it wanted to truly decentralize the product and it wanted to give a good amount of ownership to the people who made it popular by using it. That ownership would take the form of the COMP token.  Lest this sound too altruistic, keep in mind that the people who created it (the team and the investors) owned more than half of the equity. By giving away a healthy proportion to users, that was very likely to make it a much more popular place for lending. In turn, that would make everyone's stake worth much more.  So, Compound announced this four-year period where the protocol would give out COMP tokens to users, a fixed amount every day until it was gone. These COMP tokens control the protocol, just as shareholders ultimately control publicly traded companies.  Every day, the Compound protocol looks at everyone who had lent money to the application and who had borrowed from it and gives them COMP proportional to their share of the day's total business.  The results were very surprising, even to Compound's biggest promoters.  COMP’s value will likely go down, and that’s why some investors are rushing to earn as much of it as they can right now.  This was a brand-new kind of yield on a deposit into Compound. In fact, it was a way to earn a yield on a loan, as well, which is very weird: Who's ever heard of a borrower earning a return on a debt from their lender?  COMP's value reached a peak of over $900 in 2021. We did the math elsewhere but long story short: investors with fairly deep pockets can make a strong gain maximizing their daily returns in COMP. It is, in a way, free money.  It's possible to lend to Compound, borrow from it, deposit what you borrowed and so on. This can be done multiple times and DeFi startup Instadapp even built a tool to make it as capital-efficient as possible.  ""Yield farmers are extremely creative. They find ways to 'stack' yields and even earn multiple governance tokens at once,"" said Spencer Noon of DTC Capital.  COMP's value spike is a temporary situation. The COMP distribution will only last four years and then there won't be any more. Further, most people agree that the high price now is driven by the low float (that is, how much COMP is actually free to trade on the market – it will never be this low again). So the value will probably gradually go down, and that's why savvy investors are trying to earn as much as they can now.  Appealing to the speculative instincts of diehard crypto traders has proven to be a great way to increase liquidity on Compound. This fattens some pockets but also improves the user experience for all kinds of Compound users, including those who would use it whether they were going to earn COMP or not.  As usual in crypto, when entrepreneurs see something successful, they imitate it. Balancer was the next protocol to start distributing a governance token, BAL, to liquidity providers. Flash loan provider bZx then followed suit. Ren, Curve and Synthetixhave also teamed up to promote a liquidity pool on Curve.  It is a fair bet many of the more well-known DeFi projects will announce some kind of coin that can be mined by providing liquidity.  The case to watch here is Uniswap versus Balancer. Balancer can do the same thing Uniswap does, but most users who want to do a quick token trade through their wallet use Uniswap. It will be interesting to see if Balancer's BAL token convinces Uniswap's liquidity providers to defect.  So far, though, more liquidity has gone into Uniswap since the BAL announcement, according to its data site.  Did liquidity mining start with COMP?  No, but it was the most-used protocol with the most carefully designed liquidity mining scheme.  This point is debated but the origins of liquidity mining probably date back to Fcoin, a Chinese exchange that created a token in 2018 that rewarded people for making trades. You won't believe what happened next! Just kidding, you will: People just started running bots to do pointless trades with themselves to earn the token.  Similarly, EOS is a blockchain where transactions are basically free, but since nothing is really free the absence of friction was an invitation for spam. Some malicious hacker who didn't like EOS created a token called EIDOS on the network in late 2019. It rewarded people for tons of pointless transactions and somehow got an exchange listing.  These initiatives illustrated how quickly crypto users respond to incentives.  Read more: Compound Changes COMP Distribution Rules Following ‘Yield Farming’ Frenzy  Fcoin aside, liquidity mining as we now know it first showed up on Ethereum when the marketplace for synthetic tokens, Synthetix, announced in July 2019 an award in its SNX token for users who helped add liquidity to the sETH/ETH pool on Uniswap. By October, that was one of Uniswap's biggest pools.  When Compound Labs, the company that launched the Compound protocol, decided to create COMP, the governance token, the firm took months designing just what kind of behavior it wanted and how to incentivize it. Even still, Compound Labs was surprised by the response. It led to unintended consequences such as crowding into a previously unpopular market (lending and borrowing BAT) in order to mine as much COMP as possible.  Just last week, 115 different COMP wallet addresses – senators in Compound's ever-changing legislature – voted to change the distribution mechanism in hopes of spreading liquidity out across the markets again.  Is there DeFi for bitcoin?  Yes, on Ethereum.  Nothing has beaten bitcoin over time for returns, but there's one thing bitcoin can't do on its own: create more bitcoin.  A smart trader can get in and out of bitcoin and dollars in a way that will earn them more bitcoin, but this is tedious and risky. It takes a certain kind of person.  DeFi, however, offers ways to grow one's bitcoin holdings – though somewhat indirectly.  A long HODLer is happy to gain fresh BTC off their counterparty’s short-term win. That’s the game.  For example, a user can create a simulated bitcoin on Ethereum using BitGo's WBTC system. They put BTC in and get the same amount back out in freshly minted WBTC. WBTC can be traded back for BTC at any time, so it tends to be worth the same as BTC.  Then the user can take that WBTC, stake it on Compound and earn a few percent each year in yield on their BTC. Odds are, the people who borrow that WBTC are probably doing it to short BTC (that is, they will sell it immediately, buy it back when the price goes down, close the loan and keep the difference).  A long HODLer is happy to gain fresh BTC off their counterparty's short-term win. That's the game.  How risky is it?  Enough.  ""DeFi, with the combination of an assortment of digital funds, automation of key processes, and more complex incentive structures that work across protocols – each with their own rapidly changing tech and governance practices – make for new types of security risks,"" said Liz Steininger of Least Authority, a crypto security auditor. ""Yet, despite these risks, the high yields are undeniably attractive to draw more users.""  We've seen big failures in DeFi products. MakerDAO had one so bad in 2020 it's called ""Black Thursday."" There was also the exploit against flash loan provider bZx. These things do break and when they do money gets taken.  As this sector gets more robust, we could see token holders greenlighting more ways for investors to profit from DeFi niches.  Right now, the deal is too good for certain funds to resist, so they are moving a lot of money into these protocols to liquidity mine all the new governance tokens they can. But the funds – entities that pool the resources of typically well-to-do crypto investors – are also hedging. Nexus Mutual, a DeFi insurance provider of sorts, told CoinDesk it has maxed out its available coverage on these liquidity applications. Opyn, the trustless derivatives maker, created a way to short COMP, just in case this game comes to naught.  And weird things have arisen. At one point, there were more DAI on Compound than have been minted in the world. This makes sense once unpacked but it still feels dicey to everyone.  That said, distributing governance tokens might make things a lot less risky for startups, at least with regard to the money cops.  ""Protocols distributing their tokens to the public, meaning that there's a new secondary listing for SAFT tokens, [gives] plausible deniability from any security accusation,"" Zehavi wrote. (The Simple Agreement for Future Tokens was a legal structure favored by many token issuers during the ICO craze.)  Whether a cryptocurrency is adequately decentralized has been a key feature of ICO settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  What’s next for yield farming? (A prediction)  COMP turned out to be a bit of a surprise to the DeFi world, in technical ways and others. It has inspired a wave of new thinking.  ""Other projects are working on similar things,"" said Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp. In fact, informed sources tell CoinDesk brand-new projects will launch with these models.  We might soon see more prosaic yield farming applications. For example, forms of profit-sharing that reward certain kinds of behavior.  Imagine if COMP holders decided, for example, that the protocol needed more people to put money in and leave it there longer. The community could create a proposal that shaved off a little of each token's yield and paid that portion out only to the tokens that were older than six months. It probably wouldn't be much, but an investor with the right time horizon and risk profile might take it into consideration before making a withdrawal.  (There are precedents for this in traditional finance: A 10-year Treasury bond normally yields more than a one-month T-bill even though they're both backed by the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam, a 12-month certificate of deposit pays higher interest than a checking account at the same bank, and so on.)  As this sector gets more robust, its architects will come up with ever more robust ways to optimize liquidity incentives in increasingly refined ways. We could see token holders greenlighting more ways for investors to profit from DeFi niches.  Whatever happens, crypto's yield farmers will keep moving fast. Some fresh fields may open and some may soon bear much less luscious fruit.  But that’s the nice thing about farming in DeFi: It is very easy to switch fields.

Bitcoin Miner Reserve Shoots Up; Trend Of Accumulation From Last Year Continues As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC miner reserve has shown strong uptrend recently. This seems to be a continuation of the accumulation trend from the last year. The &apos;miner reserve&apos; is an indicator that tells us the total amount of Bitcoin currently stored in the wallets of miners. When the trend in the metric is towards up, it means miner inventories are growing as they stock up on more of the coin. Such a trend can be bullish for the price of the coin as it shows miners are currently accumulating BTC. On the other hand, a downtrend in the indicator implies miners have started to dump their Bitcoin. This kind of trend is naturally bearish for the price of the crypto as miners usually sell in big amounts.

The last few weeks have seen a modest rebound in total value locked, a measure of how much digital asset value has been collateralized for loans in the DeFi system. CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao whipped me up this chart, based on data from DeFi Pulse, which shows TVL, as expressed in ether, versus the value of the CoinDesk Indices' DeFi (DFX) index.  It’s too early to say whether the rebound in TVL will meaningfully reverse the declines in DeFi commitments seen since last spring. However, it’s notable the value has increased despite close to no rebound in dollar prices. We will have to see whether the sector can return to the unbridled enthusiasm of a year ago, or whether the zeitgeist has been lost to NFTs.

42411534,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOndc,1642182276,Web 3 Is a Long Fight Worth Fighting,"With all the attention – and divisive debates – around Web 3 this past month, you might think the idea of a third, more decentralized internet era is entirely new.  In truth, “Web 3.0” has been part of a two decades-long discussion around the societal, cultural and political distortions created by the dominance of big internet platforms such as Google and Facebook and around the negative impact of Web 2.0’s data-driven economics. It long precedes the latest crypto-based iteration as Web 3, which Ethereum and Polkadot co-founder Gavin Wood spearheaded via a 2014 blog post that CoinDesk republished last week.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Both sides of this raging debate have reasonable points of view. There’s the Chris Dixon position that Web 3 projects are creating real value and the countervailing Jack Dorsey position that the term is just a buzzword exploited by venture capitalists to boost their equity and token investment.  That smart people – including two famous “Tims” (discussed below) – have been exploring an exit from Web 2.0 for so long suggests Web 3 projects have worthy ambitions and that there will be public benefits and business payoffs if they succeed.  On the other hand, this long history reminds us that solving a very big problem is hard and that investors would be wise to take grandiose promises with a grain of salt.  Setting aside any opinion you might hold on either of these positions, it’s important to focus on the core structural issues with Web 2.0 and why there’s a need to change them. Doing so reveals a fundamental problem that’s crying out for a Web 3 advance: the misalignment between the interests of the giant companies that dominate the internet and those of the general public.  Blockchain technology can help address that, but it is by no means the only part of the solution or necessarily the most important part. We need a mix of technologies (both decentralized and centralized), regulation and economic rationale to enable business models that bring those competing private and public interests together.  But first, the question of how we got here requires a look at the long history of Web 3.  Web 3 means ‘not Web 2.0’  Web 3 is conceptually inseparable from the idea that society needs to escape Web 2.0 and its monopolization problems. For a long time, Web 3 has really just meant “the model that comes after Web 2.0.”  Sir Tim Berners-Lee signaled this need for an upgrade in 2006, when – according to a recent article by famed tech publisher Tim O’Reilly – the inventor of the world wide web coined the term “Web 3.0” to describe his longstanding vision for a new “Semantic Web.” Berners-Lee saw the evolution of universal data formats and artificial intelligence removing the need for intermediation by third parties to allow a true “machine-to-machine” communication network.  Whether Berners-Lee truly coined “Web 3.0” is not clear. (A quote from a 2006 New York Times article linked in O’Reilly’s column has the legendary computer scientist saying, “People keep asking what Web 3.0 is” – suggesting others had uttered the term before him.) Less in dispute is the idea that O’Reilly himself coined the term “Web 2.0,” having built a 2004 conference around the idea before explaining it in an influential 2005 essay.  By 2004, it was well known that Google, Facebook and Amazon – the survivors of the late-nineties dot.com bubble – had consolidated massive market power around ever-growing communities of value. What O’Reilly did was give a name to the new, network effects-driven business model that enabled their dominance: an ever-expanding mass user base on a common platform whose growth self-fulfillingly attracted more users to create a honeypot for advertisers. The emergence of these powerful intermediaries was a stark departure from the internet’s original decentralized idea, where publishers and users of information were expected to have direct, permissionless access to each other.  It wasn’t immediately obvious to most that this system was a socially harmful one, that the source of the platforms’ success – their ability to gather massive amounts of unprecedented user data about and package it for advertisers and other buyers of that information – would evolve into “Surveillance Capitalism.”  People didn’t foresee that we’d become dependent on the unchallenged control these few platforms wield over information, much less how, in handing over access to our eyeballs and clicking fingers, we’d be monitored, corralled into echo chamber groups, and manipulated with target ads and disinformation without even realizing it.  That’s what I mean by a misaligned business model, one that serves the owners of production but not the customers they are supposed to serve. It’s a very dysfunctional way for society to distribute information. It’s the problem that a future Web is waiting to solve.  ‘Web 3.0’ becomes Web 3  By the time of Gavin Wood’s 2014 essay, the mess we were in was clearer. There was also a new way of looking at it.  Blockchain technology advocates were now positing it, not only as a way to resolve the centralized internet’s problems but also as a novel way of framing them. In focusing on the blockchain-centric concept of “trust,” Wood, who was co-founding Ethereum at the time, shifted our gaze away from the standard economic theory that decentralization’s inefficiency had opened the door to centralizing monopolies and pushed it toward Web 2.0’s meta problem: that the distrust among decentralized communities leads people to entrust centralized entities to coordinate their exchanges of money and valuable information with each other. What was always true for banks and money could now be seen in the realm of exchanges in another valuable commodity: data.  The next step was to posit that blockchains such as Ethereum, in supplanting trust in centralized entities like Google, offered the alternative of a verifiable, “truthful” means of tracking exchanges via open protocols and decentralized validator networks. If we could achieve that, the argument went, we could replace monopolistic platforms with decentralized communities of data sharing. Business models would emerge where applications service those communities’ transactions of money and information but, in keeping with the idea of “self sovereign identity,” control over that valuable personal data would reside solely with each individual user.  Wood was so focused on such ideas that, after leaving Ethereum, he dedicated his work at Parity Labs to this giant fix-the-internet objective. In founding the Web3 Foundation in 2017, he effectively rebranded Web 3.0 as Web 3.  Building bridges  Four years later, with Web 3 almost a household word and largely associated with crypto products such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), are we achieving these objectives?  The jury is out. For one line of analysis, read Twitter critiques such as former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s, who argued the Web 3 industry is more about VC profits than real functionality. For another, see the polite responses from the likes of Balaji Srinivasan, who touted the superiority of Ethereum’s trustless “smart contracts” over Twitter users’ need to trust the platform’s “social contracts.”  Or there’s the blog post by Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike (real name: Matthew Rosenfeld), who argued that Web 3 is far harder to achieve than crypto cheerleaders believe because the cost and hassle of running one’s own web server naturally leads people to defer control to more efficient centralized platforms. That prompted a nuanced response from Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin core developer, who cited Bitcoin’s SPV (simplified payment verification) wallets as an example of a lightweight user-controlled software that can process information while maintaining integrity and avoiding dependence on centralized servers.  All sides make valid points. One thing’s certain: We still have a long way to go to escape The Matrix. Blockchain’s “trustless” exchange models might be part of the fix, as might the emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), where the power of collective action could overcome the network effect advantages of centralized platforms.  But much more is needed. As O’Reilly argued in his more recent article, if Web 3 is to go beyond its “idealism” and become “a general system for decentralized trust, it needs to develop robust interfaces with the real world, its legal systems, and the operating economy.”  Thankfully, people are building such bridges. Demand will drive them. For one thing, the entrance of mainstream, lawyer-controlled media corporations into the NFT and metaverse industry will demand these normalizing features get built. Still, to O’Reilly’s point, blockchain and crypto are not solo solutions. Many other elements are needed.  Let’s not forget the goal here: for humanity’s sake, we need a way out of the Web 2.0 morass. Keep striving, Web 3 builders.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

Despite this growth, the market still has a lot of growing to do and Edelman believes this is only the beginning. Comparing Crypto To The Internet It is estimated that there are 130 million users of the crypto market currently. This number has grown from the previous years but still remains a tiny fraction of the world&apos;s population who are yet to come into the market. Edelman, speaking with CNBC, explained that the crypt market now is similar to what the internet was 20 or 30 years ago in its growth pattern.

42411548,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOo7N,1642178099,Nayib Bukele Is Not the Bitcoin Hero We Need,"New reporting has found strong evidence Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has sought to undermine freedom of speech in the Central American nation. According to a joint investigation by Salvadoran news outlet El Faro, Toronto-based Citizen Lab and digital rights nonprofit Access Now, the cell phones of at least 22 of El Faro’s journalists were infected with spyware known as Pegasus over the past two years. Other journalists and human rights activists were also targeted. Pegasus has previously been used against journalists or other so-called undesirables in nations including India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda and Saudi Arabia.  The report should trigger serious reflection among Bitcoiners. While Bukele’s move to adopt bitcoin as an alternative to the U.S. dollar in El Salvador has great potential for freeing the developing world from the yoke of the global financial establishment, his authoritarian behavior here is anathema to the cyber-libertarian ideals that underpin cryptocurrency.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Pegasus, produced by Israeli firm NSO Group, allows not just the monitoring of a victim’s communications but deeper access to device data. The El Faro investigation, whose findings were certified by Amnesty International, found data had been exfiltrated from the devices of at least 11 journalists. The tool has been previously used in acts of violent suppression: NSO and Pegasus have been linked to the murders of Mexican opposition journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.  Up to this point, I’ve been skeptical about attempts to paint Bukele as a nascent dictator. Much of the anti-Bukele rhetoric in the Anglophone press has focused on his replacement of judges and one theatrical display of military strength, alongside derogatory statements from developed-world governments. These struck me as hard to take at face value given El Salvador’s extremely complex modern political history, entrenched corruption and the culpability of countries like the United States in fomenting the very instability that might have made strong-arm tactics necessary for Bukele’s reformist agenda.  But spying on opposition journalists is several orders of magnitude more reprehensible to me than any other claims made about Bukele so far. I am admittedly biased, but the suppression of information is a fundamental attack on the good and fair functioning of any society.  See also: Bitcoin's 'Authoritarian Hipster'  This puts Bitcoiners in particular in a bind. With its roots in crypto-anarchist and digital libertarian ideals, the Bitcoin community is ideologically hostile to both state power and digital surveillance. This sentiment is so strong that many in the community bristled at a provision in El Salvador’s law that seemed to mandate the acceptance of bitcoin by retailers. The new report should offend those critics at least as deeply.  It’s notable that this is not the first time the cryptocurrency industry has been asked to pass judgment on the ethics of state-backed digital espionage. After Coinbase acquired a blockchain analytics company called Neutrino in early 2019, myself and other investigators and reporters highlighted the company’s deep ties to a black-hat organization known as Hacking Team. Hacking Team had sold invasive spyware to repressive regimes, which used the tools to target dissidents and journalists. After fierce backlash from the crypto community, Coinbase ultimately fired former Hacking Team members from Neutrino, and admitted the acquisition had been a failure of due diligence.  The decision facing bitcoin advocates now may be more complex. El Salvador is a valuable testing ground for the digital currency, but if El Faro’s findings are true it seems clear the Bukele administration can no longer be considered a trustworthy partner. Beyond the simple ethics of supporting a regime that seeks antidemocratic methods of repressing its critics, the bitcoin community must be vigilant about public perception, given the continued widespread hostility towards cryptocurrency. A leader willing to use black-ops spyware against his own citizens is not an acceptable figurehead for spreading bitcoin adoption.  My sympathies here lie almost entirely with the journalists who have been targeted and harassed for attempting to inform Salvadorans about their own leadership. But it’s also deeply personally disappointing: I was hoping to visit El Salvador at some point this year and report on the status of the bitcoin project there. That now appears considerably less feasible because it would potentially expose me, and any other international journalists who travel there, to ongoing surveillance by Nayib Bukele and his allies.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Z.

An attacker hacked one of the project's admin accounts on Discord, according to the group's Twitter account.  ""EMERGENCY NOTICE. A CityDAO Discord admin account has been hacked. THERE IS NO LAND DROP. DO NOT CONNECT YOUR WALLET,"" CityDAO tweeted Monday.  CityDAO's founders purchased 40 acres of land in Wyoming in November with the intention of building a ""blockchain city.""  The project's aim is to build a city with decentralized governance, where ""citizens"" purchase land in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). CityDAO uses Discord to issue alerts known as ""land drops"" when there are opportunities to purchase said NFTs.  The attacker issued a fake land drop from the admin's compromised account, pocketing 29.67 ETH ($95,000) in the process.  The affected admin, ""Lyons800"", subsequently tweeted that the attack was ""a ridiculous security breach from Discord.""  This marks a second large hack via Discord in less than a month. On Dec. 21, Justin Kan's NFT platform Fractal suffered a breach in which someone hacked the project's account to issue a fraudulent link to users promoting a new NFT, making off with around $150,000.

The move follows last month’s announcement by former First Lady Melania Trump that she would be releasing an NFT series featuring images of herself, also with Parler. Despite the fact that a portion of the proceeds will go to benefit charity, the announcement attracted some jibes on Twitter.  Part 1 of the Parler ""Trump Legacy"" series features a collection of 10,000 pieces of art derived from McNaughton’s hand-painted images, minted on Ethereum as ERC-721 tokens.  Presales will be available to whitelist subscribers starting on Jan. 20 for 0.10 ETH (roughly $320), with remaining tokens to be sold to the public later.  While the artwork prominently features Trump, the former president himself has been a longstanding opponent of cryptocurrencies, calling them ""very dangerous"" as recently as last month.

However, this is not the case, in reality, the websites, data that make up the whole internet are often censored, changed, and sometimes removed also. Big centralized enterprises such as AWS, Google Cloud, IBM, DELL EMC store most of the data on the internet. They act as a medium in providing users access to applications, websites and can easily revoke our access anytime. In case these companies don&apos;t have enough funding to maintain the servers, our data can also disappear. Long-term data storage is a big problem faced by internet users currently. Arweave solves all of these problems by following a decentralized approach. What is Arweave? Arweave is a decentralized protocol that allows you to store data permanently on the internet by paying fees only one time. It connects people who need storage to those people having disk space on their hardware devices. It is designed to provide internet users with permanent, cost-efficient data storage. Arweave is built differently than any major blockchains such as Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, etc. It is built on the blockchain-like data structure called blockweave. In blockweave, each block is linked to the previous block and to a recall block (a random block from the history of the blockweave).

42416439,d60h41507aWJfyJCE1NuyB,1642169800,"After Bitcoin’s Weak Start to the Year, Analysts Now Predict Price Increase","After a rocky start to the year, bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stabilized this week, and some analysts are predicting that prices could be set to rise.  Bitcoin has added 1% since Sunday after dropping almost 12% in the first week of 2022. Compared with the first week of 2021, when bitcoin gained 15% and traded above $50,000, this week's move looks small, but experts say the market might be turning higher now.  Prices are likely to rebound from the current level around $42,000 though will remain within the $40,000-$60,000 band, said Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora.  “This would set bitcoin up for a move to new highs later in the year,” he said. “We predict the catalyst for this move to be stubbornly high inflation numbers coupled with a continuation of negative real interest rates.”  A ""real"" interest rate is adjusted for inflation, so when the figure is negative, it means that consumer prices are rising faster than benchmark bond yields. The dynamic – a function of ultra-loose monetary policies put in place by central banks around the world – encourages risk-taking since investors are effectively losing value by holding bonds and other fixed-income instruments.  The U.S. Labor Department said Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index, the nation's most widely tracked inflation gauge, rose 7% in December from 12 months earlier, up from 6.8% in November. This is the fastest annual increase since 1982.  While bitcoin has recovered after dipping below $40,000 on Monday, this rebound is nothing by bitcoin standards, according to Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.  “If bitcoin can break $45,500, we could see another sharp move higher as belief starts to grow that the worst of the rout is behind it,” Erlam wrote in a daily newsletter on Thursday.  Risk asset or inflation hedge?  The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.97% in the last five days, a move that is generally considered bullish for bitcoin and other dollar-denominated asset prices.  “This is certainly good for risk assets and it has become more and more evident that BTC falls under that bucket, at least for now,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.  Bitcoin ""has been behaving more as a risk asset recently amidst market uncertainties,"" said Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds. “The markets are still split if BTC is an inflationary hedge or risk asset, and with the current macro climate, expect more volatility in the short term.”  Whether bitcoin is seen as a risk-on asset or as a clear inflation hedge is dependent on geography, according to Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics.  In developed economies, bitcoin is very much seen as a risk-on asset and is being traded based on macroeconomic developments, such as inflation and central-bank stimulus programs, according to Deane. In developing economies like Turkey, Brazil and Argentina, however, there is a clear inflation-hedge play.  “As a result of this, direction is not clear and we fully expect unpredictable, choppy moves in a broadly sideways range for the time being,” Deane said.  Looking at the price of bitcoin in the long term, Deane predicts continued growth, development and adoption on a global scale.  “At some point this will become the dominant narrative and almost certainly lead to new price discovery in the future,” Deane said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/14/after-bitcoins-weak-start-to-the-year-analysts-now-predict-price-increase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86c27cf015f4507190a677a9ff2fd01a3ff63f63-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wu later confirmed the move in a tweet.  FTX Ventures is one of the industry's largest funds, the report said. The full funding came from FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Investments could be as low as $100,000 and as high as hundreds of millions of dollars.  Wu, who joined FTX this month from Lightspeed Venture Partners, said the fund could deploy all of the funds by next year, but that depends on the opportunities that FTX sees in the market. In October, FTX raised $420.7 million and was valued at $25 billion.  Wu told the Journal she is particularly interested in crypto gaming companies, as well as insurance and security products.  FTX Ventures joins funds set up by other crypto exchanges such as Binance Labs and Coinbase Ventures, both of which have been in existence for several years.

The slump in crypto prices could affect companies such as Core Scientific, which is planning to become a public company through a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition Corp., and bitcoin miner Rhodium Enterprises, which is planning an almost $2 billion dollar IPO.  Bitcoin prices have fallen more than 30% since reaching an all-time high in November, and investors and the number of miners going public have subsequently slowed.  “There are a number of SPACs and IPOs that will look to close in the first half of 2022, such as Core Scientific, PrimeBlock, Rhodium and Griid,” Luxor Mining’s co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera said. These companies looking to go public not only face a correction in crypto prices but also an increasingly crowded market, he added.  Stronghold Digital fell more than 50% since its trading debut in October on the Nasdaq; meanwhile, another miner, Iris Energy, also declined more than 50% since going public in November.  Gwyneth Paltrow-backed bitcoin miner TeraWulf, which was a SPAC play, fell in its trading debut in December, and the shares have traded sideways since then, according to TradingView data.  With bitcoin's price falling more than 30% since reaching its all-time high in November, and competition expected to rise as the network's hashrate increases this year, investors will be eyeing miners’ valuations and their growth strategies. Companies that can distinguish themselves in the increasingly competitive sector will be the ultimate winners.  “In order for these [new] companies to retain their proposed valuation when trading, they will need to find ways to differentiate their businesses from the existing operators,” Vera said. He also noted that production numbers from these companies for January and February will be a strong indicator where these companies will likely start trading when they go public.  However, for investors to really pay up for a company, they will need to see more longer-term strategy from the companies, said Eric F. Risley, managing partner of crypto mergers and acquisitions firm Architect Partners. Risley added that crypto miners that can operate most efficiently are most likely to thrive amid crypto markets’ fluctuations.  “We believe the mining haves and have nots (efficiency of operations) will reveal themselves in the next 24 months, and the haves will enjoy stronger valuations and strategic flexibility and growth options,” he said.

For the first time, ether accounted for most – 58% – of the stolen funds, according to the report. It was followed by altcoins and ERC-20 tokens, with bitcoin at just 20% of the total, Chainalysis said.  The increased variety of tokens has led the hackers to step up their efforts to launder their spoils, the report said. The typical process now involves several steps of swapping one cryptocurrency for another on decentralized exchanges and using decentralized finance (DeFi) mixers, which are privacy tools for obscuring the history of the transactions, to conceal their tracks, according to Chainalysis.  Mixers were the most used tool among North Korean hackers for the first time, accounting for over 65% of stolen funds, up from 42% in 2020 and 21% the year before, Chainalysis said. In 2017 and 2019, crypto exchanges were the most popular way of laundering money.  About $170 million of stolen funds from 49 exploits dating back to 2017 have yet to be laundered, the report said.  The number of North Korea-attributed attacks grew from four to seven, and the funds stolen grew by 40%, the highest since 2018, according to the report. The victims were mostly investment firms and centralized exchanges.  Chainalysis said that many of last year's attacks were likely carried out by a group labeled as advanced persistent threat 38 (APT38), also known as Lazarus Group. The group is believed to be led by Pyongyang’s primary intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau.

Although it is risky due to its high volatility, being such a young market like DeFi that&apos;s also unregulated carries some other, more significant threats. The true danger lies in the lack of boundaries among the endless opportunities, which eventually traps DeFi in becoming a large playground for Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF).

You can buy bitcoin directly on crypto exchanges, bitcoin ATMs, P2P marketplaces or traditional brokers. Likewise, you can also sell bitcoin via any of these channels, with the exception of some bitcoin ATMs.  You can sell bitcoin on the same exchange or brokerage where it was purchased by placing a sell order. As the name suggests, a sell order is an instruction to a broker (crypto exchange) to sell an asset, in this case bitcoin, at a particular price.  Bitcoin can also be exchanged or swapped for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, such as ether or tether (respectively). This is useful if you wish to take profit on your bitcoin investment or prevent the value of your portfolio from declining.  If you plan on withdrawing the fiat (government-issued currency) equivalent of your bitcoin, you would need to first place a sell order involving your preferred fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Once the order is fulfilled, most exchanges will allow you to withdraw your funds directly to your bank account. Note, most exchanges have a minimum withdrawal amount, which means if you leave small balances in your exchange account you might have to deposit more in order to get the remaining amount out.  Learn More: Bitcoin 101 Crash Course  Overall, Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, FTX and Kraken are examples of some high-volume exchanges where you can buy and sell bitcoin. Volume refers to the amount of money or digital assets being traded on the exchange at any given time. High volumes mean it’s more likely you’ll be able to successfully complete your sale of bitcoin at any given time.  It is also worth mentioning that depending on the volume of your order and how much you wish to withdraw, you may be required to go through some form of identity verification. “Know Your Customer"" (KYC) procedures are now mandatory for many crypto exchanges, just as they are for traditional financial institutions. Therefore, you may be required to submit information such as a valid identification card, utility bills with your house address or a Social Security number before you can buy and sell bitcoin.  Apart from crypto exchanges and bitcoin ATMs, another way to sell bitcoin is through peer-to-peer markets. In this case, the transaction happens directly between you and the buyer. You can register as a seller on platforms such as LocalBitcoins, Paxful and BitQuick.  Although each platform handles payments a little differently, the process is essentially the same. First, you need to register as a seller on any of these platforms and then set up your sell order. You will be notified when someone shows an interest in your offer to sell bitcoin. Some platforms such as Localbitcoins have a built-in escrow service to ensure transactions run smoothly. You can receive payment for your sold bitcoin via Moneygram, Paypal, cash in the mail, gift cards, bank deposits and even cash in person, depending on your preferred option. If you decide to make in-person trades, make sure you transact in a public setting and be aware of the major risks involved.

The figures were much higher than liquidations on bitcoin or ether futures, which usually see the most losses among all cryptocurrencies.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading where traders own the actual assets.  Nearly 65% of the liquidations stemmed from short trades, or from those betting on the downside, accounting for over $7.66 million in losses. Leveraged traders betting on an upside lost another $4 million on margin calls.  Data from analytics tool Coinglass showed 60.81 million dogecoin was liquidated across various crypto exchanges. Futures products tracking the meme coin on OKEx saw over $7.71 million in liquidations, while similar products on Binance saw $2.75 million in liquidations.  The price rally came as electric-car maker Tesla went live with dogecoin payments for merchandise early Friday. Tesla fans can now purchase belt buckles, whistles, chargers and a quadbike using the meme coin on the official store, as reported.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously lent support to dogecoin development and adoption even as the meme coin’s creators abandoned the project back in 2015. In a tweet in May 2021, Musk stated he was working with dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency.  In December, the Dogecoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that oversees developments on the network, introduced a roadmap for the project’s revival and rebrand from a mere joke cryptocurrency to a more technical project. It was the first roadmap in Dogecoin’s eight-year history and explored eight new projects, including the launch of LibDogecoin and GigaWallet, as reported.

42396220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1h7A,1642151846,Someone Accidentally Lost $135K Trying to Trade Fees.Wtf Tokens,"Ethereum blockchain data shows a user lost over $135,000 worth of ether trying to purchase Fees.wtf tokens (WTF) soon after an airdrop on Thursday night.  Data shows the user accidentally swapped 42 ether for 0.00004 WTF. However, this amount of WTF was worth just $0.00000525172 at the time of writing, as per data from CoinGecko.  The slippage was caused due to low liquidity in the trading pool, causing some in crypto circles to criticize how Fees.wtf developers funded the initial pool.  Fees.wtf is a popular tool that allows users to track the fees they spend on Ethereum. It airdropped its WTF tokens on Thursday, jumping on the larger trend of crypto projects distributing tokens to user wallets based on their usage with those protocols instead of listing directly on the market.  Use cases include staking WTF or its liquidity pool tokens with annualized returns of up to 7,000% as of the time of this writing. Users are further eligible to receive a non-fungible token (NFT), which Fees.wtf says is unique to each individual wallet.  Speculators jumped into accumulating WTF soon after its listing on Ethereum-based exchange Uniswap, hoping that an eventual price rise would net them handsome returns. But the low amount of initial liquidity on Uniswap lead to tears instead of glory.  Liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap are unlike how traditional exchanges operate. A pool refers to a set of two tokens provided by users to a DEX, which then uses smart contracts to match trades and automatically increase or reduce prices at which the two tokens trade with each other.  That’s where the problem lay. Blockchain data shows Fees.wtf developers seeded the initial pool on Uniswap with over 2,211 WTF and 0.000001 ether, causing a huge imbalance in the trading pool. This allowed users to sell low amounts of WTF for relatively high amounts of ether, while buyers of WTF ended up purchasing the tokens at a much higher value.  Purchasing WTF after the airdrop could have been a bad bet in hindsight.

What does the future hold, though? If the objective is to onboard the next billion people, the network needs work and fine-tuning. To grab the bull by the horns, The Human Rights Foundation and Strike set up three 1 BTC bounties. The bounties will go to the first person or team to develop an anonymous Lightning tip jar, a tokenless way to peg BTC to dollars, or a privacy-focused wallet that supports some kind of Chaumian e-cash feature. In a Twitter Spaces conversation about the program, they named it The Lightning Development Initiative. A catchy name that we&apos;ll use from now on to refer to all of this. This fourth edition of Lightning Speed is all about the future. Let&apos;s explore the three ideas and the new information that we have about each of them. The Lightning Development Initiative In Twitter Spaces Among the speakers were Strike&apos;s Jack Mallers, The Human Rights Foundation&apos;s Alex Gladstein, Bitcoin Magazine&apos;s Christian Keroles AKA CK Snarks, and Tales From The Crypt&apos;s Matt Odell.

As the bitcoin and ether markets followed the bearish sentiment of the equities market as the week began, bitcoin and ether tumbled below $40,000 and $3,000, respectively.  QCP wrote there was a bounce-back because of the number of strikes at the $40,000 mark for bitcoin, and the $3,000 mark for ether, held by the large holders known as whales.  The fund noted there was a counterparty that was buying a large amount of downside risk reversals (where a trader buys the put and sells the call) who suddenly switched positions to take profit (where they sell the put and buy the call).  With the volume of delta trading (simultaneously buying and selling options) on the strikes at $40,000 and $3,000, there was a creation of spot support at those levels, QCP wrote.  QCP said one reason why bitcoin is facing some resistance at the $44,000 market is a whale began taking profit on his $42,000 January calls as bitcoin drifted towards $44,000.  “We think option activity will increasingly dictate spot movements as the option market continues to grow,” the firm wrote.

As the name implies, decentralized finance removes central authorities and intermediaries from the sector, granting the public direct access to financial products at the best possible rates. Essentially, banks and other financial institutions can no longer exert their control over the market, putting the power into the hands of everyday individuals. There are several advantages to using DeFi. One of the most noticeable is the autonomy it provides the public. Through DeFi, people transacting in the finance sector using various products have total control of their funds and can channel them as preferred. Also, DeFi does not enforce heavy restrictions on access to these financial products, unlike the traditional system that reserves many products to high net worth individuals. Another advantage of DeFi is reduced fees; since there are no intermediary banks or financial institutions, customers do not have to worry about the substantial fees these entities charge. Today, several entities have seen the ease DeFi brings to the industry, and are looking to use this technology to disrupt the global finance sector.

Put together, an NFT is a record of ownership of a unique item that&apos;s stored on a blockchain. While NFTs had their start in generative art, their use cases have expanded to include other digital items like metaverse land, blockchain game characters, and music. Further, a process called tokenization allows the ownership of physical items to be encoded into blockchains, expanding NFT use cases even further to include things like merchandise, real estate, and physical art. Data stored on blockchains is immutable and transparent - immutable meaning tamper-resistant, and transparent meaning visible and verifiable by all. Because NFTs exist on the blockchain, they cannot be deleted, and their existence is publicly verifiable. This makes NFTs ideal for ownership rights management and securely storing important records. Their applications are limited only by the human imagination. The logic behind NFTs - their creation, how they are transferred between people, and their utility - is managed by smart contracts, bits of software that enforce digital agreements and run on decentralized networks like Ethereum. Combined with immutability and transparency, smart contracts make NFTs trustless, making it possible for people to transact directly without risk of fraud.

The president will also tap Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson as Fed governors, according the report.  Raskin was a governor at the central bank from 2010 to 2014 before serving as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. She is married to U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.  Raskin's nomination faces a challenge from the Senate Banking Committee's ranking member, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. He criticized all three of Biden's potential picks.  “Sarah Bloom Raskin has specifically called for the Fed to pressure banks to choke off credit to traditional energy companies and to exclude those employers from any Fed emergency lending facilities,” he said in a statement Thursday evening cited by CNBC. “I have serious concerns that she would abuse the Fed’s narrow statutory mandates on monetary policy and banking supervision to have the central bank actively engaged in capital allocation.”  “I will closely examine whether Ms. Cook and Mr. Jefferson have the necessary experience, judgment, and policy views to serve as Fed Governors,” he added.  The nominations come at time of record inflation, as Biden tries to pass his multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better legislation even in the face of opposition from some Senate Democrats whose every yes vote he needs to get the law passed.

Decentralization has been a hot topic, and while the word itself isn&apos;t mentioned once throughout Satoshi Nakamoto&apos;s Bitcoin whitepaper, it is a core identity that has been latched on to bitcoin, and crypto in general, since near inception. Of course, decentralization is the core component of just one of many question marks around Tether. However, this week the spotlight is on just that, as Tether announced that roughly $160M worth of stablecoin USDT would be frozen. Let&apos;s look at what we know. Tether Faces Scrutiny Around Decentralization Three Ethereum-based USDT addresses, holding north of $150M, were frozen this week, according to Tether officials, as the blockchain cited the move due to &apos;a request from law enforcement.&apos; The blockchain has now blacklisted over 560 addresses since November 2017. It was the first blacklisting maneuver from Tether in 2022. Tether representatives have previously stated that &apos;through the freezing of addresses, Tether has been able to help recover funds stolen by hackers or are compromised,&apos; leading to heated debates in the crypto community - one that has largely embraced decentralization - over what degree of power blockchain authorities should be able to weild over the network.

42396210,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1gxK,1642120403,"SEC Must Surrender Hinman Email on Ether to Ripple, Judge Rules","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must surrender to Ripple an email with a draft of former director William Hinman’s speech on whether ether is a security as part of an ongoing lawsuit the regulatory agency filed against the crypto startup, a judge ruled Thursday.  The SEC sued Ripple and members of its leadership at the end of 2020 on charges the company sold and continues to sell the XRP cryptocurrency in violation of federal securities law. The agency and Ripple have been involved in a protracted back-and-forth over what sort of documents must be made available through the discovery process, with Ripple seeking a number of documents detailing internal SEC communications and policies.  SEC attorneys claim these documents contain staffer deliberations and are protected against discovery. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn of the Southern District of New York federal court, ruled some of these documents are protected but ordered the regulator to turn over others, including the email with Hinman’s speech and some notes from meetings between SEC staffers and third parties that are not Ripple.  “We’re pleased with the Court’s order, which grants Ripple access to important documents that the SEC was withholding. We will continue to aggressively defend this case – and we remain optimistic that resolution of this case will provide much needed clarity to the industry,"" Ripple General Counsel Stu Alderoty said.  The SEC did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Read more:Judge Denies Ripple’s Motion to Have SEC Employees’ Crypto Transactions Disclosed  An email of a draft of a 2018 speech by Hinman, former director of Corporation Finance, is included in the list of documents to be surrendered. Hinman gave the speech in June 2018, telling the audience at a conference that, in his view, ether was not a security.  The speech was seen as pivotal for the crypto industry, given the first 60 million ether (the native token of the Ethereum blockchain) was sold to raise funds for the Ethereum Foundation. Ether is now commonly seen as a commodity in the U.S., with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission overseeing derivatives products based on the cryptocurrency.  Hinman’s speech reflected his own views, he said at the time, a point the judge referenced on Thursday in her ruling.  “The personal views of agency employees are not protected by the privilege unless they bear on ‘the formulation or exercise of policy-oriented judgment,’” the judge said in a 23-page ruling. “Accordingly, emails concerning the speech or draft versions are neither pre-decisional nor deliberative agency documents entitled to protection.”  While the email with the draft speech must be turned over, a separate email sent by the Office of the Chief Counsel for Corporation Finance the day before his speech does not need to be turned over, the judge wrote.  “The documents related to SEC staff's legal analysis of XRP, contained the SEC's staff preliminary views during the Division of Enforcement's investigation into XRP and did not present a recommendation to the SEC,” she said.  These documents were prepared for the investigation into XRP, and therefore qualify as “the kind of pre-decisional and deliberative legal analysis the deliberative process privilege protects.""  The SEC also does not have to turn over notes from meetings between SEC staffers and Ripple, as well as interagency discussions, the judge ruled.

Overall, Ripple sought access to 14 entries and three additional documents.  “The SEC is further ordered to review its privilege log and produce, in full or in part, any documents previously withheld based on the privilege that would be inconsistent with this order,” Judge Netburn wrote.
