42429558,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzlfh,1534975977,SEC Rejects 9 Bitcoin ETF Proposals,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued rejections to bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) proposals from ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares.  In three orders published on August 22, the rejections came ahead of previously reported deadlines arising from the SEC's public-facing approval process.  Notably, the agency used the exact same reasoning – and wording – in all of its rejections.  The agency wrote in the case of ProShares:  ""...the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, the Exchange has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that a national securities exchange's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""  And in the case of Direxion's five proposed ETFs:  ""...the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, the Exchange has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that a national securities exchange's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""  In all instances, the SEC stressed that it ""emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.""  Similar language was also used in the GraniteShares rejection as well.  The rejections come mere weeks after SEC commissioners completed a review on a proposed bitcoin ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose multi-year effort was dashed after a majority of the SEC's commissioners backed up the agency's original March 2017 decision.  One commissioner, Hester Peirce, dissented that decision, later telling CoinDesk in an interview that the move to block a bitcoin ETF is a disservice to both investors and innovators.  Past issues cited  For those who have read disapproval orders for bitcoin ETFs in the past, the language likely calls to mind the justifications used to twice strike down a proposal from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss for their proposed bitcoin ETF.  Yet for the three companies named today, the proposals were unique in that they were tied to the market for bitcoin futures rather than a fund that holds bitcoin directly.  Notably, the SEC cited a letter from one of the current markets for bitcoin futures in the U.S., CBOE.  ""Additionally, the President and COO of CFE, recently acknowledged in a letter to the Commission staff that 'the current bitcoin futures trading volumes on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME may not currently be sufficient to support ETPs seeking 100 [percent] long or short exposure to bitcoin',"" the agency wrote.  At the same time, the SEC did concede a notable point: that investors would gain an extra layer of protection by trading exchange-based products for bitcoin – while also contending that possible benefits should be held against other considerations.  ""The Commission acknowledges that, compared to trading in unregulated bitcoin spot markets, trading a bitcoin-based ETP on a national securities exchange may provide some additional protection to investors, but the Commission must consider this potential benefit in the broader context of whether the proposal meets each of the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,"" officials argued in the ProShares rejection.

Scammers are sending letters threatening to expose an alleged secret to men, and asking for a ""confidentiality fee"" paid through bitcoin, wrote Cristina Miranda, a member of the FTC's Division of Consumer and Business Education on Tuesday.  An example letter stated:  ""I know about the secret you are keeping from your wife and everyone else. You can ignore this letter, or pay me a $8,600 confidentiality fee in bitcoin.""  The letters reportedly also provide instructions on how victims can make these payments.  The education division, whose goal is to protect consumers from deceptive and unfair business practices, also provided guidance on how men can avoid losing funds to bitcoin-related blackmail scams.  The agency recommended that potential victims report letters ""immediately"" to both local police and the FBI.  While the FTC specifically said the scam is targeting men, comments suggested that it may also be targeting women. One comment, by username Hana, said ""I am a female and have also received a similar threat.""

42429563,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzlth,1534950967,Analyst Questions Bitmain's Revenue as Crypto Miner Seeks IPO,"Crypto mining giant Bitmain may be losing its advantage in developing miners amid other potential cash-flow issues, according to a new report.  Analysts with research firm Alliance Bernstein said the company's ""cash flow appears to be questionable and the company may be gradually losing technological edge"" in a report published Wednesday. The researchers note that Bitmain's revenue in 2017 fell below estimates after the company stored a large number of its miners' components, rather than selling to customers, although its revenue still remained ""remarkably high"" for that year.  Further, even though Bitmain dominated the mining device market with ""77 percent unit share in bitcoin and ~85 percent in all cryptocurrencies last year,"" declining cryptocurrency prices reduced some of that revenue stream.  The bear market also impacted Bitmain's holdings. The company holds roughly 5.7 percent of the total supply of bitcoin cash, which Bernstein says was ""likely"" acquired using its operating cash and bitcoin holdings.  ""These BCH holdings, valued at U.S. $890 million as of [Q1 2018], poses another major risk as BCH is illiquid and has depreciated nearly 20 percent since [Q1 2018],"" the report notes.  The company's problems also extend to its own crypto mining projects. The report states that, last year, Bitmain's advantage in mining rigs ensured it could fund projects with customer deposits, and saw roughly $1.3 billion in cash flow. However, as the price dropped early this year, customer deposits also slumped, and Bitmain was ""forced to draw from its operating cash flow"" in Q1 2018.  The report argues:  Going forward, the competitiveness of Bitmain's chips is in question, as Bitmain failed in a 10nm chip [and] possibly other projects too. Rivals now may have caught up in technologies and Bitmain's inventory (U.S. $1.2B as of [Q1 2018]) may face major a write-down risk.""  The publication comes after two of the firm's reported pre-IPO round investors – though the claim did not come from Bitmain itself – told CoinDesk that they were not actually involved in the funding effort. Both Tencent Holdings and SoftBank group said they were not investing in the company, with SoftBank adding that it had not invested in the company previously, either.  Bitmain is seeking potentially as much as $18 billion in its IPO later this year. If successful, the company could see a market capitalization as high as $50 billion after the IPO concludes.

42429566,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzm3h,1534939239,A Crypto Card Game Is Testing Magic's Records – And It Hasn't Even Launched,"In the world of nerdy trading card games, the Black Lotus is still on top.  An early version of the rare Magic: the Gathering card sold for over $87,000 in July. But less than a week later, that record received a challenge – though it wasn't beaten – from an unlikely source: a crypto trading card for a new ethereum-based game, Gods Unchained, sold at auction for 146 ether, worth more than $60,000 at the time.  It's a notable figure given that Magic is a quarter century-old institution, while Gods Unchained has yet to launch (it's expected to go live on ethereum in the fourth quarter). Still, according to those behind the platform, such figures are due to the excitement for both the game itself, and for unique crypto assets broadly.  James Ferguson, CEO of Fuel Games, the Sydney-based startup behind the game, said of his company's creation:  ""It's a really compelling game, which people would play regardless of it having anything to do with crypto.""  Ferguson compared Gods Unchained to Magic and Hearthstone, a digital trading card game with similar gameplay and fantasy aesthetics to Magic. ""It's sort of complexity-wise, and strategy-wise, a step up from Hearthstone and probably a step down from Magic: the Gathering,"" he said.  There is a key difference, though. Magic's cards are pieces of paper, meaning players have to be physically present and requiring them to lug heavy, valuable cards around. Hearthstone's cards are digital, but the game is centralized.  In centralized games, Ferguson said, players ""have so little security over what they're given in game. Essentially it's just a license to use a certain costume or a certain item on a server, and the game's company can alter stats as they wish and do whatever they think is best.""  In Gods Unchained, by contrast, the cards are non-fungible ERC-721 tokens housed on the ethereum blockchain. That means they are fully owned and controlled by the holder of an account's cryptographic key, with no risk that they will be altered or taken away. (There will, however, be a short ""rebalancing period"" after launch, during which Fuel Games can alter cards to make sure none are too powerful).  Ferguson said that decentralizing in-game aspects has appeal for gamers who might never have heard of cryptocurrency.  Gaming ""is taking up so much of people's lives and identity nowadays,"" he said, ""people are even using it as their jobs."" Professionals can't risk their cards being weakened (""nerfed"").  There's even speculation, Ferguson added, that the $60,000 ""Hyperion"" card was bought by a professional streamer.  Break into the mainstream?  Launch ahead, the ""main goal"" now according to Ferguson, is to attract 100,000 or a million players to ""Gods Unchained"" and, by extension to ethereum and the crypto asset ecosystem. ""We want to offer them the chance to seamlessly […] get their first $5 or $10 worth of crypto through buying the cards,"" he said.  He explained that Fuel Games could accomplish that goal by offering ""top-of-the-line graphics"" and ""well-designed and fun and competitive and balanced gameplay"" as well as the ability to fully control in-game assets.  Addressing blockchain tech's potential to disrupt the gaming industry, he said:  ""It's essentially like every single games studio, or every single publisher, is a central bank.""  If blockchain's ability to grant users full ownership over immutable assets is appealing, however, the quality of gameplay enabled by ethereum certainly isn't. In fact, the slow processing times and high costs involved in playing a game based on ethereum smart contracts are constant sources of frustration in the decentralized gaming community.  For example, one of the more popular ethereum games, Etheremon, recently decided to move its gameplay to a soon-to-be-launched blockchain, Zilliqa, while keeping the Pokemon-like assets, called ""mons,"" on the ethereum chain as ERC-721 tokens.  In the case of Gods Unchained, the designers decided to take gameplay off-chain entirely. ""There's pretty much no way you could put anything this complex on-chain,"" said Ferguson.  The team has experience with on-chain gaming. Fuel Game's first title, Etherbots, is played entirely on ethereum, and the company is developing a scaling solution called ""ansible channels"" to help improve user experience in that game.  VC attention  Several crypto investment firms have taken equity stakes in Fuel Games, most notably Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange. Continue Capital and Nirvana Capital led the $2.4 million round, which closed in May. In addition to Coinbase, the fundraise also saw participation from Sora Ventures.  Explaining his fund's rationale for investing in Fuel Games, Continue Capital founding partner Xiahong Lin told CoinDesk, ""Gods Unchained is one of the very first blockchain games that combines high quality game experience with true ownership of game assets.""  He added that the game's use of non-fungible crypto tokens (NFTs) was particularly intriguing.  Ethereum's ERC-721 standard was popularized by CryptoKitties, which attracted funding from big name venture capital investors in March, including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.  The dapp's user base has fallen by nearly 98 percent since its peak late last year, however, potentially calling into question the notion that NFTs were an idea whose time has come.  Gods Unchained might be putting those doubts to bed. Fuel Games has sold over 4,600 ether worth of cards for the game, worth around $1.3 million at the time of writing. But while the Hyperion card's $60,000 price tag is impressive in the context of trading card games, it's a far cry from CryptoKitties' record: one cat traded hands for $111,000 in December.  Down the line, some investors believe that NFTs enable use cases far more valuable and consequential than gaming: real estate, precious metals and other assets could be tokenized, enabling investors to buy smaller, more liquid stakes in these assets.  Then Coinbase Ventures, which has also invested in the non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea, published a blog post predicting that the use cases of NFTs would rapidly expand from cute digital cats to social media, digital identity, news and information platforms, and more.  That's a lot of hype for ERC-721 to live up to, but Ferguson argued that investors find the gaming use case plenty compelling on its own.  Citing Hearthstone's $400 million in 2016 revenues, he said:  ""The benefits of having a hip game are obvious. It just makes a lot of money.""

42429577,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzmHh,1534935602,"After Bitcoin Price Breakout, Pending ETF Decision May Cap Gains","Bitcoin's (BTC) jump to a 15-day high is encouraging, but caution ahead of the US Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) imminent decision on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could limit further price gains.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to $6,899 on Bitfinex earlier today – the highest level since Aug. 7 – and is accompanied by a 10 percent drop in the BTC/USD shorts, adding credence to our assessment that BTC has been mimicking the price action observed in the run-up to a major rally that occurred on April 12.  More importantly, BTC's convincing move above $6,600 marks an upside break of the narrowing price range and signals continuation of the rally from the Aug. 14 low of $5,859.  So, it seems safe to say the doors have been opened for the psychological hurdle of $7,000. However, that may be an uphill task in the short term, as investors are likely to adopt a cautious stance ahead of the SEC's ruling on whether to allow the ETF – due in the next 36 hours.  Further, BTC picked up a bid exactly at 1:00 UTC – the moment when Bitmex, the world's largest exchange for synthetic shorts, shut down for maintenance, forcing many to question the legitimacy of the price rally. As a result, investors may remain on the fence until a more credible evidence of the bullish breakout emerges.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,670 on Bitfinex – up 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis. While prices could skyrocket if the SEC approves ProShares bitcoin ETF, the bitcoin market will likely crater if the SEC rejects the ETF or delays the decision.  4-hour chart        The upside break of the diamond pattern seen in the chart above confirms a bearish-to-bullish trend change, that is, the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 has ended and the bulls have regained control.  The relative strength index (RSI) is holding above 50.00 in favor of the bulls. Meanwhile, the 50-candle moving average (MA) is beginning to rise in a bull-friendly manner and could soon cut the 100-candle MA from below (bull cross).  Daily chart  BTC's rise to $6,899 validates the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and the upward sloping RSI.  Although it appears the charts are aligned in favor of the bulls, BTC has already retraced close to 50 percent of the gains seen today, possibly validating the skepticism around today's rally.  What's more, the retreat to $6,670 also marks a failure to hold on to gains above the key resistance at $6,870 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $8,507 to $5,859).  View  BTC's bullish breakout has proved to be lacking in staying power. That said, acceptance above $6,870 (Fibonacci hurdle) could boost the odds of a rally to $7,000.  On the downside, a move below $6,230 (Aug. 20 low) would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000 (February low).  The SEC's decision on the bitcoin ETF could send prices either way, but until then the market will likely trade on a cautious note.

The organization wrote in a news release that its Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) is now hosting the explorer on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) through services provided by Bitaccess, a blockchain startup.  Using IPFS, it said, ensures web applications are both ""unalterable and can be accessed far into the future,"" regardless of whether the original host is online or not.  The explorer allows users to search the ethereum blockchain for proactively published grants and contribution data, according to Bitaccess.  The NRC continued:  ""These are early days, but NRC IRAP's experiments with blockchain are expected to provide constructive insight into the potential for this technology and how it may be used for more open and transparent operations for public programs.""  According to the post, NRC IRAP launched the Canadian government's first live trial of public blockchain technology on ethereum back in January, in an effort to build a more transparent administration of government contracts.  Since the launch, the program is reported to have been exploring additional applications in blockchain technology.  As CoinDesk reported previously, IPFS aims to build a more permanent web by storing multiple copies of data. It initially caught international attention as may were worrying at the time that the new administration in the U.S. would make data from the government agencies disappear.

The Thai central bank said in a release on Tuesday that it has partnered with eight financial institutions in the country in a bid to create a CBDC based on Corda, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform developed by the enterprise-focused consortium startup R3.  The ultimate goal of the effort is to use the digital currency to facilitate interbank transactions and to ""enhance efficiency of the Thai financial market infrastructure,"" according to the announcement.  To assist with the so-called Project Inthanon, the BoT has signed up R3 as technological partner and eight other participating institutions, including Bangkok Bank Public, Krung Thai, Siam Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank (Thailand) and HSBC.  ""Project Inthanon Phase 1 is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019 after which the BoT will publish a project summary accordingly,"" the bank said in the announcement.  It continued:  ""Building upon the findings and outcomes from Phase 1, the project participants aim to further develop the capabilities of the prototype for broader functions including third party funds transfer and cross-border funds transfer.""  The central bank's governor first revealed the initial concept for the project in a speech in June, commenting at the time that the aim is to explore the potential of blockchain in facilitating cross-bank transactions before it can be formally launched at a larger scale.  With the launch of Project Inthanon, the BoT joins a growing group of central banking authorities to have started trialing DLT systems to facilitate interbank and cross-border transactions, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Canada.

42401809,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2X88,1534924815,The Trick to Selling Blockchain Solutions? Don't Say 'Blockchain',"When Adrian Patten, co-founder of FX blockchain project Cobalt, pitches to banks these days, he chooses his words carefully.  In a move that may do much to validate Gartner's finding this week that blockchain hype cycle is entering the so-called ""trough of disillusionment,"" Patten admitted he rarely brings up the technology, choosing instead to focus on the cost savings Cobalt can bring without the benefit of some of the most popular buzzwords of the last few years.  ""We try not to mention blockchain or DLT too much in case it complicates matters,"" he said.  In Patten's view, many financial firms have taken a ""me too"" approach with blockchain, exemplified by things like the herd of banks joining the R3 consortium. In addition, most are probably invested in too many proofs-of-concept, he said.  ""They tend to think, if everybody else is in it, they ought to be in it, just in case a board member asks them what they are doing in blockchain,"" he continued.  The result is that people have rushed into DLT looking to use the technology rather than considering its process requirements, message requirements and whether it actually works, added Patten. But Cobalt, which created custom distributed ledger tech for its particular post-trade use case, is not alone.  There are other companies out there with live systems that are actually doing stuff, such as Baton Systems, also in the FX space with DLT, but who are using it less publicly, or at least not letting the technology dominate their messaging.  Seeing successful firms without blockchain front and center could be viewed as refreshing, or perhaps a source of misgiving. Forrester Research projects there will be a pruning, with 90 percent of blockchain projects with a flabby business focus ultimately shutting down in the coming years.  As such, Martha Bennett, principal analyst at Forrester, went so far as to say that those who persevere will likely come to understand that succeeding ""isn't really about technology, but about business.""  After the gold rush  Ready to embrace the disillusionment, some firms don't mind even admitting they used the term ""blockchain"" when in fact they were using some of its key elements, without the hype mantle, for quite some time.  Back before the bitcoin white paper was released, Guardtime was developing its Keyless Signatures Infrastructure (KSI) which uses concepts like linked time-stamping (integral to bitcoin) to eliminate the need for trusted third parties or cryptographic keys to verify data.  As the blockchain gold rush gathered pace around him, Guardtime CEO Mike Gault said he got caught up with the perceived benefits of aligning his company with the blockchain movement.  ""We called ourselves a blockchain company unashamedly. We were sitting in conferences listening to all this blockchain mania starting to happen and we looked at each other and said, 'Wait a minute, isn't this what we do?'""  Guardtime, which boasts a broad range of users from shipping giant Maersk to the U.K.'s NHS (National Health Service), is very different from ethereum, noted Gault, but the end result is the same: a single source of truth and immutability.  Gault also derided ""crypto zealots who think everything has to be decentralized,"" a view which he says is ""totally irrelevant for enterprise."" ""We will have no problem doing a quick marketing switch when 'blockchain' becomes a negative, in order to return focus to our own category of KSI technology,"" Gault continued.  ""There will be a turning point, especially in enterprise where there are zero production use cases. People are going to see the emperor has no clothes,"" he said.  Cobalt's Patten also thinks the space is being driven in a wrong-headed fashion by ""evangelists and fundamentalists.""  ""The idea that every message and every part of a life cycle is going to be encrypted and decrypted when it already exists in hundreds of databases in clear text format is somewhat naive,"" he said.  Taking a hard-headed business approach, he called Cobalt a product rather than a project and said, ""Unless we are cutting costs by 80 percent, people are not going to move away from incumbents. We have to be much cheaper and better.""  A bank's perspective  So how does the idea of side-stepping the blockchain evangelists resonate with a bank's blockchain department? Turns out, the sentiment appears to be trending.  ""That is exactly what we would like to see,"" said Ville Sointu, head of emerging technologies at Nordea Bank. ""It should be business first. We have now moved to a phase where indeed we should see more companies coming up with a clear business case and having the fact that it's a blockchain or a DLT network in the background.""  Sointu is perhaps not a typical blockchain evangelist, however.  After being brought in at Nordea midway through last year, he gathered the blockchain team under one roof and shut down almost all the prototyping. Nordea has narrowed its efforts down to We.Trade, plus a real estate pilot with the Finnish government, and a corporate identity blockchain, which has now passed the proof-of-concept stage.  ""I don't think we need another proof-of-concept for something like KYC,"" said Sointu. ""We don't need another international payments PoC; we don't need another FX PoC. These things have been proven.""  Asked if he has started to see a trend where fintech vendors mention the business case first and blockchain second, Sointu said, ""Maybe this is a call to action. But right now we don't see too many of those.""  ""Ninety-nine percent of the companies that come to talk to us say, 'We have the world's most scalable blockchain network and here are 100 use cases that we can use the technology for,'"" he said, concluding:  ""Those are not helpful at all for us.""

Three months after Coinbase introduced its suite of institutional products in May, the startup has unveiled a series of ""fundamental beliefs"" about how the company will operate and develop its institutional investor-focused business lines.  According to an August 20 blog post written by Adam White, Coinbase's vice president and general manager, the leading cryptocurrency exchange has set up five core principles.  These include the operation of ""fair and orderly"" markets, enforcing transparent market rules, offering ""fair access to all market participants,"" disclosing listing practices and market rules publicly, and safeguarding clients ""with institutional-grade infrastructure and processes.""  As White explained:  ""This set of fundamental beliefs will act as our North Star as we design, develop, and operate our products. Ultimately, we intend for these core principles to drive us toward our goal of operating the most trusted venue for storing, trading, and interacting with the world of cryptocurrency.""  Furthermore, White said that along with the institutional products, this set of core rules aims to move closer to ""an open financial system.""  As CoinDesk reported on May 15, Coinbase launched Coinbase Custody, a product specifically designed for institutional investors who are interested in cryptocurrency adoption. Coinbase began accepting deposits for the service early last month.

42401817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2XE2,1534910426,When Capitulation? 3 Ways Bitcoin's Bear Market Might End,"It's an understatement to say the current price of the world's largest cryptocurrency pales when compared to its past glories – at $6,700, bitcoin is down roughly 60 percent from its all-time high.  That said, market conditions aren't the same as they have been in years past. Indeed, bitcoin's 2017 boom has brought new attention, and with it, traders and investors who are left wondering if the asset can ever return to its former glory.  Certainly, there's no shortage of ways to approach the question, but one effective method is to look at the charts for historical patterns that could speak to investor psychology, and perhaps, yield valuable hints and clues about future performance.  Applying these theories, a market might be expected to ""bottom,"" or reach a new low, after a speculative bubble bursts in a moment often referred to as ""capitulation."" Consisting of extreme selling over a short time period, the infamous 2014 bitcoin bear market finally bottomed out after it lost more than 40 percent of its value in less than three days at the top of 2015.  Since such an event could be measured and understood in real-time, some eagle-eyed investors picked up on the move, even drawing attention to it on social media.  That's because, to chart addicts known as technical analysts, all known information about a particular asset is reflected in its price action. So, in order to predict bitcoin's future, taking a look at its price history is perhaps the best place to start.  It's an inexact science, and there's no guarantee history will ever repeat. That said, observing the bitcoin's past price action yields three possibilities worth of being discussed and considered.  1) We've seen the worst  While technical analysts only take price action into account, it's impossible to ignore the implications a bitcoin ETF could have on prices of the cryptocurrency.  As an indication of the effect an ETF can have on prices of an asset, gold prices increased drastically in the years following the introduction of an ETF. Using this as a measure, it's valid to assume bitcoin would succumb to a similar and explosive fate.  With several ETF proposals awaiting a decision, most importantly the VanEck-SolidX ETF on September 30, a trader must account for any possible outcome. The market is already overwhelmingly bearish, so the true devil's advocate would play contrarian and account for the ETF's trend-changing approval.  As shown in the above chart, ascending trend lines of support have played an important role throughout the history of bitcoin prices.  The first trendline took effect in 2012 when it provided reliable support for a strong uptrend from $2-$16. After surpassing $16, price action went completely parabolic, straying away from trendline until making a return at the end of 2014.  This time however, price broke through the support and immediate capitulation took place, selling off more than 40 percent of bitcoin's price in three days.  Since the infamous capitulation and 2015 market bottom, price found a new ascending support (lower white line) that will look to once again come into play sooner than later.  The devil's advocate claims ""we've seen the worst"" of the 2018 bear market, so he is expecting a bounce on or before the fast approaching trendline. The argument has merit, as several bitcoin ETF proposals will be decided upon in the next few weeks and an approval could be just enough to salvage the trend, avoiding large-scale capitulation entirely.  2) $3K to $5K in play  If there's no bitcoin ETF approval, one could argue there's no reason for bitcoin to resume its bullish uptrend until a market bottom occurs like it did in 2014-2015.  Here lies the second bear market ending scenario.  Looking at how dramatically price reacted to a breach of its first long-term ascending support in the chart, it's reasonable to assume it would have a similar reaction if the current trendline breaks (middle white line). If this does occur, there are two locations that present optimal bottoms following substantial capitulation.  The first ""bottom zone"" lies in the $5,000 area since it was the peak resistance level of the prior bull move, from $3,000 to $5,000.  Support and resistance lines experience an effect known as ""polarity"" when they are surpassed. When this occurs, resistance converts into support and vice versa because the party holding up or down prices has finally given up, which shifts control to the opposing party.  It's important to note the $5,000 area has yet to be truly tested as support since it was initially breached as resistance. This suggests a test of the level as support is likely and elects it as a potential candidate for the market bottom.  However, capitulation from current levels would not be overly severe for the $5,000 level to hold, perhaps leaving some to believe the market needs more extreme sell-offs in order to find a true bottom. That is where the next potential ""bottom zone"" of ~$3,000 could come into play.  Technically speaking, the $3,000 level is much stronger support than $5,000. Similar to the above zone, $3,000 marked the peak resistance of a prior bull move, except after this resistance broke, the same level was sufficiently tested and proved as support.  What's more, the $3,000 bottom zone would represent an 85 percent deprecation from bitcoin's all-time high, a near identical peak-to-bottom percent difference as the 2014 bear market of 86.65 percent, according to figures from the Bitstamp exchange.  1) $1K doomsday  Perhaps here lies another devil's advocate, the ultra-bearish contrarian.  Upon a close examination of the price level (~$240) where the first ascending support trend line was breached in Jan. 2015, it coincidentally also marks the exact peak of the prior ""mega"" bull run when price surged nearly 1,000 percent from $16 to $240.  In a sense, breaking both the trend line and prior bull run high was a ""double whammy"" to investors giving them no other choice than to lose complete hope, the necessary precursor to capitulation.  According to this theory, if the current ascending trend line breaks, price may not find its ""bottom"" until reaching the high of the prior ""mega"" bull run, which in this case lies in the $1,200 area.  If prices were to fall to this level, it's last hope would be to eventually find a new ascending support for the entire ""bull cycle"" to repeat, an estimated outcome depicted by the dashed white line in the chart.

At 01:00 UTC, just after Tuesday's close, the cryptocurrency leapt $428 over the course of 20 minutes to cross the threshold for the first time since July 24, according to CoinDesk price data.  Bitcoin was last seen trading at $6,750, marking roughly a 6.6 percent increase since the day's open.  At press time, bitcoin is gaining momentum, having stalled briefly at around $6,750 before crossing $6,800. Indeed, the spike in price could be attributed to investor sentiment in lieu of the fresh bitcoin ETF proposals, set to be decided upon on later this week.  The decision could be a defining moment for cryptocurrency in 2018, whereby a denial sends the price lower, while an approval brings additional liquidity from institutional investors.  Either way, the total market rose by a total of $11 billion in one hour as a large injection of capital entered the market seeking bitcoin amidst the move.
