With the news, the San Francisco-based startup gains more than 600 customer accounts and the services of co-founders Neil Woodfine and Richard Bensberg, who will join the Wyre team as part of the deal.  Further, Wyre now plans to hire five new employees in a new Beijing headquarters, while its engineering team will remain in San Francisco.  According to CEO Michael Dunworth, it was Remitsy's close proximity to China's market that was the chief factor prompting the move. (Remitsy uses a combination of blockchain technology and banking relationships to convert user currencies for China-based users).  Dunworth told CoinDesk:  ""Remitsy brings the expertise of industry veterans, who have built and scaled a beautiful product with a very impressive customer base.""  Wyre uses bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and other digital currencies to settle transactions between parties in different countries, serving both money service businesses and small enterprises.  The startup officially rebranded in December 2016 following a $5.8m Series A funding round.

42379391,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fX9,1491334011,Polish Startups Back Blockchain Best Practices Proposal,"Poland's digital currency industry has adopted a new proposal designed to allow the local blockchain industry to self-regulate.  Adopted on 29th March, the best practices cover areas related to the activities of cryptocurrency companies including their recommended legal form, transparency, legality of operations, relations with public authorities, customer relations, technology and security, as well as their stance toward customers and business partners.  The adoption further follows their preparation earlier this year by industry representatives including professor Krzysztof Piech, a faculty member at Warsaw's Lazarski University; Konrad Zacharzewski, PhD, a lecturer at Nicolaus Copernicus University; and Lech Wilczynski, the CEO of bitcoin payments platform InPay.  Additional contributors to the document include representatives from Bitstar.pl, dLK Korus Okoń, Bitelon, Fintech Poland and BitMarket. Public institutions that were represented at the 29th March meeting included the Financial Supervision Authority, the Ministry of Finance and the country's competition watchdog UOKiK.  Exchange shadow  Industry representatives say they hope that the best practices will also increase risk awareness in the Polish cryptocurrency market following the news local law enforcement are investigating the shutdown of local exchange Bitcurex.  Overall, the document also proposes a number of trust-building solutions, calling on industry players to inform the agency about ""planned interruptions"" and recommending that maintenance extend for no more than 48 hours.  Further, all such interruptions are to be communicated to customers and business partners by e-mail and on company websites, according to the document.  ""The idea behind the code is to try to reduce the risk of such a collapse by identifying the best practices for the existing, and, above all, new exchanges that might not be aware of certain risks,” Wilczynski told CoinDesk.  He added that the proposal provides additional information for how customers should be able to evaluate a given platform regarding its level of financial and technical security.

The market cap of the digital currency, launched in 2016 to utilize zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKS to help ensure the privacy of users, climbed to as much as $64.7m today to reach the number nine spot on the list, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  A major factor helping to push zcash's total market value is the rising supply of the protocol's ZEC tokens, with the supply recently passing 1m ZEC at the time of the report.  While the price of ZEC tokens surged to almost $6,000 shortly after going live, the digital currency's market cap rose to only $1.9m at the time because so few ZEC tokens were traded.  Adding interest to the move is that even though many alternative asset protocols have been experiencing sharp volatility over the last several weeks, zcash prices have been reasonably stable, trading between $60 and $80 since mid-March.

The update is the latest in a case that stems back to 2015, when the SEC alleges that Garza and GAW operated a Ponzi scheme in which investors were sold fraudulent ""cloud mining contracts"" with the promise of receiving profit distributions.  Thus far, Garza has refused to answer questions regarding the allegations, preferring to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to non-incrimination. The court has given Garza and his counsel Marjorie Peerce until 7th May to file any motions regarding the direction of the case.  Likewise, the SEC has until 7th August to gather evidence supporting the claims filed against Garza and his companies.  The SEC is now seeking a cease to all cryptocurrency related activities by Garza and his companies, as well as to disgorge profits from the scheme. Both the SEC and Garza will each provide up to 10 depositions for the case, including expert witness testimony regarding the actions of GAW Miners and ZenMiner.  At this point, there is still the possibility that Garza and his attorneys could decide to settle with the SEC outside of US District Court.  Notably, Garza is also a defendant in a separate civil lawsuit brought upon by disgruntled investors but he was recently dismissed, according to documents filed in District Court.  That suit claims Garza and co-defendant, Cantor Fitzgerald investment banker Stuart Fraser bilked investors out of nearly $10m through the cloud mining contract scheme.  A judge has denied a motion by Fraser to dismiss the suit.

42379405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fmF,1491309025,The Gold Rush Begins: The Day Bitcoin Topped the US Dollar,"One of bitcoin's earliest angel investors, Roger Ver has backed a number of startups including BitPay, Purse and ShapeShift, and is the owner of resource portal Bitcoin.com. Ver is noted as both an outspoken evangelist for the technology and one of the first 'bitcoin millionaires'.  In the first entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Ver discusses his initial brush with the technology and recounts the watershed moment when a single bitcoin became more valuable than the US dollar.  I first heard the word 'bitcoin' in November or December 2010 thanks to a mention of it on the FreeTalkLive.com podcast.  It sounded interesting enough. I maybe spent a few moments Googling it. At the time one bitcoin was worth about $0.10. I thought to myself, ""This is interesting, but if no one is using it, it isn't worth anything.""  I moved on with my life after only about five minutes of research...    ***    In February 2011, I heard bitcoin mentioned again, so I decided to Google it once again. The price was now around $0.40, and this time I started to see the bigger picture.  I began to understand that:  The supply of bitcoin is limited  They could be sent anywhere in the world for free (no longer true)  They could be sent anywhere nearly instantly (no longer true)  They could be used almost anonymously (less true than we thought)  It was impossible for governments to stop.  That's when the dots (helped by years of studying Marx and Mises) connected in my mind.  I realized that people were going to start using bitcoin as money and that I needed to buy some, but that was easier said than done in those days.  There was no Coinbase, Xapo or Blockchain. In fact, the only wallet was the Bitcoin-QT full client that still had the option of CPU mining in it. The only option for buying bitcoin was a website with a strange domain called Mt. Gox.  I contacted the website and received a personalized response rather quickly from the site's owner, Jed McCaleb (he hadn't yet sold the business to Mark Karpeles). After an email exchange or two, I decided to send $25,000 to what I recall was a personal bank account in New York.  I waited for him to credit my account at Mt. Gox... and the price of bitcoin rose... and then it rose some more...    ***    Several days went by, but Gox still hadn't credited my wire transfer.  I began to grow impatient... The price was rising ever closer to $1.  As the price rose, so did my frustration at not having had my wire credited... but I wasn't deterred. My excitement for the future potential of bitcoin was rising as well – and I was openly telling friends about bitcoin.  One of them was less than convinced.  When I explained bitcoin to him, and how I had just initiated a purchase of $25,000 worth because they were so amazing, he sarcastically replied, ""If you think bitcoins are so great, why don't you buy more of them?""  As soon as he said that to me, I knew he was right, and that I should buy more of them! That very same day I initiated a second wire to Mt Gox.  Somewhere in between, bitcoin passed $1...    ***    As anyone who has owned bitcoin before knows, the moment you have some yourself, you feel much more connected with the cause and the people in the ecosystem.  I couldn't help but tell anyone who would listen to me about all the wonderful ways in which bitcoin was about to change the world for the better.  I would literally tell anyone who would listen.  From strangers in a restaurant, to cashiers at convenience stores, to everyone at family gatherings or weddings, whether they wanted to hear about bitcoin or not. (Many of them did not!)  I paid for the world's first bitcoin billboard and national radio ads. I set up the first major store to accept bitcoin as payment. I was involved with many other projects. The more bitcoin companies I invested in and the more bitcoins I bought, the more fun the whole experience became.  I knew that we were all working on a fundamentally world-changing technology, but the rest of the world still had no idea.  But, the real turning point for me though was owning my first bitcoin, and watching the price cross the $1 barrier for the first time.  I still remember the naysayers claiming that a bitcoin could never be worth a whole dollar each. They claimed that bitcoin was just a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, or no different than digital Beanie Babies.  They were all wrong, and I gladly told them so.  Today, many people still dismiss bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be the winning cryptocurrency in the end. But its invention is guaranteed to have changed the world forever.

42379388,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fUd,1491305404,Why the US Department of Health Just Couldn't Ignore Blockchain,"A spat of bitcoin ransomware threats last year kept many US government agencies from holding public positions on blockchain.  That's according to Debbie Bucci, a lead IT architect employed by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Bucci is now helping lead one of the few agency pushes into the technology with plans to forge new partnerships with firms in the private space.  Previously, fallout over concerns about a February ransonware attack, in which a US hospital had paid $17,000 worth of bitcoin to regain access to its computers, had sealed the lips of the many government employees afraid of being negatively associated with bitcoin and pretty much anything built on a blockchain.  However, Bucci, who works at the Office of Standards and Interoperability, said she and her peers at the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health IT had been exploring blockchain and felt they shouldn't abandon their plans.  In conversation with CoinDesk earlier this month, the 15-year government veteran explained how she and a small group of like-minded colleagues were able to push through the fears holding back other agencies.  She told CoinDesk:  ""We really couldn't keep our heads in the sand, because we really knew what was coming on.""  Plethora of papers  To help safely navigate her agency past the concerns surrounding what ended up being a watershed year for bitcoin ransom demands, Bucci built her blockchain strategy around a little-known piece of legislation often called the 'America Competes Act'.  Formally called the Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education and Science Act, the bill is designed to make it easier for government agencies to partner with the private sector.  Just a few months after the bitcoin ransomware attack came to the attention of the general public, Bucci and her director had helped orchestrate what ended up being the first government request for white papers related to the industry.  The call, in July, 2016, was expected to result in 10–15 white papers, Bucci said, but instead they received 77 original submissions. And, instead of 15 submissions, the agency announced 15 winners of its own blockchain contest in August 2016.  Companies that participated include 'Big Four' accounting firm Deloitte, consulting giant Accenture and health company The Mayo Clinic.  However, the agency's most-important takeaway from the flood of papers was that there was still so much more to learn, according to Bucci. As a result, she and her colleagues set about planning what they believe was the first government-sponsored hackathon to explore blockchain.  Held in partnership with the Chamber of Digital Commerce and others at the DC Blockchain Summit, the ONC's Blockchain in Healthcare coding event attracted 68 developers broken into 10 teams, three of which competed remotely from across the US.  Announced in front of about 500 summit attendees representing a diverse set of industry leaders, the eventual winner was a group called Health Passport – a decentralized personal health record platform for sharing information with any provider or consortium in the world.  Distributed road map  Going forward, Bucci expects even more exploration of blockchain by the Department of Health, and new partnerships encouraged by the America Competes Act. That's assuming, of course, that it survives the Trump administration.  President Trump has taken an aggressive stance against more than 60 government agencies, with the HHS Health IT Office recently cited in reports as another possible target.  Looking forward, Bucci spoke of a roadmap for national interoperability, published in October, 2015, by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), which helps oversee standards for certifying health records.  Key to the plan, which is currently set to achieve national interoperability by 2024 at the latest, is a series of efforts that push for what the ONC called a ""well-functioning dynamic and distributed architecture"".  Although details about what exactly is that distributed architecture might entail are sparse, Bucci believes that blockchain could help meet some of the office's mandates.  She concluded:  ""There’s a realization that, perhaps, to look ahead, technologies might be able to assist with some of the existing gaps that we have.""

42379394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fav,1491298203,No Incentive? Algorand Blockchain Sparks Debate at Cryptography Event,"""Can you say anything about incentives in Algorand?""  That question was directed to Silvio Micali, an MIT professor who had just delivered a keynote on his theoretical proof-of-stake (PoS) system at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference in Malta, yesterday. And the Turing-award winner's answer set a few back on their heels.  ""Incentives are the hardest thing to do,"" Micali said.  In 30 years as a cryptographer, he had spent the last 10 working on just that issue.  As he explained, when you put incentives out there, people learn how to use those incentives for making money in ways that are nearly impossible to predict. He pointed to bitcoin as a prime example, saying its creator probably never imagined bitcoin's incentive structure would lead to industrial-scale mining pools.  Micali also argued those using a system do not necessarily need to be rewarded for trivial computations. And that, while bitcoin miners are compensated for their work, validators, who in contrast do not have to invest in expensive equipment and electricity, are not rewarded.  He said:  ""We must use incentives as a last resort. I believe I can [make Algorand work without incentives], but I have no formal proof that I can, because these formal proofs are much harder than the proofs of Algorand.""  Intended as a public blockchain, Algorand contains a novel version of Byzantine agreement with nine steps, where players are replaced in each round of communication. The protocol tolerates one-third bad actors, and Micali said he assumes the majority of the system's users are honest.  Against the grain  Yet, the idea of a consensus algorithm that offers no incentives runs counter to the thinking of many, including those working on the decentralized application network ethereum, a blockchain project working on a PoS system of its own called Casper.  ""We basically explicitly put incentives front and center,"" said Vitalik Buterin, founder of ethereum. He described ethereum's approach as fundamentally about how much money stakeholders can lose, as opposed to the approach taken with Algorand.  ""One thing I would be concerned about, is if you have no incentives at all, then that means you have no incentive not to just be lazy and go offline,"" Buterin told CoinDesk.  Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir, who is heavily invested in building Casper, had stronger words. He stated he simply did not think such a system would work.  ""My whole perspective on the space is, like, polar opposite. I don't believe the 'majority of people are honest' assumption,"" he said, adding:  ""There is a small number of people who control most of the coins in most [PoS] systems. It is not that hard for people to coordinate to undermine protocol guarantees.”  Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer, also questioned the idea Micali put forth.  Sirer pointed out that, while it's true bitcoin's participants are not always fully incentivized, a lot of people run full nodes altruistically.  ""But to go from that and to say, since bitcoin works and it is not fully incentivized, ergo, any system will work – that is not incentivized. There is a gap there,"" he said.  Launch and learn?  But some had an altogether different take on the matter.  Charles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain technology firm IOHK, pointed to BitTorrent as an example of a system that works just fine while not being incentivized at all. No token exists and you aren't paid anything to share files on the network.  Another example he points to is folding@home, where thousands of people freely donate idle processing power for disease research.  ""It is an open question of whether you need incentives or not, and I don’t think it can be determined in an academic model. It is actually going to be determined by evidence. You launch something and you see what happens,"" he said.  The comments nonetheless suggest that Algorand's eventual launch could be one to watch, especially for those who question whether the platform's incentive plan will work or not.

42379398,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fhD,1491273127,Purse Proposal Touts Extension Blocks as Bitcoin Scaling Solution,"Bitcoin startup Purse is spearheading work on a new solution it believes could break the network's long-simmering scaling gridlock.  In a new blog post issued today, Purse has released a specification that includes demo functionality and code for upgrading its bitcoin software implementation, Bcoin, to support ""extension blocks"". The technical update seeks to enable the network to optionally support different kinds of blocks in addition to the default 1 MB blocks that today make up the main bitcoin blockchain (and that have long been a source of community tension).  The move to develop the technology finds Purse pitching its implementation – one that is today an alternative to versions by Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited – as a third option in the scaling debate that would bring about a block size increase and malleability fix via soft fork, or a change that doesn't risk splitting the bitcoin blockchain.  Founded in 2014 as a startup that enables bitcoin users to get discounts when shopping at Amazon, Purse has been increasingly interested in network development, launching Bcoin in September of last year.  Developer Joseph Poon and BitPay CEO Stephen Pair contributed to the release.  So far, the idea is said to have support from bitcoin's mining community, though miners did not have any preferred access to the code, a source said.  Industry firms also appear to be anticipating the release, with BitPay reporting it is eager to test the idea as an alternative to a contentious hard fork. In remarks, CEO Stephen Pair said the bitcoin payments processing startup was afraid of needing to shut down in the face of such an event, and that it is open to all alternative ideas.  Pair noted that he recently broached the topic in a blog post, which he credited as helping to spark new development on the idea.  Pair said:  ""With 'Extension Blocks', you can implement something and maybe only a small portion of the network even cares about it, but it can be enforced by the miners and included in blocks. It can work or not work and it won’t impact the rest of the network.""  As shown by the comments, the idea comes at a time when interest among network users in exploratory ways to reach consensus on changes to the network rules remains high.  As such, Purse CEO Andrew Lee framed the solution as one that seeks to jumpstart momentum for bitcoin through effective compromise, writing:  ""We are proposing the best of both worlds through a safe, non-contentious upgrade.""  Path ahead  As for how the idea would progress, those close to the project expressed that they want the announcement to be viewed as the start of a conversation on the idea.  So far, it seems there is enthusiasm among some network stakeholders, with mining pool F2Pool even citing the software last week, embedding a message in the bitcoin blockchain that referenced the proposal.  Mining firm ViaBTC, an outspoken supporter of the Bitcoin Unlimited software, also tweeted its approval for the concept, and Bitmain is said to be supportive as well.  An effort was also made to heavily publicize the effort with major media outlets as a potentially ""momentous"" development for the network.  As detailed in the post, the idea is to now garner miner support for the technical fix.  ""Once a supermajority of miners have flagged for this change, users can begin using these features enabling entirely new use cases for bitcoin,"" the post reads.  Purse went on to state that it would like for the resulting conversation to involve ""users, miners and industry"", remarking that any eventual upgrade is still months away.  Past precedent  If introduced, this would not be the first time work on a proposal for extension blocks would see public discussion.  Commentary on the proposal surfaced on the bitcoin development mailing list as far back as 2015, when Blockstream CEO Adam Back discussed how the network might adopt extension blocks.  ""The interesting thing is this makes block sizes changes opt-in and gives users choice. Choice is good,"" Back wrote.  A more extended history of discussion on the concept can be found in the mailing list archives as well.  As recently as this January, the subject was advanced again, though some developers offered concerns about the change.  Bitcoin Core developers indicated that they are aware of the proposal, responding with concerns about the complexity of the code, as well as the precedent that could occur should the proposal be aggressively adopted by one constituency of the network or without sufficient review.  Worries were also raised about how this would affect access to the network, and whether technicality increases brought about by more custom blocks would only be accessible to a minority stakeholders and users.
