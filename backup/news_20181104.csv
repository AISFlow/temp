42429924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BJh,1541340028,Builders on Wall Street: Bitcoin Devs Host Lightning Hack Day,"It was described as ""not a normal conference.""  Sure, speakers took to the podium to present their futuristic ideas – a staple at the cryptocurrency space's many, many conferences. But the Lightning Hackday, which took place in the heart of Wall Street on October 27th and 28th, was all-in-all more of a community-led endeavor with a heavy coding twist.  Throughout the two-day event, a hackathon whirred in the background. Tiny computers called Raspberry Pis dotted the tables and developers murmured amongst themselves about how to tweak the rules of the system while also not disrupting the incentive schemes.  This eclectic setup is maybe to be expected from a group of hackers building what they hope is the future of money.  Bitcoin's lightning network is still in its early stages, but many hope it will fix bitcoin's biggest underlying problems – that it's simply too slow and clunky, and so doesn't scale well for a future of mass adoption – at least, that is, without the help of a second layer.  ""For those of you who don't know, blockchains suck,"" Chris Stewart, an engineer at blockchain data provider SuredBits, said when kicking off his talk.  That said, he and other developers hope the lightning network will change that.  Passions were so high, in fact, that it was hard to keep track of all the different projects on the floor. But one thing tied them all together – the interest in building for the technology's potential as a payment mechanism for everyday purchases.  Indeed, Lightning Labs engineer Alex Bosworth admitted that lightning's ""killer app"" – what takes it mainstream – might be as simple as that.  ""I don't know what the killer app is, maybe buying a cupcake is,"" Bosworth told attendees during his talk.  Ideas, man  Bosworth, though suspects that the best ideas for using lightning haven't even been created yet.  For comparison, he argued that the early developers behind Linux, the popular open-source operating system, could never have guessed how far the code would go.  ""Were they thinking 'Oh this will be deployed in a billion phones?"" he said, implying that they probably didn't – and couldn't – have that kind of foresight when it was first deployed.  As such, Bosworth told the developers to not keep their big ideas a secret. And he took his own advice, sharing his many ideas for how lightning could be used in unique ways. For instance, he believes lightning could be used as a ""monetized data layer,"" with some retouching of the underlying software.  Right now, lightning works by passing around ""little proofs"" that are essentially ""meaningless, random data,"" Bosworth said. ""But we could turn it into meaningful data,"" added.  One idea: use lightning for passing around little pieces of a file, so that when they're brought together they recreate the full file.  Bosworth also argued that lightning could be used to pay for enhanced payment privacy and to fuel a wave of ""self-organizing"" games, although, as Bosworth rattled off idea after idea, it was hard to keep up with just how these features would work in practice.  Still, he was only one developer sharing ideas at the event.  Hailing from Japan, Nayuta CEO Kenichi Kurimoto presented a lightning implementation that's optimized for the ""internet of things,"" or the vast array of devices – from cars to TVs – that have enhanced capabilities thanks to being connected to the internet.  He sees great potential in this use case, arguing these connected machines might one day send payments between each other. And with that, he envisions that a ""money owned by nobody"" (i.e. bitcoin) will play a key role, since payments can be so cheap and various devices can execute them without the need for a third party.  Back to the basics  But with all of the futuristic, look-past-the-horizon ideas aside, another key focus of the Lightning Hackday was simply making lightning easier to use.  ""There's a lot going on, but there's also not,"" bitcoin enthusiast Toby Algya said, laughing about how difficult lightning is to set up. ""I'm just trying to get lightning working. That's my personal challenge for the day.""  In this regard, developers are still thinking about the bottom layer, which might someday help with these kinds of problems. For example, a tool called ""lightning autopilot"" could make things easier by automating the step where users have to set up a ""channel"" to use the network.  For one, Rene Pickhardt, a lightning developer and data science consultant, is working in this area and argues that these kinds of design questions are important to answer early.  ""Why is it important to think about it early? If we grow lightning for a couple of years, we might find out topology is not that great,"" he contended.  While Pickhardt offered some ideas at the Lightning Hackday, he noted that no solution is perfect since there's a ""tradeoff between privacy and the quality of recommendations.""  On a related note, a few key lightning developers are meeting in Australia next week to discuss the future of the project's specifications. Pickhardt noted that the future of autopilot, including his implementation, is something high on their list to discuss.  Bosworth echoed that sentiment, saying that these kinds of technical tweaks are so vital that he's going to hit pause on his big ideas – for now, at least – to focus on them. Case in point: he recently joined Lightning Labs on a full-time basis in order to work on the nuts-and-bolts aspect of the software.  ""There are so many cool things that can be built on lightning, it's important for the underlying protocol to work well,"" he said, concluding:  ""My priority is to get it there.""

42429937,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2Bfh,1541337041,Why Blockchains Struggle to Gain Traction in Enterprises,"Paul Brody is EY's global innovation leader for blockchain. The views expressed are his own.      The Y2K program (does anyone remember that?) came about because software developers assumed, in the early days of computing, that newer, better enterprise systems would come along very soon and that their efficient two-digit date systems would be replaced long before the year 2000 came along.  There were very few CIOs in those days, and many of them would have carefully explained to those efficient software developers that if something isn't broken, don't fix it, which often followed the corporate view on IT issues.  You may think of CIOs as technology enthusiasts, and they are, but these days, IT systems are almost always mission-critical. Changing them out means accepting significant operational risk. While you can't make a car with an electronic data interchange message, if those messages don't go out or come in, there will be no raw materials for the manufacturing line to bolt together.  As a result, risk management in large enterprises means that we can't drop in blockchain technology wherever we see a good application. Processes that work at scale, even ones that don't work particularly well, are still less risky than adopting new ones, especially if you need to bring a bunch of business partners along with you for the ride.  When it comes to deploying blockchains in the enterprise, this means that some things that seem like obvious applications aren't necessarily going to get traction.  The most typical blockchain solution that doesn't gain traction even though, on the surface, it seems like a great idea, is supplier collaboration. Blockchains are ideal for complex, multi-party solutions.  Tokenization  , in particular, is a powerful tool for managing supply chains because it means that each piece of inventory is subject to double-spend controls and reconciliation when it is tokenized.  You may think that such things already happen today. They don't.  Enterprise double-spends  While I cannot put money in your bank account without moving it from another one, it turns out that most enterprise IT systems will let me create inventory just about anywhere — and without reconciliation.  Unloading raw materials off a truck? You can ""receive"" goods easily and because the trucking system and the enterprise are usually not linked, there's no single system that demands you off-load raw materials from a truck if you want to put them in a warehouse.  By using tokenization and a blockchain to link up the supply chain, we can subject inventory tokens to double-spend controls and force reconciliation across the network. The result is a process that looks much more like banking. When we model this for EY clients, they can easily find a 20% or more reduction in inventory just by improving the accuracy of operations. The return on that investment is usually very large.  The obstacle here is that nearly all large companies already have supplier relationship management systems. These handle the exchange of shipment messages, invoices and inventory data. They're often point-to-point, between one customer and one supplier, not including third parties like contract manufacturers or shipping companies, and often detached from payments as well. In addition, these systems can't usually see past one tier back in the supply chain, so a factory fire or a big shipping delay two tiers back won't be visible until it's too late to properly react.  Inadequate? Expensive? A far cry from what an integrated blockchain solution could do? Yes, yes and yes. But do these systems work from a day-to-day operations standpoint without major disruption? Mostly. Would it be risky and scary to replace them without a major crisis or burning platform? Yes.  As a consequence, while we are building supply chain collaboration and integration systems, my expectations about where and when we can push a blockchain solution forward are somewhat different.  Businesses are seeking more procurement solutions where the ROI is particularly large and measurable or those scenarios where operational success in the supply chain depends heavily on actions that take multiple tiers out of the supply chain. In both of those cases, there's often enough value or (perhaps sometimes more importantly) big enough capability gaps to justify enterprises' investment in new solutions.  I believe blockchains will eventually become the standard mechanism by which companies interact with each other, covering everything from the business agreement to the tokenization of products and services, delivery and supply chain tracking and integrated payments.  The path there, in the enterprise, will be an indirect one, starting with one very specific problem at a time.
