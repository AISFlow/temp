42380111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M7Ed,1513028745,"PlexCoin Founder Gets Jail Time, Fine on Contempt Charge","U.S. and Canadian authorities appear determined to make an example of a recent initial coin offering.  On Friday, a Canadian court ordered a two-month jail sentence against PlexCoin creator Dominic Lacroix and $100,000 in fines against his company for contempt of court, according to Radio Canada. The day before, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought extensions of its restraining order, asset freeze and order against destruction of documents by PlexCoin and its organizers, according to FinanceFeeds.  PlexCoin promised a platform that would provide the same services as bitcoin, but do so faster. ""This implies a huge success for PlexCoin as soon as it launches,"" its website said.  Quebec's finance regulator, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), had ordered PlexCoin and its parent company, DL Innov, to cancel the sale. When it allegedly did not, the AMF sought and attained a court order. Last week's ruling by the superior court in Quebec follows the continuation of the offering in violation of the court order.  'We do not care'  Judge Marc Lesage cited the ""flippancy"" of the defendants in documents seized by the AMF in justifying the fine and sentence.  ""We do not care about the AMF, "" Lacroix wrote to an employee, according to the Radio Canada story, as translated from French using Google Translate.  The U.S. court orders enjoining PlexCoin and DL Innov expire on Dec. 12, but the SEC sought an order to extend them in a hearing of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, where the company has been asked to show cause why they should not expire.  The company is believed to have raised $15 million, of which $810,000 remains deposited at the payment processor Stripe, according to the SEC, and an unknown amount remains in crypto-wallets controlled by the company, FinanceFeeds reports.

As of press time, the BPI had climbed as high as $17,382.64, beating the $17,364.56 reported previously on Dec. 7. As previously reported, that day saw significant price divergences among exchanges, leading to spreads in excess of $1,000 between the world's various marketplaces for bitcoin.  According to the BPI, the price of bitcoin has surged more than $2,000 today, a development that comes less than a day after options exchange CBOE first commenced trading of its initial bitcoin futures products. Data from CNBC indicates that the contract scheduled to expire in January is trading at $18,670 as of 3:38 p.m. EST.  At press time, bitcoin's price is $17,178.96, per the BPI representing an increase of over 14 percent.  Additional data from CoinMarketCap suggests that the wider cryptocurrency market is seeing gains, with several of the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization seeing price increases above 10 percent in the past 24 hours.

42380105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M775,1513023311,Understanding Futures: A Primer for Bitcoiners,"Lanre Sarumi is the CEO of Level Trading Field, an interactive online platform for professionals in the finance industry.      ""Study the past if you would define the future."" – Confucius  Confucius shares a trait with Satoshi Nakamoto: no one knows if their most famous work was authored by one or multiple people.  Regardless of who came up with the quote above, it is sage advice and so to understand what the introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago exchanges means for the cryptocurrency, let's start with history.  Before there were ""futures"" contracts there were ""forward"" contracts. Before there were forward contracts, there were gentlemen's agreements. Before there were gentlemen's agreements there was simply ""show up in the market with your harvest and hope you can sell everything at your desired price.""  All four of the above still exist today. The ""show up at the market with your harvest and hope you can sell everything at your desired price"" is self-explanatory. The other side of the trade is ""show up at the market hoping a merchant is there to sell you what you want at the price you want it.""  The problem with conducting business this way, besides the mouthful of words, is that you risk not finding a desirable counterparty and thus losing money. To fix this problem, the gentleman's agreement was created.  In the gentleman's agreement, two counterparties agree on a time, place and price in the future to trade with each other. The problem with the gentleman's agreement was that it required two gentlemen willing to honor the agreement.  The absence of one or more of the required gentlemen usually led to lawsuits.  However, the courts usually threw out the cases because it was hard to convince a judge that you had a binding agreement with just a selfie of you and your counterparty shaking hands. (OK, they probably didn't call them ""selfies"" back then, but you get the idea.) To solve this problem the forward contract was created.  The forward contract is a legally binding agreement between two counterparties to trade a given asset at a future (forward) date and a given price. It allows one party to seek relief from the court if the other party does not live up to their part in the agreement. While showing up with a nicely typed and signed document is a lot better than a selfie of two people smiling in better times, it has one problem. The defaulting party could be broke. Since broke parties generally do not pay their debt, the other party essentially loses.  To fix this problem, the futures contract was developed.  Futures 101  The futures contract is pretty much the same as the forward contract with some slight differences. The main difference is that an exchange stands as a guarantor to both counterparties.  The bitcoin futures contract set to launch Dec. 18 at the CME is a cash-settled contract. This simply means that on the date of expiry, no actual bitcoin will be traded but a cash value will be credited to one of the parties depending on the final settlement price.  If the contract was first traded at $12,000 and the price of the CME bitcoin index goes to $14,000, the seller is on the hook for $2,000. Should the seller decide to flee and not fulfill his or her obligation, the exchange will step in and make the buyer whole.  Goodbye, going to court with legal contracts or selfies. Goodbye, getting on your donkey and hulling bushels to the harvest market. Ok, you use Uber instead of a donkey and you traded bitcoins instead of corn, but you get my point.  Before you start thanking the exchanges for their selfless service and asking how many ETH tokens you can send them in appreciation of their kindness, here is the thing: they get paid.  Toll booth city  In ice cold fiat cash, no cryptos here.  They call it an ""exchange fee."" That is expected of course, but here is another thing, the exchanges don't really take all the risk of defaults.  They have other entities called ""futures clearing merchants"" that shoulder a good portion of the risk. For their service, clearing merchants also take a fee. They call it, you guessed it, a ""clearing fee.""  Exchanges must be regulated. After all, they are now essentially the counterparty to every transaction and could, in fact, default themselves.  In the U.S., they are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and not the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), despite the word ""Exchange"" in the latter's name. Why these agencies of government are separate is probably a good subject for an article, just not this one.  But here is an interesting thing. The CFTC is the regulatory body for futures exchanges, but it essentially outsourced a lot of the work to a self-regulatory association established by the exchanges, The National Futures Association. Like most people, the folks at the NFA don't work for free. By now you know what is coming... they get a fee.  In the case of Bitcoin futures, the CFTC has washed its hands very clean and is leaning on the exchanges and NFA to self-certify and self-regulate the Bitcoin futures market.  Remember when I said the exchanges don't take all the risks and they have the clearing firms shoulder some of the risks? Well, the clearing firms are no fools, they also pass on some of the risk to firms called introducing brokers. Introducing brokers, of course, collect a ""brokerage fee.""  A short leash  Now if you think brokers are the last fool, then think again. There is one last party in this chain, the trader, you.  Yes, did you think because you pay exchange fees + clearing fees + NFA fees + brokerage fee you would be let off the hook? Hahaha, ROFTL, give me a moment let me gather myself.  I'm back. You see, when the exchanges said they would stand as guarantor to both sides, what they really meant was they would ask their friends at the clearing organization (sometimes a subsidiary of the exchange, not to be confused with the clearing merchants) to put their hands in both counterparties' pockets every day to make sure they don’t abscond when the market goes against them.  You may be able to trade the bitcoin cash market anonymously, but you cannot do the same with futures.  So, if two counterparties trade a Bitcoin futures contract for $12,000, the clearing organization will calculate the value of the contract every day using a price they call ""settlement price."" For the CME, the settlement price is determined from an index, the Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR). The BRR is calculated using the market prices from certain exchanges.  As of today, there are four exchanges in the CME index, Bitstamp, GDAX, Kraken and itBit. The Cboe, which launched bitcoin futures trading Sunday, uses the price from the Gemini exchange. If the settlement price is $11,900, after the first day, the clearing organization takes $100 from the buyer and gives to the seller. If the settlement was instead $12,100, the opposite happens: The clearing organization takes $100 from the seller and gives it to the buyer.  This mark to market process is performed every trading day.  By so doing, the exchange essentially protects both sides, and itself, from having to deal with massive losses that can accrue over days. The clearing organizations don't really interact directly with most traders except the self-clearing firms. They perform the ""hand in pocket"" routine with clearing merchants. Long before the clearing organization takes money from the clearing merchants' pockets, the clearing merchant would have notified the broker and the trader who must have made a deposit with the clearing firm.  Table stakes  How much deposit is required? The exchanges, CME to be specific, created this magical tool to measure the intraday volatility of every commodity futures contract. It's called SPAN, short for standard portfolio analysis of risk.  SPAN does some intensive computation not unlike the computer from ""The Hitchhikers’ Guide to the Galaxy,"" Deep Thought.  Just like Deep Thought, SPAN spits out a magical number, but in this case that number isn't 42. In fact, it's different for every contract. The number is used by a lot of brokerage firms to determine how much of the risk the trader will shoulder. They call it initial margin. This is the amount a trader must deposit before he can trade a given contract.  In the case of a brand new contract like the bitcoin futures contract, where SPAN has no historical futures data to calculate the margin number, the exchanges go back to their ""Deep Thought"" computer for a number. For CME, Deep Thought says initial margin should be 35%. Cboe's computer says 30%.  So that's it right? Not really.  Focus on the first word of the term ""initial margin."" The margin you deposit is just to ""initially"" get you started. If you immediately start making money from your trade because you followed the secret to trading, ""buy low, sell high"" then you are fine.  If your strategy doesn’t follow that simple concept and the value of the futures contract you bought or sold causes the initial margin to fall below a certain value called the ""maintenance margin,"" then you will be getting a call to post additional funds into your account. If you fail to do so, then the broker, clearing firm, or exchange will close out your position and whatever is left in your account will be used to offset your losses.  The above is essentially a high-level synopsis of the futures market as well as an introduction to how account management and setup work. The process is the same whether the account is set up to trade oil, wheat or bitcoin. I will be posting additional articles on futures contracts in general and bitcoin futures contracts in particular.

Speaking to Financial News, Edward Tilly said that objections like those raised by the Futures Industry Association in an open letter last week are ""uncalled for"" and doesn't reflect the reality of the regulatory approval process. As an institution that trades commodity-backed derivatives, the CBOE is overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),  He told the publication:  ""I think letters like that and cheap shots to our regulator, the CFTC, are uncalled for to make it seem this was an overnight self-certification without the proper amount of CFTC involvement. This is just irresponsible. I respect all the concerns that the industry has but when it's articulated in the way the FIA did, not so much.""  In that letter, released last week, FIA chief executive Walt Lukken said that members are concerned about the volatility around cryptocurrency prices, while also attacking the process that led to the yesterday's futures launch.  ""A public discussion should have been had on whether a separate guarantee fund for this product was appropriate or whether exchanges put additional capital in front of the clearing member guarantee fund,"" Lukken wrote at the time.  Similar objections were previously raised by Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy who, in an ad in the Wall Street Journal, argued that bitcoin derivatives activity should be siloed off from the broader market.  Tilly explained that the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), a clearinghouse focused on equities derivatives, clears the contracts for CBOE.  ""Again, I default to their expertise and I'm comfortable with their decision,"" he told the publication.

42380097,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M6vl,1513010419,SEC Halts Multimillion-Dollar 'Munchee' ICO for Securities Violations,"A California-based company has refunded tokens sold in a $15 million initial coin offering following an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The SEC announced today that Munchee Inc. had provided refunds to investors after officials made contact and drew issue with its token sale, which the agency said constituted the offer and sale of unregistered securities.  The development represents the latest high-profile move by the agency to regulate initial coin offerings, coming roughly a week after the SEC filed a fraud suit against the organizer of the PlexCoin token sale. As in that instance, today's order resulted from an investigation by the SEC's Cyber Unit, formed earlier this year in part to police token sales that involve U.S. investors.  Munchee, according to a thread on Bitcointalk, was pitched as a ""Yelp Meets Instagram"" that would serve as a new way to source restaurant reviews. Its MUN token, materials suggest, would serve as an incentive for activity on the company's social network, and the sale began in October, according to the post.  Yet in its cease-and-desist order, dated Dec. 11, the SEC argued that the MUN tokens constitute securities because ""they were investment contracts."" The document later notes that the tokens were ultimately deemed a security regardless of their ""utility"" when the sale took place.  ""Even if MUN tokens had a practical use at the time of the offering, it would not preclude the token from being a security. Determining whether a transaction involves a security does not turn on labelling[sic] – such as characterizing an ICO as involving a 'utility token' – but instead requires an assessment of 'the economic realities underlying a transaction,'"" the SEC wrote in the order.  While it's not clear how much money was raised, the SEC said that ""about 40 investors"" bought tokens through the sale. The agency also noted that it first contacted Munchee on the second day of the sale and that it ""did not deliver any tokens to purchasers.""  In statements, the agency pointed to the swift cooperation by Munchee after it began investigating the sale.  ''In deciding not to impose a penalty, the Commission recognized that the company stopped the ICO quickly, immediately returned the proceeds before issuing tokens and cooperated with the investigation,"" said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division.

According to the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR system, new applications have been received for the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, as well as both the REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Connecticut-based REX's filing is dated Dec. 8, whereas VanEck's is dated Dec. 11, the records show.  As previously reported, filings from these firms were withdrawn earlier this year after the SEC raised questions about the timing of the launches.  ""[SEC] Staff expressed the view that it is the Commission's policy to not review a registration statement for a fund where the underlying instruments in which the fund intends to primarily invest are not yet available,"" VanEck assistant general counsel Matthew Babinsky wrote in a letter in late September. REX went on to make a similar statement the following month.  The timing is notable, given that Chicago-based CBOE launched its initial bitcoin futures products on Sunday. That opening was marked by a near-simultaneous spike in the price of bitcoin and loss of connectivity on the exchange operator's website.  Subsequent reports show that CBOE's self-imposed circuit-breakers – which pause trading during big price swings – have activated in the hours since the futures trading went live.  According to data from CNBC, the price of CBOE's January futures contract is trading at $17,790 as of 10:14 a.m. EST, on a volume of 3,011 following the start of trading.

42380117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M7IP,1513004403,"Bitcoin Gold Defies Gravity, But Price Rally Looks Weak","Bitcoin gold is defying gravity today, but analysis suggests the upturn in prices may be ephemeral.  The cryptocurrency, which was created via a hard fork of bitcoin in mid-November, topped out above $500 levels soon after launch, but since then has gradually been losing weight as the most unloved of the bitcoin clones.  However, the world's seventh largest cryptocurrency by market value bounced up to $288.68 early this morning (as per UTC) before falling back to $240 levels, according to CoinMarketCap. Currently, BTG is holding well above the yesterday's low below $200 ($253 at press time), and has appreciated by 9 percent over 24 hours.  Even so, the price chart analysis indicates the strong bid tone seen today could be short-lived.  4-hour chart  Despite the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence and bullish price-stochastic divergence (marked by dotted lines), BTG is still stuck inside the falling channel. Thus, the odds are high that the cryptocurrency will resume its downtrend in the next 12–24 hours.  Daily chart  View  BTG is looking likely to fall below today's low of $219 and extend losses to $150 (Nov. 20 low).  Only a close (as per UTC) above the falling channel resistance would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and yield a sustained rally to possibly $330–340 levels.

42380114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M7Ft,1513002609,Pantera Invests $3 Million in Sharing Economy Token Origin,"It can be said the sharing economy brought the internet into the real world, helping it move real items rather than just information.  On today's web, though, if you want to rent out your camera or desk, you need a specific site for each one (think Airbnb, 99 Designs or DogVacay), and each site takes a hefty cut from every sale. The founders at Origin, however, envision a world where entrepreneurs would build specific interfaces for each business area, all of which would share one giant pool of customers to lower costs.  Josh Fraser, Origin co-founder, told CoinDesk:  ""We're asking a really audacious question. What if open-source software can replace dozens of multimillion or even multi-billion dollar companies?""  A platform for any kind of peer-to-peer service, Origin has today announced the successful completion of an advisor round with Pantera Capital for $3 million worth of its tokens.  Unsurprisingly, the investor group, one of the longest-running to specialize in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, sees Origin as a potentially powerful idea for disintermediation.  ""If Airbnb were being started today, it would’ve been a peer-to-peer cooperative model based on a blockchain, lowering transaction costs drastically, instead of a rent-seeking equity-based business,"" Joey Krug, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk.  Also distinguishing Origin, which re-branded recently from 0rigin (with a zero), is that it is led by founders with previous successes. Matthew Liu, for instance, was a very early YouTube employee who's since worked at multiple startups, while Fraser has led three venture-backed companies, one of which was acquired by Walmart Labs.  Pantera's allocation base on this investment will now depend on overall investment through a public sale to be held in April. Neither party is yet discussing a goal or cap for the public sale, but Origin said it is aiming to release a production-ready version of its protocol at that time.  Better-than-free  Back to the concept, though, Origin's protocol will seek to create a distributed database of offerings and customers that can have different user interfaces built over them.  One entrepreneur could build an interface for dog walkers, another could build one for carpenters and a third could build one for everything home related, including both dog walkers and carpenters. Time would prove which interfaces worked best for users, but new entrepreneurs wouldn't have to start from zero users every time they wanted to explore a new peer-to-peer vertical.  Each new attempt would already enjoy the existing user base of the prior efforts.  Liu explained to CoinDesk that this wouldn't cause much change for consumers, other than perhaps increasing available choice.  ""To be clear, we are defining protocols and enabling different types of marketplaces to exist,"" he said, as opposed to building a decentralized marketplace for each.  ""I wouldn't say we would build none of them, but our goal is not to build all of them,"" he added. ""We're unsure at this point how far we have to push our own user experience, our own front end and our own acquisition of customers.""  Origin, he continued, is likely to launch a lower volume service to prove the concept, such as freelancing or design services.  Raising stakes  By tokenizing, Origin also believes it can manage what could become a giant and unwieldy piece of software while facilitating community policing and growth.  On the incentive side, Liu explained, Origin's tokens can be used to encourage new users. Early users who pay for a product or service in ethereum or another token, as an example, might get a few Origin back. This incentivizes them to encourage others to take part.  ""We believe in the better-than-free business model,"" he said.  Staking should also facilitate discouraging fraud or spam by requiring payments to be put up for listings. So, if the community identified a bad listing, those funds could be taken away.  All this leads to the second use of the token: governance. If it works, token holders will have a say over how the protocol changes as it grows, something Fraser described as a value-add over current services in which large companies are stymied by regulation.  ""We've seen companies like Uber and Airbnb get banned or heavily regulated in cities all around the globe. These new distributed and Origin-powered marketplaces will be far more resilient to censorship and over-reaching government regulation,"" he said.  But navigating elected officials' opinions is a long way off. For now, the company is focused on getting its platform in front of users.  The team is collaborating with ConsenSys on its code auditing and security.

42380103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M73J,1513000848,BitGo Scores $43 Million as Crypto Goes Corporate,"BitGo, the maker of multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets for enterprises, has closed a $42.5 million Series B funding round in a sign that demand has at last arrived for institutional-grade services in the market.  Led by Valor Equity Partners with participation from Bill Lee and David Sacks, the round of venture capital brings BitGo's total funding to more than $55 million, following a Series A in June 2014.  As part of the investment, Antonio Gracias (who sits on the boards of SpaceX and Tesla) and Sacks (who co-founded PayPal and Yammer) will join BitGo's board of directors. Strategic investor Don Wilson, the founder of asset trader DRW and a co-founder of blockchain startup Digital Asset, will also join BitGo as an advisor.  Announced today, the fundraising caps a transitional year for the veteran bitcoin startup, which was founded to serve businesses back in 2013 – long before this year's influx of institutional money helped drive the currency to record highs.  As a result of that market maturation, BitGo turned a profit for the first time this year. Based in Palo Alto, CA., the firm was building institutional products when most other startups in the space were focused on bringing bitcoin to the masses.  With clients such as CME Group, which is expected to launch a much-anticipated bitcoin futures product next week, BitGo now facilitates a total $8 billion-worth of bitcoin transactions per month, charging a fee on each one.  In an interview, BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe discussed the firm's long path to achieving profitability and scoring one of the largest venture capital raises in the blockchain industry.  All this time, Belshe said:  ""We've been behind the scenes plotting away, building a bigger, better system.""  Multi-coin support  When BitGo was founded, it focused on enabling businesses to securely use bitcoin with wallets that require multiple cryptographic signatures to access.  But over the years, the company has evolved to meet an institutional demand for both ""hot"" (online) and ""cold"" (offline) storage of six currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash.  With the new investment, Belshe said the company will be able to expand that pool of currencies by ""at least"" three in 2018 – and perhaps more importantly, to more quickly on-board new currencies that result from forks of existing ones. Currently, adding these spinoff currencies can sometimes take days or weeks to accommodate.  In addition to supporting new currencies, Belshe indicated that BitGo intends to invest in helping develop and implement scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, ""that are able to drive off-chain payments"" – something he says is crucial to helping his corporate clients build at scale.  Lastly, Belshe spoke in broad terms about ""a number"" of other opportunities that will be explored as a result of the additional funding.  One area he mentioned specifically included services that could be offered as a result of BitGo having a bird's-eye view of where transactions are coming from and going to.  ""What we see now is a big opportunity ahead,"" he said. ""We know that it's going to take some strong growth, and we are aligning the resources that we need to be able to capitalize on that.""  Patience makes perfect  BitGo was born the same year bitcoin's price surged from less than $100 to more than $1,000, before beginning a long slow decline in the wake of the Mt. Gox exchange collapse.  As the industry emerged from that trough, largely due to retail purchases at exchanges like BTCC, Coinbase and Kraken, the institutional investors BitGo courted largely stayed on the sidelines.  ""We had a quiet 2014, a quiet 2015, 2016 started to grow a little bit, but still pretty quiet,"" said Belshe. ""Then 2017, finally traditional finance and institutional investors are here. They are looking around desperately for, what do they do?""  Surviving a hack of one of BitGo's largest clients in 2016, the company went on to become profitable for the first time earlier this year, largely thanks to a single revenue stream: the transaction fees charged to those using the hot wallets. A less significant amount of revenue comes from cold storage.  While the privately held firm isn't sharing actual revenue or user numbers, Belshe said both are ""strong,"" enabling BitGo to double the size of its team from 20 employees in January to 40 today.  In spite of the patience Belshe and his team seem to have exhibited over the past few years, he maintains a humble stance when explaining this year's rapid expansion, saying:  ""The industry has grown, and it's made us strong with it.""

As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to a high of $16,773.04 at 08:00 UTC today, and was last seen trading at $16,500 levels. Going by CoinMarketCap data, bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated 16 percent in the last 24 hours.  It hasn't all been smooth sailing this week, however. Following all-time highs on Dec. 8, prices fell to $13,000 yesterday before recovering to $15,700 at the time of bitcoin futures launch on the CBOE.  Approximately four hours after the debut, the BTC contract on the CBOE (which expires in January) spiked 20 percent and triggered two trading halts. Further, a surge of traffic to the CBOE website caused delays and outages, but failed to deter the cryptocurrency from regaining altitude.  With doors now open for mainstream investors, BTC is showing no signs of slowing down. The price chart analysis indicates the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  The previous three daily candles (as per UTC) have long tails (big gap between the intraday low and close), indicating strong dip demand.

Described internally as the Massive Autonomous Distributed Reconciliation platform, or Madrec for short, the project led by Swiss banking giant UBS, with help from Barclays, Credit Suisse, KBC, SIX and Thomson Reuters, is designed to make it easier for banks to reconcile a wide range of data about their counterparties.  Traditionally, regulated firms use what are called ""legal entity identifiers"" that are stored in a global data system to execute transactions on behalf of clients, even if those clients themselves don't have one of the codes. But as part of a sweeping regulatory change called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II, scheduled to go live in the EU on Jan. 3, 2018, all eligible legal entities will be required to have and use these codes.  Instead of mandating that each of these institutions perform these checks independently, though, the banks built Madrec to mutualize much of the effort in a potentially industry-wide reconciliation process hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, the head of UBS' blockchain research and development efforts, Peter Stephens, explained how the blockchain infrastructure was designed to help users save money, without sacrificing their competitive edge.  Stephens said:  ""It will be our first go-live project.""  'Do no harm'  As part of the build-up to the launch, Stephens took CoinDesk on a tour of the UBS lab in which Madrec was conceived, and described in detail how the blockchain platform could help ease the regulatory demands, even before they begin.  Built over a six-month period, the platform evolved into a smart contract-powered network designed to integrate with identifiers endorsed by The Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee (LEI ROC) and others. The reconciliation of the LEI reference data includes industry classification and information from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).  Instead of each company checking the information independently, and reconciling the results periodically, the blockchain smart contracts will ensure accuracy in almost real-time.      To do this, the anonymized reference data is hashed to the ethereum blockchain, while the source data itself remains within the institution. The smart contracts then reconcile the data, letting users quickly identify anomalies and reconcile them.                  Since every eligible entity will be held to those same standards, Stephens argues that helping one another ensure the accuracy of their work will only positively impact their respective bottom lines, leaving room for competition elsewhere.  ""It's public reference data, it's not a competitive differentiator,"" he said, adding:  ""It's a sort of a 'do no harm, make the world a better place' thing. It does good for the regulators, we're including the data providers as well, we're not trying to disrupt them, and we're including other banks.""  Mock-live pilot  Originally referred to internally as Project Conrad, the Massive Autonomous Distributed Reconciliation platform was largely incubated in London, at UBS' off-site blockchain research and development lab.  Housed in offices at the Level 39 fintech workspace in London's Canary Wharf, the laboratory is intended to be a ""neutral space"" where contributors from multiple partners are currently working on six blockchain projects slated to go live next year.  Perhaps most notably, the location is the same site where UBS initiated the Utility Settlement Coin project, also being undertaken by a group of financial institutions.      As for the Madrec pilot, it is currently in a mock-live environment using 22,000 non-sensitive reference attributes for cash equity issuers. The pilot is to scheduled to be completed by the end of next month, with a further, staged roll-out dependent on the result.  Lee Braine, of the investment Bank CTO Office at Barclays, told CoinDesk:    ""This narrow use case makes it easier to appreciate the innovative cryptographic technique that allows each bank to retain data privacy and yet also check its own data against baselined data maintained via group consensus.""

42380109,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M7DN,1512990629,Parity Urges 'Rescue' Fork to Reclaim Frozen Millions,"Parity Technologies has published an update on its efforts to reclaim funds lost in a high-profile coding error that occurred on ethereum last month.  In a blog post published today, the U.K.-based company published the results of its research into the issue, suggesting as many as four such protocol changes are currently under review as possible fixes, all of which would require changes to the ethereum software all users run. At the time, $275 million-worth of the cryptocurrency ether became inaccessible to their owners.  Given the stakes, Parity sought to galvanize community support for a plan to ""rescue"" the funds in the post, appealing to those who run the software for the change.  While acknowledging a decision would ultimately be up to the community, Parity said its preferred fix would be made via protocol changes to the ethereum virtual machine (EVM). According to the blog post, this would be a ""functional enhancement to the platform"" that would both restore the lost funds and protect against similar cases in future  The company wrote:  ""No one should be under any illusion that unlocking these stuck funds would be anything other than a rescue operation – and would only be possible with a hard fork."".  The company's positioning of the news also sought to stress the idea that the company can't act unilaterally to recover the funds. A sign of the early stages of the process, it has also yet to document the idea as an ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), the official code patches for the platform.  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, EVM protocol changes are a contentious solution.  Speaking at the time, the idea was criticized by ethereum developer Nick Johnston, who said it would ""change an important invariant"" in the EVM, potentially leading to ""unexpected bugs, even in already-deployed contracts.""  The post documents two other potential fixes, including an amendment to the existing ethereum improvement protocol, EIP 156, and an ""address specific"" Parity fund rescue.  In the time since the fund freeze, the Parity debate has triggered discussions reminiscent of the DAO hack of last year, in which hard fork contention spawned a competing cryptocurrency named ethereum classic (now valued at $1.7 billion), though on a smaller scale.  The Parity blog post concludes:  ""It is our hope that the community would get behind a rescue of these funds to help all the users that we can.""  Correction: This article has been updated to better highlight source material.    Edit: This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimate of the funds frozen, from $160 million to $275 million.  CoinDesk is following this developing story.

Speaking at the ICI Securities Law Developments Conference in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Division of Investment Management director Dalia Blass offered some insight into how the agency – tasked with policing investment activity in the U.S. – is grappling with some of the issues posed by firms that are holding and investing wholly digitized assets.  ""We also continue to think about new innovations in asset management. For example, we have seen several filings for registered funds that would hold cryptocurrency. As with any new product, there are questions to ask,"" Blass told attendees according to a transcript of her remarks.  Some of those open questions include how to differentiate different types of assets and whether sufficient information is being provided to prospective investors regarding the related risks.  Blass went on to say:  ""How would these funds fit into the existing regulatory scheme? What regulatory structure or structures apply to the market for the underlying instrument? We will be discussing these questions with you as we work through these filings.""  The comments come amid growing activity out of the SEC around blockchain, including its policing of initial coin offerings (ICOs) that involve U.S. investors. The agency charged a New York businessman with violating anti-fraud laws in September for allegedly launching fraudulent token sales. More recently, the SEC's new Cyber Unit moved to file fraud charges against the organizer of an ICO that had previously been the target of regulators in Canada.

42380113,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M7C7,1512968485,Gibraltar Bill Passage Paves Way for Blockchain Regulations,"Lawmakers in Gibraltar approved a piece of legislation last week that advances the government's broader plans for blockchain.  On Dec. 6, legislators cleared a bill that amends the British overseas territory's Financial Services (Investment and Fiduciary Services) Act in order to ""extend measures for the protection of investors to the customers of licensees carrying on controlled activities which are not investment services.""  As arcane as that may seem, the bill represents a legal tweak intended to pave the way for new rules that officials made public last year as part of a bid to legally define blockchain's use in storing and transmitting value under Gibraltar law.  Albert Isola, Gibraltar's Minister of Commerce, celebrated the bill's passage and pointed to expected demand for licenses once the DLT-specific regulations are formally introduced in the new year.  Isola remarked:  ""Gibraltar is one of the first jurisdictions in the world to introduce a regulatory framework for [distributed ledger technology] businesses thereby providing the regulatory certainty required by quality firms that we aim to attract to Gibraltar. I am aware that there are a number of businesses waiting to file their applications with the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission on 1st January 2018 and this is excellent news.""  Given the passage of the latest bill, Gibraltar's Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers) Regulations 2017 is likely to be approved as well. The next year may also see regulators in Gibraltar move to develop rules specifically aimed at initial coin offerings (ICOs) as suggested in a September statement on the blockchain funding model.  At the time, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission said that it is ""considering a complementary regulatory framework covering the promotion and sale of tokens, aligned with the DLT framework.""

42380110,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M79b,1512961225,Deutsche Bank: Blockchain Opportunities Are 'Huge',"Blockchain technology could represent a major shift in how companies conduct their business, according to Deutsche Bank's chief investment officer.  In a slide presentation this month  , Christian Nolting, also the bank’s global head of wealth, and Marcus Muller, global head of the CIO office, explained how digital currencies and blockchains work and predicted where they would go in the future.  According to the presentation, the “opportunities associated with blockchain technologies are huge,” and could be fully put into practice within the next few years.  The bankers predicted that roughly 10% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) would be tracked or otherwise ""regulated"" by a blockchain by 2027.  The presentation said:  “We expect that the blockchain will change the business model of companies in a sustained way. The blockchain technology enables a faster and cheaper exchange of assets and financial products between individuals without an [intermediary], which reduces the asymmetry of information between the individuals.”  Lukewarm on currencies  While blockchain technology is promising, cryptocurrencies are less so, according to the presentation. The bank is classifying digital currencies as ""highly speculative"" given their lack of intrinsic value or backing from a central bank.  Though cryptocurrencies could represent an alternative to fiat currencies, especially in nations with runaway inflation, they need more regulation and security to become a proper asset class, according to the presentation.  Digital currencies in general could evolve in a number of possible ways, with some of the main factors affecting their growth being government intervention and competition between different currencies.  The potential for hard forks creating new currencies is also a potential cause for concern, since it could lead to inflation, the presentation stated.  ""In addition, central banks could develop their own cryptocurrencies and replace the private ones in the market,"" it said.

42380089,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M4sh,1512951666,"Bitcoin Futures Open Sees Price Spike, CBOE Crash","The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)'s website became unavailable just as it launched its first bitcoin futures contracts at 6 p.m. EST on Sunday.  The website downtime – which CBOE attributed to significant traffic around the futures launch in a post on Twitter – coincided with a sudden surge in the price of bitcoin, which jumped from $14,509 at 22:59 UTC to $15,732 at 23:06 UTC according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Yet as of press time, CBOE's website is becoming more available – delayed information about the contracts being offered can be found here – and the price of bitcoin has maintained a somewhat steady pace since that initial jump, trading at $15,226.29 per the BPI.  The data coming in thus far suggest that buyers are indeed moving to purchase contracts. Activity has been largely centered around the first contract to expire, dated January 17, 2018, with social media posts pointing to purchases of contracts scheduled to expire on March 14.  According to CNBC, 672 January contracts have been sold as of 7:10 pm EST, with the news service reporting a price of $15,800.  In all, the tumultuous start is perhaps a fitting start to the trading of the new contracts. CBOE's is the first to be traded on a major regulated exchange in the U.S., and it's set to be followed next week by CME Group, which has announced that it will launch its own products on Dec. 18.  According to executives from the firm, CBOE is hoping that the futures launch will lead to other products and services centered around cryptocurrencies, including a possible shift into exchange-traded funds and notes – provided that the SEC gives its approval.
