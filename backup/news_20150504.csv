First announced in November, Case is advertised as a pocket-sized bitcoin hardware wallet that includes security features such as multisig and biometric authentication. Case is now available for pre-order for $199 or roughly 0.83 BTC through payment processor PayStand.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Melanie Shapiro indicated that she expects the first Case units to begin shipping this summer, though no firm dates for shipping were provided.  Shapiro further spoke to the broader vision for the product in a statement, adding:  “As online blockchain technologies evolve as a means for buying and selling bitcoin, they will require devices like Case to ensure security and maintain privacy.""  Only 1,000 Case wallets will be available for pre-order, with each entry in the initial batch bearing a unique identifier.  CryptoLabs had earlier suggested units were expected to be market ready by spring 2015.

42398328,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI7y,1430769351,Block Chain Summit Responds to Backlash Over Private Island Bash,"Boasting an exotic location and the apparent blessing of billionaire Richard Branson, the Block Chain Summit has emerged as one of the most discussed events in the digital currency community in recent months.  To be held from 25th to 28th May on Branson's private Necker Island, little has been known about the conference apart from its available guest list, a factor that has led to speculation as to what the event would seek to achieve since it was first revealed by CoinDesk.  In a new interview, however, Valery Vavilov, CEO of leading event sponsor BitFury and venture capitalist Bill Tai shed new light on the gathering, opening up about its planned schedule and responding to criticism that it is perpetuating negative industry stereotypes.  Tai, who has previously invested in BitFury, sought to dismiss these criticisms, suggesting that the Block Chain Summit first and foremost will seek to attract attention to how decentralized ledger systems might positively impact the world.  Positioning this as a contrast to past conferences, Tai told CoinDesk:  ""This is not a conference that's about the pure technology and it's not a gathering to try to disrupt governments and banks and mess with people's currency systems. We want to get great minds on how to use blockchain technology to do good.""  Vavilov reported that BitFury was involved as an organizer due to what it saw as its ability to influence the more widespread distribution of the technology. BitFury is one of the largest processors for transactions on bitcoin's distributed ledger.  Necker Island, according to Tai, represents the perfect venue for such discussions, providing a more relaxed setting that can set the stage for this generation of technology innovators to collaborate and form early bonds.  ""We want to create an environment where people can form friendships and work on projects together that can actually have real influence and global impact,"" he said.  Gender imbalance  Tai indicated that he was pleased with the attention the event has so far received on social media, even from more negative articles that have framed it as too exclusive due to its lack of women participants.  However, he characterized the reaction as an example of the positive impact that the medium can have by galvanizing public sentiment on important issues.  ""I love the attention on it,"" Tai said. ""What I think the attention does is allow women to self identify as women that should be here, because they're speaking up.""  The Block Chain Summit is aiming to contact an additional seven or eight women, according to Tai, who said the BitGive Foundation's Connie Gallippi is involved in recommending potential candidates. Still, logistics are forming a potential barrier to this effort.  Tai noted that Necker Island had previously been booked close to capacity, and that as such, last-minute accommodations for new guests are being put into place.  ""We would be delighted to have great women that can contribute to this discussion, so we're creating another location where some people can stay adjacent to the island if the island is full and come on to the island for discussions,"" Tai said.  BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello has since been confirmed as an attendee, according to the event's official website.  Branson's role  Perhaps the most noteworthy name on the event's guest list is Richard Branson, the Necker Island owner who previously invested in bitcoin payment processor BitPay. While another lightning rod for interest, Tai indicated Branson's involvement will be limited.  Tai reported having a long-standing relationship with the Virgin Group founder, having met Branson while kiteboarding in the early 2000s following the initial public offering of Internet hosting provider iAsiaWorks.  ""I ended up running into some interesting characters that also kiteboard, including Richard Branson, and we ended up throwing a bunch of entrepreneur summits together,"" Tai said, framing the Block Chain Summit as a continuation of this past work.  ""Obviously it's his island home so he'll be there and he's part of the activities, but he's not going to be running them,"" Tai continued. ""He's going to be participating in them to the extent that he can.""  Tai also cautioned that readers perhaps shouldn't read too much into Branson's hosting of the conference, adding that he is ""not an expert"" on the technology despite his public support and interest.  Itinerary details  Apart from previously announced talks by Wall Street Journal writer Michael Casey and Institute for Liberty and Democracy president Hernando De Soto, Tai reported that much about the event will be informal or is still being finalized.  He inferred the event will be more of a workshop than a conference, with organizers breaking guests into groups which will then brainstorm solutions to pressing global problems while engaging in an activity of their choosing.  ""We ask what major problems in the world can we solve with a blockchain, what are the challenges to accomplishing that and what are the solutions. Then, we go off and do those while we're doing fun cool things like kiteboarding, playing tennis or whatever people are interested in,"" Tai explained.  Each group will then be responsible for presenting their findings at a closing party, he added.  Tai suggested talks would also be given by the team behind ID3's Open Mustard Seed platform, a project that is seeking to apply blockchain solutions to digital identity challenges. Members of MIT's recently announced Digital Currency Initiative, he added, might also make an appearance, though details are being finalized.  Ultimately, organizers suggested that more information from the conference would be limited, though this was dependent on what transpired at the event.  ""If we can't think of anything to change the world for the good, I don't know that we'll talk about it,"" Tai quipped. ""There won't be anything to say.""

42398339,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTIGp,1430749588,Melotic Shuts Down Digital Asset Exchange,"Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency startup Melotic has announced that it is shutting down its digital asset exchange, citing a lack of sufficient growth.  In a 3rd May blog post, Melotic indicated that the cost of operating its platform had become prohibitive. The exchange, which hosts a number of altcoins and decentralized app (dapp) tokens, appears to have fallen victim to low trading volumes.  According to the post, users will have until 15th May to withdraw their balances, and deposits. After 15th May, the exchange will be shut off.  Melotic said that it intends to continue operating with an as-yet undisclosed new service or product, asking users to ""stay tuned for what we have in store"". The post noted that resources previously used to support the digital asset exchange will be redirected to those efforts.  When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Melotic echoed the blog post, emphasizing that the platform is solvent and that the company has sufficient capital to pivot away from the digital asset exchange and toward new product initiatives.  The representative said:  ""We simply didn't see enough growth in our metrics and in the digital asset market to justify continuing devoting more resources to the exchange's development. We still believe in bitcoin and have been working on a promising new product for the last couple of months.""  The planned shutdown comes months after the company raised new capital to help support its exchange efforts. Melotic closed $1.17m in seed funding last October, drawing support from Ceyuan Ventures, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp and 500 Startups.  Melotic is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to close its doors in 2015, adding its name to a list that includes UK-based Netagio.

42398344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTIJm,1430734733,London Photographer Embarks on Bitcoin-Only Challenge,"London photographer Abby Scarlet has embarked on a six month challenge during which she will only accept work from clients willing to pay her in bitcoin.  Sitting in her colourful studio in a warehouse in North London, Scarlet – who's approximately two weeks into her bitcoin-only endeavour – opened up about her discovery of the digital currency and her personal quest to spread its adoption.  Bitcoin 'head-first'  ""I was thrown into bitcoin head-first,"" said Scarlet.  Anecdotally, Scarlet explained how she shared a house in Brighton – a seaside hotspot in the UK – with a bitcoin miner and a bitcoin enthusiast last year.  ""He [the bitcoin miner] had all these machines and I didn't know what they were. I actually turned them off when I got home once because they were making so much noise. He came in and started yelling, asking what I was doing. I didn't realise he was actually mining digital currency.""  Though her initial introduction to bitcoin was somewhat humorous, Scarlet now refers to the currency as ""mind blowing"", noting how it can be used to do good in the world.  What really sold her, however, was the community built around bitcoin.  ""I was exposed to all the reddit and sub-reddit forums. Reading how the people in bitcoin were supportive of each other, how some took on voluntary roles without payment as an incentive really caught my attention. I have never been part of such a huge community where everyone wants to help each other.""  The photographer reiterated that the bitcoin community had ""been amazing, really uplifting"" following the announcement of her challenge.  Spreading the word  This is not the first time Scarlet has set out to spread the word about the digital currency.  While living in Brighton, she had helped Flawless Clothing, a local shop, get its first bitcoin ATM.  One could argue that her open-minded approach and her unique way of seeing the world through her camera lens were the driving forces behind her bitcoin challenge.  ""I believe that artists see the world slightly different to people who don't practise art. Maybe we see a light in something that nobody else really sees, perhaps with bitcoin its the same.""  It soon became apparent, however, that her bitcoin-only adventure is much more than an artistic vision. Scarlet is not just talk, she's action.  Having realised how bitcoin could potentially transform traditional finance, she decided to take matters into her own hands, telling clients about the digital currency and outlining its benefits.  ""There is a live music event that I photograph every month, I told the organisers about bitcoin, got them in touch with trader friends and now their flyers include the bitcoin symbol and they accept it at their food and bar stalls at gigs. They have been really supportive of me.""  Shooting for bitcoin  However, Scarlet's challenge is not without risks. She was fully aware that it could potentially result in the loss of her frequent clients, mainly model portraits and wedding shoots.  When asked about whether she would turn away clients unwilling to pay in bitcoin, she said: ""Unfortunately, I have to. I have been really trying to, not convert people to bitcoin, but ease them into it and show them how it all works.""  She noted that her business has not suffered dramatically, quickly pointing out that her workload remains ""more or less"" the same as when she was also accepting payment in fiat.  Scarlet is currently contracted by Fork the Banks, a charity album released by Occupy London, a movement that fights for a new political and economic order that prioritises people, democracy and the environment over profit.  During her interview with CoinDesk, Scarlet shot UrbanD Soul, for the project. Both musicians, Romain and Enji told CoinDesk they liked the idea of bitcoin but were not entirely convinced.  Romain said: ""Perhaps I am too French to believe in bitcoin.""  It was not all skepticism on the shoot, however. Lee Smith, project manager at Fork the Banks, told a different story, noting how the digital currency and the blockchain could potentially overhaul the art world, giving artists more control over the work and their revenue.  Smith will be paying Scarlet in bitcoin. He said:  ""Everything that empowers the people and frees us from the middle man is a good idea.""  Future plans  Scarlet has undoubtedly set out to encourage bitcoin use, but before we see mainstream adoption, she said, there is one underlying issue that needs to be addressed.  Accessibility, she noted, is a real problem. ""The average person does not know much about it. If they go online, they are mainly going to read all these negative articles. I want somewhere where people can go and get information.""  To overcome this, Scarlet is planning on using some of her bitcoin funds to set up a coffee shop where she would also like to hold bitcoin meetups and house a commission-free bitcoin ATM.
