42432740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1E3h,1600982474,Israeli Draft Bill Would Nix Hefty Capital Gains Taxes on Bitcoin,"Israeli bitcoiners take note: A handful of Knesset members are seeking to ease Israel's hefty taxation of cryptocurrencies.      Four Knesset members from the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party on Tuesday introduced a draft bill that would effectively end Israel's 25% capital gains tax on bitcoin by redefining certain ""distributed digital currencies"" as currency, instead of a taxable asset.    The proposed re-designation applies to cryptocurrencies with: a distributed issuance network, a 1 billion shekel ($288 million) market cap or more, a general use purpose and an independent origin story.  Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies meet these criteria, according to the bill authors: Oded Forer, Evgeny Sova, Yulia Malinovsky and Alex Kushnir.  ""This regulatory clarity will create commercial certainty and allow more digital currencies to enter the Israeli market,"" the lawmakers wrote in their proposal.  Defining cryptos as currency would simplify Israeli bitcoiners' tax burden and make qualifying coins a more attractive payment mechanism, according to the measure.  The Yisrael Beiteinu party is part of Israel's parliamentary opposition, making passage unlikely without backing from members of the majority.

42384757,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIP5,1600980591,"New Bipartisan Bill Would Classify Digital Tokens as Commodities, Not Securities, in US","A new bipartisan-backed bill aims to clarify investment contract assets or digital tokens sold as part of a securities offering are separate and distinct commodities, not securities.    The legislation introduced by Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) would amend existing securities laws to exclude tokens from the definition of a security.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer for the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), noted if a company issues a token, and there is an investment contract there, it has to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to qualify for an exemption.  The token that's the object or the subject of that investment contract itself isn't necessarily a security, Kim said.  According to a press statement on Emmer’s website, the bill would allow companies in compliance with securities registration requirements or have qualified for an exemption to “distribute their assets to the public without additional regulatory uncertainty.”  It goes on to state that digital tokens associated with security offerings “are in fact, and always were, commodities.”  The bill has bipartisan support, Kim said, adding that the bill would make law a legal standard argument made in an amicus brief submitted by the CDC following the SEC injunction against messaging app Telegram, in which Telegram was accused of violating securities law when it issued its native gram token in 2018.  The new legislation would help to bring clarity to this area of the industry that's in desperate need of it, Kim said.  Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), who joined Emmer in introducing the legislation, proposed a separate bill Thursday that could bring digital currency exchanges under a single federal framework.

42384775,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlImz,1600979581,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $10.7K; Options Market Likes Sub-$360 Ether,"Bitcoin had a small rally Thursday. Meanwhile, the ether options market is giving some investors protection from decentralized finance downsides.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,653 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,135-$10,736.  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price made gains Thursday as the world’s oldest cryptocurrency began a modest rally at around 15:00 UTC (11 a.m. EDT). It jumped $343 to as high as $10,736 in just two hours on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. Bitcoin was changing hands at $10,653 at press time.      Thursday’s bitcoin price pop came after several days of stagnation followed by a quick drop in tandem with equities Wednesday.      George Clayton, partner at Cryptanalysis Capital, maintains that the average cryptocurrency holder is a risk-oriented trader and that quantitative strategies kept bitcoin’s price near at $10,400 in the days leading up to Wednesday’s decline.      “If volumes are low, traders and algorithms are in charge,” Clayton said. “This last move down was on pretty low volume and coincided with the sell-off in stocks.”      Momentum in the crypto market had been absent this week prior to bitcoin’s rise Thursday, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the digital assets prime broker Bequant. “There has been a distinct lack of aggressive liquidations and the actual bitcoin futures curve has been flat for much of the month,” he said.      Liquidation volume in September on derivatives exchange BitMEX has fallen. Liquidations, the crypto equivalent of margin calls, often exacerbate price movements as long or short traders have their positions wiped out.      Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at crypto brokerage Koine, says he still has some concerns that investors will quickly sell off crypto should traditional markets take another nosedive. “Risks are still to the downside,” he said.      Read More: Strengthening US Dollar Could Bring Further Downside for Bitcoin      Bitcoin has performed poorly compared to equities thus far in September, down 10.7% while the S&P 500 is in the red 7.9%. Major stock indexes in Europe and Asia are also treading below 0% month-to-date.      Bequant’s Vinokourov points to decentralized finance, or DeFi, as contributing to the bitcoin market’s lack of overall momentum. “It appears that leverage flow has already been sucked out and quietly exited or transitioned to other parts of the crypto ecosystem, namely DeFi,” he said.      Despite this, Vinokourov sees positive sentiment towards bitcoin’s use in DeFi-based yield generation to eke out profits in slow market cycles. “The use of bitcoin on the Ethereum network remains on a strong uptrend, with over 100,000 BTC now locked,” he noted.    Ether options hedging DeFi    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $346 and climbing 5.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Uniswap Users Have Claimed $560M-Worth of UNI Tokens in a Week      The ether options market for October expiration seems to favor the cryptocurrency being priced below $360.

Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, said this market behavior signals smart investors are likely hedged on DeFi’s risks.      “This is a protective premium against DeFi total value locked; a lot of people have ETH locked up in pools,” he said. “The larger players definitely are hedged, plus this can make offering DeFi structured products a lot easier [such as one with a] USD-yield with protective puts against the pool.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the green Thursday.

42384768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIfR,1600977013,Startup Aleo Wants to Help You Use the Internet Without Sacrificing Data Privacy,"Privacy tech company Aleo has launched a data privacy-oriented blockchain and developer kit to make writing zero-knowledge proofs in web applications easy and scalable.      The startup is releasing its first round of software tools to let developers write private applications for the web using a new programming language called Leo, as well as integrate these tools into pre-existing browsers’ functions.      “I think it's become very clear that the internet is broken,” said Aleo co-founder Howard Wu on a phone call. “As users of the internet, we give up our personal data in exchange for services from providers. This model is really outdated. It's an antiquated one. For us, the goal is to provide a new type of model where this incentive can be aligned for both sides.”    Zero-knowledge proofs    Aleo leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic technique that allows two parties on the internet, such as an app and a user, to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to this information.      If you think about it in the context of logging into a website for example, it would verify who you are without sharing info such as your password, geolocation data or other information that can be used to suss out additional details about yourself that you aren’t aware you might be giving up.      See also: Zcash’s Halo Breakthrough Is a Big Deal – Not Just For Cryptocurrencies      “The idea is that we can provide user interface (UI) components and frameworks that look just like traditional web applications,” said Wu. “But when you click on something, it does some magic under the hood, and makes executing ZKPs much easier, happening within your browser. We will provide a UI toolkit, a UI framework that lets web developers build it into existing web applications.”    Aleo’s development toolkit    Aleo’s initial release is made up of four different components.      There is the Aleo Studio, the first integrated development environment (IDE) for writing privacy-focused, zero-knowledge applications. An IDE is a holistic environment for developers to write computer programs.      The Aleo Package Manager is focused on letting developers manage and store data packages. Integrated with Aleo Studio, the package manager makes it easier for developers to organize and share their work.      SnarkOS is Aleo’s decentralized operating system for private web applications and the first implementation of the Aleo protocol.      “It runs a blockchain and it supports all sorts of applications,” said Wu. “So it’s very similar to ones that people know and love on Ethereum. The idea for us is to use snarkOS as the foundation or the backbone of this entire system. So snarkOS is meant to checkpoint, verify and store data in state.”      See also: Privacy Startup Nym Will Pay You in Bitcoin to Run Its Mixnet      As users interact with the web, they're making transactions such as payments, inputting their data, or interacting with games through applications, all of which involve state transitions, or the ways that data moves throughout the internet. Private app integrations with Aleo can address all of these phases, meaning the data privacy functionality isn’t negated at any one point.      The last part of Aleo’s developer kit is the “Aleo Testnet I,” a testnet on snarkOS that allows developers to write and deploy applications.      Developers must build programs on the Aleo blockchain to use the kit, as Aleo is the foundation for everything else developers want to build and integrate with. The focus is on establishing a strong and private core, so that users are able to choose whether they want their data to be public or not.      The whole goal, however, is for developers to integrate existing apps with Aleo.

Addressing shifting attitudes around data privacy    According to a recent report from AI-powered fraud detection company Sift, if a company inadvertently exposes a customer's data, whether it’s the companies fault or not, 56% of survey respondents said they’d stop using the site altogether.      “The idea here is to provide an ecosystem that is robust enough to give you alternative options and I think that’s a model that’s far more far more cohesive for both companies and consumers,” said Wu.

It is unclear at press time whether the approval is for the fund’s previously disclosed purchase of shares in the cryptocurrency exchange or for a new purchase.    The VC giant’s $2 billion fund, Andreessen Horowitz LSV Fund I, L.P, received antitrust clearance from the FTC in a filing dated Sept. 22 involving “Coinbase Global, Inc.”  Given that Coinbase’s $8 billion valuation would represent nearly half of a16z’s $16.6 billionhttps://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Common/crd_iapd_Brochure.aspx?BRCHR_VRSN_ID=635056 assets under management, it’s extremely unlikely the clearance is for an outright purchase.  a16z most recently participated in Coinbase’s $300 million Series E in October 2018. Its first investment in the crypto exchange came in 2013’s Series B, a round it led.  Since a16z already has a stake in Coinbase, it’s likely the FTC clearance is for the firm’s previously disclosed purchases of Coinbase shares, or for a purchase of additional shares. The exchange is reportedly considering going public.  A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed that “Coinbase Global” is the firm’s parent entity but would not comment further. A spokesperson from a16z declined to comment on the record.  Coinbase has had close ties with a16z since at least 2013. The exchange added a16z chief Marc Andreessen as a board observer in August.

42384765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIbf,1600964323,ConsenSys-Incubated Startup Releases In-Browser Atomic Swap Wallet for DeFi,"On Thursday, ConsenSys-incubated startup Liquality released a new wallet that lets you atomically swap digital assets directly from your browser.      The Liquality Atomic Swap Wallet can act as a trustless alternative to current methods of porting cryptocurrencies into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space due to the peer-to-peer (P2P) nature of atomic swaps, Liquality co-founder Thessy Mehrain told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      The wallet interacts similarly to cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask, but with an entirely different end-game: swapping assets trustlessly.      “It’s called a chain abstraction layer, which basically is a way of making different blockchains talk the same language and interact,” Liquality co-founder Simon Lapscher said.      Liquality’s wallet leans on atomic swaps and hashed time locked contracts (HTLC), a cryptographic escrow scheme that allows two parties to swap assets without trusting the other party. HTLCs are also the foundation of Bitcoin’s second-layer payment scheme, the Lighting Network.    Atomic swaps: an alternative to asset wrapping    Notably, atomic swaps let investors hold onto their private keys throughout the entire exchanging process.      Mehrain and Lapscher believe these swaps can act as a trustless alternative for DeFi investors looking to bring value from one blockchain to another. To date, over $1.1 billion worth of bitcoin has been tokenized on Ethereum.      Yet, investors have increasingly relied on private firms to bring value from other blockchains to Ethereum’s DeFi markets.

The startup makes revenue acting as market maker for swaps, Lapscher said.

42384770,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIhx,1600963924,A New Era of Media Begins With Tokenization,"Media on the incumbent web is in crisis. It turns out that paying publishers for clicks, endless loops of “content” and ads, all served on platforms far beyond their maximum-viable scale is ideal for misinformation, disinformation and the decay of trust.      The solution, according to various media innovation prognosticators, is the “passion economy.” The argument goes that since anyone can create content now, it follows that the lumbering media institutions of the past will be unbundled and replaced with a swarm of individuals: Smart, sharp, upstart newsletter writers, podcasters and maybe even TikTokkers. Substack will save us… hopefully.    Joon Ian Wong is a member of Seed Club, the social token incubator. He started the Consensus conference in 2015 and has been a reporter at CoinDesk, Quartz and elsewhere. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series about the future of the crypto economy.    But there’s just one problem. The tooling of the legacy web isn’t fit to usher in this new era of publishing. If we believe that first we make our tools, and then they make us – that aphorism so often misattributed to Marshall MacLuhan – we must examine each layer of tooling involved in creating and distributing our stories. This is the media stack, as the polymath provocateur Balaji Srinivasan calls it.      And the media stack as it exists today is found wanting. The most powerful layers of distribution, payment and production remain entangled in oligopolistic platforms where the platform’s owners – not the creators fueling those systems profit the most.      How to cut through those bonds? You guessed it, this is where I make an argument for cryptocurrencies. An open-source, internet-native monetary layer is the makeweight that could tilt value back in favor of writers, broadcasters and other creators, as well as the communities that support them.      This is the notion of the “Renaissance creator,” as Jarrod Dicker of the Washington Post has called it. Every writer is also a publisher. The roles are flattened to optimize for agility and impact. But the model can be taken one step further. Sari Azout, of Level Ventures, argues for a “participatory economy” where fans benefit alongside media creators.      We see an early glimpse of how cryptocurrencies can tie fans and creators together with a preliminary “lean token design” proposed by the Web 3.0 tinkerer and my colleague Brian Flynn. Media creators today can issue their own cryptographic token and design distribution and incentives around it to trigger a virtuous cycle for themselves and their fans. A simple token economics model could help media creators bootstrap funding for new projects, reward early fans and rally communities towards a common goal. In short, communities should be tokenized.      The tools and models for tokenizing these media relationships are being built right now. Collab.land is a system that lets media creators gate a Telegram or Discord chat group so that only fans holding a certain number of tokens are let in; the pseudonymous issuer of the $WHALE token is now amassing a digital art collection that backs his coin, effectively turning it into an index fund of collectibles that anyone can buy; the news title Decrypt allows readers to earn tokenized rewards each time they engage with stories within its app.      See also: Roll Wants to Take Power From YouTube With Cryptos for Content Creators      The possibilities continue: Can volunteer-run, community efforts like meetups avoid a tragedy of the commons by issuing their own tokens to attendees and organizers? Will it ever be possible to bring in non-crypto native fans into a tokenized community? What happens when personal tokens are permissionlessly tacked on to the rest of DeFi’s money Legos?      An ecosystem of startups like Rally and Roll; investors like IDEO CoLab and Variant Fund; and community efforts like the Seed Club incubator for token issuers I’m helping launch are exploring these possibilities.      The promise of tokenizing the relationship between writer and reader, or broadcaster and audience, means that we finally have an alternative to the extractive models of strip-mining attention on the internet.      But these are early days. Just as bitcoin has offered us a decade of permissionless value-transfer over the internet, years more of exploration for more equitable and more creative media products lies ahead of us. And that’s both a challenge and a gift.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/24/a-new-era-of-media-begins-with-tokenization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2c9d810a83a6b2424ce5f3040041b0b1881952a-2048x1270.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIU7,1600963218,A New Bill Proposes to Put US Crypto Exchanges Under a National Framework,"A new bill could bring cryptocurrency exchanges under a single federal framework.      The Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020, introduced Thursday by Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), seeks to create a federal definition of “digital commodity exchanges,” putting them in their own legal category and charging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with oversight.      The bill outlines a new framework for digital currencies, treating them similarly to commodities under the Commodities Exchange Act, which governs that asset class. Under the framework, crypto exchanges would enjoy a federal jurisdiction, allowing them to operate in the entire U.S. rather than applying for 49 different state money transmission licenses. The DCEA also allows for certain types of initial coin offerings.      If passed, the act would streamline a number of disparate cryptocurrency regulations in the U.S., creating legal clarity for token issuers and lowering the barrier to entry for exchanges hoping to operate in a compliant manner.      “The proposed legislation builds on the existing commodity market practices required of Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) to protect customer assets. DCEs would be required to segregate customer assets and hold them in separately regulated entities which are licensed to custody digital assets,” a summary of the bill said.      Conaway is the ranking member on the House Committee on Agriculture, which oversees commodity exchanges in the U.S. The committee’s Senate counterpart, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, oversees the CFTC.      The DCEA wouldn’t create prescriptive rules on how exchanges can comply with the new law. Rather, it would describe the requirements and let the exchanges themselves figure out the best way to meet those requirements.      ""The CEA works through principles-based regulation, laying out high-level principles – 'core principles' – that a regulated entity has to meet,” a committee aide told CoinDesk. “The regulated entity is given flexibility on how to meet those principles, but the CFTC has oversight and can decide if it has met those principles or not. The regulatory regime under the CEA works in large part because it creates a more flexible framework and lets regulated entities be more innovative.""    Federal jurisdiction    The idea of regulating cryptocurrencies under a single, nationwide regime has attracted renewed interest this summer. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors announced earlier this month that it was consolidating its supervision exams for certain crypto exchanges, and there may be plans in the works to streamline the application process for startups to avoid needing more than 50 state and territory licenses in order to operate nationally.      The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal banking regulator, wants to bypass the state-by-state regime entirely, instead creating a national payment charter that would let exchanges operate across state lines.      The DCEA follows the latter path, but shifts crypto assets into a familiar framework and grants the CFTC primary supervisory authority over the space.      If enacted, the bill would preempt the state money transmitter licensing regime entirely.      ""What we’re proposing is first, a simplification of the multi-state money transmitter license regime but, second, a more appropriate regime which addresses all the aspects of the business of operating a trading venue,” Conaway said through a spokesperson.      Read more: CFTC Chair: ‘A Large Part’ of Financial System Could End Up in Blockchain Format      The DCEA would essentially mimic existing regulations around futures commission merchants, creating similar rules around customer fund protection, cybersecurity, capital requirements, public reporting requirements, governance standards, conflict of information reporting and other issues.      ""This should also help to better define the line between [Securities and Exchange Commission] and CFTC jurisdiction: pre-sale agreements will continue to be regulated by the SEC, but there will be less need for continued SEC wariness once the tokens are delivered and the network is live because the CFTC will be picking up the regulatory slack and supervising sales to the public upon network launch,"" said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at industry think tank Coin Center.      State regulators might not have the same authority over order books or matching engines the way federal markets regulators do. In other words, a national regulator like the CFTC might have an easier time finding or stopping wash trading and similarly deceptive practices.      Companies could voluntarily register but would not be required to shift from the state-level regime if they didn’t want to.      ""If a company has gone through the work of getting individual state money transmitter licenses and it likes the regime it is operating under, we’re not going to require that it give those up and come into a federal regime,” the aide said. “But, if it does come into a federal regime, with regulations which cover more aspects of its business, it will have the opportunity to innovate and serve customers with more complex products.""    Token offerings    Perhaps the more daring aspect of the DCEA is a carve-out for token creation and sales. At present, initial coin offerings fall under the SEC's remit. The federal securities regulator has treated almost all such token sales as securities sales, either bringing enforcement actions against unregistered offerings or allowing registered sales.      Under the DCEA, companies would be able to raise funds by selling tokens to investors, and remain subject to the SEC during this period. However, if the companies then deliver a token which meets the definition of a digital commodity under the new bill, “transactions involving that asset would be subject to the regulatory regime provided in the DCEA,” the document said.      Read more: DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      The bill also provides for token presales. This restricts the initial trading or secondary market sales of the tokens to either individuals who could have participated in the original securities sales or under specific conditions.      This changes if and when a regulated exchange believes the token cannot be easily manipulated and lists it for public trading.      The summary likened the process to the one existing designated contract markets follow when listing new derivatives contracts, but noted it will depend on the specific purpose of a digital commodity.      The bill is unlikely to pass before the upcoming election, but with its introduction, the general public can begin providing feedback or suggestions on how to improve it for a future Congressional term.      ""The introduction of this bill in this Congress is an important step in a process that is likely to play out more fully when the new Congress convenes in January,"" Van Valkenburgh said. ""At that point we expect to see the bill re-introduced which would then allow for the process including possibly hearings and then committee consideration.""

42384773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIlj,1600962851,Bitcoin Options Open Interest Hits Record High in Expiry Week,"Open interest in bitcoin options has risen to new record highs this week. But the market will witness $1 billion in notional value expiring Friday, which could trigger heightened volatility.    A record $2.14 billion worth of options contracts were open on Tuesday, up nearly 53% from the multi-month low open interest of $1.14 billion back on Aug. 28, according to data source Skew.  As of Wednesday, open interest was $2.03 billion.  The previous record high of $2.11 billion was reached on July 30.  Options are derivative contracts, which give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined rate on or before a specific date. A call option gives its owner the right to buy and a put option gives its owner the right to sell.  Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, contributed 75% or $1.6 billion of the total open interest of $2.11 billion on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the CME, which is considered synonymous with institutional activity, accounted for 13% of the total open positions.  While open interest has risen to new record highs, trading volumes have remained mostly steady in the $100 million to $200 million range throughout the month.  ""A trend higher in open interest amidst a backdrop of steady volume indicates the concentration of risk behind a specific theme/trade,"" said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5. ""That's not necessarily a bad thing but shows where the market conviction is coalescing.""  Monthly expiry  At press time, there were 89,100 options contracts with a notional value of over $1 billion set to expire on Friday across major exchanges – Deribit, CME, Bakkt, OKEx, LedgerX – according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  Some experts foresee the big expiry adding volatility to the spot price.  Traders often hedge exposure on loss-making options positions ahead of expiries, putting upward or downward pressure on prices in the spot market.  ""The theory is that the maximum pain point (which is very hard to know or evaluate) of the market will trigger delta hedging of those expired options,"" Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk.  The maximum pain point is the price at which option buyers would lose the most money and option writers or sellers would profit the most.  Large institutions are generally net sellers of options and gain from pinning the spot price at the maximum pain point. Depending on the size of the market, they may try to push the spot price ahead of expiry, causing volatility.  However, bitcoin's options market is quite small compared to the spot market. Hence, the expiry may not have any impact on the spot price.  Bitcoin's options market saw a total trading volume of roughly $160 million on Wednesday. That's just 0.8% of the spot market volume of $20 billion, according to data source CoinGecko.  ""We have seen it too many times in the past that just nothing happened on a big expiry,"" Heusser said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/24/bitcoin-options-open-interest-hits-record-high-in-expiry-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dad9090c8dc79a8f4365160447bff68c11f30e7b-1920x1273.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Decentralized governance MakerDAO will not compensate victims of March 12’s “Black Thursday” flash crash that left some of the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s investors out $8.33 million, according to a vote that closed Tuesday. Large MKR holders dominated the vote as only 38 unique votes (8.74% of MKR holders) were cast, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports. In March, market making bots exploited a flaw and were able to buy ETH at near-$0 prices, as the entire crypto market tanked, thereby liquidating many collateral positions. Investors lobbied the community for partial compensation denominated in the platform’s MKR governance token. The Maker community had initially voted in early April to refund sunken investors.      Data markets Taking cues for DeFi, Ocean Protocol has teamed with Balancer Labs to create the first automated market maker (AMM) for data. “Our goal is to unlock this data economy with data marketplaces, connecting the buyers and sellers of data. These can be individual humans, families, small companies, large companies, cities, nations, etcetera,” Ocean founder Trent McConaghy said. The decentralized market approach aims to make pricing data easier, by allowing anyone to discover, price and trade using a variety of cryptos like Ocean’s native token (OCEAN) or other cryptos like ether (ETH) or dai (DAI).      Global south JBS, the biggest meat packer globally by sales, plans to use blockchain technology to stem deforestation caused by cattle suppliers in the Amazon. The Brazilian company will monitor all of its meat suppliers on a blockchain system by 2025, saying current monitoring efforts enable its suppliers further down the chain to potentially ""launder"" meat from cattle raised on illegally cleared ground. Meanwhile, to the north, Venezuela has legalized crypto mining but only under the direction of the government. All mining activities must be registered and carried out through an official National Digital Mining Pool, a centralized pool that will keep the government in control of disbursing profits. This comes as Iran continues to clamp down on crypto mining – despite its citizens’ growing reliance on the borderless technology.

For early bitcoin investors, like those at the maverick hedge fund Pantera Capital, heart pounding returns may seem like a thing of the past.      Founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead, Pantera was originally focused on global macro hedge fund investments. A decade later, the firm switched its focus exclusively to the world of crypto.      This appears to have been an auspicious move. Its first bitcoin fund, opened in late-2013, has rallied by over 10,000%.      Such returns on BTC now appear beyond the pale. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has sunk close to half a billion dollars of his firm’s treasury into bitcoin, not as a venture investment, but as a means to beat inflation. He told CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson that MicroStrategy is prepared to hold BTC for the next 100 years.      Paul Brodsky, a former partner at Pantera Capital, also appears skeptical that bitcoin will see another breakout rally. He believes that bitcoin is too easily accessible, its derivatives market too established and its network too energy-demanding to offer massive investor upside.      Though he hasn’t soured on crypto broadly.      Brodsky is opening a new hedge fund, called PostModern Partners, aimed at volatility plays across cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Set to open in 2021 the fund is seeking high-risk, high-return blockchain investment opportunities, CoinDesk’s Nelson reports.      While it isn’t clear precisely what assets might have Brodsky’s eye, PostModern’s organizational documents reads, “we believe there are greater scaling opportunities in Proof-of-Stake tokens.”    Market intel    Dollar-led doldrums The U.S. dollar is showing signs of life and a continued breakout could weigh over bitcoin, which surged amid the greenback’s sharp sell-off this summer. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $10,320 – up nearly 2% from Wednesday's low of $10,140. The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has broken above its two-month-long range of 92.00-94.00. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports the dollar and bitcoin (like other assets including gold, and increasingly stocks) are inversely correlated, meaning a rise in one might cause a downside in the other.    Tech pod    Version 2 Parity Technologies has released the second version of its blockchain building kit, Substrate 2.0, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports. The new release gives developers additional tools to customize a blockchain “precisely for your application or business logic,” a blog post reads. Parity Technologies is the developer of the Polkadot blockchain with ambitions for developing a Web 3.0, undergirded by a meshing of various blockchains running on a “tooling kit” called Substrate. The latest code update includes 70 composable “modules” for blockchain architects to build and modules to bring off-chain data onto the blockchain.

42384759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIVN,1600961397,How Small Business Can Achieve 'Economies of Scale' by 2030,"At EY, we believe that by 2030, more than half of all new business contracts will be blockchain-based smart contracts. While this change will utterly transform the administrative complexity of managing business operations, we also think it will transform the competitive landscape of the global market economy as well. Combining blockchain with other internet-based technologies and digital systems, we see a transformation coming where smaller companies, already nimble, will be nearly as efficient and scalable as their larger competitors.      In July of 1994, Yahoo, one of the very internet search engines, got started. And suddenly, the internet, a technology platform that was designed to drive security through decentralization, kicked off into a thirty year wave of digital centralization and consolidation. The economies of scale that turned software platforms into monopolies accelerated with the addition of internet-based network effects. The big got bigger and the small struggled to survive.    Paul Brody is a Principal and Global Blockchain Leader at EY. This post from CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series about the future of the crypto economy.    If that wave of centralization crested in 2020, by 2030, it will start to recede, and quickly, thanks to the power of re-decentralization coming from blockchain technology. The new business environment is one where economies of scale are less powerful, as blockchain-based software lets smaller companies collaborate together as efficiently as larger enterprises.      So let’s imagine what things might how all this might come together by 2030:      On Wednesday afternoon, Feb. 6, 2030, at around 4:15 p.m., a washing machine in Sheffield, England is going to break. As the machine enters the spin cycle, vibration from the rotating drum rattles the connecting water drainage hose loose, and water from the spin-drying clothes starts to leak out onto the bottom of the washer housing and through the ventilation holes on the floor of the laundry room.      The leaking water is going to trigger a water sensor in the washing machine, which will shut off the spin cycle and text the owner about a fault. From there, the owner arranges a service call, selects a locally available repair person, and goes on with their day. Two days later, on Friday afternoon, a new drainage hose was installed. The owner will never see a bill for this service, as their machine is under an extended warranty.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Would Use DeFi, if It Weren’t so Public      If this scenario strikes you as unremarkable, that’s because it is. All of this is possible today, though not yet available. We will see the first really integrated smart offerings like this very soon, but those offerings will be faking their integration. Behind the scenes, there will be a mess of non-digital paperwork, and even then, it will be accessible to only the largest, and most sophisticated enterprises. And for all of that, you will need a clumsy installation and registration process as well, including a frustrating three-way dance between your smartphone, the washing machine, and the home internet router.      What should be easy and sensible today is in fact very difficult. Retailers are not fully integrated with manufacturers and they, in turn, are not fully integrated with repair service providers. Behind the scenes, people are busy emailing each other spreadsheets to keep track of everything. To make those integrations properly digital usually requires the creation of a customized network service and a big one-time investment. By 2030, blockchain technology will have changed all of that.      You see, in 2030 this smart digital washing machine that breaks won’t be from a major brand. It will be from a startup that designs customized washing machines for smaller, older homes. Most commercially available machines don’t fit neatly in the slightly odd-side spaces under the stairwells or closets in British homes that were built before electricity was widely available. Buyers will snap photos of their unique spaces and the company’s smart algorithm with move around components to create something that actually fits. Installers will even 3D print special connectors and parts on-site to finish the installation. Homeowners looking to make the best use of their quirky spaces will snap them up.    The new business environment is one where economies of scale are less powerful, as blockchain-based software lets smaller companies collaborate.    Today, such a proposition would be staggeringly expensive, but thanks to the internet and blockchain technology, this startup can offer their highly localized and customized products for only a small premium over mass-market offerings. Some of the magic comes from digital manufacturing technologies, like 3D printing and digital machine tools, that keep the costs of one-off parts and components not much higher than mass production. Another chunk of the magic comes from blockchain-based tokenization and smart contracts that make it possible to administer a network of partners without building a massive IT organization.      Combining blockchain innovations through the internet with clever software, and you have a tiny startup that can build customized appliances and get them installed and serviced anywhere. Digital directories of 3D printing service providers, warehousing services, and installation and service companies make it possible to quickly identify local partners in nearly every part of the world. Standardized smart contracts, in turn, make it possible to set up and administer those business relationships quickly and run them without constant supervision.      None of this gets rid of the hard work of real innovation, but that often isn’t what keeps startups from scaling. The clever algorithms that adjust the washing machine size and components may be unique, but the cost of managing 200 different installers and partners and negotiating with each one is what will sink any such startup today.      Today, it costs about $50-$100 for a company to issue a bill manually and get paid, and around $100-$200,000 to install a customized system-to-system integration, but once that is in place, the per-transaction cost goes nearly to zero. It’s easy to see how, by the time a startup has found a manufacturing, warehouse, delivery, and service partner, they could have spent more money administering their business network than on the cost of actually making and selling the product. If you don’t have large volumes, you cannot compete.      Blockchain-based smart contracts mean that once a relationship has been established and the credentials of a partner verified, much of the administration (bills, payments, warranty checks, and scheduling) can be handled in a touch-free manner, and without the need to create a customized digital network. And startups need only create one major integration at first – from their own operations into the public Ethereum blockchain.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Need Third Parties for Oracles to Work      As a result by 2030, the future of commerce may start to look, in some ways, strikingly similar to the past. If you go back to the 1950s, hundreds of companies made televisions, for example. Wikipedia keeps a list of hundreds of companies that were once in the TV business, from Motorola to Mivar to English Electric. Nearly all of them are gone, driven out by standardization and economies of scale. Today, the top-10 TV makers represent 75% of the market.      Globalization and scale haven’t been all bad. A black-and-white TV with a 12 inch screen cost approximately $2,500 in current prices back in 1950. Today, you can get a 60 inch, UHD 4K flatscreen for about $500. Oh, and the modern TV also shows color pictures.      By 2030, we will be back on a path towards a proliferation of smaller brands, but instead of regional brands and high prices, we will have hundreds of global brands and competitive pricing. Old homes with unique spaces are not just a feature of English towns, they are, in fact, a global phenomenon. Tiny startups that cater to unique markets will become niche global brands, each offering highly customized products to a small market, but independent of geographic location.      If there is a final thought worth having, it is that there are many things that can go wrong with this rose-tinted vision of the future. We thought the internet was going to make democracy and freedom inevitable everywhere. It didn’t. Time and again, technology revolutions have failed to produce the benefits we hoped for, and this time is probably no exception, though it should not stop us from trying one more time.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/24/how-small-business-can-achieve-economies-of-scale-by-2030,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11c0c1ba42dc4b0502560d630717d64f5f4d9107-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The partnership will bring BitGo’s wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) into the Tron ecosystem as a TRC-20 token. (The token is backed roughly 1:1 by bitcoin deposited by users at BitGo Trust, a qualified custodian in the U.S.)      The introduction of WBTC – plus a newly-created wrapped ether token from BitGo – is meant to help fuel the incipient decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Tron. WBTC has been a key driver in the growth of DeFi on Ethereum. (Note: BitGo has nothing to do with the existing wrapped ether (WETH) token used widely in Ethereum DeFi applications.)      Tron founder Sun said the move will help sidestep surging transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain.      “Everyone may now use their BTC/ETH to enjoy all the benefits of the Tron DeFi ecosystem without the high gas fees on Ethereum,” Sun said in a statement.      Read more: Supply of Tokenized Bitcoin on Ethereum Now Tops $1.1B: Here’s Why      Sun also pointed to a service similar to Uniswap on Tron called JustSwap, which he said has achieved $100 million 24-hour volumes since it was launched about a month ago.      BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said WBTC has seen tremendous growth in concert with DeFi’s boom.      “Our new strategic alliance with Tron creates even greater opportunities for users to expand to other chains and tokenize their BTC on the Tron dApp ecosystem while transacting at a lower cost and faster speed,” Belshe said in a statement.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/24/bitgo-is-bringing-defi-friendly-wrapped-bitcoin-to-the-tron-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/556ff8c60684b06cef61d503074efb3a0ed7781b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIeB,1600959900,"CoinDesk Reporters Discuss FinCEN Files, Venezuela's Stablecoin Flop and More","From the CoinDesk Global Macro news desk, this is Borderless – a twice-monthly roundup of the most important stories impacting Bitcoin and the crypto sector from around the world. It's created by reporters Nikhilesh De, Anna Baydakova and Daniel Nelson.      For free, early access to Borderless, subscribe to CoinDesk Reports with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, CastBox or direct RSS for your favorite podcast player.      On today’s show: the FinCEN files, AirTM isn’t working in Venezuela the way people hoped and stablecoin regulations are reappearing in the U.S. and Europe.      CoinDesk's inaugural episode of Borderless discusses the FinCEN Files, which showed that not only is a global superpower keeping tabs on thousands of financial transactions, but it doesn't appear to actually be tamping down on the alleged crimes it purportedly wants to halt using this data. What's more, many of these transaction records aren't suspicious. Should the government hold onto this personal and financial data for 20 years?      Stablecoin regulations are resurging in both Europe and the U.S., with government officials in both regions publishing new guidance discussing how stablecoins might be regulated and how issuers can interact with banks. The European Union wants stablecoin issuers to abide by strict ""e-money"" rules, according to draft legislation leaked last week. Meanwhile, a federal banking regulator in the U.S. says nationally regulated banks can offer stablecoin issuers financial services.      This applies specifically to hosted wallets, meaning wallets that are controlled by a trusted (regulated) third party. Wallets where users directly control the keys do not fall into the guidance. For its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission warns that some of these digital assets may or may not look like securities, and recommends that issuers contact it prior to launching a new token.      Another stablecoin story down in Venezuela has us rethinking whether the country’s purported crypto economy is really as robust as the headlines make you think. CoinDesk contributor Jose Rafael Pena Gholam writes that opposition leader Juan Guaido’s attempted airdrop of $19 million in stablecoins to Venezuela's “health heroes” has fallen flat.      The money came from funds seized by U.S authorities. Guaido was hoping to use it to back pay thousands of health workers with a $100 bonus for three months of work, but the drop has been hampered by the Maduro regime and tech hiccups.

42384771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIjD,1600957296,Uniswap Users Have Claimed $560M Worth of UNI Tokens in a Week,"Uniswap users have snapped up much of the supply of free UNI tokens in the first week.    Data from Dune Analytics on Thursday shows that eligible participants in the DeFi project have claimed approximately 78% of the existing UNI supply – just under 117 million tokens.  At the current $4.78 market price, that means just under $560 million worth of the tokens have been claimed.  Last Wednesday, Uniswap announced it was giving away 400 of its newly minted tokens to each address that had used its protocol prior to September.  The decentralized trading platform said it will ultimately issue and distribute 4 billion UNI tokens to the community over the next four years.  So far, 190,000 eligible wallet addresses have claimed their tokens; nearly 140,000 did so the day after the announcement.  The volume of claimants has fallen over the past week, with 1,557 addresses on Wednesday and just under 500 addresses so far today.  Designed to power on-chain decision making, UNI has made the headlines almost every day since it first started trading last week.  At an initial price of $2.97 on Wednesday, UNI had surged to over $7.80 by Friday.  Following a market slide that took the price down to $3.80 by Tuesday, UNI has since recovered and has currently edged past the $4.80 mark, according to CoinGecko data.

42384767,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIZ9,1600956042,Climate Startup Nori Raises $4M to Solve Carbon Market Double-Spending,"Climate-change startup Nori has been funded to build a blockchain-based market for carbon credits that will start by paying farmers to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.      Announced Thursday, the Seattle-based startup closed a $4 million funding round which included Placeholder, North Island Ventures and Tenacious Ventures. A large, unnamed agribusiness also invested in the round, according to Nori CEO Paul Gambill.      The firm, which was part of 2019’s Techstars Sustainability program, previously closed a $1.3 million pre-seed round in December.      The funds will be used to expand the team and onboard more carbon-removal suppliers (i.e. farmers), the company said in a statement, laying the foundations for an industrial-grade carbon marketplace.      The same way that blockchains prevent the double-spending of digital coins, so too can they solve the double-counting problem in the carbon offset market. The first generation of carbon markets, though well-intentioned, led to the selling of carbon credits over and over again, while really it’s the same ton of CO2 being traded every time.      Read more: Carbon Credits Have a Double-Spend Problem. This Microsoft-Backed Project Is Trying to Fix It      “The idea is to build a carbon-removal marketplace that makes it really simple for people to pay for carbon dioxide that’s being removed from the atmosphere in a verifiable way,” Gambill said in an interview.    Green blockchain    Step one for Nori is about working with farmers, who can remove carbon from the air and “sequester” it in the soil by adopting more sustainable farming practices. This part of the Nori project is not really blockchain-intensive, said Gambill.      “It’s more of a traditional software and data challenge to really improve the way in which we’re quantifying and verifying the carbon,” he said, adding:    “Right now we’re able to sell carbon for cash, so no tokens are involved. The next stage of the roadmap will involve building out a forward market in addition to our spot market, and integrating a token into that. And so the forward market will be an auction-based concept. And that’s where price discovery will happen.”    The idea is that when a farmer removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and then that gets verified, they are issued a Nori Carbon Removal Tonne (NRT) electronic certificate stored on the blockchain, which they can then sell to buyers in exchange for one nori (NORI) token. One token is always worth one ton, but the price of the token will fluctuate based on supply and demand, Gambill explained.      Read more: Ocean Protocol and Balancer Want to Do for Data What Uniswap Did for Coins      “The true price discovery is happening is on the nori token, and then the carbon is immediately retired, which is carbon-market language meaning that the buyer owns it forever,” said Gambill. (The carbon-removal certificate takes the form of an Ethereum-based non-fungible token that is non-transferable.)      In other words, Nori is transparently separating the trading part, so that the carbon is retired immediately, and then a token, representing one future ton of CO2 removed, is traded as a commodity.      The funding is one of Placeholder’s first investments that bridges the gap between crypto and the “real-world,” said Chris Burniske, a partner at the blockchain-focused VC firm.      “With Nori, farmers can adopt regenerative practices like planting cover crops in empty fields over the winter and get paid for doing so, as the same process that rejuvenates the soil also sequesters carbon,” Burniske said in a statement, adding:    “In pursuit of an elegant solution to a tough problem, Nori has employed a host of cutting-edge technologies, including blockchains, to account for and audit the carbon-backed assets produced by farmers.”",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/24/climate-startup-nori-raises-4m-to-solve-carbon-market-double-spending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af7d8ea14a03102f1f74ea789d04af2a05bb9ab0-1500x1003.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIRb,1600954435,"Read CoinDesk’s New, Expanded Ethics Policy","As part of our ongoing efforts to be maximally transparent and accountable to the community we serve, CoinDesk has substantially updated and expanded its ethics policy.      I encourage all readers to take a close look at the new page, which lays out, in greater detail than ever before, a number of important items, including:    Our relationship with parent company Digital Currency Group and the editorial independence policy, mutually agreed upon by both firms, that ensures we cover the industry without fear or favor  Our revised guidelines about when and how we disclose our ownership by DCG in articles  Our journalistic standards, including guidelines on issuing corrections and using anonymous (and pseudonymous) sources  CoinDesk’s company-wide policy on personal investing, and related disclosure requirements for the journalists on staff  Our social media guidelines  Our advertising policy (you may notice that ads have returned to the site, but they’ll never again be the intrusive and seedy kind of programmatic advertising that made our staff cringe along with readers during the 2017 boom)    Some of the practices laid out on the new page have been in place for a long time. For example, our journalists have been required to disclose crypto holdings in their profile pages since before I joined in 2017, and the company-wide trading and investing policy has been in effect for well over two years. Other policies have been revised and iterated over the years.    How the sausage is made    When I started at CoinDesk, our policy was to include an in-text disclosure of our ownership each and every time an article mentioned DCG or any of its investments. Over time, checking every startup name against a list of 100-plus firms in DCG’s portfolio before publishing any article became unwieldy for a 24-hour news operation.      Later, we replaced the in-text requirement with a built-in disclosure of our ownership that automatically appeared at the bottom of every article, whether or not the piece mentioned DCG or one of its holdings. While this guaranteed disclosures, the placement was not conspicuous and fed a misperception in some corners that we were trying to hide something.      Compounding that problem, for a time after we rebooted our website in late 2019 the standard disclosure required users to click to see it. Luckily, this design feature was short-lived.    Tough customers    None of this helped us when covering and serving the crypto community, who are an instinctually distrustful bunch – as well they should be. In this day and age, no media outlet can demand the benefit of the doubt from its audience anymore, but especially not when reporting on a technology whose very raison d’etre is mistrust of intermediaries and authorities.      Returning to the disclosure question, in 2020 we have adopted a policy I believe combines the best of both worlds. As explained on the new ethics page, the standard disclosure still automatically appears at the bottom of every story and is again plainly visible, no clicks required. Better yet, it now contains links to the full list of DCG’s portfolio companies, digital assets and wholly owned subsidiaries (which you’ll also find in an appendix to the new ethics page).      On top of that, we once again require in-text disclosures of our ownership in any article mentioning DCG or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries (Genesis, Grayscale, Foundry or Luno). We have also added such disclosures in other appropriate instances, such as a lengthy piece on Decentraland (an asset in which DCG is a significant investor). It’s a belt-and-suspenders approach designed to be workable in practice.      Again, I invite everyone to review CoinDesk’s full, expanded ethics page – we welcome reader feedback as we strive to inform, educate and serve the crypto and blockchain community with the utmost integrity.

42384758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlIQL,1600952856,EU Proposes Full Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies,"The European Union's executive branch has laid out plans to create a comprehensive framework for digital assets.    Confirming CoinDesk's report last week, the European Commission on Thursday proposed legislation that will turn cryptocurrencies into a regulated financial instrument.  Dubbed the ""Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets"" (MiCA), the bill will provide clarity on what constitutes a ""crypto asset,"" as well as definitions for different token subcategories.  It will provide rules on digital asset custody and capital requirements, while also stipulating what the relationship between the token issuer and the token holder will be, including laying out a procedure for investors to file complaints against projects.  Officials also floated the idea of a regulatory sandbox initiative for companies developing infrastructure for the trading and settlement of digital assets.  If passed, the MiCA would turn the EU into the largest and most significant regulated space for cryptocurrencies anywhere in the world.  The framework will be applicable in all 27 member states, giving regulated crypto companies passport rights across the entire bloc.  Following on from concerns expressed last week by five European finance ministers, the commission has also warned that stablecoin issuers will likely be subject to more stringent regulatory checks.

42384742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGNH,1600952018,Russian Ministry Wants Citizens to Report Their Crypto Wallet Details: Report,"Russia's Ministry of Finance is seeking strict measures regarding cryptocurrency use in the country, including the reporting of wallet balances and large transactions to the tax authorities.    According to Russian news source RBK, the ministry has prepared a package of amendments to Russia's law on digital assets.  The law, signed by President Vladimir Putin in July, takes effect in January 2021.  The Ministry of Finance has previously tried to introduce harsh restrictions for crypto transactions in the country.  In this latest attempt, it wants crypto users to have to report their digital wallet address, transaction history and balance if the wallet receives more than 100,000 Russian rubles (around $1,300) during one year, according to RBK.  Failure to report a wallet that received over $13,000 in one year would lead to a punishment of up to three years in prison.  Using crypto in financial crimes would also be considered an aggravating circumstance in court and could lead to more severe punishment.  Further, over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency dealers would be obliged to report all transactions involving rubles and Russian IP addresses to the tax authorities, RBK wrote.  The previous draft bill on digital assets sought harsh punishment for facilitating crypto transactions in Russia, including prison time of up to seven years.  The most draconian parts of that proposal did not become law, following criticism from the cryptocurrency community and the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economic Development.

42384756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGcN,1600951919,"First Mover: Federal Reserve, Congress Play Game of Chicken Over Stimulus as Market Lurches","It's becoming clear just how hooked investors have become on dollars injected into the economy by the U.S. government and Federal Reserve.      Just take a look at what happened on Wall Street this week as the Republican-led U.S. Senate shifted its focus to confirming a new Supreme Court justice, and away from the passage of a new fiscal-stimulus package. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 2.4% Wednesday, wiping out gains for the year and putting the U.S. stocks gauge on track for its worst month since March.      “The market continues to reevaluate its previously very optimistic stance on the status of global risks out there,” Ben Randol, senior FX strategist at BofA Securities in New York, told Reuters.      The simplest takeaway is that the lack of fresh stimulus is negative for economic growth, and therefore bad for corporate earnings and stocks. The diminishing chances for a new package prompted Ian Sheperdson, chief economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, to slash his forecast for fourth-quarter U.S. growth to 4% from 10%. Without more money injected into the economy, consumer spending will be lower than previously expected.      ""It's just not possible for consumption to continue at its current pace in the absence of a much bigger income-replacement program,"" Shepherdson wrote.      Bitcoin, which recently has shown a high correlation with stocks, has sold off this week as well, showing that most investors still prefer cash in a flight to safety.      ""Crypto has been unable to shake its recent correlation to the S&P,"" Micah Erstling, a trader at the cryptocurrency firm GSR, wrote in an emailed comment.      The cryptocurrency is still sitting on a 42% gain for the year, and indeed digital assets were ranked this week by Bloomberg News as the world's top-performing investment category. As headlines trumpeting new stock-market highs in the mainstream financial press start to fade, bitcoin might get a second look from investors on the prowl for an alternative to traditional assets.      One clear theme is just how unified top Federal Reserve officials are in harping on Congress to provide a new fiscal-stimulus package, even as such efforts prove increasingly futile.      A Bloomberg article on Wednesday recounted how not just Fed Chair Jerome Powell but a ""parade"" of top officials from the central bank's Chicago, Boston and Cleveland branches used public appearances to clamor for more fiscal aid.      The upshot is that any new stimulus in the near term is going to have to come from the Fed itself, which already has cut interest rates close to zero and is currently printing about $120 billion a month to buy U.S. Treasuries and government-backed mortgages.      Mary Daly, who heads the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said Wednesday that central-bank economists won't know it's time to start tightening monetary policy until higher inflation actually shows up.      The Federal Reserve has already printed about $3 trillion of new money this year, expanding its balance sheet by about three-quarters, which has encouraged cryptocurrency analysts in their assertions that bitcoin stands to benefit as an inflation hedge.      A new round of stimulus to stanch the losses on Wall Street might bolster demand for inflation hedges, which might get bitcoin prices going up again. That could help cement crypto's lead in the 2020 asset-class rankings, which in turn would probably lure in even more buyers.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin has bounced up to $10,400 from Wednesday's low of $10,150. The cryptocurrency, however, may have a tough time maintaining the bullish momentum with the U.S. dollar showing signs of life.      The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, is trading at two-month highs above 94.      Bitcoin had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the dollar's sell-off this summer.      ""Bitcoin will likely follow further downside together with precious metals given the DXY breakout,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and funds, told CoinDesk.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Strengthening US Dollar Could Bring Further Downside for Bitcoin    Token Watch    Uniswap (UNI): Decentralized exchange token's new governance tokens defy DeFi sell-off.

42384749,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGXL,1600949352,Ex-Pantera Partner's New Crypto Fund Is 'Not for the Faint of Heart',"Paul Brodsky, a former partner at storied crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, has left to launch a hedge fund aimed at volatility plays across cryptocurrencies and traditional assets.      Brodsky’s new fund, PostModern Partners, will open in 2021 with a focus on high-risk, high-return blockchain investment opportunities, according to a source familiar with the matter. It will be open only to accredited investors – and only those, the source said, who can stomach potentially heavy market dips.      The fund’s launch comes three years after Brodsky joined Pantera. Leaning on Brodsky’s traditional portfolio management chops, CEO Dan Morehead had tapped the former derivatives trader in October 2017 to lead his crypto VC’s investor outreach.      But even back then, regulatory filings indicate that Brodsky, a founder and chief of multiple funds, was laying the groundwork for an eventual pivot back to asset management. He first registered PostModern Partners GP LLC with FINRA in early 2017.      The PostModern that Brodsky is now preparing to lead will trade in highly liquid asset classes of all kinds with a special focus on high-growth, volatile cryptocurrencies, according to organizational documents obtained by CoinDesk.      That means shying away from a bitcoin-heavy portfolio, the documents said. PostModern asserted that bitcoin is too easily accessible, its derivatives market too established and its network too energy-demanding to offer massive investor upside.      “We believe there are greater scaling opportunities in Proof-of-Stake tokens,” the documents state – while leaving open the possibility of investing in bitcoin for near-term upside.      Pantera’s bitcoin fund rallied by over 10,000% since its late-2013 launch. PostModern’s refusal to embrace bitcoin indicates Brodsky is on the hunt for the eye-popping returns that bitcoin can no longer deliver.      Such a calculus on the market-leading crypto clashes with the long-on-bitcoin mantra sloshing around some corners of Wall Street. Michael Saylor, whose publicly traded business intelligence firm MicroStrategy put its $425 million treasury reserve into BTC this month, publicly touts the sprawling network as a strength.      But PostModern is playing for capital accumulation rather than capital preservation, the source said. It’s for accredited investors looking to place risky bets on volatile crypto assets with the alluring yet hardly assured potential of extremely high returns.      “It’s not for the faint of heart,” the source said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/24/ex-pantera-partners-new-crypto-fund-is-not-for-the-faint-of-heart,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb2f1c5a1e9f5597f14688235fecdee1a614cc1f-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, Daimler is building the platform in partnership with Ontology, an open-source blockchain specializing in data and digital identity.  The first product to emerge out of the partnership, ""Welcome Home,"" will be demonstrated at Dalmier’s virtual live event at the Startup Autobahn event today and is built to service users who’d like to transfer preferences from one auto to another.  “Preferences in a car are settings such as lighting, the seat, the music players,” said Gloria Wu, chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships at Ontology. She also said a user, “could basically use a ‘Welcome Home’ application to access another car rental service provider within the app without having to do all the registration.”  The platform built under the Daimler and Ontology partnership would allow a user to both port identification information and in-car preferences from one region to the other, given that the rental service or leasing agent is registered with the platform.  The statement added that the ‘Welcome Home’ solution is the first product on the MoveX platform. Being built in partnership by the Daimler Mobility AG Blockchain Factory and Ontology, the MoveX platform is targeted at solving barriers to adoption around “user roaming, bundling, and sharing.”  “‘Welcome Home’ combines mobility with social networking,” said Harry Behrens, head of Blockchain Factory at Daimler Mobility, in the emailed statement. The statement also said that the platform is not limited to in-car experiences and can also include smart devices.  “What did you eat, what kind of itineraries you had, you can save it to one of your profiles, and share it with a friend, assuming that she's also using ‘Welcome Home,’” Wu said.

42384753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGZr,1600946780,Strengthening US Dollar Could Bring Further Downside for Bitcoin,"The U.S. dollar is showing signs of life and a continued breakout could weigh over bitcoin, which surged amid the greenback's sharp sell-off this summer.    The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $10,320 – up nearly 2% from Wednesday's low of $10,140, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  However, the relief rally could be short-lived, as the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has broken above its two-month-long range of 92.00–94.00.  ""Bitcoin will likely follow further downside together with precious metals given the DXY breakout,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and funds, told CoinDesk.  ""Bitcoin, like gold, is inversely correlated to the dollar,"" Max Keiser, a broadcaster and finance analyst tweeted on Tuesday.  Indeed, bitcoin and the dollar index have moved in opposite directions since March, with the apparent inverse correlation becoming more noticeable since mid-July.  The DXY is looking north following Wednesday's breakout and is currently hovering near 94.40.  ""The dollar has been very heavy since March on the back of Federal Reserve's easing, and we expect to see some profit-taking [in dollar shorts] across the board,"" said Darius Sit, CEO of Singapore-based QCP Capital.  As such, there's a risk bitcoin may fall to the psychological support of $10,000.  Gold has already declined to a two-month low of $1,860, tracking the dollar strength.  ""A break below $10,000 support could mean a further drop to $8,800,"" Stack's Dibb said.  However, on-chain analyst Willy Woo doesn't foresee a mega bump. ""While I've heard talk of bearishness down to even [$7,000], I don't see fundamentals supporting this as a likely event,"" he tweeted Wednesday.  If stock markets rebound sharply, the haven demand for the U.S. dollar will likely weaken, potentially allowing a notable recovery in bitcoin and gold.

42384744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGOX,1600945233,Bitcoin in Africa: FastBitcoins Partners With Flexepin to Expand Global Footprint,"FastBitcoins has partnered with prepaid voucher giant Flexepin to increase its global footprint, while at the same time accessing mobile money providers in 14 countries in Africa, where demand for crypto is growing.      Announced Thursday, the deal with Flexepin (a subsidiary of ASX-listed payments company Novatti) expands FastBitcoins’ coverage to some 20,000 point-of-sale locations in Australia where Flexepin is based, as well as across Canada and Europe.      Flexepin caters to users who want to make online payments without using credit or debit cards. But in addition to improving the security and privacy of online spending, the service is about enabling many of the unbanked population worldwide to purchase goods and services using an alternate method of payment, according to the company’s website.      “The big one for me, personally, is we can accept mobile money payments in 14 countries in Africa,” said FastBitcoins CEO Danny Brewster. “So, users in places like Kenya or Uganda can use M-Pesa or MTN Pay on their mobile phone to buy a Flexepin voucher which is then redeemed for Bitcoin via us. We charge only 4.5%. The best price equivalent on, say, Paxful, charges 40%. That’s all through this Flexepin deal.”      There is an interesting shift in position here. A few years back, when M-Pesa was establishing a veritable monopoly in Kenya, its owners Vodafone and Safaricom were very resistant to any interoperability with Bitcoin on the grounds of anti-money laundering (AML) concerns.      “Today, the regulatory and AML environment surrounding Bitcoin is a far throw from what it was in 2013 and 2014,” said Brewster. “Also, our agreement with a publicly traded company like Flexepin provides leverage with all sorts of partnerships.”      M-Pesa did not return requests for comment by press time.      Read more: Where FATF Crypto Compliance Gets Interesting: Africa      Rather like mobile money itself, which grew out of a hack where users traded mobile minutes as a form of cash, pre-paid cards and gift cards have become popular in Africa, where they can be exchanged for bitcoin on peer-to-peer platforms like Paxful. The redemption codes of cards purchased in places like Canada, for example, can be sent to relatives in Africa who then exchange these for bitcoin.      The likes of LocalBitcoins have banned gift cards because of the regulatory challenges, but Paxful says it has gone to some effort to continue supporting this channel since the vast majority of these transactions are legitimate and offer more access to the financial system for unbanked users.      Asked if Flexepin vouchers could be used in a similar way by African users of FastBitcoins, Brewster said:      “As long as the recipient has their account open with us, they can do that.”      For its part, London-based FastBitcoins has an application underway for registration with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority in line with Europe’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and has also signed up with government body AUSTRAC (Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre).      Read more: Identity Startup Notabene Launches Exchange Tool for FATF Travel Rule Compliance      Brewster explained that FastBitcoins’ approval involves some know-your-customer (KYC) checks, such as providing a driver’s license or passport, while doing the best to preserve customer privacy.      “The voucher is just the mechanism for transferring fiat to our platform, the AML/KYC is no different to any other exchange platform as per the regulatory environment of the countries we operate within,” he said. “As a company, we take those responsibilities seriously but also balance that with the onus placed onto the customer and their experience when using our service to ensure they only provide what is absolutely necessary.”      Since 2016, Flexepin has become the leader in prepaid vouchers used at cryptocurrency exchanges globally, Flexepin operations manager Effie Dimitropoulos said in a statement.      “Flexepin is happy to be a new funding method on the FastBitcoins site,” she said. “Every day, consumers around the world use Flexepin to purchase their first cryptocurrency and many more use it to add to their holdings. Flexepin is continually expanding its distribution network with thousands of online and offline locations being added regularly.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/24/bitcoin-in-africa-fastbitcoins-partners-with-flexepin-to-expand-global-footprint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f3e981e3bfc727b444f4e39a6e7e0b5ba00c9a2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Terry Angelos, Visa's global fintech lead told Forbes cryptocurrency companies had shown a ""significant interest"" in working with the company.  Although Angelos didn't mention any by name, he said most wanted to plug themselves into the payment processor's network, which has over 60 million merchants in more than 200 countries – the largest of its kind in the world.  Visa is an increasingly prevalent force in the digital asset space.  Having first dabbled with a few proof of concepts in 2015, the payment processor has joined (and left) the Libra Association, invested in custodial provider Anchorage and become a member of the Digital Chamber of Commerce – a blockchain advocacy group in the U.S.  Exchange Coinbase has been Visa's most prominent crypto partner. After initially collaborating on a branded payment card, Coinbase became a principal member earlier this year, giving it the right to issue Visa cards to other crypto companies.  But Angelos said Visa had already ""on-boarded"" another 25 crypto companies that were ""at various stages of development.""  Some have been through its fast track program, he continued, an initiative that gives selected startups a leg up through guidance and support as well as providing them with access to its payments network.  Just this month, the crypto lending platform Cred joined the fast track and can now use Visa's network to send interest payments directly to users' bank accounts.  Asked if Coinbase was likely to remain the only crypto company to be a Visa principle member, Angelos said ""we have some that are potentially in the queue.""

JBS said currently it checks that all direct suppliers do not clear forest without authorization, but others further down the chain may ""launder"" meat from cattle raised on illegally cleared ground.  The announcement comes as the company seeks to counter criticism of the meat industry in the region, which is said to be responsible for extensive forest clearances to make way for cattle pastures.  JBS also announced it would set up a fund worth 1 billion reals (around $179 million) fund to support social and economic development in the Amazon.  The company aims to provide 25% of the funding (250 million reals) itself over the first five years, with other parties expected to join the initiative and match its donation.  Another 25% may follow later if third-party support is strong enough, JBS' global CEO, Gilberto Tomazoni, told Reuters.  Despite years of campaigning from environmentalists, Amazon rainforest destruction is still soaring.  Reuters said an area the size of Lebanon was cleared in 2019 – the most in over 10 years.

42384747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGSJ,1600930841,Ocean Protocol and Balancer Want to Do for Data What Uniswap Did for Coins,"Some tricks of the trade employed by today’s booming decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are being used for a completely new paradigm: decentralized data marketplaces.      Announced Thursday, blockchain-based data monetization startup Ocean Protocol is teaming up with Balancer Labs to create the first automated market maker (AMM) for data.      Ocean Protocol is about helping people and businesses unlock data and monetize it, spreading the benefits of data and AI beyond the handful of organizations that hoard, control and get rich from it. Creating efficient data marketplaces is really the lynchpin of this, according to Ocean founder Trent McConaghy. Thus the collaboration with Balancer.      “Many people have tried to build data marketplaces in the past, but have been held back by issues of privacy and control. With blockchain and compute-to-data, Ocean is addressing this,” McConaghy said in an interview. “So our goal is to unlock this data economy with data marketplaces, connecting the buyers and sellers of data. These can be individual humans, families, small companies, large companies, cities, nations, etc.”      Ethereum-based Ocean creates data tokens, which can represent a particular dataset – be it an individual’s DNA or something much larger and more valuable, like all of Daimler’s self-driving car data. The tokens act as an on-ramp to the data, which is stored elsewhere. The second part of the puzzle is establishing a marketplace where this tokenized data can be discovered, priced and traded using Ocean’s native token (OCEAN) or other cryptos like ether (ETH) or dai (DAI).      Pricing data is hard. Now, with the third version of Ocean, McConaghy has concluded AMMs like Uniswap do the job best.      Read more: Mercedes Maker Daimler Tests Blockchain for Supply-Chain Data Sharing      Unlike an auction-based approach, AMMs continue to price throughout the asset’s lifetime. And unlike order books, they don’t need a lot of upfront liquidity and a double coincidence of wants. As such, AMMs – which have been instrumental in DeFi’s $13 billion ascent – can be thought of as robots that are always ready to buy or sell.      The Balancer pool functions as a “self-balancing weighted portfolio and price sensor,” which means it behaves like an index fund – if a given asset out- or under-performs, it is respectively sold or bought to keep its value share of the total portfolio constant. But this is done in a decentralized manner without human intervention.      This is basically what DeFi application Uniswap does, but Balancer has the added advantage of allowing non-equal weights among tokens in the pool (e.g. 90/10 vs. 50/50). That means someone with lots of data tokens can offer these without having to tie-up a great deal of Ocean tokens or other cryptos.    Ocean: ‘Liquidity mining for the people’    McConaghy pointed to a trend where people are launching things on AMMs, and in the case of an Ocean data-token pool he has coined the term “initial data offering” or IDO.      “Our community has been really loving this term and using it a lot internally,” McConaghy said, adding:    “Basically it’s an example of liquidity mining for the people. Right now when people want to do liquidity mining on Balancer or other tools, they need to have assets. This works well for the whales, and it works even for some medium-sized folks, but the small guys are completely priced out because of gas prices. But we all have assets, as in our data assets; I have location data or whatever, and I’m going to start putting it up there and see what happens as the price gets automatically discovered.”    Read more: Following COMP’s Surge, DeFi Platform Balancer Begins Distribution of BAL Tokens      On the subject of the high gas costs associated with deploying pools on Balancer, the Ocean partnership has led to a useful tweak of Balancer pool contracts to use the ERC-1167 proxy pattern to reduce those costs.      “The idea of having millions of different tokens and pools wasn’t viable with today’s gas prices on Ethereum, so it’s very nice the way we have extended Balancer to make it cheap for the creation of new data pools,” said Balancer Labs CEO Fernando Martinelli, adding:    “It doesn’t cost a lot for someone to just put up their location data or their DNA data. It’s great because it’s shown us the need to create more efficient markets – something that’s going to be addressed in our version two.”",POSITIVE,BAL,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/24/ocean-protocol-and-balancer-want-to-do-for-data-what-uniswap-did-for-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56ccba90048ba54e838cbf3bf06c5b0cba35cd84-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
