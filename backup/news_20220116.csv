42375501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8XAn,1642376256,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Continues Its Sluggishness Amid Darkening Economic Signs,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin's price hovered above $43,000 as investors looked for signs the cryptocurrency's price had hit a bottom point.  Technician’s take: Support remains intact, which could keep BTC buyers active over the short term.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,210 -0.1%  Ether (ETH): $3,359 +0.5%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,662 +.08%  DJIA: $35,911 -0.5%  Nasdaq: $14,893 +0.5%  Gold: $1,817 -0.2%  Market moves  The crypto price slump continues.  Bitcoin spent much of its weekend roughly where it started it, hovering just over $43,000. That level was a little better than at the start of the week, but well off its highs just two months ago. Trading was light as investors looked for signs that bitcoin's downward spiral has reached an end point and that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is ready to enter a new bull cycle. Ether and most other altcoins followed a similar sluggish pattern.  The weekend saw bitcoin in a choppy zone with no clear trend,"" BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale told CoinDesk. ""Volumes have also been lacking and bitcoin's failure to cross $45,000 is a sign of its inherent weakness. When bitcoin experiences a sharp drop, investors and traders are looking for aggressive buying to confirm a bottom and reversal; however, we haven't seen much of that since Bitcoin dropped below $40,000 briefly.""  The crypto market's struggles come as the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus rages and many businesses struggle with supply chain issues and the increasing cost of raw materials. Last Wednesday the U.S. central bank also reported that inflation had hit 7%, a 40-year high.  DiPasquale does not see bitcoin's price dramatically rising in the days ahead, although he noted that the next options expiry on Jan. 28 could could serve as a ""possible trigger"" to send Bitcoin toward $50,000.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $42K; Resistance at $45K-$47K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are attempting to reverse a two month-long downtrend. The cryptocurrency declined by roughly 30% from an all-time high near $69,000 in November, and now technical indicators suggest the sell-off is starting to stabilize.  BTC was up about 3% over the past week, although the recent decline in trading volume suggests large price swings could occur.  Support is seen around the $40,000 price level, which could limit pullbacks over the short term. Still, upside could be limited toward the $45,000-$47,000 resistance zone over the weekend.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels, similar to what occurred in late September, which preceded a price rally. This time, however, upside momentum is starting to wane on weekly and monthly charts, which lowers the chance of significant buying.

42411558,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoXp,1642351800,Derivatives Data Shows Softening Crypto Enthusiasm,"Several months ago, investors facing FOMO – the fear of missing out – worried that the ship had sailed when it came to crypto. Now, however, while that ship may have left the harbor, the wind is out of its sails as it floats directionless for the time being. Perhaps it’s because of upcoming Fed tightening; enthusiasm seems to have dampened. That sentiment is backed up by some market data showing market activity has fallen and that could take prices with it.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  1. Funding rates have gone negative.  Rates from several major exchanges compiled by analytics firm CryptoQuant show that the cost of borrowing to buy crypto on leverage has fallen to the point where it’s slightly negative. That implies that demand for money to make leveraged bets has taken a hit. Traders aren’t in any rush to add to their positions.  2. Open interest (OI) in bitcoin futures is down slightly since the last week of December.  It’s currently $16 billion, according to data site Skew.com, down from just shy of $19 billion around Christmastime. During bitcoin’s November peak, open interest was roughly $26 billion.  3. Ether futures also have seen declining open interest.  Since its own November peak of $13 billion, open interest for the smaller ether futures market is currently around $8 billion.  4. Options open interest on bitcoin and ether are down to where they were in early October.  OI for bitcoin options is now at $7 billion and $5 billion for ether. Back in December, those figures were around north of $10 billion and $7 billion, respectively.  Some of the falloff can be attributed to year-end bets taken throughout the course of 2021. While current OIs are still significantly larger for both cryptocurrencies than where they were last year, they are still roughly where things were in October, before the big run-up in prices.  5. Implied volatilities on bitcoin are falling precipitously.  Implied vols, which are calculated off options premiums and gauge the market’s view of future risk, are down to levels not seen since October 2020. To be sure, regular levels in crypto implied volatilities would signal alarm and panic in the equity market, but since the second week of December, crypto’s implied vols have drifted down. In the past couple of days, that drop has accelerated. One-month at-the-money implied vols are now at 60%; they had been hovering in the 80% range since the summer. When demand for options falls, implied volatilities fall with it.  6. Ether’s implied vols are also down.  Now at 69%, implied volatilities on one-month at-the-money options on ETH had been around the 100% level since June. It has been over a year since they were regularly below 70%.  The list goes on and on.  Of course, this doesn’t mean muted markets can last forever, but in the coming days or weeks, one shouldn’t be surprised if prices drift south.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/16/derivatives-data-show-softening-crypto-enthusiasm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6caf1ac52bbc7876911dc0d7369b04e4e3de3878-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
