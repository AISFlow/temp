The network also ranked as the second largest revenue-generating crypto project on Monday. Following this, some market watchers shared their predictions regarding the token’s recent performance. Some highlighted that a recent rejection of a key level could plunge the prince to $150 before it’s ready for a massive rally. Analysts Set New ATH Targets For Solana On Tuesday, crypto trader Yoddha forecasted his price target for Solana this cycle based on its performance over the years. According to his chart, SOL saw a 96% drop from its all-time high (ATH) during the last bearish rally. After the retrace, the token saw a 343-day accumulation period. Related Reading: Render Continues To Flash Red In All Timeframes – What’s Going On? This period was followed by a 600% surge to the yearly high above $200 seen in March. According to Yhodda, SOL is in an accumulation zone again, moving within a falling wedge pattern. The chart suggests to the trader that the token’s price could skyrocket over 455% in the coming months, hitting the $1,000 mark this bullish run. Meanwhile, analyst Inmortal Crypto highlighted that SOL rejected the weekly opening (WO) price of $190, which traded above last week’s WO. To the trader, if SOL’s price doesn’t hold the $180 support level, it could potentially drop to retest the monthly opening (MO) of $147 before resuming its climb. Poseidon, another pseudonym analyst, shared a similar opinion. He stated that investors “will have a chance to buy SOL below $150 again” before it rallies to $500. According to Crypto Jelle, SOL broke out of “the re-accumulation structure” this month. Per the chart, a similar structure preceded the price expansion that led to Solana’s ATH. Jelle considers that Solana “looks ripe to push higher” and will enter a “mania-like stage” once it gets moving. He also suggested that SOL will be scaling out aggressively” after it breaks above its ATH. Nonetheless, he set the token’s final target to $600, disagreeing with those expecting a new ATH above $1,000. “People expecting $1000+ are in for a rude awakening I’m afraid,” said the analyst. SOL Price Stays Still Despite Bullish News On Tuesday, Solana and its community received bullish news after the US SEC amended its complaint in the lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance. The regulator filed an amendment regarding its “Third Party Crypto Asset Securities” complaint, stating that there is no imperative need for the court to rule on “the sufficiency of the allegations regarding those tokens at this juncture.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Go Up 680% This Week?

Despite the news, SOL’s price didn’t register any notable performance, hovering between the $177 and $183 price range.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} dropped to $64,500 from around the $66,500 level where it traded following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, and was down more than 2% over the past 24 hours. Altcoin majors including ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}}, Avalanche's AVAX {{AVAX}} and Cardano {{ADA}} also declined, while Ripple's XRP saved some of the gains from earlier today. The broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index was 0.8% lower than 24 hours ago.  The sell-off happened as the New York Times reported that Iran's leaders ordered retaliation against Israel for killing Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, increasing risks of a broader conflict in the region.  Earlier today, the Fed left benchmark interest rates unchanged and gave little indication that a widely expected rate cut in September is guaranteed. Fed's Powell said that while no decisions have been made about a September cut, the ""broad sense is that we're moving closer"" to reducing rates.  While digital assets suffered losses, most traditional asset classes climbed higher during the day. The 10-year U.S. bond yields fell 10 basis points, while gold was up 1.5% to $2,450, slightly below its record-highs and WTI crude oil prices surged 5%. Equities also soared during the day, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index rebounding 3% and the S&P 500 closing the session 2.2% higher, led by chipmaker giant Nvidia's (NVDA) 12% gains.  The differing performances between asset classes could be due to traders' positioning prior to the Fed meeting, Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, said in an emailed note.  ""Equities may have been slightly under-owned after the recent drawdown, while bitcoin is coming off a strong period with solid inflows, whereas gold rallied after a period of weakness,"" he said.  ""Bigger picture, the combination of Fed rate cuts, bipartisan focus on crypto policy issues, and the prospect of a second Trump Administration may advocate for a weaker U.S. dollar should be considered very positive for bitcoin,"" he concluded.

XRP Sharks & Whales Have Witnessed Their Count Go Up Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the shark and whale wallets have registered a notable jump over the past five weeks. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the number of addresses that currently belong to a given wallet group. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins Seeing Less Interest Than Bitcoin: Data The addresses are put into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance right now. Investors who own between 1 and 10 XRP, for example, fall inside the 1 to 10 coins group. In the context of the current discussion, the 10,000+ coins group is of interest. The cutoff for this cohort converts to around $6,500 at the current exchange rate. This amount in itself isn’t high, but the upper range of the group stretches to infinity, so it should also include heavyweight investors like sharks and whales. The sharks and whales are considered key investors in the market, so their behavior can be to keep an eye on, as it may end up affecting the cryptocurrency’s price. Naturally, the whales are the more influential of the two, due to their larger size. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Supply Distribution for the 10,000+ coins cohort over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Supply Distribution for this wallet group has observed a rapid increase recently. More specifically, around 2,390 addresses of this size have popped up on the network in just the past five weeks. This would suggest that entities like the sharks and whales have been busy accumulating the cryptocurrency. Following the latest increase, the indicator’s value has reached the 279,400 mark, which is the highest that it has been in about six months. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator’s value had been observing a downtrend earlier in the year, alongside which, the asset’s price had also been riding bearish momentum. The indicator reached a bottom in April, which is around when the asset’s drawdown also slowed down. And since the recent uptrend in the Supply Distribution of the sharks and whales has appeared, the XRP price has also felt the return of bullish winds. “The correlation between these wallets and XRP’s market value has been undeniable throughout 2024,” notes Santiment. Related Reading: Minimal Bitcoin On-Chain Resistance Ahead: Price Set For New ATH? Given the pattern, this indicator should be monitored in the near future, as a continued rise in it could spell a bullish outcome for the cryptocurrency.

31767278,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632517,1722454216,This PEPE Holder Cohort Is The Reason Price Is Struggling To Reclaim $0.00002,"PEPE bulls have encountered challenges in their attempts to push up the meme cryptocurrency’s price over the past week. Notably, PEPE has experienced a decline of approximately 4% in the last 24 hours alone, with a more substantial drop of 6.5% over the course of the past seven days. The selling sentiment surrounding PEPE has increased significantly since the middle of July. Throughout this period, the meme coin has struggled to break above resistance at $0.0000126, facing repeated failures each time it approached this critical price point. A deeper analysis of market behavior reveals that this prevailing selling sentiment can be largely attributed to a notable shift in the composition of PEPE investors. There has been a strong increase in the number of short-term holders, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in long-term holders. Jump In Short-Term Holders According to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, short-term PEPE holders have increased noticeably in the past 30 days. This observation is derived from IntoTheBlock’s Balance by Time Held metric, which follows the variation over time of the balance in wallet addresses and groups them into holders, cruisers, and traders, depending on their average time. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Show Interest In Cardano, Triggering 300% Surge Notably, this metric shows that the balance in the wallets belonging to the trader cohort has increased by over 31% in the past 30 days. This is interesting because the trader cohort is made up of those who generally hold their assets for less than a month before selling. The behavior of this cohort suggests a shift towards more speculative trading, as these investors are looking to capitalize on quick market movements rather than committing to long-term. On the other hand, the balance in cruiser addresses have fallen by 6.24% in the same timeframe. Cruisers are those addresses that hold their tokens for between one to twelve months before selling. This decrease in the balance of cruisers suggests many long-term holders have been selling their PEPE tokens in the past 30 days. What Does This Mean For PEPE? The influx of short-term holders is creating a more volatile environment for PEPE. Currently, they account for 20% of the entire circulating supply of PEPE. As these investors tend to buy and sell quickly based on market fluctuations, they are more likely to create frequent price swings. This increased volatility is making it challenging for PEPE to maintain a stable upward trajectory. Related Reading: Analyst Says ETH Price Will Struggle As Spot Ethereum ETFs Expectations Crash At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.00001135. Although the crypto is still up by 42% from a 2-month low of $0.000007975 recorded on July 5, the upward trajectory has been stalled by the activity of short-term holders. PEPE now finds itself trading around a two-week significant support of $0.00001133. A bounce above this price point would enable PEPE to resume its uptrend and continue approaching the $0.00002 threshold.

42390683,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5URR,1722452650,The Protocol: Bitcoin Gets Political as U.S. Government Ponders Airdrops,"Last week's Bitcoin Nashville conference dominated crypto news headlines – largely due to former U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign speech (and lots of promises) as well as Senator Cynthia Lummis's call for a national ""Bitcoin Strategic Reserve."" (We've got the draft legislation.)  We wandered around the event for four days while scrambling to cover all the news, and took lots of photos. Bitcoin LARP, anyone?  In this issue:  California puts car titles on the Avalanche blockchain  Stablecoin issuer Circle's pre-IPO shares trade at $5B+ valuation in private markets  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Irys, Arweave, Router Protocol, Blackbird, Theoriq, Dash  $13M of blockchain project fundraisings: Hyperbolic, Roxom, Kuru  CoinDesk 20 returns for July: XRP soars, RNDR tumbles  Network news  U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, with a copy of her bitcoin reserve bill at the Bitcoin Nashville conference on Saturday, July 27. (Danny Nelson/CoinDesk)  RESERVING JUDGMENT: Details are scarce on last weekend's Republican calls for a ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile."" Trump, the party's presidential nominee, suggested using the government's existing holdings of just over 200,000 BTC as the ""core"" of a new reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming proposed to go even further, possibly building it up to 1 million BTC, or about 5% of the cryptocurrency's maximum supply.  Lummis said onstage at Bitcoin Nashville that the plan might eventually ""eliminate"" the national debt – $27 trillion, at last check! – but didn't really explain how that would work, ""apart from the basic math that swelling U.S. government wealth would generally equate with reduced indebtedness,"" as CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton put it. Questions arose on social media over whether the government even had rights to keep the existing hoard, mostly obtained through seizures and forfeitures associated with criminal activity; in other words, any stolen assets might at some point need to be returned to the rightful owners.  There was also considerable speculation over what exactly Lummis meant when she said, ""We will convert excess reserves at our 12 Federal Reserve banks into bitcoin over five years,"" or if the economics or legality of anything remotely close to that were even feasible. George Selgin, an economist with the conservative Cato Institute, wrote on X that he had ""heard from someone in Senator Lummis's office"" who clarified that the plan was actually just to buy about $64 billion worth of bitcoin using balances created from simply revaluing the gold in Fort Knox. CoinDesk obtained a draft bill that does indeed outline a plan to revalue Federal Reserve gold certificates, while setting aside $6 billion from any net earnings the U.S. central bank might generate over the next five fiscal years – with the giant caveat that, lately, the Fed has been losing money at a record pace.  Fun fact: The draft bill offers a provision for how the U.S. government would handle any airdropped tokens.  Taking things from a high level, the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board concluded that ""if cryptocurrencies really are a libertarian vehicle to invest free from political vagaries, then they should trade on their own without government help.""  The entire debate took a sharp turn once reports emerged that U.S. authorities had just moved about $2 billion worth of the government's bitcoin associated with the Silk Road website seizures. U.S. officials wouldn't really explain the move, and cautioned against reading too much into it, but theories quickly emerged on social media that the Biden administration and its allies were rushing to ""dump"" the government's stash before the Trump administration ever gets control.  ALSO:  California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) digitized 42 million of car titles on the Avalanche (AVAX) network as part of development to modernize the state's title transfer process with software development firm Oxhead Alpha.  WazirX, the Indian crypto exchange hit by a $230 million hack, drew fire on social media as customers criticized a proposed workout plan appearing to incentivize them to keep their funds on the platform, CoinDesk's Amitoj Singh reported.  Financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald will open a bitcoin financing business, CEO Howard Lutnick said at the Nashville Bitcoin conference on Saturday.  Circle Internet Financial’s privately held stock is trading in the secondary market at a price implying a $5 billion to $5.25 billion valuation for the stablecoin issuer ahead of a planned initial public offering, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Click here for the full story by Bradley Keoun  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  The Irys project will feature both permanent data storage as well as ""term data ledgers"" (Irys)  1. Irys, describing itself as aprovenance layer for data storage, announced it will transition to a new layer-1 network with the launch of a ""programmatic datachain that combines data storage and execution."" According to the team: ""Through IrysVM, which is fully EVM-compatible, developers can leverage efficient and cost-effective real-time data manipulation. This approach simplifies development processes, enhances scalability and ensures stable and predictable pricing for transactions and data storage. Ecosystem partners building on Irys’ Layer 1 include Berachain, Eclipse, Injective Labs, Livepeer, Linea, IoTeX, Gateway.fm, Lit Protocol, NodeKit, Olas, Snapchain, BeraLand and YEET."" Founded in 2021, Irys began its journey as Bundlr, a scaling solution for permanent data storage on Arweave.  2. Router Protocol, a project built using Cosmos blockchain technology, said Tuesday that it launched the main network of a new blockchain designed for ""chain abstraction"" –a concept embraced by many protocols with the aim of making the user experience of blockchains more seamless. To make the new Router Chain more seamless in cross-chain interactions, it will focus on reducing “the development barriers and streamlining the development of dApps that can seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains and aggregate liquidity from any chain,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  3. Blackbird Labs, the restaurant loyalty platform founded by Resy and Eater co-founder Ben Leventhal, announced the launch of Blackbird Pay, a system that will allow participating restaurants to accept payment in cryptocurrency. The new payments platform expands on Blackbird's mission by allowing consumers to pay for their meals using the $FLY cryptocurrency. The tokens can be earned as loyalty points for dining at participating restaurants or purchased in the Blackbird app using Coinbase's popular USDC stablecoin.  4. The developers of Theoriq, described as an ""AI agent base layer,"" published its official project whitepaper, introducing the key aspects of its network and outlining its benefits for the development of advanced AI agent collectives. According to the team: ""Using a decentralized model, Theoriq will leverage smart contracts to ensure transparency and accountability while also maintaining flexibility to ensure its network will continue to adapt as AI continues to advance in complexity.""  5. Dash, a payments-focused cryptocurrency project, is launching the Evolution upgrade on July 29, described as ""its most major upgrade"" to date, with a new sidechain. According to the team, the project aims ""to enable indexed decentralized storage and decentralized applications."" According to a blog post, the sidechain ""is run by EvoNodes, which also secures the legacy Dash chain. It uses the account-based model (single addresses have balances), as opposed to the UTXO model (multiple addresses hold coins, or UTXOs) of the Core chain. It uses a heavily-modified derivative of Tendermint (Cosmos) consensus called Tenderdash. The main differences between Tenderdash and Tendermint are that Dash’s version has same-block execution, meaning you don’t have to wait for the next block after writing new data in order to query it.""  Money Center  Fundraisings  Hyperbolic CEO Jasper Zhang and co-founder Yuchen Jin (Hyperbolic)  Hyperbolic, one of the newer contenders in the race to apply blockchain tech to artificial intelligence, has raised $7 million in a seed funding round led by Polychain Capital and Lightspeed Faction. Hyperbolic's first product will be an AI inference service that allows builders to use state-of-the-art AI models ""at a fraction of the cost,"" according to the company.  FIRST REPORTED IN PROTOCOL VILLAGE: Roxom raised $4.3 million in pre-seed funding to launch the first stock, commodities, and futures exchange denominated in Bitcoin. The company was founded by CEO Borja Martel and CTO Nick Damico. Martel was previously a co-founder at LATAM-based crypto exchange Lemon. Roxom's round was led by Kingsway, Draper, and David Marcus, among others. ""Bitcoin native financial markets are an important step for holders to access a wide range of financial services natively. Roxom is an important step in that direction,"" said Marcus.  Kuru, building the first fully on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) on Monad, raised $2 million in a seed round led by investors like Electric Capital, Brevan Howard Digital, CMS Holdings and notable angels like Nomad Labs co-founder Keone Hon, Eugene Chen and Jarry Xiao.

42390675,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5ThH,1722452400,It's a Different Sort of Olympics as Cryptographers Face Off in Polyhedra's 'Proof Arena',"A nice thing about watching Olympic swimming is that it's not too complicated to determine who's the fastest. Everyone dives into the same pool, there's some paddling, and at the end of the final lap, one person touches the wall first.  The same can't be said for blockchains, where engineers are always releasing ever more powerful, speedier systems, and use-cases and transaction types vary from project to project, as do tools and methods for measuring performance. The dilemma extends to designers of cryptographic tools, and the myriad ways of reporting hashes per second.  Such was the backdrop as Polyhedra Network, a team building a crucial blockchain component known as a cryptographic ""prover,"" set out to develop a just-released platform called ""Proof Arena"" that's designed to serve as, well, a proving ground.  Just a few months ago, the Polyhedra team released an open-source zero-knowledge proof system – used in many setups for auxiliary blockchains known as ""layer 2s"" – that was ""nearly 2x faster than alternatives."" But how did they really know?  Eric Vreeland, Polyhedra's chief strategy officer, said the team decided to develop Proof Arena so developers could test various provers in a controlled environment – ""people evaluating the performance of various proof systems for a particular proof generation task.""  ""Proof Arena will allow ZK-proof system creators to compare their systems against others in a clear and scientific manner while ensuring that all controllable variables are held constant,"" according to a press release Wednesday.  Outputs from the testing system include proof generation time, memory peak and setup time, according to Vreeland. Here's what that might look like in a hypothetical scenario:  Builders of the provers can also submit their systems ""for inclusion in the arena,"" Vreeland said.  Initially, the project will be set up to generate benchmarks for Polyhedra's own ""Expander"" ZK-proof system, Polygon's Plonky3, StarkWare's Stwo and Linea's Gnark.  ""The team plans to support all open-source proof systems and will provide benchmarks for frequent ZK tasks like Keccak and Poseidon hash verification run on a variety of machine configurations,"" according to the press release.  That might all sound like gibberish, but for cryptographers, it's what they care about.

The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} edged lower to $66,550, but remained modestly higher over the past 24 hours. U.S. stocks remained sharply higher for the session, the Nasdaq up 2.4% and S&P 500 1.6%.  Dealing with galloping inflation at the time, the Fed's historic run of tighter policy began in early 2022 taking the fed funds rate from 0% to 5.25%-5.50% in the space of less than 18 months. The rate has remained at that level for more than a year as the central bank has been cautious to ease while inflation stubbornly remained well above its 2% target.  Prior to today's meeting, markets had fully anticipated at least 25 basis points in rate cuts by the mid-September meeting, according to CME FedWatch. Looking out further, markets had priced in a near-60% chance of 75 basis points in rate cuts by the Fed's final meeting of 2024 in mid-December.  Speaking at his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said recent readings have given more confidence that inflation is moving back to its 2% target. While no decisions have been made about September, he said, the ""broad sense is that we're moving closer"" to reducing rates.

After sinking below $0.40 in early July, the coin has rebounded sharply, adding 60%. As the coin outperforms leading altcoins like Solana and Ethereum, for example, there could be more room for growth. Is XRP Ready For $150? Analyst Thinks So From the daily chart, XRP is trending above key reaction levels. Notably, the close above $0.55 (now key support) reversed losses posted in mid-April. Additionally, the confirmation of recent gains and the close above $0.62 earlier today could spur demand, extending gains toward $0.74 and eventually $1. Related Reading: Analyst Says ETH Price Will Struggle As Spot Ethereum ETFs Expectations Crash As optimism reigns, one analyst on X thinks the coin is preparing for sharp gains in the coming weeks and months. Sharing a price chart, the analyst said XRP is breaking out from the local resistance and the multi-year resistance trend line. From his analysis, the trader said XRP just broke from a “massive, 2,351 days resisting trend.” The breakout from the bull flag anchored at the swing high, when prices rose to all-time highs of over $3.20, and the swing low, $0.16, when the coin plunged to $0.16 in 2021, is crucial. In the analyst’s estimation, XRP is now preparing for more gains that could propel the coin to $150 for an over “21,000% climb” from spot rates. Settlement Of United States Versus SEC Case Crucial It remains to be seen how prices will behave going forward. However, one of the key drivers of demand in the coming days and weeks will be the outcome of the ongoing case pitting Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite the partial win in July 2023, the regulator wants Ripple to pay a huge penalty of $2 billion. However, things are evolving fast, with Ripple lawyers defending that XRP is not an unregistered security as the regulator alleged. The United States SEC is being accused of regulation by enforcement, forcing crypto innovation elsewhere. During the last Bitcoin conference, former President Donald Trump said if he took over, his administration would fire Gary Gensler, the current head of the Commission. Trump said his plan would be to make America the leader in crypto and even establish a BTC reserve. Related Reading: Render Continues To Flash Red In All Timeframes – What’s Going On?

42390673,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5THd,1722446331,Does the SEC Really Have Jurisdiction Over NFT Art? Two Artists Sue SEC to Get an Answer,"Two artists have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. SEC in a Louisiana court to get a declaratory judgement that would protect their forthcoming NFT projects from regulatory action from the SEC.  They say the SEC has set a concerning precedent of potential regulatory overreach by filing charges against two other NFT art projects.  Two American artists filed suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, seeking a declaratory judgment from a Louisiana court that their forthcoming non-fungible token (NFT) projects would not violate U.S. securities laws.  The scathing complaint, filed in the jurisdiction of the notoriously anti-regulatory state Fifth Circuit, accuses the SEC of using two 2023 enforcement actions against NFT projects – Impact Theory and Stoner Cats – to stake its jurisdictional claim over the entire NFT industry without authorization from Congress.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the four other SEC Commissioners – Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda and Jaime Lizarraga – as well as Eric Bustillo, regional director of the SEC’s office in Miami, Florida are all named as defendants in the suit.  Under Gensler, the complaint argues, the regulatory agency has “taken an extremely expansive view of its own authority in the context of digital assets” and failed to provide clarity to NFT artists about the circumstances in which the offer and sale of NFTs could constitute securities offerings or sales.  And, in sucking NFTs into its regulatory orbit via enforcement actions, the SEC has failed to meaningfully grapple with the potentially far-reaching implications of applying securities laws to art, the complaint alleges.  A representative for the SEC declined to comment on the allegations contained in the lawsuit.  The specter of potential enforcement actions against NFT projects has “unleashed a chilling effect over NFT artists across the [U.S.],” according to the complaint. The plaintiffs in the case, conceptual artist and law professor Brian Frye, and musical artist Jonathan Mann, also known as “Song a Day Mann,” are each holding back a ready-to-go NFT project until a court grants them protection from the “credible threat” of a future investigation or litigation by the SEC, which their lawyers claim would be which would be “economically devastating to [their] artistic endeavors.”  But it’s not just small artists that are impacted by potential threat of SEC action – major companies offering NFT artwork have also struggled with the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding NFTs.  Just one day after Mann and Frye’s suit was filed, American sports betting company DraftKings announced it was shuttering its NFT business, effective immediately, citing “recent legal developments.” DraftKings is currently facing a class action lawsuit from investors claiming that its NFT sales violated securities laws. Last month, Dapper Labs – the company behind the popular digital trading card NBA Top Shot “Moments” – paid $4 million to settle its own class action securities lawsuit.  Concerning regulatory precedent  Frye and Mann’s lawsuit points to two recent SEC enforcement actions against other NFT projects, Impact Theory and Stoner Cats.  In August 2023, the SEC announced charges against and a settlement with Impact Theory for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via their Founder’s Keys NFTs. Prior to its settlement with Impact Theory, the SEC had not issued any formal guidance regarding NFTs or taken any public action against any NFT creators.  As part of its settlement with the SEC, Impact Theory agreed to pay more than $6 million in disgorgement and civil penalties, as well as to destroy all of the remaining Founder’s Keys NFTs in its possession.  “The SEC literally demanded that artists destroy their art, as punishment for violating its unprecedented diktat that art was a security,” lawyers for the plaintiffs argued. “That’s right: the United States federal government demanded that an artist destroy their art, because an agency of the federal government decided that it was being offered or sold contrary to federal law.”  Two SEC commissioners, Pierce and Uyeda, issued a dissent against the SEC’s Impact Theory action, arguing that the NFT sales did not constitute an investment contract and raised larger questions about NFT art that the SEC “should grapple before bringing additional NFT cases.”  But a month later, in September 2023, the SEC announced charges and a settlement with another NFT project: this time, the company behind Stoner Cats, a Mila Kunis-backed animated web series funded by NFT purchases, agreed to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty to the SEC to settle the charges. Like Impact Theory, the company also had to agree to destroy “all Stoner Cats NFTs in [its] possession, custody or control” within 10 days of the order.  Pierce and Uyeda again dissented, writing “Were we to apply the securities laws to physical collectibles the same way we apply them to NFTs, artists’ creativity would wither in the shadow of legal ambiguity…the Commission’s application of securities laws here makes little sense and discourages content creators from exploring ways to harness social networks to create and distribute content.”  In going after Impact Theory and Stoner Cats, plaintiffs argue, the SEC has “sent a message…that it regulates the digital art markets, and perhaps, even the art market as a whole,” thus creating a “precarious situation for artists and innovators” like Frye and Mann.  “Accordingly, Mann and Frye require federal court intervention to be able to offer and sell their prospective art projects without facing an enormously expensive SEC investigation, or an administrative or court action that might require them to—as the Stoner Cats and Impact Theory settlements did—literally destroy their own digital art in order to satisfy the SEC’s wrath.”  According to court documents, Frye has, in the past, reached out to the SEC to request a no-action letter for two of his other NFT projects. He received no response.  A number of other companies and entities have recently filed similar preemptive suits against the SEC, largely within the same circuit. ConsenSys sought injunctive relief to prevent the SEC from suing it and declaring Ethereum a security; the Blockchain Association sued over the SEC's definition of a ""dealer""; a company called Beba and the DeFi Education Fund sued for relief against possible SEC action and a crypto company sued to launch a trading platform called ""Legit.Exchange.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/31/does-the-sec-really-have-jurisdiction-over-nft-art-two-artists-sue-sec-to-get-an-answer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/efff81f625e808c0b6135570d2d1561db9592c43-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390682,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5UHB,1722445987,The Anatomy of a Crypto Bull Market,"Although crypto history is short, with Bitcoin celebrating its 15th birthday this year, we have already experienced three major cycles: 2011-2013, 2015-2017, and 2019-2021. The short cycle time is not surprising given the crypto market trades 24/7, about five times more than the equity market. The 2011-2013 cycle was predominantly about BTC, as ETH launched in 2015. Analyzing the past two cycles reveals patterns that help us understand the anatomy of a crypto bull market. With the market warming up to the U.S. election and improved liquidity outlook, history might rhyme again.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  BTC leads Altcoins into the Rally  In both the 2015-2017 and 2019-2021 cycles, Bitcoin initially led the market surge, establishing confidence and setting the stage for a broader rally. As investor optimism grew, capital flowed into altcoins, driving a broad-based market rally. Altcoins’ market cap peaks often coincided with BTC’s market cap dominance bottom, indicating capital rotation from BTC to alts. Currently, BTC dominance is still climbing from the post-FTX low, suggesting more room for BTC to run before alts catch up.  Altcoins Significantly Outperform in Later Half of the Cycle  In both major cycles, altcoins significantly outperformed Bitcoin after an initial phase where their returns were comparable. This trend reflects investors' increased risk appetite and how reflexive the alts market can be with increased risk capital. In the second half of the 2015-2017 cycle, alts returned 344x versus BTC’s 26x. Similarly, in the second half of the 2019-2021 cycle, alts returned 16x versus BTC’s 5x. We are about halfway through the current cycle post-FTX, with alts slightly lagging behind BTC. This trend suggests a potential altcoin outperformance in the second half.  Macro Economic Influence  Crypto, like other risky assets, is highly correlated with global net liquidity conditions. In the past two cycles, global net liquidity increased by 30-50%. The recent Q2 selloff was partially driven by tightened liquidity conditions. However, as Q2 data confirmed a slowdown in inflation and growth, the trajectory for a Fed rate cut looks favorable.  The market now prices in a more than 95% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 50% at the beginning of Q3. Additionally, crypto policy is becoming central in the U.S. election, with Trump endorsing crypto, which may influence the new Democratic candidate. The past two cycles also overlapped with US elections and BTC halving events, adding to the rally potential.  Could This Time Be Different?  While history doesn’t repeat exactly, the rhyming nature of past cycles — initial Bitcoin dominance, subsequent altcoin outperformance, and macroeconomic influences—sets up for an altcoin rally. However, this time could be different. On the positive side, BTC and ETH have reached mainstream adoption through ETFs, with record inflows from retail investors and institutions.  On the cautious side, a larger and more diverse set of altcoins competes for investor capital, and many new projects have limited circulating supply due to airdrops, leading to future dilution. Only ecosystems with solid technology and the ability to attract builders and users may thrive in this cycle.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Kelly Ye,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/31/the-anatomy-of-a-crypto-bull-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6713872a327e56c0fdf8e5aca47f576c500c255-5435x3623.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If Trump wins in November, loosening limitations on these crypto-for-the-masses products from Fidelity, BlackRock and their ilk seems an obvious target. The average ETF sees about $1 million of opening day trading, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump once professed himself “not a fan” of bitcoin; now, he says he will end the U.S. government’s “anti-crypto crusade.” Digital currencies have indeed strained against regulators wary of a speculative free-for-all. Those restraints loom over the debut of new funds tied to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which are held back from offering certain sweeteners. If Trump wins in November, loosening limitations on these crypto-for-the-masses products from Fidelity, BlackRock and their ilk seems an obvious target. The giants of exchange-traded funds, which command trillions of investor dollars, already brought bitcoin closer to the adults’ table of finance by establishing products directly holding the currency. They’re doing the same for ether, last Tuesday launching new funds that drew over $100 million in net inflows and $1 billion in trading volume on day one. The average ETF sees about $1 million of opening day trading, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan. It’s still much less than the $4.6 billion that spot bitcoin ETFs attracted on landing in January. After all, ether is less well-known, with the dollar value of all tokens amounting to about 30% of bitcoin’s worth. More importantly, the funds lack ether’s key selling point. The technology depends on “proof of stake” to validate transactions, which involves users putting up coins under the inducement of receiving so-called staking rewards. Put simply, they earn a yield. Issuers including Fidelity and Franklin Templeton initially intended to include staking in their funds, but ultimately launched without it, a distinct disadvantage. They likely had little choice: Gary Gensler, head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has indicated that staking is tantamount to marketing a security, with all the regulation that implies. With ether ETFs expected to draw only 25% to 30% of the demand of bitcoin funds , that dampener is an annoyance for fund managers and the fees they reap from their products’ adoption. Of course, things could change. Crypto hawkers have beat U.S. regulators in court before. A recent district court order affirming that cryptocurrencies including ether are commodities could help establish the legal basis for moving to a laxer regulatory regime. Grinding through lawsuits, though, takes time. The confluence of buzzy products backed by blue-chip fund managers with a live issue to resolve offers an easy issue for a potential Republican administration to score points on. Trump’s campaign, currently ahead in the polls, is accepting donations in digital coins. The industry may foresee it paying back out in kind. Context News U.S. exchange-traded funds tied to the price of ether enjoyed a strong debut on July 23, with $1.07 billion of shares changing hands, according to CF Benchmarks, a digital asset index provider. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 20 asked Nasdaq, CBOE and NYSE to fine-tune their applications to list spot ether ETFs as the agency moved towards approving the products, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the process. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said in a speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference on July 27 that, if he is elected, the current administration’s “anti-crypto crusade will be over.” The former president promised a plan to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” Original Post Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4708604-ether-etfs-spotlight-cryptos-big-ask-for-trump?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31766570.jpeg

42390684,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5UMJ,1722444407,Investor Surveys Reveal Strong Interest in Digital Assets,"There was a time when skeptics and professionals alike held the belief that digital assets, cryptocurrencies in particular, might be nothing but a passing trend. That time has come and gone, and the digital asset ecosystem has matured to a point of acceptance and even acceleration.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  In a recent survey conducted by an EY-Parthenon team, 94% of institutional investors and 83% of retail investors say they are long-term believers in digital assets. This past year across the globe, we have seen registered assets (exchange traded products) approved, legislation crafted (and in some cases passed), increased allocations, and the expansion of interest in tokenized assets.  Investors are demanding more services and more options.  There is significant opportunity for TradFi firms to drive meaningful revenue by extending new services to existing clients, as well as crypto native/FinTech firms to offer more institutional-focused capabilities. Those that move quickly will reap the benefits. Of survey respondents, 54% of institutional investors and 64% of retail investors plan to increase allocations, representing a significant upside over current money invested. Institutional investors largely seek a multi-custodian model to manage their digital assets, and beyond custody, want services like connectivity to more liquidity providers, the ability to lend/borrow against their crypto and prime brokerage services — in short, the services they receive from TradFi firms for traditional assets currently.  On the retail side, 72% of retail investors see digital assets as a core part of their overall wealth strategy, and they want their current wealth and estate planning, tax and trust, and advisory services enhanced to include coverage of crypto and digital assets. By the numbers, 71% of investors have sought or plan to seek out advice from a financial advisor or planner regarding their crypto holdings, and 85% would be interested in wealth and estate planning to incorporate crypto and digital assets.  There is a strong preference for registered vehicles.  Traditional asset managers and wealth managers should take note of the emerging preference for registered vehicles in the digital asset community. In fact, 62% of institutional investors and 57% of retail investors prefer to get their exposure to digital assets through registered vehicles. Drilling down, accredited retail investors are most interested, outpacing non-accredited investors’ demand for exposure to digital assets through registered vehicles by almost two to one. Though conducted before the approval of the Ethereum ETPs, 47% of institutional investors surveyed and 69% of retail investors surveyed that currently invest/have plans to invest in digital assets noted they are likely to invest in an Ethereum ETP when/if approved.  Innovation and regulatory clarity create opportunity.  Investors are intrigued by the new capabilities presented by digital assets. Both institutional and retail investors see the opportunity for tokenized assets to improve portfolio diversification and enable greater access to new asset classes like alternative investments. Additionally, both asset managers and retail investors are gaining comfort and interest in using digital assets for payments. Asset managers, banks, payment providers, and others may see an opportunity in this increased interest.  As the regulatory landscape becomes clearer, we expect more opportunities for both institutional and retail investors. As more sophisticated players enter the market, we will see more innovations offered by crypto native players and new services offered by more financial incumbents to meet the increased demand for use cases around digital assets.

This surge in XRP’s price occurs amidst swirling speculations of a forthcoming settlement or remedies ruling in the Ripple-SEC case. Amid these developments, XRP is dominating discussions on X (formerly Twitter), where a flurry of optimistic posts paint a bullish scenario for the cryptocurrency. Among the vocal proponents contributing to this positive outlook is crypto analyst Doctor Magic (@Doctor_Magic_), who shared several different time frame analyses for XRP. Short-Term Outlook For XRP (4-Hour Chart) The first chart posted by the crypto analyst shows the XRP/USD trading pair on a 4-hour time frame. The chart highlights the currently most crucial resistance zone (in red) just above the $0.70 mark. This resistance level is critical, as Doctor Magic suggests that surpassing this could pivot XRP towards new all-time highs (ATHs). Related Reading: XRP Price Jumps As Ripple Leadership Blasts SEC’s ‘Hypocritical’ Crypto Regulation However, he warns of potential short-term (LTF) rejections despite the higher time frame (HTF) indicators appearing bullish, advising traders to exercise caution with leverage long positions in this zone. “XRP most heavy resistance, get above that and we go for ATHs. Note that even though HTF XRP is primed on LTF this resistance could cause a LTF rejection, wouldn’t jump into leverage longs here.” The chart shows an uptrend line that XRP has successfully maintained, suggesting a strong bullish momentum. The focal point is the resistance zone above $0.70, which if breached, could potentially lead to higher price levels. The first target could be the price level above $0.90 which was last seen after the summary judgment by Analisa Torres on July 13 last year. A crucial element in Doctor Magic’s analysis is the breakout observed in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI demonstrates a clear upward breach of its previous trendline, signaling robust momentum. Currently at 67, the RSI is approaching the overbought threshold, which could suggest some notably bullish days ahead for XRP’s price action if the cryptocurrency runs red hot. Related Reading: XRP Price Poised For ‘Ultimate Breakout’ With $18 Price Target: Crypto Analyst Notably, the $0.70 zone as the key resistance area aligns with the Bollinger Bands analysis in the monthly chart. XRP surged above the middle band with the latest move and is now on the verge of breaking the upper band. “Today we confirm the breakout on monthly RSI. XRP is less than 10% to trigger volatility to come back which is at all time lows, $0.7 is the area to watch,” Doctor Magic explained. Long-Term Prediction For XRP (Weekly Chart) With regards to the higher time frames, Doctor Magic believes that it is too early to predict the cycle top price. Via X, he wrote, “Many of you are asking for my target on XRP, the answer is it depends. If I am right and alts lead the next leg up it will be the nail in the coffin for ‘it’s 2017 again’ and I will be looking for two tops, the second one will be determined by the first one.” The chart shared by the crypto analyst highlights several key Fibonacci retracement levels derived from XRP’s historical price movements, which could serve as critical points for potential reversals or continuation of trends. These include the 0.618 Fibonacci level at approximately $0.91, indicating a moderate resistance point. The 0.786 level sits at around $1.61, serving as a stronger psychological and technical barrier. The parity level or the 1 Fibonacci level is set at $3.31, which marked the April 2021 all-time high. Beyond this, the analysis extends into Fibonacci extension territory, with the 1.272 level at about $8.29, and the 1.414 level at roughly $13.37. The most notable and perhaps ambitious target is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which is placed at approximately $26.60. The analyst concluded, “My point is it’s too soon to speak about final target, need more data for that and I will update when its time. For the impatient of you my best guess is we see double digits XRP and that $26.5 will be tagged.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.6539.

Gox, the defunct Japanese exchange, unloaded another $2 billion of tokens late Tuesday, inching closer to finishing its $9 billion asset distribution that has been a major source of worry for investors.  Blockchain data by Arkham intelligence shows that Mt. Gox-related addresses moved 47,229 BTC worth roughly $3.1 billion between internal wallets and then transferred nearly 34,000 BTC worth $2.3 billion to new addresses little before Tuesday at midnight UTC. Arkham analysts said that the recipient was most likely BitGo, the last one of the five crypto service providers where creditors will be able to reclaim their funds.  After today's movements, Mt. Gox wallets held $3 billion BTC, down from $9 billion last month, according to Arkham data.  Previous instances of large Mt. Gox transfers triggered price declines, but today's flattish price action signals that traders have perhaps moved past the fears of sell pressure. Bitcoin dropped 0.4% from $66,000 immediately following the transaction during the Asian trading session, but later rebounded to around $66,500 by U.S. hours.  The distribution of a total $9 billion worth of bitcoin – and a smaller amount of bitcoin cash {{BCH}} – from Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange before it imploded in 2014 due to a hack, has been weighing on the crypto market sentiment with investors concerned about creditors selling assets realizing the profits of 10 years of price appreciation. The trust managing the Mt. Gox assets started distributing assets in July sending tokens to exchanges including Kraken and Bitstamp to creditors who opted to receive their claim in digital assets instead of fiat money.  ""From a psychological perspective, this represents the final chapter in a major market overhang over the industry,"" a Glassnode report said this week.  Glassnode analysts examined the cumulative volume delta (CVD) on Kraken and Bitstamp, and saw only a minor uptick in BTC selling following the days creditors received tokens on the platforms. CVD measures the net difference between spot buying and selling volumes on centralized exchanges.

42390692,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5hg5,1722441586,How Founders Can Revitalize VC Tokens,"One of the undeniable realities of the past year in Web3 has been the massive surge in memecoins. This has led to a clear dichotomy between memecoins and VC tokens – the tokens of companies backed by venture capital.  While I disagree with the notion that memecoins have killed VC tokens in the long run, it’s evident that the market for many VC tokens is currently stagnating. How did we get here, and what do we need to do to make VC tokens exciting again?  Even more importantly, what could a savvy founder who’s willing to go against the grain do in order to revitalize the VC token market, especially as we’ve started to see memecoins fatigue? To answer that, we need to go all the way back to what would be considered the root of the problem to begin with that brought us to this point.  The problem lies in the intersection of venture-funded Web3 companies and centralized exchanges. For founders and venture capitalists to profit, a successful token launch is essential. Centralized exchanges can be categorized into unofficial tiers based on their volume and liquidity. The goal is to get your token listed on the exchanges with the highest volume and liquidity, as this increases trading activity and improves market positioning. But what does it take to achieve this? It’s a complex process, but I’ll simplify it.  As you’d imagine, the top centralized exchanges are quite selective. Each has different criteria, but one key factor they value is high valuations. High valuations indicate that a founder successfully raised substantial funds, making their token launch seem more promising. The specific valuation that matters is the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV). This is calculated by multiplying the token price by the total supply, estimating the token’s market cap once all tokens are in circulation. If a company achieved a high FDV, it was seen as exciting and worthy of listing on exchanges with better volume and liquidity. Although other factors were considered, this was a crucial one.  While this strategy was successful in the past, venture capitalists, especially those with excess funds, found a way to game the system by helping more companies raise at high valuations. It worked for a while, and a few people made significant profits, but it also tainted the market. Now, it seems that every company is raising tens or hundreds of millions, often at billion-dollar-plus valuations.  This strategy worked for a while, but it had a major downside: artificially inflated pre-market token values. The practice limited the upside potential for retail investors with only a few hundred dollars to trade. Without sufficient upside, the risk wasn't worth it, especially for short-term traders seeking quick profits. This gap in the market is where memecoins stepped in to replace VC tokens.  In contrast, memecoins have thrived by offering the potential for massive returns, attracting the very investors that VC tokens have lost. These tokens promise potentially massive returns in short periods, something VC tokens haven't been able to match. However, the problem with memecoins is that they lack intrinsic value beyond the meme. As a result, they tend to have shorter lifespans before eventually spiraling into worthlessness.  To revitalize VC tokens, we need to rethink the current approach. This means shifting away from inflated valuations and adopting a model that attracts retail investors. It will require brave founders willing to challenge the conventional wisdom of the past few years. Eventually, a founder will succeed in making retail investors money, sparking a new trend that others will follow. But what does that look like?  Currently, Web3 founders are encouraged to raise more money than necessary to achieve artificially high FDVs. However, a savvy founder can generate hype while raising only the needed funds. This approach keeps valuations lower, making the token more accessible to retail investors and offering greater upside potential.  Admittedly, this strategy requires nuance, such as explaining to retail investors why your token is priced lower than competitors. There will also be other aspects to communicate to the broader Web3 ecosystem. However, once retail investors realize you’ve left value on the table for them, your VC token could see a surge similar to memecoins this year. Given the rarity of original thinking in Web3, others will likely follow suit.  You might wonder how this founder can get their tokens listed on the right exchanges without an artificially high FDV. Centralized exchanges have grown frustrated with the gamification created by venture capitalists and are now pushing back against unnecessarily high FDVs. Exchanges are shifting their focus because their business model relies on users buying and selling tokens. If users don’t see potential upside in a token, they won't trade it, which means the exchange won't profit. Therefore, exchanges are now waiting for projects that offer realistic valuations and genuine value for investors.  In summary, the stagnation of VC tokens amid the rise of memecoins highlights the need for a shift in funding strategies. Moving away from inflated valuations and embracing approaches that engage retail investors can revitalize the VC token market. This change won't be easy, but it's essential for the ecosystem's long-term health.

The technology could help nations respond more efficiently to risks from stablecoins, the report added.  Nations have stressed concerns over stablecoins experiencing runs in recent years.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the so-called central bank for central banks, and the Bank of England (BoE) have been able to demonstrate that the balance sheet of asset-referenced stablecoins can be supervised, a Wednesday report on their latest project said.  Project Pyxtrial developed a prototype data analytics pipeline which can provide supervisors with near real-time data about stablecoins' liabilities and the assets that back them, the groups said Wednesday. Stablecoins are digital coins which are pegged to other assets like fiat currencies for example.  ""The technology is a first step towards a tool that could support supervisors and regulators in proactively detecting issues in stablecoin backing and aid the development of policy frameworks based on integrated data,"" the report said.  The creation of Pyxtrial was motivated by these facts: Stablecoins are a growing and largely unregulated sector with a market capitalization of $163.7 billion that lacks supervisory technology, the report said.  ""Should a mismatch occur between a stablecoin issuer’s liabilities (the coins in circulation) and the assets backing that stablecoin, this could undermine confidence in the ability of the issuer to offer redemption at par and prompt a 'run,' ie a sudden loss of belief in the stablecoin’s value,"" the report said.  Central banks have stressed the risks of stablecoin's experiencing runs. Two years ago the U.S. Federal Reserve said that stablecoins backed by national currencies could face runs if there was a sudden drop in value.  “These vulnerabilities may be exacerbated by a lack of transparency regarding the riskiness and liquidity of assets backing stablecoins,"" the Federal Reserve report said at the time. Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is examining the global requirements that could apply to stablecoins.  Project Pyxtrial also has the potential to monitor tokenized products that are backed by real-world assets, the BIS said.

Using this same theory, pseudonymous crypto analyst XForceGlobal has estimated what could happen next for the Bitcoin price. Elliot Wave Theory Points To A Recovery In the analysis posted on TradingView, XForceGlobal used the 5-wave Elliot Wave theory to predict further upside for the Bitcoin price. The chart maps out the waves and subwaves, all of which carry various implications for the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Show Interest In Cardano, Triggering 300% Surge The crypto analyst points out that the subwaves are currently in play, ranging from 1-5. So far, subwaves 1 and 2 have finished their run, and with subwave 3, the analyst expects the price to continue to rise as this wave forms. The Bitcoin price being caught in Wave 3 is actually good for the price from here, given that the third wave is known to be bullish. It is also a long wave, meaning that its effects will last longer than that of bearish wave 2, although shorter than Wave 1. However, instead of just being a straight shot for the Bitcoin price, the crypto analyst warns that it could end up being an ABC wave, which is inherently bearish for price. In this case, the Bitcoin price would rise and then decline. Bitcoin Targets Going Forward As mentioned above, the Bitcoin price being caught in the subwave 3 is bullish, meaning the price could surge further from here. According to the crypto analyst’s chart, a 100% move from here is possible, putting the BTC price as high as $126,000. However, the next wave, Subwave 4, is very bearish and the analyst predicts a major crash. They put the target as low as $39,728, which is an over 60% decline from the $126,976 price target from subwave 3, which would mark the most notable drawdown in the Bitcoin price since 2022. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Ethereum Whales Send Over $205 Million To Coinbase The next wave, Subwave 5, is then expected to continue the bullish narrative, triggering an over 200% rise from the lows from subwave 4. It is expected to peak at around $153,000, marking the completion of the five subwaves. Despite the bullish scenarios mapped out, the crypto analyst warns that “while the evidence strongly suggests that Bitcoin will reach higher levels before any significant correction, it is crucial to remain adaptable as market conditions evolve.” They further added: “No theory can predict market movements with absolute certainty.

A portion of the supply will be airdropped to FLOKI token holders, and another portion will be distributed to users who trade Simon's Cat with the Floki trading bot.  Simon's Cat memecoin is officially linked to the mainstream Simon's Cat brand and is the first major cat memecoin on the BNB Chain, backed by the company's IP which earned $5.8 billion in revenue last year.  Animated cat brand Simon’s Cat will issue a memecoin using Floki’s TokenFi launchpad in the first week of August, with a token issuance expected on August 8, Floki lead developer B told CoinDesk in an interview Wednesday.  The token is launching in partnership with Floki, BNB Chain, and crypto investment DWF Labs. TokenFi, started in 2023 as a sister project to Floki, is a real-world assets platform helping traditional internet brands tokenize into Web3 projects. It also lets users launch any cryptocurrency without writing code.  Simon’s Cat is an animated series about a hungry house cat and its adventures. Metrics show it has over 20 million followers across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. The series mainly consists of videos and memes about the cat.  A portion of the impending memecoin's supply will be airdropped to FLOKI token holders, and a separate portion will further be distributed to users who trade Simon's Cat with the Floki trading bot – accruing value for the FLOKI token.  ""The cat memecoin sector is a budding and rapidly growing sector: it is worth $2.9 billion market cap compared to the dog memecoin sector worth $36 billion market cap,"" B said in an interview. ""The biggest dog coin is 6x bigger than the entire cat memecoin sector, showing just how small the sector is right now.""  ""While other major cat memecoins are based on Solana and Ethereum blockchain, Simon's Cat will be the first major cat memecoin on the BNB Chain,"" B added.  The Simon's Cat memecoin is officially linked to the mainstream Simon's Cat brand and backed by their IP. Banijay, the company holding the Simon's Cat IP, earned a revenue of $5.8 billion last year.

31760657,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632476,1722432607,BNB Eyes $605 After Breaking Key Resistance: Can The Bulls Maintain Momentum?,"BNB has demonstrated significant bullish momentum, with a positive candlestick crossing the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. The previous market scenario reveals that the digital currency has faced multiple rejections at the $572 level. This persistent resistance has cleared a path for the bulls to take charge and drive the price higher aiming at the $605 resistance level. As market dynamics shift, the key question is whether BNB can continue its current upward trend and hit the new target of $605. In this article, we will analyze the recent price movements of BNB using technical indicators to determine whether the price can sustain its momentum to reach $605 or decline back to $572. Technical Analysis Indicates Potential Rise To $605 Technical analysis reveals that the price of BNB has successfully crossed above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, indicating a potential bullish trend and increased buying momentum. This position indicates that BNB’s price could continue rising as long as it remains above the SMA. On the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signal line has successfully risen above 50% into the overbought zone, signaling a potential shift in momentum, which suggests that buying pressure is increasing and the asset might experience further upward movement towards the $605.6 level. Meanwhile, on the daily chart of BNB, the price is attempting to break above the 100-day SMA. A successful cross above this key technical level could signal potential bullish momentum. If BNB maintains its position above the 100-day SMA, it might trigger a sustained uptrend and greater investor confidence. Also, the RSI indicator is trading above 50%, further supporting the possibility of a bullish trend, indicating that buying pressure is currently stronger than selling pressure. BNB’s 1-day chart shows that a bullish engulfing candlestick has formed following the rejection at $572. This pattern demonstrates a potential trend reversal and could make the $605 target achievable. Key Levels To Observe When BNB Reaches $605 Resistance BNB is on a bullish trajectory, targeting the $605 resistance level. If the price of BNB breaks and closes above the $605 level, it may continue its rally toward the next resistance level at $635 and possibly other levels beyond. Nonetheless, should the digital asset face rejection at $605 and fail to break above it, a potential downward move could follow, possibly retreating to $572. The $572 level could act as a key support zone, where the price may stabilize or consolidate. However, if $572 fails to hold, a deeper correction could occur to lower support ranges such as $553.3 and $500. As of the time of writing, BNB’s price has risen by 2.09%, trading at approximately $585 in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency boasts a market capitalization exceeding $85 billion and a trading volume surpassing $1.8 billion, indicating an increase of 2.09% and 3.57% respectively over the same period.

I delve deeper into ETHA and explain why it's not my favorite investment vehicle. I conclude my analysis with a 'Hold' rating for ETHA. Spot Ether ETFs have just hit the US market by storm, not long after the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Here are the options investors now have if they wish to invest in Ether ETFs. Spot ether ETFs (CNBC) As usual, big names like Grayscale, Fidelity, and BlackRock, among others, have participated in this new offering and will be investing substantial amounts of capital into Ether tokens which will form the underlying of their crypto funds. As with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the launch of spot Ether ETFs now provides a hassle-free and secure method for people to invest in the token. Previously, one would require a crypto wallet to hold such tokens. Hardware wallets are often the safest option, but the inconvenience of setting one up causes many investors to settle with online wallets like MetaMask, or even worse, leaving the tokens held in crypto trading exchanges like Crypto.com. It's crucial to remember that the crypto space is far from hack-free, with over $1.7 billion in tokens stolen from hacks alone in 2023. When you buy into Ether ETFs, you essentially leave the security matters to the companies managing the trust, which contains the Ether tokens that form the underlying of the fund. Doing so is likely to be far safer on average, especially for investors who are relatively new to the space and may not know how to secure their tokens with a reliable crypto wallet. However, there are definitely other factors to consider before investing in such instruments. In this article, I go deeper into BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ) - a crowd favourite among Ether ETFs - and explain why I'm not in love with it. Fees are not high, but also aren't the lowest Like most Ether ETFs in this recent debut, ETHA's underlying consists almost fully of Ether tokens, and its price movement correlates closely to that of the token itself. It is the largest Ether ETF, and it is managed by the most reputable fund manager in the world - BlackRock. While most Ether ETFs are similar in their investment objectives, a key differentiating factor among them is their fee structure. ETHA Fees (iShares) As seen from above, ETHA's fees are 0.12% until the fund exceeds $2.5b of the Trust's assets or the 12-month waiver period is over. While this is far more competitive than Grayscale Ethereum Trust's ( ETHE ) hefty fee of 2.50%, Ether ETFs from VanEck ( ETHV ), and Franklin ( EZET ) offer more competitive fee structures which start at 0% during the waiver period and go up to 0.20% and 0.19% respectively. More details can be found below. Franklin Ether ETF Fee Structure (CryptoPotato, Franklin Templeton) VanEck Ether ETF Fee Structure (CryptoPotato, VanEck) All in all, ETHA's fees are not the highest, but certainly not the lowest, and the small differential in fees on a percentage basis can mean a lot in absolute terms for large amounts of capital invested over long horizons. Ether as an investment vs. Bitcoin While this new launch is largely similar to that of the most recent spot Bitcoin ETFs, we must realise that Bitcoin and Ether are two fundamentally different cryptocurrency tokens. While Bitcoin is proposed by many as a potential store of value and hedge against inflation, Ether has a completely different purpose. The Ether token is the main form of cryptocurrency on the Ethereum platform, which is the most popular decentralised blockchain platform in the crypto space. Ethereum facilitates the writing of smart contracts and allows developers to build decentralised applications, also known as dApps, on the platform itself - something you cannot do with Bitcoin, As such, many may see Ethereum as a more flexible and scalable investment option. No fixed Ether supply That being said, a major drawback is that Ether tokens have no supply cap, so the total amount of circulating token supply can vary based on the burning or issuing of tokens. As a result, the price of Ether may face greater volatility in the future, and there is less certainty as to whether the current price is a good one to pay for the Ether token. Bitcoin does not face this issue as it has a fixed supply cap, which makes it a candidate for a suitable inflation hedge (though I do have my doubts, do check out my article on IBIT ETF to know more!). However, the varying supply of Ether makes its valuation even more ambiguous than Bitcoin's, and I'm not exactly a fan of that. Competition in the space Another concern is Ethereum's growing number of competitors - many decentralised blockchain platforms are in the works as we speak, with aims to triumph Ethereum's transaction speed and costs. A very noteworthy player in the space is Solana, which has shown to be more efficient and affordable as compared to Ethereum. In fact, Solana processes 2600 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum's 15, and the former's gas fees are also significantly lower. While Ethereum still remains the most popular decentralised platform due to its impressive adaptability and reputation, we need to acknowledge the possibility of a new player taking over in the future. If Ethereum fails to overcome its competition, the price of Ether may be significantly impacted. No staking for Ether ETFs For security and regulatory purposes, issuers will not be staking their funds' underlying Ether tokens. Staking involves locking up your tokens as collateral to validate transactions on the Ethereum platform, and you're paid in freshly minted Ether tokens for facilitating the process. Investors can quite easily do so if they own Ether tokens, and may assume that investing in Ether ETFs would generate similar passive income since fund managers can simply stake the underlying Ether tokens. However, the SEC does not allow this due to regulatory concerns. As such, investors would face the opportunity cost of a potential passive income stream generated through staking if they choose to invest in Ether ETFs as opposed to owning Ether tokens directly. Doing so with ETHA is no exception - the same amount invested directly in Ether tokens could potentially yield a better return due to the staking interest earned (in tokens). Whether this regulation will be lifted in the future so that Ether ETFs can pay dividends that match staking rewards is still not certain. However, as it stands, ETHA may not be the most attractive way to gain exposure to Ether. Why you may consider ETHA In my opinion, ETHA provides investors with a reliable vehicle to invest in Ether tokens securely. Investors are able to essentially bypass the lengthy process of setting up a wallet to invest directly in Ether tokens. In addition, the rapid development of blockchain technology and decentralised platforms is a good indicator that the crypto space is evolving to offer more utility to its users through platforms like Ethereum. As such, an investment in ETHA is a potentially attractive and decently secure method of gaining exposure to the growth of Ethereum and the price appreciation of the Ether token. Potential concerns with such an investment Yet, it's important for us to still understand the risks involved with an investment in ETHA, especially those specific to Ether tokens - varying token supply and increasing competition to name a few. The lack of passive income generated through the staking of Ether is also a key consideration. Finally, it's imperative to note that while ETHA is the largest ether ETF, its fees are far from the most competitive, and the effects of these fee differentials cannot be understated. Investment decision In conclusion, I like ETHA, but I don't love it. The fees definitely make other Ether ETFs that bit more attractive. In addition, the future path of the Ethereum platform is one with many obstacles, so I'd be wary of the potential investment risk with regard to the Ether token. I rate ETHA a 'Hold' for these reasons.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4708440-etha-interesting-but-not-in-love-with-it?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31760309.jpeg

The law is an effort by the island-nation to tighten its crypto laws after the Nov. 2022 collapse of The Bahamas headquartered FTX.  The parliament of the Bahamas, where bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX was headquartered, has passed a new crypto law, The Securities Commission of The Bahamas announced on Tuesday.  The Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act, 2024, or DARE 2024, was promised after the collapse of FTX in November 2022, more than a year after the island nation's Prime Minister Philip Davis cut a ribbon with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to officially open the FTX office.  ""Building upon the foundation laid by the DARE Act, 2020, the legislation introduces comprehensive reforms designed to address the evolving landscape of digital assets and cryptocurrency markets,"" the regulator said.  DARE 2024 ""encompasses a wider range of digital asset activities, including advisory or management services, digital asset derivatives and staking services. Digital asset exchanges must adhere to increased investor and consumer protection requirements including stringent systems and controls requirements,"" the announcement said.  The law also introduces new disclosure and financial reporting requirements, brings custody services under its fold and a comprehensive stablecoin framework, while prohibiting algorithmic stablecoins.  After FTX's collapse in Nov. 2022, The Bahamas stated a desire to tighten its crypto laws as it fought a crisis of confidence and a referendum on its credibility as a hub for financial services.  In October last year, during a conference, PM Davis said the ""DARE Act will include – among other things – measures to clarify the regulation of stablecoins, and the introduction of more robust investor and consumer protection mechanisms,"" among other changes.  This is ""a testament to our commitment to robust risk management,"" said Christina Rolle, Executive Director of the Securities Commission.

With investors feeling bullish about the coin, its community is on fire, hoping for the token to knock a few zeroes off its price. Let’s take a look at MOG’s recent movement and price potential going forward into the remainder of 2024. Mog Coin Grows Despite Meme Coin Market Downturn MOG is the self-professed “first culture meme coin” being one among few meme coins positioning themselves as a long-term player from the get-go. Currently, MOG is trading at $0.000002065, a 2.64% growth over the last 24 hours. Looking further back in time, we can get a sense of MOG’s growth and anticipate future potential. MOG is up 4.76% in the last week, and has grown a significant 22.60% over the past month. Part of this is due to cat-themed coins like POPCAT and MEW trending in the space, and pulling MOG up with it. Where MOG really stands out is when we look at the past year, the token has grown a massive 8995.27%- an 89x increase. Since its launch in September 2023, the token has grown over 120x by 12813.40%. This shows that the crypto community is hungry for a culturally relevant token like MOG. Expert sentiment has been largely bullish, with influencers like Pink Beluga with over 10,000 subscribers on X (Twitter) seeing the token as one of the best long-term prospects in the space. https://x.com/PinkBelugaNFT/status/1817887662432190650 MOG Price Prediction Analysts across the space are looking at MOG’s recent growth as a sign of another rally. Names like Davie Satoshi with over 14,000 followers on X (Twitter) are hyping up the coin and stating its poised for more growth, with its cultural appeal helping it stay relevant as the markets shift. https://x.com/NFTdavie/status/1818280336004186434 In the short-term, if MOG can continue to grow at its current pace, it might surpass its all-time high of $0.0000052445 soon. Analysts are clearly bullish on the project, but there are also other emerging meme coins that are catching traders’ eyes. One is the new Shiba Shootout token, which recentl launched a presale and is already nearing the $1m milestone. Could Shiba Shootout be the Next Meme Coin to Explode? Shiba Shootout (SHIBASHOOT) is the native token of the Shiba Sharpshooter P2E game available on Google Play and the Apple App Store. The token’s memetic appeal comes from its unique blend of doges with a Wild West aesthetic. SHIBASHOOT has already raised over $880,000 in its presale, selling for $0.0197 per token. The ICO follows a dynamic pricing structure, with pricing growing and staking rewards dropping as more investors come into the project. It could provide a profitable opportunity for early investors, allocating 20% of its 2.2 billion tokens to the presale. Another 20% is allocated to staking with a massive 1120% P/A allowing stakers to 10x their token holdings within just a year. Ever since SHIBASHOOT entered its ICO, it’s had momentous expert interest. It’s been covered by Cryptonews, Austin Hilton, Crypto World Daily, and others with ClayBro – a YouTuber with over 130,000 subscribers – recently praising it for its fundamentals and massive staking rewards.

The partnership allows customers to pay in USDC or native crypto, or to place policies completely on-chain.  Lloyd’s of London, the three-century-old insurance marketplace, is backing digital asset protection policies arranged on the public Ethereum blockchain that can be paid for natively, on-chain using cryptocurrency, courtesy of Lloyd’s coverholder Evertas and smart contract insurance provider Nayms.  It wasn’t so long ago that any kind of cryptocurrency insurance cover was hard to come by. Aside from the efficiency benefits of paying for policies in crypto and using a blockchain to streamline intermediary-heavy paperwork, a Lloyd’s of London consortium of syndicates backing crypto-native, on-chain insurance shows how far the industry has progressed in the last couple of years.  “What we're enabling is for people using public blockchain infrastructure to interact with highly regulated, traditional, fiat-backed institutions in a way that is seamless,” said Evertas CEO J. Gdanski in an interview. “Whether it's to pay in USDC or native crypto, or to place policies completely on-chain with the blockchain helping coordinate between a broker, the insured, and the insurers, we think this is a seminal piece of infrastructure.”  Nayms, a digital marketplace where brokers and underwriters connect with crypto capital investment, is a play on Lloyd’s “Names,” the collection of individuals and corporations who underwrite the risks at the historic insurance market.  Evertas provides cover to custodians, exchanges and the bitcoin mining industry. Last year, Evertas acquired mining cover specialist Bitsure and began offering policy limits of up to $200 million per crypto mining location.  “The crypto native expertise we're bringing into the underwriting process gives us a thorough understanding of the risks that we underwrite,” the company's head of European underwriting, Nick Selby, in an interview. “It means we are highly explicit about what we will and won't cover, and we can pay insured claims faster than anybody else.”",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/31/lloyds-of-london-backed-insurance-policies-can-now-be-paid-for-in-crypto-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6d363f9bef6a0cbf6300269abf850c6c2f99227-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Australia's Treasury is planning to introduce a draft legislation for the crypto sector by the end of 2024.  Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) is concerned about “ongoing regulation through enforcement,” which is not “helpful to the overall direction of the industry” in Australia ahead of expected draft legislation, senior executives of the cryptocurrency exchange told CoinDesk in an interview.  “We want to avoid ongoing regulation through enforcement given all the healthy interactions we've had (with regulators) in recent times which didn’t exist earlier,” Coinbase’s Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen said in an interview.  Australia's Treasury previously announced plans to release draft legislation by the end of 2024 covering licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers.  “There’s clearly a nice macro theme and ongoing uptick in consumer adoption with the recent approvals of spot-ETF products in Australia and the U.S. and we want to make sure we're not kind of muddying the waters in this gray zone prior to the draft legislation.”  However, Australia’s market regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), has not slowed down in its approach toward the industry.  Last month, Dr Rhys Bollen, senior executive leader of digital assets at ASIC, warned an audience of industry goers to fall in line with the precedents set in the recent cases it has filed against crypto entities.  ASIC has sued Binance Australia and social investing platform eToro, while major banks of the nation have imposed partial restrictions on crypto citing scams and are appealing recent judgments that, at least in part, were in favor of crypto entities such as Block Earner and BPS Financial Pty Ltd (BPS).  “We've been quite vocal with our concerns about ASIC potentially just continuing to make enforcements”, during the “four or five roundtables” in recent weeks, O’Loghlen said, even though he complimented a new ASIC team for “very much reaching out to all industry players” … “proactively” having “a coffee conversation with 50 or so groups.”  In July, a parliamentary committee report recommended that the Australian Government recognize that ASIC has “comprehensively failed to fulfil its regulatory remit.” Earlier this month, Coinbase hired David Menz, who held senior positions at ASIC and the Australian Treasury’s Digital Assets and Crypto Unit, as its APAC Policy Manager.  “Our current policy priority is to continue to foster those relationships with both ASIC as well as Treasury,” Menz said. “We will be putting a large amount of effort into that response to exposure draft legislation when it does come out.”  Menz also said Coinbase was hoping “it's not just a bare bones licensing framework” even though that would be “better than none at all.”  Within the framework, “we are supportive of an Australian financial services (AFS) licence” to conduct crypto-related business and hopeful for inclusion of staking services, indicating “no licensed entity should stake customer's assets without” customer permission. “We would encourage that sort of good detail to be included in the exposure draft legislation,” Menz said.

42390702,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5iaV,1722427260,First Mover Americas: Crypto Market Stabilizes After Nursing Losses,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The crypto market was little changed during the European morning, with the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) down by around 0.35%. Bitcoin dropped about 0.6% in 24 hours to around $66,000. The biggest gainer among crypto majors was XRP, which added more than 4.5% to over 64 cents. This is XRP's highest level since March 25 and comes amid a large scheduled token unlock and increased hopes for settlement of a long-running SEC-Ripple lawsuit. A Tuesday filing showed that the SEC intends to amend its complaint against crypto exchange Binance, including with respect to ""Third Party Crypto Asset Securities,"" which traders are taking as a sign that the dispute could be coming to an end.  Spot ether ETFs snapped a four-day losing streak on Tuesday, recording a net $33 million of inflows on only the second day of positive flows since they listed on July 23. Ether ETFs have witnessed a cumulative net outflow of over $400 million. Grayscale’s ETHE has recorded the most losses at $1.84 billion, while BlackRock’s ETHA leads inflows at $618 million. The bitcoin equivalents, conversely, broke a four-day winning streak with $18 million of net outflows. SoSoValue data shows that Grayscale’s GBTC led outflows at $73 million. Products from Fidelity, Ark Invest, Bitwise, and VanEck saw outflows ranging from $2 million to $7 million. Blackrock’s IBIT was the only ETF that recorded inflows, adding nearly $75 million.  Nvidia is expected to see more significant price swings than bitcoin and ether. NVDA's 30-day options implied volatility, a gauge of anticipated price swings over four weeks, recently surged from an annualized 48% to 71%, according to Fintel. Deribit's bitcoin DVOL index, a measure of 30-day implied volatility, declined from 68% to 49%, according to charting platform TradingView. The ETH DVOL index fell from 70% to 55%. NVDA, a bellwether for AI, has emerged as a barometer of sentiment for both equity and crypto markets. Both bitcoin and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and have since exhibited a strong positive correlation. The correlation between 90-day prices on bitcoin and NVDA is currently 0.73.  Chart of the Day  The number of active XRP perpetual futures contracts has surged to 1.5 billion XRP, the highest since April 20, and funding rates have been positive.  The increase shows rising demand for long positions or leveraged bets looking to profit from a price rally.  XRP has gained 34% this month.

31758973,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632448,1722427250,Render Continues To Flash Red In All Timeframes – What’s Going On?,"Render investors and traders continue their sell-off, following the broader market’s bearish attitude. After weeks of continuous bullish action, CoinGecko data shows that the market is down a few percent, translating to losses in the altcoin market. Related Reading: Crypto Watch: Why Today’s FOMC Meeting Is The ‘Most Important Of Your Life’ Although the environment brought gains to a number of tokens, it dragged several tokens, like Render, to the ground. The latest market data shows that the latter is down in almost all timeframes, with the biggest loss in the monthly timeframe at nearly 25%. This presents a big question to investors and traders whether Render will continue its downward spiral. Big Things Coming For Render Jensen Huang, CEO and Co-founder of NVIDIA, recently spoke at SIGGRAPH 2024 about the effects of accelerated computing and generative AI on different industries. He also briefly mentioned the company’s jump in computer graphics saying that “it was the best decision” the company made. Almost like NVIDIA, Render’s framework as a provider of decentralized graphics and computing resources places the platform in a unique position in the world of AI. When asked about the AI revolution which started in 2022, Huang said: “[And] this is really the revolutionary time that we’re in. Just about every industry is going to be affected by this just based on some of the examples I’ve already given you.” This just shows how the broader industry is pivoting towards supporting the development of AI, thus providing a bullish signal for investors on Render as the latter’s nature as a provider of computing resources makes them valuable for the AI space. Key moment from today’s #SIGGRAPH2024 fireside with Jensen Huang and Lauren Goode: Q. Where do you draw the line between AI is augmenting and helping [artists] and this is replacing certain things that we do?https://t.co/muYWEq586d A. “These tools help us be more productive.… — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) July 30, 2024 And traditional finance institutions recognize this potential at the crossroads of AI and crypto. Asset management firm Grayscale launched its first decentralized AI fund in the early half of this month, featuring the likes of RENDER, TAO, FIL, LPT, and NEAR. With Render’s providing a valuable resource to anyone who needs computing power, their market position remains secure despite facing substantial downturns this month. More Bearish Pressure In The Offing? As it currently stands, the token’s position is quite shaky as it might push the token to lower lows following the general trend it has had since May. If the downward trend continues, the bears might push the crypto to January 2024 levels, wiping out the token’s year-to-date gains. Thus bulls should consolidate and gain control of the $6 support before any attempt upward. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Go Up 680% This Week? This Analyst Believes So But the token’s volatility might work in the bull’s favor. The current market environment is still mostly bullish, mostly by the fact that the major cryptocurrencies are in a rally, pulling the market upward. This greedy mood counters the bearishness of the current market correction, putting more emphasis on long-term gains rather short or medium-term increases. Investors and traders should then monitor the market for long-term opportunities that will support the movement of the altcoin.

The majority of BTC holdings are under MacroStrategy, a separate entity that shields MicroStrategy from any recourse by investors, leading to fewer shareholder rights and ownership. MSTR has raised $6.8b in the capital markets with limited benefits to generating real shareholder value. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is in the midst of a major operational transition from operating as a software licensing company to a SaaS company and is struggling to reemerge to growth. Though MicroStrategy is valued based on their BTC holdings, I believe there may be some structural discrepancies that will result in less BTC exposure than investors are led on to believing, specifically the funneling of BTC to MacroStrategy, a subsidiary of MicroStrategy that is shielded from any recourse of BTC holdings in the instance of MicroStrategy undergoing bankruptcy. Though I do not anticipate imminent bankruptcy MicroStrategy's operations, I do believe the separation of the BTC holdings from equity holders dissociates any risk exposure to the actual holdings of BTC. Despite this factor, I believe MSTR shares are significantly overvalued based on their intelligent leverage model and exposure to BTC. Given the firm's capital structure and series of debt and equity raises, I reiterate my STRONG SELL recommendation for MSTR shares with a price target of $1,026/share at 1.107x their BTC holdings. This multiple is derived by the percentage of net debt in the firm's total enterprise value. MicroStrategy will be reporting q2'24 earnings on August 1, 2024. The firm has two downward EPS revisions and zero upward revisions within the last 90 days. Be sure to read my previous coverage of MicroStrategy here . MicroStrategy Operations Looking at consensus estimates for MicroStrategy for eFY24, I believe the analyst community is significantly underestimating the cost of transition the firm will undergo as it converts from a licensing-based software firm to a SaaS company. Analysts are expecting MicroStrategy to realize a significant decline in operating income in eFY24 in the range of $-235.4-189.99mm on the back of $479.61-502.28mm in revenue generation. FinChat MicroStrategy is going through a major shift in operations, migrating customers from on-prem licensing sales to cloud-based SaaS. Management believes this shift will create the appearance of lower revenue on a per-quarter basis as revenue will amortize from deferred to cash over a period as opposed to a one-time payment. This adjustment has offset revenue significantly from period to period; however, the firm's total revenue generation has been on a steady state of decline for the last decade, suggesting that customer churn may be involved in the decline in revenue in recent quarters, not just the transition from licensing to subscription fees. One factor that struck my attention was the higher costs associated with cloud hosting as the firm transitions more customer features to the cloud environment. I believe this factor will drive further challenges beyond the decline in net revenue, as MicroStrategy's operating strategy essentially calls for a decay in operating margins. Though this is no longer the primary deliverable for MicroStrategy as the firm has transitioned its core focus away from BI applications in favor of BTC holdings, I believe their applications still remain as a key factor as it remains the company's sole cash generation outside of the capital markets. Gartner Management discussed the release of an array of AI-oriented applications that are essentially business intelligence functions with the addition of a copilot. Essentially, their Auto SQL, Auto Answers, and Auto Expert features don't appear to add any additional functionality to the business intelligence process aside from the ability to query information with natural language. The feature most outstanding of the group is their Auto Bot feature, which allows for users to create custom bots to access BI insights. Aside from the name differentiation, the functionality appears to remain relatively rudimentary when compared to Oracle's ( ORCL ) BI & AI capabilities. I believe that one of the lagging factors of MicroStrategy's applications is that the features stop short of actionable items, meaning that the application will provide all the insights necessary without the cost-saving or revenue-generating benefits other BI/AI applications have to offer. Holistically, I believe this last point is what differentiates traditional business intelligence and BI + AI. Another negative risk when compared to competitors such as Oracle, Microsoft, and Google is that MicroStrategy uses 3rd party hosting for their cloud features. Though this can be seen as a benefit as it allows for the application to be utilized in a multi-cloud or hybrid environment, the barriers across hyperscalers have been broken down in recent years, allowing for applications run on OCI to be used in Microsoft Azure ( MSFT ), Google Cloud Platform ([[GOOGL]], [[GOOG]]), or Amazon AWS ( AMZN ). One factor that comes to mind that might make MicroStrategy's application more appealing to competitors is pricing; however, Microsoft Power BI, which resides in the top-right corner of the Gartner Magic Quadrant , is scalable, offers the same features, and starts at $10/month for a single user of Power BI Pro. Corporate Reports Looking at MicroStrategy from a financial standpoint, the firm appears to be continuing its operational decline despite the transition from licensing revenue to subscription-based revenue. Given the additional costs associated with cloud hosting services through this transition, I anticipate MicroStrategy to experience a continued decline in their adjusted operating margin. FinChat Given the limited cash flow generation, I do not anticipate MicroStrategy to allocate nearly as much free cash flow to BTC acquisition, especially as the firm transitions to the new subscription model despite it being a higher margin business. Perhaps margin compression will be a near-term headwind; however, if the firm continues to experience a decline in total revenue, I believe this downward trend may continue. Corporate Reports This leads me to believe that the firm will continue to depend on the capital markets to pay down debt in order to both sustain operations and acquire BTC. In total, MicroStrategy has raised $3.2b in equity and $3.6b in debt to purchase BTC. Corporate Reports MicroStrategy & MacroStrategy Management at MicroStrategy may refer to themselves as a Bitcoin Development company over a BI/AI company, which is well within their rights given that every cent of cash generated, whether through operations and debt & equity raises, goes straight to buying BTC. The factor that makes me think twice about investing in MicroStrategy as a so-called intelligence-leveraged BTC company is that the firm funnels the majority of its BTC holdings into MacroStrategy, a wholly owned subsidiary that is shielded from recourse in the event of a MicroStrategy bankruptcy. This means that equity holders of MSTR own nothing more than the assets held by MicroStrategy and none of those held by MacroStrategy. SEC Filing In addition to this, MicroStrategy is no stranger to shelf equity offerings in order to build their BTC holdings, which management believes is accretive to shareholder value. Though this may be true when comparing the fundamental value of MSTR shares to BTC, I believe this strategy only harms those seeking BTC exposure as MSTR shareholders aren't solely exposed to BTC risk. Other risks include further dilution of their equity value, operational risk, macroeconomic risks, and market risks as the price of BTC is relatively correlated with the NASDAQ ( QQQ ). Aside from the buying volume of MSTR shares in February post-q4'23 earnings release, MSTR remains significantly correlated to BTC. The chart below correlates BTC & QQQ and includes MSTR for reference. TradingView As for being a leveraged approach to BTC, ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) offers a 2x leveraged approach to trading BTC without the operational risk as experienced with MSTR. The niche that management calls for in holding MSTR is that investors receive a leveraged approach to investing in BTC. One of management's strategies for culling in investors is the expense ratio factor, which MSTR shares have no exposure to. BITU has a 95bps expense ratio. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which has direct exposure to BTC with no leverage, has an expense ratio of 12bps. Though MSTR shares having no management fees certainly is a good perk to holding shares, I believe the operational risks involved with holding MSTR shares significantly outweighs the management fees of the managed and passive ETFs. TradingView The biggest differentiator is that investors of MSTR don't actually own direct exposure to BTC, as the BTC assets are primarily held in MacroStrategy. Given this factor, I believe MicroStrategy is nothing more than a capital-raising vehicle used to bolster BTC holdings at MacroStrategy. This is essentially a reverse SPE where investors are directly investing in equity dilution and debt with limited-to-no benefits from MacroStrategy's BTC holdings. In addition to this, MicroStrategy does not generate value by holding BTC. BTC is very similar to a commodity or a security in which BTC can be mined, bought, and sold to generate value. By only buying BTC with no mandate for selling, BTC's sole purpose is to act as a placeholder to potentially accrue value over time. Unlike the miners, such as Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) or CleanSpark ( CLSK ), MicroStrategy does not generate value by creating BTC. Similar to these miners, MicroStrategy holds BTC with the expectation of BTC being an appreciating asset. My last point is Michael Saylor's recent stock sales. Management's argument for this was that the sales were automated and premeditated, which is common for executives to do. What baffles me is that the management team spent a good proportion of their q1'24 earnings call selling listeners on why they should own MSTR shares while their founder is selling millions of dollars of stock. Automated or not, Mr. Saylor elected to sell his shares in the open market. FinChat Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports As of q1'24, MacroStrategy holds 175,721 BTC and MicroStrategy holds 38,679 BTC for a total holding of 214,400 BTC. As of July 29, 2024, BTC was valued at $67,340/BTC, providing a total value of $14.4b. Based on MicroStrategy's current BTC holdings and their EV/Market cap of 1.107x, I believe MSTR shares are significantly overvalued when priced to their BTC holdings. I reiterate my STRONG SELL rating with a price target of $1,026/share.

31756301,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632455,1722421828,Analyst Says ETH Price Will Struggle As Spot Ethereum ETFs Expectations Crash,"Pseudonymous trader and analyst Roman has made a bold prediction regarding the ETH price, suggesting that investors should lower their short-term expectations. This comes amid a drop in the hype around the Spot Ethereum ETFs, with these funds currently suffering significant outflows. What To Expect From The ETH Price Roman mentioned during an interview with Hall of Flame that he doesn’t see Ethereum “doing that well” for the next few months. The analyst believes that ETH will suffer a similar fate to the rest of the crypto market as Bitcoin sucks up all the liquidity while altcoins continue to trade sideways due to this. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies Bullish Pattern That Can Send XRP Price To New Highs As such, Roman doesn’t expect the ETH price to enjoy any parabolic rally until traders begin to rotate their capital from Bitcoin into altcoins, with Ethereum likely to lead the pack when that time comes. The analyst also noted that this period will likely come when traders think Bitcoin is at or close to its market top. The analyst highlighted the period in 2020 when Ethereum “didn’t really do well” until the flagship crypto hit $40,000. He noted that the ETH price was down 80% from its all-time high (ATH) while Bitcoin broke ATHs. Indeed, Ethereum is currently suffering a similar fate. Bitcoin hit a new ATH earlier this year, while ETH is down over 33% from its current ATH of $4,890. Meanwhile, Roman explained how Ethereum will rise from the ashes when Bitcoin is almost or already at its peak. He stated that when Bitcoin starts to experience a significant price correction, after hitting a price target like $120,000, Bitcoin traders are taking profits and rotating it into Ethereum and other altcoins. Interestingly, the crypto trader suggested that Ethereum’s success largely depends on Bitcoin. He claimed that the flagship crypto needs to continue to break new highs and rally much higher for money to flow into ETH and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Roman believes that the liquidity shift will happen before year-end. How Much Could Flow Into The Spot Ethereum ETFs Expectations for the Spot Ethereum ETFs have dropped since they began trading on July 23, with analysts like Sygnum Bank Head of Research Katalin Tischhauser suggesting that inflows into these funds could be lower than expected. Tischhauser told The Block that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could witness as low as 15% of Bitcoin’s flows, with around $5 flowing into these funds in their first year of trading while $30 billion flows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Show Interest In Cardano, Triggering 300% Surge The analyst made this prediction based on “Ethereum’s lesser name recognition” and ETH’s market cap compared to Bitcoin’s, suggesting that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will likely record less adoption and lower liquidity. These Spot Ethereum ETFs have suffered significant net outflows since they began trading thanks to Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). However, these funds broke this streak of net outflows on July 30, with data from Farside Investors showing that they recorded a net inflow of $33.7 million.

42390686,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5hBJ,1722418132,Bitcoin Keeps Weekly Loss as 'Anti-Risk' Yen Strengthens After BOJ Rate Hike,"The Bank of Japan's interest-rate increase sent the Japanese yen to its strongest since March against the U.S. dollar.  BTC holds on to a weekly loss as rising yen could lead to global financial tightening.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} remained on the defensive while the Japanese yen (JPY) strengthened in the foreign exchange market after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised its interest rate and announced other measures to tighten liquidity.  In an aggressive hawkish move, the central bank lifted its unsecured overnight call rate target to around 0.25% from the previous 0%-0.1% range. It also said it would cut liquidity-boosting bond purchases to roughly 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) a month by the first quarter of 2026. As of March, the bank was buying about 6 trillion yen of bonds a month, .  Bitcoin held steady near $66,000, nursing a weekly loss of 2% on expectations for renewed rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. That spurred demand for the ""anti-risk"" yen, sending the USD/JPY rate down to nearly 150, the strongest for yen since March, according to data source TradingView. Futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, signaling a positive open on Wednesday.  Traders use the low-yielding Japanese yen to invest or fund investments in high-return assets. As such, a notable rally in the yen tends to strain the so-called carry trades and forces investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""The yen’s popularity as a funding currency can cause knock-on effects in other markets, helping tighten global financial conditions,"" BlackRock said in its weekly note. ""The yen’s resulting surge caused investors to unwind positions using the low-yielding yen to buy higher-yielding currencies – what’s known as the carry trade.""  The yen has rallied nearly 6.4% against the dollar this month, the highest gain since November 2022. That might partly explain the recent risk aversion in technology stocks and bitcoin's repeated bullish exhaustion near $70,000.  The yen could gain further ground, adding to risk aversion if the Fed sends out a strong dovish signal later Wednesday, setting the stage for rapid-fire rate cuts.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/31/bitcoin-keeps-weekly-loss-as-anti-risk-yen-strengthens-after-boj-rate-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d2924ddb6292f101f9d21615be226f8463ac415-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Marks claims BCH has verified a Hidden Bullish Divergence, indicating great upside possibility. According to his analysis, BCH might reach a goal level of $3,745, a whopping 683% rise from existing levels. Marks underlines that the current price swings are only the start; a significant rise is set by these developments. Investors and traders, who are attentively observing BCH’s future actions through important resistance levels, have been excited by this prognosis. Historical Context & Market Sentiment The historical performance of BCH offers important background for both present and future trajectory. On December 20, 2017 BCH peaked at $4,350 and fell to $77.20. Ever since the previous cycle low, $1,620 has been the highest BCH price. The Fear & Greed Index shows a reading of 61, which corresponds to “Greed,” hence despite the volatility, the present market mood stays positive. This implies that investors are likely to keep supporting BCH’s upward movement as they are enthusiastic about its possibilities. Bitcoin Cash: Price Forecast The crypto prediction tool CoinCheckup projects BCH to increase by 4.55% over the next three months. This estimate shows a steady, although slow rise in market confidence and possible investment flow. Rising institutional interest, clear regulations, and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in many economic sectors are among the elements driving this price action. With a forecasted increase of 16% over the following six months, BCH’s medium term development is expected to be more noticeable. This projection points to perhaps major adoption benchmarks and a better market vibe. This positive mood is probably driven by technological developments, higher transaction volumes, and better connection into financial systems. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies Bullish Pattern That Can Send XRP Price To New Highs Investor Takeaways The existing and expected behaviour of Bitcoin Cash offers investors an interesting option. Recent increases, professional forecasts of a significant spike, and favorable market atmosphere point to BCH being ready for significant increase. Still, one should take into account the possible risks and the natural volatility of the crypto market.

31753148,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632418,1722411002,Crypto Watch: Why Today’s FOMC Meeting Is The ‘Most Important Of Your Life’,"For the crypto and broader financial market, FOMC day is upon us once again today. And analysts agree that today’s meeting will be one of the most important in recent years. Kurt S. Altrichter, a financial advisor and founder of Ivory Hill, even describes today’s FOMC meeting as the “most important of your life.” In a new post on X, Altrichter explains why. FOMC Preview Central to today’s FOMC meeting is the Federal Reserve’s potential indication of a September rate cut. According to Altrichter, the financial markets are almost unanimously anticipating this move, with Fed fund futures indicating a near-certain likelihood of such an outcome. “Market expectation is a strong signal for a September rate cut,” Altrichter points out, marking today’s update as a pivotal moment for financial markets. The key question for today is: “How strongly does the Fed signal a September rate cut?” the expert explains. Investors are directed to pay close attention to the FOMC’s statement at 2:00 pm ET, especially the third paragraph, which could subtly signal the Fed’s confidence in reaching its inflation targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Poised For ‘Ultimate Breakout’ With $18 Price Target: Crypto Analyst Altrichter advises, “Look at the 3rd paragraph for this key sentence: The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” Any modification in this wording would be a clear signal that the Fed is nearing its inflation control goals, potentially paving the way for rate adjustments. Altrichter outlines several potential outcomes from the meeting, each associated with specific market reactions. In a dovish scenario, the Fed signals a rate cut for September. Then, Altrichter expects a broad market rally, especially in sectors less sensitive to interest rates. “Yields and the dollar should fall modestly with a modest rally in commodities,” Altrichter predicts, suggesting significant movements in standard and sector-specific indexes. In a hawkish scenario, there will be no change in the forward guidance by the US central bank. If the Fed maintains its current stance without hinting at future cuts, the markets might experience a downturn. “Look out below and expect a sharp decline. SPX should fall by 1-2%,” he warns, noting that tech and growth sectors might relatively outperform due to their appeal during higher yield periods. How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React? The potential adjustments in US monetary policy bear direct consequences for the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Crypto, often viewed as alternative investments, reacts sensitively to shifts in monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Cycle Likely To Go On Till Mid-2025: CryptoQuant CEO If the dovish scenario materializes, this could make Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more appealing. A signal of lower future rates could drive increased investment into the crypto market, potentially leading to price increases as investors seek higher returns in alternative assets. Conversely, should the Fed signal reluctance to cut rates, indicating a stronger economic outlook or concerns about inflation, this could strengthen the US dollar and increase yields on traditional financial instruments. Such an environment might lead to a pullback in the crypto markets, as the comparative advantage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies diminishes against strengthening traditional yields. Max Schwartzman, CEO of Because Bitcoin Inc, commented via X: “FOMC is [today] & its incredibly important as we get into the end of this fed cycle… Here is how the last 11 meetings have gone for Bitcoin…” Thus, today’s FOMC meeting is a watershed moment for financial markets globally, with significant implications for both traditional and crypto markets. As Altrichter succinctly puts it, “A Sept Fed rate cut has driven the 2024 bull market. Tomorrow’s meeting will either reinforce that tailwind or refute it. If the Fed signals a cut, the rally continues. No signal: markets could get ugly.” At press time, BTC traded at $66,462.

Traders foresee an end to the legal dispute between the SEC and Ripple Labs.  Optimism from traders pushed payments-focused XRP token to the front of the market, beating bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}} and the broad-based CoinDesk 20 index in Asian trading hours.  XRP has risen 7% in 24 hours to over 64 cents, the highest point since March 25, amid a large scheduled token unlock and increased hopes for settlement of the long-running SEC Ripple lawsuit.  A Tuesday filing showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to amend its complaint against crypto exchange Binance, including with respect to ""Third Party Crypto Asset Securities,"" which likely means that the Judge won't have to decide whether ten tokens such as Solana's SOL and Polygon's MATIC are unregistered securities just yet.  Although the filing did not name any token, traders are taking it to be a sign that the legal dispute between the SEC and Ripple Labs, which the regulator argues issued XRP, could be ending. Ripple and XRP aren't interchangeable. While Ripple is a fintech company focused on building a global payments network, XRP is an independent digital asset used for things like online payments and currency swaps.  Ripple is set to unlock 1 billion XRP, or $641 million worth at current prices, in August as part of a pre-determined unlock schedule.  While the concept of putting more token supply onto the market would logically drive down the price, a growing field of research suggests it might accelerate an existing bullish market trend because of increased liquidity.  Market data from CoinGecko shows that XRP's demand stems from South Korea. The XRP-Korean Won trading pair came in at $386.5 million versus Binance's XRP-USDT trading pair, which hit $352.5 million in volume.  In crypto circles, South Korean traders are known for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens, contributing to buying pressure and possibly influencing prices.

Traders are looking to the possibility of soft U.S. tech earnings as a signal for upcoming volatility in the BTC market.  U.S.-listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded outflows while ether {{ETH}} ETFs recorded inflows after a four-day losing streak on Tuesday as prices pared gains from last week’s run-up to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s speech.  Spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $18 million in net outflows, breaking a four-day streak that saw inflows as high as $124 million.  SoSoValue data shows that Grayscale’s GBTC led outflows at $74 million. Products from Fidelity, Ark Invest, Bitwise, and VanEck saw outflows ranging from $2 million to $7 million. Blackrock’s IBIT was the only ETF that recorded inflows, almost $75 million.  Eher-tracked ETFs recorded net inflows at $33 million after a four-day losing streak, only the second day of net inflows since they went live on July 23.  Ether ETFs have witnessed a cumulative net outflow of over $400 million. Grayscale’s ETHE has recorded the most losses at $1.84 billion, while BlackRock’s ETHA leads inflows at $618 million.  BTC surged to over $69,000 last week as Trump took the stage at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, revealing plans to fire the U.S. SEC head Gary Gensler and create a strategic bitcoin reserve if elected.  However, the cryptocurrency lost as much as 5% on Monday as the U.S. Marshals Service shifted $2 billion worth of BTC to two new wallets, instilling fears of a looming liquidation.  Meanwhile, traders are largely cautioning of further price volatility as major U.S. technology firms are scheduled to release earnings this week – an event that tends to influence bitcoin prices.  “Election headlines will remain a major focus, but several key macroeconomic events are also on the horizon,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast Tuesday. “Key events starting with the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, megacap tech earnings (Apple, Amazon, Meta) throughout the week, and unemployment data on Friday.”  “We maintain a range-trading outlook for BTC,” the firm said.

Bitcoin has exhibited a strong positive correlation with NVDA since late 2022.  Nasdaq-listed Nvidia (NVDA), hailed by Goldman Sachs as the world's most important stock this year, is expected to see more significant price swings than crypto market leaders bitcoin and ether.  NVDA's 30-day options implied volatility, a gauge of anticipated price swings over four weeks, has recently surged from an annualized 48% to 71%, according to data source Fintel.  Meanwhile, crypto exchange Deribit's bitcoin DVOL index, a measure of 30-day implied volatility, has declined from 68% to 49%, according to charting platform TradingView. The ETH DVOL index has dropped from 70% to 55%.  Options are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from bullish and bearish price swings. The implied volatility, influenced by demand for options, represents the degree of uncertainty or expected price turbulence.  NVDA, a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and the producer of graphics processing units formerly used for cryptocurrency mining, has emerged as a barometer of sentiment for both equity and crypto markets since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.  Both bitcoin and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and have since exhibited a strong positive correlation. As of writing, the correlation between 90-day prices on bitcoin and NVDA was 0.73.  NVDA's stock is down roughly 26% since reaching a high of $140 last month, offering bearish cues to the crypto market. Bitcoin has been locked in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, CoinDesk data show.  The spike in NVDA's implied volatility is likely related to the hedging activity of market makers, a phenomenon often seen in the crypto market, according to the crypto financial platform BloFin.  ""It must be admitted that negative gamma does not only dominate the crypto market. In the U.S. stock market, SPY and QQQ have experienced significant declines caused by negative gamma hedging, and the high volatility risk has made NVDA's front-month implied volatility level significantly surpass that of cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH,"" Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, told CoinDesk.

The price is now consolidating and might aim for more gains above $590 in the near term. BNB price started a decent upward move from the $565 support zone. The price is now trading above $580 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $582 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could extend its increase if it clears the $590 resistance in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Upsides In the past few days, BNB price saw a decent upward move from the $565 support zone, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price was able to climb above the $572 and $580 resistance levels. It even cleared the $582 resistance. The current wave surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $597 swing high to the $568 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $582 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading above $582 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is now consolidating near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $597 swing high to the $568 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $588 level. The next resistance sits near the $590 level. A clear move above the $590 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $600. A close above the $600 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the near term. Are Dips Limited? If BNB fails to clear the $590 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $582 level or the 100-hourly simple moving average. The next major support is near the $575 level. The main support sits at $565. If there is a downside break below the $565 support, the price could drop toward the $550 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $532 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.

31748000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632396,1722400203,XRP Price Jumps As Ripple Leadership Blasts SEC’s ‘Hypocritical’ Crypto Regulation,"The XRP price has climbed by over 4% within the last 24 hours, extending its bullish trend observed over the past month. This increase propelled the token to a four-month peak of $0.6377 early on Tuesday, outperforming the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the market. However, this recent surge in value coincides with strong criticism from key Ripple executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, directed at the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple’s Response To Amendments In Binance Lawsuit As Bitcoinist reported early Tuesday, the SEC amended its complaint against the world’s largest exchange, Binance, specifically adjusting the classification of 10 cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Cosmos (ATOM), that were initially deemed as “securities.” Related Reading: Research Firm Predicts Bitcoin Game Theory In Global Adoption Race Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, responded to this development by emphasizing the SEC’s perceived “hypocrisy” in the classification of crypto tokens and its management of crypto regulations over the past year under the guidance of Chair Gary Gensler. Garlinghouse criticized the SEC for what he sees as a lack of clarity in the consistent application of rules, suggesting possible political agendas or questionable litigation tactics. “Definitely not faithful allegiance to the law,” Garlinghouse said. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s CLO, also weighed in on the situation, pointing out apparent inconsistencies between the lawsuits involving Binance and the US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, both initiated around the same period in the last quarter of 2023. Alderoty highlighted the SEC’s response to judicial scrutiny in the Binance case compared to its stance in the Coinbase lawsuit, particularly regarding the classification of tokens, in which twelve cryptocurrencies, most of which were also included in the Binance case, were also deemed securities. Analyst Forecasts Bullish Breakout For XRP Price Despite XRP not being implicated in the recent SEC decision, its price continues to surge following a 33% uptrend over the past month. The sustained momentum fueled by bullish investors suggests a potential push towards the $1 threshold. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes that XRP’s price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern for six years. Martinez anticipates a bullish breakout if XRP surpasses the $0.90 mark, especially in light of the ongoing recovery from a significant dip that drove the token to a 17-month low of $0.3825 on July 5. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins Seeing Less Interest Than Bitcoin: Data However, a critical event looms on August 1 when Ripple Labs is scheduled to release 1 billion XRP from its escrow account, which this influx of supply could potentially outstrip demand, leading to a subsequent decline for the XRP price if market interest fails to materialize. The key will be to watch the $0.5353 level, where the token’s 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) currently resides, which could act as a notable support in the scenario of a further decline following Ripple’s token release.

31745102,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632328,1722394829,Is A Major Bitcoin Dip Coming? What the Coinbase Index Tells Us,"An analyst from the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform has now drawn attention to a particular trend tied to the Coinbase Premium Index (CPI) which currently suggests a grim move brewing for Bitcoin. This indicator, when placed with its Simple Moving Average over 14 days (SMA14), has often shown a significant correlation with Bitcoin’s selling pressure, shedding light on how crucial its impact is on the market. Bull or Bear: What the Coinbase Index Tells Us Before diving into what the Coinbase Premium Index is currently signalling for Bitcoin, it is worth explaining further the essence of this indicator to grasp the credibility of it. Notably, the Coinbase Premium Index (CPI) is an analytical tool that measures the variance between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase Pro and its price on other major exchanges. A negative CPI value suggests that Bitcoin is trading at a lower price on Coinbase Pro compared to other platforms, which typically indicates a selling pressure in the US market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $63,000: Key Indicators Signal Further Decline – Time To Sell? According to the CryptoQuant analyst with the name ‘burakkesmeci,’ this phenomenon has been observed more frequently after the US approved the trading of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which currently seems to have amplified the significance of CPI as a leading indicator. When Coinbase Premium Index is below SMA14, selling pressure increases “Examining the data for 2024, we clearly see that Bitcoin price corrections have occurred when the CPI (Coinbase Premium Index) fell below its’ SMA14.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/Bc3N1cfh5W pic.twitter.com/tN99LNhNkr — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 30, 2024 The analyst disclosed that for 2024, the data reveals a clear pattern: Bitcoin often faces price corrections when the CPI dips below its SMA14. This specific behaviour points to a bearish sentiment when the index falls short of the moving average, signaling increased selling activity. Currently, the CPI stands at -0.008, contrasting with the SMA14 at 0.020. This discrepancy according to burakkesmeci “indicates that sellers have a stronger hand in the US market.” Bitcoin Market Performance Looking at Bitcoin’s market performance so far, the phenomenon of a seller-driven market, as indicated by the CPI, appears to hold true. Currently, Bitcoin trades at a price of $65,805, marking a 3% dip in the past 24 hours and roughly 2% in the past week. In the past day alone, the asset’s market cap has declined by over $40 billion, a stark contrast to its 24-hour trading volume, which has seen quite the opposite, surging from below $30 billion as of yesterday to as high as $36.7 billion, at the time of writing. Regardless of the price performance, a handful of crypto analysts remain optimistic. For instance, Crypto Rover, a renowned enthusiast in the crypto space, disclosed that Bitcoin is currently just consolidating inside a notable bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Back On Radar’ To Hit $80,000, Then New ATH, Analyst Says According to Rover, “This is the worst time to be bearish.

31742077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632268,1722389440,"Institutional Investors Show Interest In Cardano, Triggering 300% Surge","Cardano (ADA) has witnessed a massive 300% surge in Exchange Traded Product (ETP) inflows. The unexpected influx of capital from institutional investors could set the stage for a potential uptrend ahead of the Chang hard fork. Cardano Inflows Skyrocket 300% On July 29, CoinShares, a leading firm in the crypto ETP industry, released a weekly report on the fund flows of various digital assets. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw a relatively muted inflow of approximately $245 million in the last week. Related Reading: Technical Indicators Show Strong Bitcoin Bullishness – New ATH On The Horizon? Among the list of digital assets which recorded new flows, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded the largest increase in inflows. The pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a healthy inflow of $519 million, achieving a month to date inflows of $3.6 billion. More impressively, Cardano recorded a surge in inflows into its ETP, totaling approximately $1.2 million. This massive inflow surge represents a whopping 300% addition from the previous week. Furthermore, Cardano’s strong performance has effectively placed it second among all crypto ETPs. Sharing a “Flows by Asset” chart of Cardano and various other prominent cryptocurrencies, CoinShares reports that institutional investors have invested a total of $11 million into Cardano-oriented investment products. Additionally, Cardano’s month to date inflow has seen about $2.4 million. During its report, CoinShares also revealed that the launch of Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed some of the largest inflows since December 2020. This also led to newly issued ETFs experiencing a staggering $2.2 billion in inflows while trading volumes in Ethereum (ETH) rose by 542%. In the case of Cardano, following its 300% surge in ETP inflows, the price of the cryptocurrency witnessed a slight rebound from previous bearish trends. Following a surge to about $0.8 some time in March 2024, Cardano’s price has been undergoing a corrective phase, declining below the $0.4 price mark. With the Chang hard fork underway following the deployment of Cardano node 9.1.0, the market sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency has been somewhat more positive. Analysts like ‘Sssebi’ on X (formerly Twitter) have deduced that Cardano was the most undervalued asset amongst the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The analyst disclosed that investors should remain bullish on Cardano, predicting upsides for the cryptocurrency. Update On ADA Price Analysis Despite experiencing constant declines in its price over the past few months, Cardano has steadily consolidated around the $0.4 price level, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s strength and resilience during unfavorable market conditions. CoinMarketCap reports reveal that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.4, reflecting a 4.34% decrease in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Solana Confirms Upside Breakout With Bullish Pennant – Here’s The Target Analysts like Sssebi continue to maintain a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, anticipating future price increases during the bull cycle.

31740191,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632337,1722384088,"Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Why ETH Could See Larger Fluctuations Soon, QCP Reveals","Regardless of both their maturity in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum rivalry persists. According to recent insights from QCP Capital, a global digital asset trading firm and market maker, Ethereum appears to have now shown potential for larger price fluctuations compared to Bitcoin. QCP reveals that the volatility premium between these two major cryptocurrencies has seen a notable increase, with Ethereum leading in potential price swings. ETH to see Larger Price Swings than BTC Delving further into the insights shared, QCP Capital disclosed that it has observed Ethereum’s volatility premium over Bitcoin expanding to 8%, up from 4% just last week. This widening gap, according to QCP highlights a growing trend where Ethereum is expected to outpace Bitcoin in terms of price volatility. Particularly, the analysis suggests that Ethereum could offer more lucrative opportunities for those willing to capitalise on its market movements. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Breakout Moment: Here’s Why ETH Could Skyrocket to $15,000 Soon Furthermore, besides the impending surge in volatility, Ethereum’s market behaviour continues to diverge from that of Bitcoin, with its performance holding relatively steady even amid broader market shifts. Analysts from QCP Capital have pointed out that despite recent market uncertainties, including significant movements of Bitcoin by the US government, ETH has managed to sustain its market position more effectively than its counterpart. The analysts noted: ETH spot has performed relatively well compared to BTC following Trump’s speech, with ETHBTC gaining 5% since, despite its fourth consecutive day of spot ETF outflows. Why the strength in ETH? The market might be becoming immune to headline outflow figures due to the rotation from more expensive ETHE to the cheaper ETFs. They note that if the current trend of outflows from instruments like the Grayscale Ethereum Trust begins to slow, and inflows into Ethereum ETFs pick up, “could ETH break significantly higher?” Suggesting a trade idea, the QCP Capital analysts added: While we maintain a range-trading outlook for BTC as re-iterated yesterday, we favor accumulating ETH at its current discount, as volatility has picked up slightly. Ethereum and Bitcoin Market Performance While both Ethereum and Bitcoin have seen a negative performance in price over the past week, there remains a notable difference when being specific. For instance, over the past week, Bitcoin has decline by 1.4% however, Ethereum on the other hand has plunged 4.2% over the same period. Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours, Ethereum has seen an increase of 1.2% bringing its price to trade at $3,314 while Bitcoin still remains in the red down by 1.4% over the same period to trade at a price of $66,292, at the time of writing.
