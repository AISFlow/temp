42424224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lhRh,1637796600,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Falls in Pre-Holiday Trading; Ether Drops,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin remains around $57,000 a day before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday while tether’s discount to the Chinese yuan mostly recovers from the extended shock of China’s September crypto trading ban.  Technician’s take: Initial signs of downside exhaustion could stabilize the intermediate-term uptrend from July. Volatility expected to rise.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,002 -1.1%  Ether (ETH): $4,250 -2.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin spent most of Wednesday trading below $57,000 with low trading volume, as the U.S. enters the Thanksgiving holiday. Ether dropped below $4,300, a more than 2% decline.  Meanwhile, a recovery in the price for the USDT/CNY (tether/Chinese yuan) pair indicated the market in China is slowly recovering from the country’s September severe ban on crypto trading, according to the Hong Kong-based crypto financial service provider Babel Finance.  Babel Finance wrote in its weekly newsletter dated Nov. 22 that tether’s quoted prices in the yuan on the over-the-counter (OTC) market have recovered in the past week.  Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the Asian currency, but tether has traded at a significant discount since China’s ban.  A recovery from this discount indicates that China’s crypto market has returned to normal from the ban, which could be good news for the markets due to China’s historical significance in crypto.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Held Support at $53K, Faces Initial Resistance Around $60K  Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above its 100-day moving average, which is currently at $53,700. The cryptocurrency was trading around $57,000 at press time and could see further upside toward the $60,000 resistance level over the short term.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is almost oversold, similar to what occurred in late-July and September, which preceded near-50% price rallies. Still, buyers will need to break above the $60,000-$65,000 resistance zone in order to yield upside price targets.  Price momentum is slowing on the daily chart, although initial signs of downside exhaustion could stabilize the intermediate-term uptrend from July. Volatility will likely return into the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which could lead to sharp price movements over the weekend.

According to data compiled by DeFi Llama, Elrond – a layer 1 smart-contract platform that leverages the web assembly (WASM) virtual machine – is now the 10th largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem with $2.06 billion in TVL.  Elrond, which went live on mainnet in July 2020, has been slow to attract developers but is now rising quickly on the back of a massive liquidity mining program from the Maiar decentralized exchange.  The sudden surge for the chain could be a sign of the continued significance of what Yearn.Finance founder Andre Cronje described as “liquidity locusts” – traders who hop from project to project, feasting on incentives – as a growing number of chains attempt to buy their way into relevance with gargantuan incentive programs.  On Nov. 19, Maiar announced a $1.29 billion liquidity mining program, with $282 million set to distribute in the first month of activity.  However, the rewards are denominated in Maiar’s MEX governance token, which has rallied since the start of the program to $0.001345. With 5.44 trillion MEX set to be distributed over the course of a year, the value of the program currently sits at $7.32 billion worth of incentives – likely the largest liquidity mining program in DeFi history, assuming prices remain stable.  Additionally, in an interview with CoinDesk, Elrond Network CEO Beniamin Mincu said that an initial airdrop of MEX tokens to Elrond EGLD token stakers helped to bootstrap usage.  “With 60,000 users who could claim MEX based on their EGLD holdings before go-live, the Maiar DEX had an impressive Day 1 user count, which keeps increasing,” he said.  Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum is ahead of Elrond in TVL at $2.35 billion, and Waves is 11th with $1.5 billion. The Ethereum mainnet leads all chains with a commanding $171.9 billion – well over half of DeFi’s aggregate $260 billion in value managed by various protocols.  As the competition heats up between layer 1s to attract users and funds, projects are increasingly turning to massive incentive programs to stand out. Harmony, Fantom, Avalanche and Oasis are a few of the leaders that have turned to the tactic or are planning to, but so far not at Maiar and Elrond’s scale.  Mincu said that Elrond currently has functioning cross-chain bridges to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom and Tron, and that more DeFi verticals will be coming to Elrond in the coming months, including lending and synthetic assets.",POSITIVE,EGLD,ETH | MINING | ARB | EGLD | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/24/elrond-leapfrogs-into-defis-top-10-as-users-chase-ridiculously-large-incentive-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc895c4e1a8bd2f7ee179a2e612eea1343095ad1-5312x2988.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424223,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lhPh,1637788618,Market Wrap: Higher Volatility Expected in Bitcoin and Ether,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Wednesday as bitcoin traded in a tight range around $56,000. Technical indicators suggest downside is limited around the $53,000 support level, which could keep buyers active toward $60,000 resistance.  Trading volume is expected to decline over the next few days, especially on the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday Thursday. Still, some analysts expect volatility to increase in the bitcoin and ether options market as November comes to a close.  Rising volatility could cause sharp price moves over the next few days, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period.  In observance of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, Market Wrap will return on Monday, November 29.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,420, -0.65%  Ether (ETH): $4,271, -2.51%  S&P 500: $4,701, +0.23%  Gold: $1,788, -0.12%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.63%  “The market as a whole will stay rangebound in the short term. BTC has failed above $60K a few times and it will take some doing to break through that level,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, a crypto derivatives trading platform, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “We should expect downward pressure and higher volatility on all risky assets including BTC, but $1 trillion market capitalization level (currently around $53K BTC) should hold as a good support for bitcoin in the short term,” Balani wrote.  Prepare for higher volatility  Some analysts expect an increase in bitcoin and ether options volatility, which means sharp price movements could occur over the next few days.  Bitcoin’s daily implied volatility has declined since May and could be set for a near-term rise from relatively low levels. “Unlike traditional equities markets, where price volatility generally occurs to the downside, bitcoin can express significant price volatility in both directions due to leveraged perpetual futures trading,” crypto asset manager Two Prime wrote in a report earlier this week.  Additionally, “with bitcoin leverage ratios still relatively high, further price declines could set off a cascade of liquidations which could see bitcoin rapidly test its 100-day moving average (currently around $53K BTC),” Two Prime wrote.  Similar to bitcoin, ether’s volatility has also trended lower, albeit with greater swings. This is likely due to more speculative interest in the options market for ETH relative to BTC.  As shown in the chart above, “when implied volatility (options market expectations of future volatility) is substantially higher than realized volatility (the actual price fluctuation during past trading ranges), an increase in the latter is usually around the corner and long volatility options positions pay exponential returns,” Two Prime wrote.  Altcoin roundup  SHIB slumps as large holders take profits: Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed “dogecoin killer,” may still have its passionate following but it was in the red again Wednesday following three consecutive weeks of losses. Blockchain data showed the loss followed profit-taking by large SHIB token holders, as the crypto market moved to risk-off mode, a situation when traders reduce their exposure to riskier assets.  eToro to limit ADA and TRX for U.S. customers; coin prices fall: Trading platform eToro will be limiting the crypto assets of Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) for U.S. customers starting in December due to “business-related considerations in the evolving regulatory environment,” according to a statement on eToro’s website. At one point after the announcement was published ADA prices dropped by more than 6%. At press time, TRX was down 2.4%.  Metaverse platform The Sandbox’s SAND token surges 25%: The bullish move in SAND, the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain-based virtual world The Sandbox, gathered steam after a tweet by Adidas, a German sporting goods manufacturing giant, seemed to confirm a relationship between the two companies.

42424206,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lgzh,1637781788,Salvadoran Ambassador to US: Bitcoin Challenges Your Authority,"By approving bitcoin as legal tender and announcing plans to build a “Bitcoin City,” El Salvador is one step ahead of everyone else in pushing the mainstream adoption of bitcoin, and that seems to be a threat to other countries, including the United States, according to Milena Mayorga, El Salvador’s ambassador to the U.S.  “They are afraid and concerned because a lot of countries are looking at us, and they will follow our leadership,” Mayorga said in an interview with CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday.  In September, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender, sending shock waves through the international monetary establishment. That, and other increasingly ambitious plans to put bitcoin at the center of its economy, are wagers that America’s global influence is waning.  “I know the concerns here in D.C. are about losing the power of the dollar and we can understand that, but El Salvador has to move on [because] it wants to be on a different level,” Mayorga said. El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender in 2001 after the failure of its native currency, the colón.  Concerns about El Salvador’s monetary experiment are widespread. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to strengthen the regulation and supervision of bitcoin use in the country, noting the “significant risks” that come with the cryptocurrency.  El Salvador will be closely watched in 2022. Besides its recently announced “Bitcoin City,” a low-tax, legal municipality pitched as a mecca for wealthy bitcoin investors, the Central American country plans to raise $1 billion via a bitcoin bond, a tokenized financial instrument in partnership with Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream.  Although no other country has yet to follow El Salvador in putting bitcoin on equal footing as the U.S. dollar, many are beginning to think seriously about digital currencies. Neighboring Honduras and Guatemala, for instance, are both studying central bank digital currencies.

India has reportedly joined the list of people to go all out, as they are on track to ban all but a few private cryptocurrencies after the government announced on Tuesday it was introducing a new financial regulation bill. The back and forth affair with India and crypto continues. A bill was recently presented, and sets to shake things up for many of big name coins in India.

42420833,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlJN,1637781573,SHIB Slumps as Large Holders Take Profits,"Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, may still have its passionate following but it was in the red again Wednesday, following three consecutive weeks of losses.  The loss followed profit-taking by large SHIB token holders, as the crypto market moved to a risk-off mode, a situation when traders reduce their exposure to riskier assets, according to blockchain data.  “Crypto markets are currently in a risk-off mode following the new highs made by bitcoin and ether [about] two weeks back,” blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a written response to CoinDesk, adding that it’s “natural to see higher beta assets like SHIB to dip in price as investors de-risk.”  At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.0000370, down 11.89% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari.  According to Nansen, an increasing number of wallets with significant holdings have been reducing their SHIB positions recently, possibly due to profit-taking.  Data from blockchain data firm Santiment shows similar trends. So-called whale transaction counts, or the number of SHIB transactions valued more than $100,000, have been rising since the beginning of November. Active deposits, or the amount of daily unique addresses to deposit SHIB to centralized exchanges, have also been increasing.  A spike in the active deposit metric may indicate a rise in short-term sell pressure for the token, according to Santiment’s metric explainer.  “Like any asset, SHIB price is the product of supply and demand ... a larger percentage of SHIB buyers were evidently attracted by its speculative appeal alone,” Rick Delaney, a senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Drawn by the asset’s rising price, many SHIB investors simply do not have the long-term conviction needed to hold their positions or to reenter the market while the price is dropping.”  Falling trading volume  While SHIB was once the most traded token on centralized exchanges, its trading volume has dropped significantly, as CoinGecko’s data shows.  Nansen said that trading volume is among the most important metrics for SHIB and other meme tokens because a drop in trading volume shows that investors start to lose interest and become more “cautious” of putting money in the meme-themed tokens.  The most traded alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on centralized exchanges now are gaming-related tokens, including decentraland (MANA) and the sandbox (SAND), according to CoinGecko.  “SHIB’s price fall can be mostly attributed to the recent shift in investors’ interest from meme tokens to metaverse projects,” crypto price-tracking site CoinMarketCap wrote in a response to CoinDesk. “That can easily be seen by comparing the trading volume of MANA, SAND and SHIB.  “Trading volume is always related to investors’ interest in a project,” it added.  Social media buzz around the canine-themed coin has also sunk dramatically. At the time of publication, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 22 for the search query “SHIB” globally, down from a peak at 100 at the end of October.  A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time. A value of 22 means fewer people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.  Silver lining  Despite declining social media buzz around the meme token, retail investors’ interest in SHIB remains strong as the number of unique addresses holding SHIB continues to increase – good news for the SHIBArmy.  The number of unique addresses holding SHIB surpassed one million on Nov. 11 – a time when SHIB’s prices were already dropping, according to Nansen data.  “Retail interest is definitely there still, as people take speculative bets,” Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen, said. “[No one] wants to miss out on getting rich.”",NEGATIVE,MANA | SHIB,BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/24/shib-slumps-as-large-holders-take-profits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddc3ffa9c01ff58fdfa5b9a6c24b470dba90252e-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411623,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLBN,1637779839,El Salvador: Who Needs the IMF When You Have Bitcoin?,"Christopher Nolan’s third Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, in part because it’s so easily read as a celebration of neoliberal authoritarianism. The film’s plot has the villain, Bane, take over Gotham City, wipe out all financial ledgers and reign over a kind of mega-Occupy movement. To fight back, Batman engages in a series of moral compromises that he justifies as, more or less, necessary exceptions to defend a more broadly just system.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The International Monetary Fund has been playing the Batman role in the global order for decades. Though nominally aimed at supporting democracy and free markets, reforms mandated by the IMF in exchange for its loans have historically included serious cuts to social spending and industrial policy. The fallout is often devastating: The IMF’s (real world) body count is considerably higher than Batman’s.  El Salvador, a country with low income and high debt, has been in negotiations with the IMF for one of its loans in the amount of $1.3 billion. One roadblock has been the country’s recent adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF signaled it wasn’t too happy with that idea.  On Monday, El Salvador introduced a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” that could present at least a partial end-run around the IMF, highlighting why bitcoin made the IMF so queasy in the first place. “The Dark Knight Rises” contains a notorious moment, drawn from the Batman comics, in which Bane pummels Batman so badly that his back is broken, leaving him paralyzed and vulnerable. That’s about how the IMF is going to feel if El Salvador finds a way to raise large sums of international financing, as a developing country with a troubled economy, without the IMF or corruption-riddled global banks.  The bond allows purchases in units of $100, using bitcoin or tether. It will be issued by Bitfinex, an essentially stateless and unregulated platform. So there are probably few if any controls on who can buy into this bond, either by source or by amount.  That means one simple thing: El Salvador will absolutely sell out of this bond, and will probably be able to issue another round. It will replace that $1.3 billion from the IMF without breaking a sweat, even taking into account that about half of the first bond sale will go into a bitcoin fund.  There doesn’t need to be any further explanation of this than “Bitcoiners are nuts and rich,” and would gladly pump money into this small country for the lulz. More seriously, every one of these experiments that pans out is another win for bitcoin, so pitching in is also a matter of enlightened self-interest. Remember that an Ethereum DAO just raised $40 million for what was essentially a vaguely civic-minded prank – $1 billion for an actual bond with an actual return is nothing.  Let’s leave aside the touted “Bitcoin City” El Salvador says it wants to build using the other half of the first bond. That’s mostly a marketing stunt: For $500 million, at best the country will get a couple of power plants, a server farm and an IHOP. And that’s actually fine! Assuming El Salvador follows through in broad strokes, you do need some kind of infrastructure to support the mining facilities, so whether or not it’s a “city” right off the bat is a matter of semantics. And $500 million of new capital in the small country will have a major impact regardless of how it’s spent.  Read more: The ‘Bitcoin City’ Fantasy – Dan Kuhn  So, kudos to El Salvador for burning down Wall Street and building a throne out of the skulls of predatory bankers. That said, the bond might not be a terribly great investment.  For one thing, it introduces political counterparty risk to your bitcoin strategy. This is a country that only emerged from near-anarchy in 1994, and while President Nayib Bukele seems to have sturdy popularity, a disruptive change in leadership or the political order could mean creditors don’t get paid back. That’s not necessarily likely, but it’s on the table in a way that it’s not with, say, U.S. Treasury bonds (or just buying bitcoin yourself).  Also, Blockstream’s projection that the bond will return 165% annually over 10 years is based on the bet that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by that time. I consider that completely possible, but also completely unknowable. A 10-year projection for literally any asset is pretty much always going to be a made-up number.

42424218,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lhFh,1637777650,European Council Takes One Step Closer to Ratifying Landmark Crypto Regulation,"The European Union’s (EU) proposed framework for regulating crypto is one step closer to ratification.  On Wednesday, the European Council, which sets the EU’s political agenda, adopted its position on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, according to a statement on its website. This means that the Council and the European Parliament can now enter into negotiations on the proposal before it is formally adopted as law. This agreement also formed the Council’s negotiating mandate for discussing MiCA with the European Parliament.  The MiCA framework broadly captures cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and promises to make it simpler for crypto firms to expand throughout the EU by facilitating a passportable license.  Created in the wake of Facebook’s plans for issuing a “basket-backed stablecoin” or cryptocurrency pegged to the value of a combination of other assets or currencies, MiCA places a heavy emphasis on regulating stablecoin issuers in particular. The proposed MiCA framework referred to this type of stablecoin as “asset-referenced tokens” and dedicated about a fifth of the package to outlining requirements for issuers of these tokens.  The European Council’s own 405-page negotiation mandate for MiCA shows the EU might not be easing up on issuers of asset-referenced tokens, stating they should “be subject to more stringent requirements than issuers of other cryptoassets.”  The negotiation mandate also contained a number of exceptions to the MiCA framework. For one, the Council has agreed that credit institutions authorized under the EU’s capital requirements directive “should not need another authorisation under [MiCA] in order to issue asset-referenced tokens.” These institutions, the document said, should also be exempt from the capital requirements stablecoin issuers are required to maintain under MiCA.  The Council’s document also said that the MiCA regulations do not apply to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) “including digital art and collectibles, whose value is attributable to each cryptoasset’s unique characteristics and the utility it gives to the token holder.”  The document said that the regulations also do not apply to tokens “representing services or physical assets that are unique and not fungible, such as product guarantees or real estate.”  Other potential exceptions include crypto assets that are offered for free or as rewards, and transactions between global organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.  “It is appropriate to exempt certain intragroup transactions and some public entities from the scope as they do not pose risks,” the document said.

Arca, which had a total of $500 million in assets under management as of the third quarter, began accepting investments in the Arca NFT Fund on Nov. 15 and has so far raised $11.4 million from 68 inventors toward its total $30 million goal.  Arca tells CoinDesk the fund is only open to existing Arca limited partners (LPs) and is already oversubscribed.  “We decided to create a standalone vehicle based on the lifecycle of the NFT ecosystem … [that] was mature enough for a fund but still very early,” Sumana Maitra, Arca’s chief marketing officer, told CoinDesk in an email.  Sasha Fleyshman is the portfolio manager for the Arca NFT Fund and Jeff Dorman will oversee as CIO.  Last month, Arca entered the world of early-stage investments with the Endeavor Fund. The fund closed above its $30 million goal and has put money behind Bitwave, Lattice and BlockchainSpace.  Asked to compare the Endeavor Fund to the NFT Fund, Maitra said Endeavor looks at early-stage investments across many sectors, including NFTs and gaming, but will predominantly invest in companies supporting NFT growth via equity and token investments.  “The NFT fund focuses on investing in the actual NFTs themselves, many of which have immediate cash flows and yields and unique properties that accrue directly to the token holder,” Maitra told CoinDesk.  Investment focuses for the Arca NFT Fund will include digital property, in-game assets, art and collectibles and how NFTs interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), to name a few.  Arca’s NFT fund marks the latest venture capital bet on digital assets. In a research note published last month, Bank of America said VC investments in the sector surpassed $17 billion for the first half of 2021, up from $5.5 billion in the same period last year.

The students were notified on Nov. 13 in an email from ConsenSys Academy, an educational branch of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based company. While they already finished most of their coursework, the suspension means students won’t receive certificates of completion.  “We are saddened to have to tell you that, effective immediately, we are suspending your enrollment in ConsenSys Academy and your access to the platform,” read the email, which two students separately shared with CoinDesk. It was sent at 1:30 a.m. local time in Iran. “A recent review of our records shows that you indicated that you are located in a country that we are prohibited from providing goods or services to under U.S. law.”  The move represents an abrupt turnabout for ConsenSys, which had offered the $985 course to Iranian students for free and in the past talked openly about its scholarships for Iranian women.  It’s unclear what triggered the company’s drastic change of course. Elo Gimenez, ConsenSys’ global public relations lead, would say only: “ConsenSys is committed to building the digital economy of tomorrow and also to complying with U.S. law in all its facets. That commitment is reflected in our terms of service.”  The switch underscores the latent tension between sanctions, a policy tool to isolate rogue regimes, and blockchains, decentralized networks unconstrained by geographic borders. While sending money from the U.S. to Iran is clearly prohibited, simply teaching citizens of a sanctioned country to use censorship-resistant technology is a more ambiguous matter.  The suspensions come two months after Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in a sanctions case brought by the U.S. over a speech he gave at a conference in North Korea. Griffith was previously expected to fight the charge in court.  Long-tense relations between the U.S. and Iran were further strained this month after two incidents in the Sea of Oman.  ConsenSys has been raising money over the course of 2021: The VC-backed entity got a fresh $65 million in April and $200 million in November, with mainstream finance heavyweights such as JPMorgan, Mastercard, HSBC and UBS among the investors.  Whatever the reason for ConsenSys Academy’s decision, it left the students, who lost access to the course materials a few weeks before the program’s scheduled ending on Dec. 1, frustrated and bewildered.  “We are not entering a genuinely new world, but we are just witnessing a transition of our old institutional relations, which are the relations of inequality and power, to just new forms and institutions,” one of the students, Salman Sadeghi, a researcher at the College of Dublin in Ireland, wrote in an emotional blog post.  Recent college graduate Mohammad Hosein Ahmadzadeh told CoinDesk that being abruptly cut off from ConsenSys Academy felt like a bitter deja vu: websites like Coursera and GitHub have previously restricted access for users from Iran. (Coursera later restored access.)  “Especially when [Donald] Trump was president, Iranians couldn’t use these sites,” Mohammad added. “We can’t access any education sites with Iranian IP or nationality.”  Gray area  When asked whether, as a general matter, sanctions bar U.S. companies from teaching blockchain programming to Iranians, a Treasury Department spokesman said such questions cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.  The Treasury would need to have an extensive discussion with the company to make any kind of assessment, said the spokesperson, declining to comment further.  Sanctions experts interviewed by CoinDesk gave differing opinions on the risk of violating sanctions for U.S. companies that provide education to Iranians and the potential severity of any penalties.  While education is normally not subject to the sanctions the U.S. imposed on Iran, there are some intricate caveats, said Benjamin Hutten, counsel at the law firm Buckley LLP.  For example, it’s only legal to provide learning materials that are a complete product, available in full from the start. This means that “it would probably be permitted to export books, pre-recorded courses or lectures,” but not teach a live lecture, for example, via Zoom, because it “would not be fully in existence at the time of the sale,” Hutten said. (ConsenSys Academy’s course included live content, according to a person familiar with the program.)  It’s easier with traditional learning formats, when to study with an American teacher one needs to go through the emigration process and effectively get approved as a foreign student by the U.S., Hutten said. Accredited academic institutions, like universities, can provide remote courses to Iranian students if those students previously had a U.S. student visa and the coursework was part of regular degree studies, Hutten said.  “If a company can keep [its] crypto educational activities within the above constraints, there should be relatively low risk in doing so,” he said. If not, the consequences can be either a significant monetary penalty or even criminal charges for a willful violation, Hutten said.  Given the exemption under sanctions law for informational materials, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “has not been in the habit of publicly penalizing companies providing education or educational materials to Iran, and it certainly has not imposed severe penalties in this sphere,” Hutten said.  However, the agency “has discretion to make the penalty fit the circumstances, and thus to the extent that the information or education could be or is used to violate or evade sanctions, the penalties could be more severe.”  Read more:ConsenSys AG Shareholders Readying Legal Action Over Share Valuation  Daniel Tannebaum, a former OFAC officer and partner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm, told CoinDesk that the language of sanctions laws can be confusing to people who don’t regularly deal with them, and “confusion about potential non-compliance can force businesses to abandon what could potentially be lawful activities.”  Although the case of Virgil Griffith apparently scared people in the industry, Tannebaum said he believes that spreading knowledge about blockchain technology and digital assets is not damaging, but helping what the U.S. is trying to achieve in Iran.  “Blockchain and digital assets may benefit the government of Iran, but they also benefit the Iranian population in breaking out of their existing banking system as they try to look for more freedom, assuming broader sanctions relief,” Tannebaum said. “That being said, the sanctions are still heavily in effect. So if you find that you’re dealing with someone who is physically located in Iran, that is a sanctions-related risk.”  The safest way to proceed for a company would be to reach out to OFAC and ask for specific guidance, “but you might not get a specific answer,” Tannebaum said.  According to Amber Scott, founder and CEO of Canadian consulting firm Outlier Solutions, the risks for American companies providing services to countries under U.S. sanctions are quite real.  “The U.S. has a stricter sanctions regime than other countries, as well as more severe consequences for violation,” Scott told CoinDesk. “It’s correct for institutions to take a cautious approach.”  When it comes to technology, even giving people knowledge about circumventing the sanctions regime, which cryptocurrencies can do, can be considered a violation, Scott said. The case of Virgil Griffith definitely made the blockchain community in the U.S. stop and reconsider their approach to interaction with sanctioned jurisdictions, she added.  Hope still lingers  Earlier this year, ConsenSys Academy’s team seemed excited about educating Iranians, who often find themselves excluded from the global IT market. Last year, a group of seven Iranian women got a chance to study Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, for free thanks to ConsenSys Academy grants.  The project was put together with the help of a local crypto association CoinIran. It was meant as “a diplomatic mission to give this opportunity to folks who need it,” as Coogan Brennan, then head of developer relations and now director of ConsenSys Academy, told CoinDesk in February.  This year, the program was expanded so that 50 students from Iran were enrolled in September. Since then they all but finished the course and had been working on their final projects when the news came of their suspensions.  Thessy Mehrain, a ConsenSys alumna and one of the creators of the program for Iranian students, said that Iran has a lot of tech talent, and people with coding skills should be able to contribute to development of Web 3 – a future decentralized internet – regardless of where they are geographically.  “Those are the same people who can work on a world that works better for everyone, because we build technology that helps to collaborate, build reliable reputation and verify transactions,” Mehrain wrote to CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message.  For Iranians, crypto provides a way to find jobs and earn money outside the country.  “Because of sanctions, in Iran we can’t buy things, transfer money, participate in classes or have a bank account outside of Iran, and I think blockchain can help us to solve part of this injustice,” said Ahmadzadeh, the recent graduate.  Read more:Here’s What We Know About Suex, the First Crypto Firm Sanctioned by US  Some of the students are still hoping the situation can be resolved. As a temporary fix, students who live in other countries and did not choose Iran as their country during registration still can access the course, course participants interviewed by CoinDesk said. They are sharing the content with others so that people can finish their work, said one of the students, Navid Hosseini, who works as a developer at a crypto exchange he wouldn’t name.  However, it won’t help students get official certificates from ConsenSys, which could provide “a springboard” for Iranian blockchain coders, Hosseini said.  “I have known ConsenSys for many years for their products like MetaMask and Infura and I have known that they are one of the leading companies in the blockchain sector,” he said. “So, attending and passing this course was crucial for me and many other students that I know.”  Reza Ghasemi, a cryptography professor at Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran, wanted to learn smart contracts coding so he could pass that knowledge on to his students, he said. That, in turn, would give them better career opportunities.  In the end, Iranians are still enrolling in PhD programs abroad, he added, and he himself has been working on academic projects with colleagues in Canada and Turkey – although he doesn’t want to publicly name the academic institutions so as not to cause problems for them.  He added he still hopes that the program’s mentors, which are the previous year’s students, can negotiate some solution with ConsenSys so that this year’s students finish their projects and get their certificates.  Ghasemi said he believes the company gave in to pressure from overly cautious lawyers.  “I believe that ConsenSys doesn’t like to do that, to ban us,” he said.

Animoca Brands said it will cover the loss of 265 ETH, worth about $1.1 million, from the hack involving a game called “Phantom Galaxies” that is being developed by its Australia-based subsidiary, Blowfish Studios.  Animoca noted there was no evidence that smart contracts were compromised, and no funds were stolen from the game or from its developer or publisher.  According to the firm, last week hackers managed to access the Discord account of Phantom Galaxies and take over its server. The hackers then posted a fraudulent announcement claiming that the game was launching a non-fungible token (NFT) minting event.  The hackers directed users to a website charging users a 0.1 ETH fee that sent the funds on to the hackers’ Ethereum address. The total sent was 265 ETH, or roughly, $1.1 million.

42420838,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlNV,1637757000,Which Comes First: DeFi Utility or Yield?,"As a sub-industry of crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi) has undeniably become a productive economy, generating billions of dollars in fees and distributing vast wealth to project founders and users.  In that arises the chicken or the egg question. Are users using these applications out of genuine want/need or are token incentives and yield artificially boosting demand?  There’s probably no clear answer to this because the outsized yield and real adoption are likely a positive feedback loop. This loop, in turn, bolstered the current market where users can earn yield on both sides of lending platforms or earn 50% annual interest in trading fees and token incentives for supplying stablecoin liquidity to exchanges.  There would likely be consensus within the DeFi community that these conditions are not sustainable and will come and go with speculation. Notably, yields dropped harshly in the early summer as asset prices fell and trading volume slowed. How much worse could it be in a sustained bear market like the one we experienced in 2018-2020?  Compound, a DeFi lending market, recently released a Q3 report, a first within the industry. The report highlighted that when token incentives were factored in, protocol earnings were negative. Compound has essentially been trading equity to rent liquidity that may or may not be sticky when it eventually decides to stop emitting COMP in coming years, as per the Compound governance model.  This is true for essentially the whole industry, outside of OpenSea, Maker, Uniswap and maybe a handful of others. For example, according to Banteg’s Dune dashboard, Curve emitted 33.3 million CRV to liquidity providers over the past 30 days worth $156 million. During the same period, Curve had $5.7 million in earnings for its protocol and token holders.  Read more: How Yield Farming on Curve Is Quietly Conquering DeFi  At face value, this would appear to be unsustainable, but Curve has created such important usage for its token that emissions do not equate to selling pressure. In fact, CRV’s inflationary mechanics have arguably brought in over $20 billion in liquidity to the exchange and been the largest reason for high trading volume and decent revenue accrual.  For every Curve there are easily 100 protocols that use inflationary tokenomics for short-term speculation and attention. Inflation and yield without adoption are a recipe for disaster, but a handful of successful early-stage protocols are eager to showcase how they can thrive in the long term.  Will a bear market show us whether these governance tokens are a way to bootstrap an ecosystem or if they are a complex way to dump on speculators?  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  ConstitutionDAO was outbid on a copy of the Constitution by Citadel CEO Ken Griffin. BACKGROUND: ConstitutionDAO was one of the first examples of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) intersecting with the real world, highlighting both the potential and limitations of group work and collective thinking. The DAO crowdsourced over $40 million in capital in under a week.  Ethereum Research is planning how to best mitigate the downsides of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) on the proof-of-stake network. BACKGROUND: Flashbots has suggested creating a third-party block constructor that will closely resemble the current Flashbots marketplace. The mechanism will allow solo stakers to participate in maximizing block value and in theory distribute the roll of MEV on the network.  Binance plans to open withdrawal to Arbitrum, becoming a ramp to Ethereum’s layer 2. BACKGROUND: Binance, arguably the largest crypto exchange and backer of Binance Smart Chain, will be one of the first exchanges to offer deposits and withdrawals to an Ethereum roll-up. Bypassing Ethereum’s high transaction fees, the move will bring greater accessibility to DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other on-chain activity.  Consistently high activity on Ethereum keeps ether in the deflationary zone. BACKGROUND: Base fees on the network have consistently outweighed block rewards, burning more ether than is emitted each day. If demand remains similar to current levels, the native asset will become much more scarce after the merge to proof-of-stake, where validation emissions are much lower.  Factoid of the week  Open comms  Valid Points incorporates information and data about CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator in weekly analysis.

42396464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3c0K,1637749285,"Stablecoin Tether Crashes on Indian Exchanges, Traders Buy The Dip","Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market value, has turned volatile on Indian exchanges amid renewed regulatory uncertainty. And savvy traders are profiting from the price instability.  The cryptocurrency launched to help mitigate volatility associated with other digital assets should always be worth $1 or rupees (₹) 74.37, as per the current dollar-rupee or USD/INR exchange rate.  However, on Tuesday, USDT crashed on prominent local platforms, hitting as low as ₹60 on the Mumbai-based WazirX exchange while maintaining the 1:1 peg with the dollar on western exchanges.  The move happened after the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Parliament) bulletin said the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, seeking to ban all private cryptocurrencies, could be discussed during Parliament’s impending winter session scheduled to begin on Nov. 29.  Some traders took advantage of the mispricing and bought tether at a discount. “There was an arbitrage opportunity in buying USDT at Rs. 60 to sell it at the peg or premium,” trader Swarang Tanksali told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. “I purchased tether around ₹62 on CoinDCX exchange.”  At press time, tether is changing hands around ₹74 on Indian exchanges, according to data source gadgets.ndtv.com.  MintingM, an India-based crypto asset management company, said many traders could not take advantage of the mispricing as a sudden spurt in trading volumes in the wake of regulatory news led to technical glitches on major exchanges. “Many investors were unable to transfer money to exchanges,” MintingM said. “Those holding INR on exchanges could take the gambit.”  Blockchain security researcher Mudit Gupta said it’s primarily small traders taking advantage of the mispricing. “Since crypto is in the grey area [in terms of lack of regulatory clarity], no big market maker touches it in India,” Gupta said in a Twitter chat.  While tether has recovered to trade pretty much in line with the USD/INR exchange rate, it is still short of the price of ₹80 observed ahead of the crash. Tether typically trades at a premium of around 5% on Indian exchanges due to high demand.  Not the first crash  In late January, tether suffered a similar meltdown, falling from ₹80 to ₹61 after the then-Lok Sabha bulletin cited the bill for banning cryptocurrencies as part of the government’s parliamentary agenda.  As seen above, the decline was quickly reversed, and the bill was never scheduled in the Parliament.  The draft of the bill to be introduced in the winter session seems to be the same as in January. The bill seeks to ban private cryptocurrencies while facilitating the development of a digital rupee to be launched by the Reserve Bank of India.  Still, tether crashed along with bitcoin and popular meme tokens dogecoin and shiba inu. The market reaction suggests recent media reports about the government softening its stance on crypto had built expectations for a friendlier language in the bill.  The details of the bill are not available in the public domain. Nishcal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, told CNBC TV-18 early today that the definition of the word “private cryptocurrencies” used in the bill is not clear. Gupta added that lawmakers do not want cryptocurrencies that compete with the rupee.

Three Arrows Capital, Solana Ventures, Polygon Studios, Hashed, Binance Smart Chain’s $1 Billion Growth Fund and executives of GoldenTree Asset Management also participated in the investment.  Gaming guilds like Avocado cluster Platform to Employment (P2E) gamers who are able to earn crypto income from titles such as Axie Infinity.  Guilds often have revenue-sharing agreements and give players initial loans in non-fungible tokens (NFT) to bring them into the game.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Avocado co-founder and CEO Brendan Wong described the guild as a “metaverse of metaverses,” because it enables players to participate in multiple virtual worlds.  “Avocadians,” as users call themselves, not only learn how to earn supplementary income on P2E games, but are trained in how to become Web 3 users, take advantage of opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and become part of a community, Wong told CoinDesk.  The guild will spread its operations to other P2E games using the funds and purchase NFTs and land in virtual worlds, Wong said.  The guild will also boost its scholarship program to over 10,000 members, Wong added. Avocado Guild currently counts 7,000 members, mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia.  Avocado scholars are educated about how to play games like Axie Infinity and are lent NFT assets that the guild purchases from gaming companies, after agreeing to a 50-50 revenue split, according to a company representative. Scholars are free to stop the program at any time, but most of them choose to stay in the community even after their scholarship has ended, Wong said.

To ensure the stability of the digital currency, the consortium, dubbed Digital Currency Forum, is proposing a model similar to how bank deposits work, according to the white paper. The digital yen will be issued by banks as their liability, the paper added.  Members of the Digital Currency Forum, include such banks as MUFG Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Mizuho Bank, Japan Post Bank, industry heavyweights like the Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., East Japan Railway, and Mitsubishi Corp., as well as local governments. The Bank of Japan, Financial Services Agency of Japan and three ministries are observing its activities.  The consortium plans to experiment with large business transactions using the digital yen as early as January, according to the progress report. The consortium’s subcommittee on Settlement in Industrial Distribution, led by Mitsubishi, will be testing “the automatic execution of contracts using digital currency in the settlement of maritime transportation for transactions,” the progress report said.  The consortium will also be releasing a beta version of the digital currency marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by 2022, the progress report said.  The focus on business transactions is a marked difference from China’s digital yuan, set to be the first central bank digital currency (CDBC) to be rolled out by a major economy, which has focused on retail transactions up to this point, with some exceptions.

Kazakhstan has been grappling with electricity shortages, partly caused by an influx of crypto miners from China. The southern part of the country is particularly vulnerable as the region lacks abundant electricity generating plants and the national grid cannot reliably transfer electricity from the energy-rich northern region.  Crypto miners, like Xive and Enegix, have been facing electricity issues since September due to rationing from KEGOC, the national grid operator. KEGOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Xive is preparing a new site for the over 2,500 machines, but “it is clear that mining in south Kazakhstan is not possible anymore,” Bekbau told CoinDesk.  Other miners in south Kazakhstan are also looking for hosting sites for moving their machines but there are “no options” left in the country,” he said. Some have found hosts for their mines in Russia and the U.S., he added.  Last month, the Ministry of Energy released a draft regulation that would cap the buildout of new mines to 100 megawatts. The ministry later said that they would not restrict electricity to lawful mines, as long as it does not jeopardize the national grid.  Recently, the government said it wants to encourage crypto miners to develop independent renewable energy capacity. The industry hopes that after Kazakhstan expands its renewable electricity capacity in the next one-two years, the limit might change, Sapar Akhmetov, chairman of the board of the Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain Technology told CoinDesk.  As of August, Kazakhstan is the world’s second-largest crypto mining country after the U.S., according to data from the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index by the Center for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge.  Bekbau tweeted a video early on Nov. 24 of the last rigs being moved out of the mine.
