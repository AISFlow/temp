42403896,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgzDv,1580332529,"Better Regulation Could Curb Crypto Scams, Chainalysis Report Says","Greater regulations and enforcement can deter some crypto crimes, blockchain forensics provider Chainalysis said in a new report.      The firm's 2020 ""State of Crypto Crime"" report, published Wednesday, offers analysis of illicit activities last year, contrasting 2019's actions with previous years. Chainalysis found that while the amount of bitcoin sent from criminal entities doubled between 2018 and the end of 2019, it still accounts for just 0.08 percent of the total number of bitcoin transactions last year.      And while exchange hacks and thefts dominated headlines last year, “scams were by far the highest-earning category of crypto crime in 2019,” the report said. “Cryptocurrency scams represent a significant danger to consumer protection, and the growth of this activity in 2019 calls for increased action from regulators, law enforcement and exchanges alike.”      According to the report, scammers received roughly $4.3 billion in crypto, out of about $6 billion received from illicit activity last year. Overall, scams accounted for $8.6 billion in crypto transactions, while criminal activity (including hacks and thefts) totaled just under $12.5 billion..      Other categories included terrorism financing, ransomware, darknet markets, outright theft, sanctions and child abuse. Moreover, the total amount of crypto used in scams is disproportionately weighed down by “just three separate large-scale Ponzi schemes”; without them, the numbers drop dramatically (for example, the PlusToken Ponzi appears to have accounted for between $2 and $3 million alone).      Chainalysis mentions at multiple points that a solution, or at least the beginnings of one, to the issue of illicit activity can come from more informed regulation, better enforcement of regulation and action by crypto exchanges to tackle illicit activities.      “We believe the consumer protection implications make cryptocurrency scams an issue regulators must address and law enforcement must have the resources to investigate,” the report said. “Exchanges are also in a unique position to help, both in terms of protecting users from being scammed and preventing successful scammers from depositing funds or cashing out.”      Regulators and law enforcement agents must become more familiar with analyzing blockchains as part of this effort, the report said.      The company also highlights its own services, noting that while money laundering in the fiat world might require court-issued subpoenas to tackle, “blockchain analysis tools like Chainalysis” can help investigators analyze transactions recorded on public ledgers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/29/better-regulation-could-curb-crypto-scams-chainalysis-report-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22aaaa13d87f710420f7ecc8c7dd0916b983bc7c-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431475,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kVh,1580328006,Developers Say Google Play Unfairly Booted Their Bitcoin Rewards Game,"Google recently suspended and removed bitcoin rewards game “Bitcoin Blast” from its Google Play app store for allegedly deceiving users, but it will not explain to the developers what exactly was deceptive about the game.      On Jan. 20, Google pulled Bling's “Bitcoin Blast,” a match-three puzzle game that rewards users with bitcoin-redeemable loyalty points. The Android version of the game had been live on the Play Store since May 2019, CEO Amy Wan told CoinDesk.      Within that time, she said, it amassed 800,000 users, 20,000 ratings and 13,000 written reviews, placing it at the top rank for “bitcoin rewards” searches.      “We worked hard to try to get to where we were,” Wan said of Bling's five-person developer team.      But shortly after Bling submitted a Bitcoin Blast update that featured new marketing taglines (“Earn Free Bitcoin!” “Cash Out Free Bitcoin!”), which Wan said better reflected the current app experience, Google axed it for “deceptive practices.”      A Google Play Store spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.      The Bling team is now unsure how to proceed with future updates; Wan said they still do not know what needs to change.      “If we don’t know what [Google] thinks is deceptive about the game, how can we possibly stop being deceptive?” she said. “We know the game inside and out, and Google is spending maybe a minute reviewing it.”    ‘A black box’    Google’s relationship with the cryptocurrency community has been tenuous for months. The search engine giant, owner and operator of YouTube, Chrome and Android OS has blacklisted crypto content with an often shoot-first mentality, only to then go back and rectify apparent mistakes.      A reporter played the iOS version of Bitcoin Blast for about 25 minutes on Jan. 28, earning slightly more than 1,000 loyalty points – the minimum amount users can convert into bitcoin. Attempts to convert the points were successful; the reporter’s newly made Coinbase account received 103 sats on Jan 29.      But Bling, and the app, may now have to reset. Wan said Google would not let her team fix Bitcoin Blast without submitting an entirely new version under a fresh bundle ID – deleting the game’s amassed history and user reviews. Google has already rejected the company’s first appeal, Wan said.      Google further informed Bling, “Additional suspensions of any nature may result in the termination of your developer account, and investigation and possible termination of related Google accounts,” according to screenshots reviewed by CoinDesk.      If that were to happen, Wan said, it would effectively throttle Bling's entire tech infrastructure, including its iOS app hosted on Google Cloud.      “For us, that was a very serious threat because our business runs on Google,” she said.      After taking news of the suspension to Twitter, Wan said the Google Play developer Twitter account informed her it would grant the appeal and “escalate” her case. But she has not seen any meaningful changes in the Play developer console and is unsure what, if anything, will change.      “I think it is a black box for all app developers, but I think in particular crypto apps are probably more sensitive,” she said.      Wan said the unexplained suspension carries hallmarks of other recent Google actions against crypto programs, services and content.

Surojit Chatterjee spent 11 years at Google, where he worked on payments, adtech and commerce. He most recently led the continuing development of Google Shopping, a service available in more than 90 countries. Prior to that, he was the head of product at Indian e-commerce site Flipkart.      Chatterjee is Coinbase’s first chief product officer since the departure of Jeremy Henrickson in December 2018, the company confirmed.      In his new role Chatterjee will focus on “making the cryptoeconomy accessible to millions more people through Coinbase’s suite of products,” CEO Brian Armstrong said in a statement.      Last November, the exchange added support for five new crypto options to its Visa debit card and began allowing users to earn rewards on their cryptocurrency holdings, starting with the Tezos token.      For his part, Chatterjee became passionate about separating money from the state after growing up in India under government-run banks and seeing the Indian government switch over to new currencies in November 2016, requiring the entire population to either use a bank or a post office to convert their cash. Currently, the Indian government has blocked banks from dealing with the crypto industry but hasn’t outlawed the use of cryptocurrencies themselves.      “I don’t think crypto is the end-all be-all of our problems, but it’s a big piece of the puzzle,” Chatterjee said. “[Coinbase] will revolutionize global financial services in the same way that Google revolutionized the internet.”      In a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance, Coinbase CEO Brian Amstrong said, “Surojit’s 11 years at Google will be valuable as we continue to scale Coinbase into a company with a lasting and meaningful impact on the world’s financial system.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/29/coinbase-hires-google-vp-as-chief-product-officer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fd91c37d72bb2d647347d5f8d2ecac34b152676-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kRh,1580318121,Literally No One Is Trading Bakkt’s Bitcoin Options,"Trading volumes in bitcoin options listed on the Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt platform have completely dried up, even while CME’s options product is seeing strong interest.      As per Bakkt’s data, not a single bitcoin options contract was traded last week on Bakkt, with activity last registered on Jan. 17, when 20 lots had changed hands.      This is happening while the price of bitcoin has rallied to three-month highs, raising the cryptocurrency’s volatility.       Demand for options tends to rise with a spike in volatility, the standard deviation of an asset’s returns that is used as a measure of uncertainty. An options contract gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the specified amount of the underlying on or before the expiration date. A call option gives the holder a right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.      New York-based Bakkt launched the first regulated bitcoin options contract on Dec. 9, having rolled out a cash-settled futures and physically settled futures November and September, respectively.      The physically delivered product, which went live on Sept. 24, was well received by the markets. Trading volumes quadrupled to $4.8 million in one month after launch, as noted by Bakkt Volume Bot, a Twitter account that tracks the exchange’s trades. The solid growth likely motivated Bakkt to offer option contracts on bitcoin.      So far, however, the uptake for its options product has been weak. Bakkt traded a little over $1 million worth of options in the first four weeks since the launch on Dec. 9. The highest contract, worth $500,000, was initiated during the second week.      These numbers appear weak when compared to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) first-day options trading volume of $2.3 million. Trading activity on Bakkt has dwindled particularly since the launch of options on the CME. The CME listed options on Jan. 13, a month after Bakkt's launch. Even so, the Chicago-based exchange is witnessing higher trading volumes; while Bakkt saw no activity last week, the CME traded 59 lots of options.      For now, institutional investors seem to be preferring CME over Bakkt, which isn't surprising as the CME's two-year-old bitcoin futures are among the most liquid derivative products in the cryptocurrency space.       While Bakkt futures witnessed a record trading volume of 6,600 contracts on Dec. 18, the CME futures registered an average daily volume of 6,400 in 2019. However, the difference is substantially more pronounced given that Bakkt’s contracts are for one bitcoin each while the CME futures’ contract size is five bitcoin.       It remains to be seen if Bakkt volume will pick up with a potential rise in price volatility ahead of the mining reward halving due in May or if the CME will continue to dominate the derivatives space.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/29/literally-no-one-is-trading-bakkts-bitcoin-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61e69011be1ca498d348d65f314491c04eaef898-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431480,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kdh,1580317260,Most of MakerDAO's Asset Value Is in Only a Few Addresses,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) market saw a massive upswing in 2019 and its growth is expected to continue in 2020. Yet, only a handful of accounts are responsible for much of the industry’s value.      DeFi is the movement to transform old financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that run on decentralized applications built using smart contract platforms like ethereum.      The most popular DeFi protocol right now is MakerDAO's multi-collateral Dai system, where users create “collateralized debt positions” (CDP) by putting up ether or other ERC-20 tokens as collateral to generate DAI tokens up to two-thirds of the value of the ether.      The generated DAI serves as a debt and can be used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency; it can be freely sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, or held as long-term savings. Since DAI's value is pegged to the U.S. dollar, a user only owes back what he or she initially borrowed with interest.      As of Jan. 17, about $400 million worth of assets used as collateral were locked up in MakerDAO protocol Stability system, according to Digital Assets Data.      Meanwhile, the number of ether tokens locked up on the Dai system has reached an all time high of nearly 2.5 million, about 2.2 percent of the total ether supply.      The amount of DAI locked in DeFI recently rose to $50 million, representing a 65 percent month-on-month growth, according to Arcane Research. The total value locked in various DeFi protocols rose above $800 million earlier this month – up over 236 percent year-on-year, according to defipulse.com.    Concentrated market    Although the DeFi market has exploded over the last 12 months, activity has been dominated by a very small portion of addresses.      On the old Maker protocol, what they now refer to as ""Single-Collateral Sai,"" approximately 155,000 CDPs were created. Yet, 77 percent with positive amounts locked held less than 0.05 ETH ($8.10 as of publication time) as of Jan. 15, Brandon Anderson, data science lead at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk.      Categorizing accounts based on locked pooled ether (PETH) collateral balances shows just how large the disparity is. Just one account holds 171,000 PETH — or 27 percent — of total PETH held on Jan 15.      A similar distribution is seen under the new system launched in November 2019, which now refers to CDPs as ""vaults"" and where the DAI is backed by multiple collaterals.      Again, most accounts are small in size, however, with these addresses holding just 4 percent of the total wrapped ether (WETH) locked. Meanwhile, a single address holds 15 percent of the value locked as of Jan. 15 and another one holds nearly 8 percent. Essentially, two accounts were holding nearly a quarter of total collateral.      The owners of these big accounts are not yet known. ""Neither the Maker Protocol nor the Maker Foundation track personal details of Vault (formerly known as CDP) holders. It's a core component of the decentralized system,"" Mike Porcaro, head of communications at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk.      “The accounts in the lower tier of vaults (lowest balances) appear to be actual adopters with more than 1 ETH being locked into the accounts”', according to Anderson. ""As Maker continues to grow, we will see how these distributions play out and if there is more adoption within the [group of smaller account balances].""      The concentration of ownership is nothing new in crypto, of course. It’s also an issue in the bitcoin market. As of December 2019, only two addresses had 100,000 or more bitcoins, according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.      Most addresses hold under 10 bitcoin, and while there were only 2,022 addresses holding 1,000 to 1 million BTC, these addresses controlled over 40 percent of bitcoin’s total supply.

42431478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kbh,1580309751,Silvergate Bank Adds 48 Crypto Clients in Q4 Even as Deposits Slip 4%,"UPDATE (Jan. 29, 20:59 UTC): Updated with information from Silvergate’s earnings call and comments from a banking analyst.      Silvergate Bank, one of the few U.S. banks serving crypto-related businesses, added more crypto clients in the fourth quarter of 2019 but saw deposits and fee income from those clients drop as institutional investors trade less during a relatively stable bitcoin market.      The La Jolla, Calif.-based bank, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SI in November, released its earnings report before market open on Wednesday. It was the company's first official earnings call as a publicly-traded company and revealed the ups and downs of serving the crypto sector.      Silvergate's earnings report lists a 4 percent decrease in deposits from the digital currency industry despite the addition of 48 crypto clients. The commercial bank’s overall deposits decreased by 1.8 percent in the same quarter (Silvergate also serves non-crypto businesses). Around 74 percent of the bank’s $1.8 billion deposits were non-interest bearing.      Deposits lagged most among institutional investors who have less interest in trading while bitcoin is in a bear market and doesn’t have a lot of daily volatility.      “We don’t pay interest on these deposits, so we experience outflows during times when the opportunity to make outsized returns on trading declines a bit,” Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said in an earnings call Wednesday morning. “That’s why we focus on just continuing to add customers, knowing that when the market comes back and they want to trade their assets, the best way to do that is by putting deposits at Silvergate.”    Client growth    Lane attributed the new client growth to the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between different crypto exchanges. SEN transactions topped 14,400 in the fourth quarter, a 17 percent increase from Q3 2019. This is the highest that SEN transactions have ever been, despite the daily average price of bitcoin declining from Q3 to Q4, Ben Reynolds, Silvergate’s director of corporate development said.      The cost of deposits for the bank, which holds $2.1 billion in assets, increased from 0.5 percent to 0.84 percent. For scale, average deposit costs for small mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75 to 1.25 percent, said KBW analyst Mike Perito.      Silvergate earned $1.4 million in fee income from its crypto customers, down 12.5 percent from $1.6 million last quarter because of a lag in foreign exchange fees. The bank’s fee income is mostly made up of foreign exchange transactions, cash management products such as wires and ACH and send fees for digital currency clients.      The bank added 11 digital currency exchanges (including over-the-counter trading desks), 21 institutional investors and 16 crypto businesses (i.e. mining operations or crypto application companies). Lane noted in the call that there are more than 200 future crypto customers in the bank’s review and onboarding pipeline.      Silvergate’s net income decreased by around 45 percent, from $6.6 million in the third quarter to $3.6 million. It’s net interest margin also dropped from 3.39 percent to 2.97 percent quarter-over-quarter. The bank’s largest expenses came from salaries and employee benefits, which increased in the fourth quarter by nearly 6 percent to $8.7 million.      In response to analysts questions, Lane said that the bank has yet to make a strong correlation between the price or volatility of bitcoin and deposit levels.      “Other banks have mentioned their intention to come into the space and are offering customers some yield,” Lane said. Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York seems to have felt the same pressure of new crypto banking entrants, with its deposits dropping by half over the course of 2019.    Long road    In 2013, Silvergate pivoted from traditional commercial banking to serving the cryptocurrency community as a rich resource of non-interest bearing deposits. The bank then converts these deposits into interest-bearing deposits at other banks, investment securities and loans.      Earlier this month, Silvergate launched the SEN Leverage product in pilot mode, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans that they can then use to buy more bitcoin, similar to margin lending in the traditional markets.      When analysts inquired about the cost of underwriting SEN Leverage loans because of the volatility of the underlying collateral asset, Lane said the institutional investors that will be using the product can add more USD as collateral or pay down the loan at any time through the SEN network.      “The institutional investor has more access to funds,” KBW’s Perito said. “For example, a hedge fund client of Silvergate might only be putting 15 percent of their cash into the digital currency niche and 85 percent of their money in other areas. They have access to cash much more than retail investors buying bitcoin with their savings account money.”      Silvergate also made its first hire directly from the crypto industry, bringing on former Blockstream exec Benjamin Richman as director of digital currency.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/29/silvergate-bank-adds-48-crypto-clients-in-q4-even-as-deposits-slip-4,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3896ee7d0f100ad863524781dc363b0d33add388-1500x851.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, the exchange said returns will be given on a monthly basis starting Feb. 1.      ALGO and ATOM are the only proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies currently available on Binance US, a California-based licensee of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.      Binance US now joins Kraken and Coinbase in offering staking rewards on PoS coins, though the latter two exchanges only offer staking on Tezos (XTZ).      Binance US currently offers 28 cryptocurrencies on its platform. With U.S. compliance laws remaining a top concern for the Binance offshoot, the firm says it’s waiting for further regulatory clarity on Tezos. Binance US CEO Catherine Coley told CoinDesk the exchange hopes to offer additional staking rewards once more PoS assets are listed.      An expected return per coin was not included in the Binance US announcement. Tezos staking returns on both Kraken and Coinbase run at roughly 6 percent, according to network figures.      An alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) mining, staking encourages cryptocurrency holders to participate in the network by depositing their coins in specialized public addresses. Users compound holdings through disbursed network rewards for verifying transactions while bolstering the network’s overall security.      Launched in September 2019, Binance US was launched to cater to U.S. citizens following Binance proper’s booting of U.S. customers earlier that summer.

According to a report by Bloomberg on Tuesday, Vinnik was interviewed by French prosecutors as soon as he was extradited from Greece late last week. Zoe Konstantopoulou, a member of the defense team, said in a news conference Tuesday that Vinnik was a blockchain and computer genius, targeted for his Russian nationality and ""persecuted"" because of the threat he posed to the international banking system.      France has charged Vinnik on counts of extortion, aggravated money laundering, conspiracy and harming automatic data-processing systems, an official at the public prosecutor's office told Bloomberg. Wanted in multiple countries, Vinnik has maintained he is innocent of all charges, arguing he was just an employee of the company.      Vinnik was extradited the same day Greece’s Council of State, the country's supreme administrative court, issued a ruling confirming the extradition was lawful. Having been in detention since July 2017, Vinnik has been on a hunger strike over claims his human rights have been violated. He is currently detained in a French hospital.      “Alexander’s crime is to be Russian and a person with extraordinary technological knowledge that could liberate people economically,” Konstantopoulou said. The defense has also complained against the ""inhumane"" length of his pretrial detention.      The investigation is currently underway and a trial has not yet been ordered.      Once the court case in France is complete, Vinnik's lawyers said he will be extradited back to Greece and to the U.S., where he faces similar charges. Once that case has been completed, he will then be sent to Russia and face charges there.      “The Greek Minister of Justice has in essence decided that this person is going to spend his life being extradited, judged and then re-extradited, re-judged and yet again re-extradited and re-judged,” Konstantopoulou said.      Greece had turned down Russian requests for Vinnik's extradition. Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly raised the matter with then-Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in December 2018, according to Russian media.      Vinnik has previously said he wished to face trial in Russia.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/29/france-charges-alleged-btc-e-operator-alexander-vinnik-following-greek-extradition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/430989369721263dba973f1d5f18c75f6d7728b7-1490x1089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431476,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kXh,1580297454,Bitcoin Eyes Best January Close in 7 Years After 30% Price Increase,"View  Bitcoin's convincing breakout above the 200-day average overnight has opened the doors for a move to $10,000.  The weekly charts are also flashing strong bullish signals.  The case for a quick rise to $10,000 would weaken if prices drop below the 200-day average at 8,894 with strong volumes.    Bitcoin appears set to register its best January price gain in seven years and could soon rise into five figures.      The top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $9,350 – a hefty 30 percent gain from the opening price of $7,160 observed on Jan. 1, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      If the gain is held through Jan. 31, it would be the best starting month to a year since 2013. Back in January 2013, bitcoin had rallied by 54 percent.      From 2015 to 2019, bitcoin has posted losses in January. The cryptocurrency now looks certain to snap that losing streak. The 30 percent rally is the second-best January performance on record.      Bitcoin picked up a strong bid at lows near $6,850 in the first week of this month and rose past $8,000, exiting a six-month-long downtrend. Notably, the breakout happened as the U.S. and Iran came close to war, forcing the analyst community to take note of the cryptocurrency's strengthening safe-haven appeal.      Since then, we've seen a textbook bull move: a steady uptrend with regular low-volume pullbacks testing dip demand.      The price rise is in line with historical data showing the cryptocurrency hits a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a miner reward halving, but before the event, as discussed earlier this month.      With history looking to repeat itself, a further rise to levels above the June 2019 $13,880 before the May 2020 halving (supply-cutting event) cannot be ruled out.      For now, the technical charts do indicate scope for a move above the psychological resistance of $10,000.    Weekly chart    The falling channel breakout confirmed in the first week of January validated a bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-week moving averages (MAs) and opened the doors for a test of resistance at $10,350 (October high).      Supporting the bullish case are the ascending five- and 10-week MAs.      Additionally, the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change, while the relative strength index is on an upward trajectory and is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading.    Daily chart    Bitcoin printed a UTC close above $9,188 (Jan. 19 high) on Tuesday, establishing a fresh higher high and signaling a continuation of the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,850.      More importantly, the move saw bitcoin cross the 200-day moving average (MA) with a positive ""marubozu candle,"" which comprises of little or no wicks and a strong body.      The candle indicates buyers remained in control during the 24-hour period and the cryptocurrency closed near the high point of the day. While bitcoin did see a minor pullback to $8.870 during the U.S. trading hours, the dip only ended up recharging the bulls for a strong move higher.      The positive marubozu candle indicates that bullish sentiment is strong – more so, in this case, as it shows buyers stepped without any hesitation despite prices trading close to 200-day MA, which acted as stiff resistance on Jan. 19.      Some investors may point out that bitcoin's break above the 200-day MA in October turned out to be a bull trap. But back then the overall market sentiment was bearish, with the cryptocurrency trapped in a bearish channel on the weekly chart.      Overall, the broader trend is bullish, as noted. The stage now looks set for a quick move into five figures. Pullbacks cannot be ruled out, though, and the case for a quick rise to $10,000 would weaken if prices fall back below the 200-day MA at $8,894 on the back of a spike in trading volumes.      The weekly chart will continue to paint a bullish picture as long as prices are holding above $8,000.

However, the rise of cryptocurrency in the 2010s allowed for a new channel for investment, one that was all the rage circa 2016 - 2017.

42431479,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kZh,1580289479,Alleged Crypto Ponzi OneCoin May Have Used Flood of Fake Reviews to Boost Ailing Image,"The OneCoin cryptocurrency project – accused by authorities of being a Ponzi scheme – may have attempted to boost its fortunes by using ""inauthentic"" accounts to place favorable reviews on TrustPilot and Quora, according to new research.      The Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), an entity under U.S. think tank The Atlantic Council, said in a report on its blog Wednesday that an ""astroturfing campaign"" came around the same time that OneCoin founder, Ruja Ignatova, disappeared following a number of legal cases against her and other members of the project in 2019.      In March of last year, U.S. prosecutors in New York arrested a man they said was a “top leader” of OneCoin, saying the project stole “billions” from investors through its alleged pyramid scheme. At the same time as Konstantin Ignatov was apprehended, Ignatova was also charged with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.      Mark Scott, the lawyer behind the scheme, was also found guilty of laundering $400 million for OneCoin in New York in November. At around the same time, a number of nations announced they were taking action to protect investors against the project, which used pyramid selling scheme tactics to lure new investors.      DFRLab's researchers found that in October of last year OneCoin received a slew of five-star reviews on consumer ratings site TrustPilot.      ""Of the 579 reviews for OneCoin on the site, 90 percent were positive. Of the five- star ratings, about 400 were published within the span of a single month,"" the post states.      The researchers say a number of one-star reviews were ""buried"" by the flood of positive reviews.      While the lab's team couldn't tell if the reviews came from automated or ""inauthentic"" accounts due to the limits of the TrustPilot user interface, the spike in five-star ratings ""indicated an abnormal influx of favorable reviews just as OneCoin’s public relations and legal woes mounted.""      An analysis of reviewers on question-answering site Quora, however, found profiles posting positively about OneCoin that showed ""signs of inauthentic behavior."" These included an absence of profile pictures and bios, erratic posting times, and ""an exclusive interest in OneCoin-related discussions.""      A large number of profiles purported to be subject-matter experts on cryptocurrency, according to the report, but restricted answers to the ""viability or value"" of OneCoin. DFRLab said it was not able to confirm the identities of the individuals, with social media searches showing ""no similar or matching results.""      ""While there was no direct evidence tying these inauthentic profiles and reviews to OneCoin employees or evidence of automated activity on either platform, the profiles and favorable reviews nonetheless served to boost trust for the OneCoin brand as it faced a multibillion-dollar scandal,"" the report concluded.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/29/alleged-crypto-ponzi-onecoin-may-have-used-flood-of-fake-reviews-to-boost-ailing-image,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bc38a604dbcbdb38b8ff9890cacaa034855c989-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431470,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kNh,1580259636,"Bitcoin Cracks $9,400 to Reach Nearly 3-Month High in 'Asia-Driven Rally'","Bitcoin (BTC) has risen above a key area of resistance to reach its highest point in nearly three months.      On Jan. 28, at roughly 23:30 UTC, the price of BTC rose from around $9,150 to $9,400 in less than five minutes to reach an 83-day high, CoinDesk’s BPI shows.      Prices on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continues to gain amid the backdrop of uncertainty in the global markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average cemented a 1.6 percent loss on Jan. 28 while the S&P 500 index also saw a sharp decline, down 1.5 percent.      Both indices are posting modest gains in after-hours trading as they attempt to correct yesterday's selloff. However, with uncertainty stemming from the Coronavirus outbreak in China, investors could be looking elsewhere to park their funds according to Su Zhu, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto investment firm Three Arrows.      “[BTC] rally looks Asia-driven with the Chinese equity market reopening after holidays has been delayed due to the coronavirus, so traders itching for activity may have set their sights on the 24-7 crypto markets in the meantime,” Zhu said.      Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic, said given the extremely highly volatile macro environment, bitcoin suddenly doesn't seem so risky anymore.      ""The recent surge in bitcoin price is merely a prelude to a much larger move upwards that has been building up over the past several months,"" said Chu. ""A steady wave of shocks including Iran turmoil, U.S. political strife, and now coronavirus destabilizing the public markets is pushing investors to seek alternative shelters for capital.""      Elsewhere in the market, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are posting positive gains, with the likes of Cardano (ADA) up 8.6 percent, bitcoin cash (BCH) up 4.6 percent, ether (ETH) up 2.15 percent, and XRP is up 1.94 percent over a 24-hour period.",POSITIVE,ADA | BCH,ADA | ASIA | BCH | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/29/bitcoin-cracks-9400-to-reach-nearly-3-month-high-in-asia-driven-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2249a05b4dc071f46f9f33b669d76bc50b3082b-593x283.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431469,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kJh,1580258854,LedgerX Board Member and Former CFTC Chair Named CEO of Miami Futures Exchange,"A board member of LedgerX's holding company has been named CEO of a firm accused of trying to take over the bitcoin derivatives exchange.      Mark Wetjen, a former acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is the new CEO of Miami International Futures Exchange (MIAX) and an executive vice president of its parent firm, Miami International Holdings (MIH).      According to a press release Monday, Wetjen in his EVP role will work on futures and innovative products – including crypto derivatives – and act as a regulatory liaison for MIH.      ""Wetjen will play a pivotal role in projects relating to the futures business as the MIAX Exchange Group expands from electronic trading of options into cash equities, futures and innovative products, including digital securities and crypto assets and derivatives,"" the press release said.      MIAX is a shareholder in LedgerX, and was recently accused of potentially trying to take over the bitcoin derivatives exchange by a member of its board of directors. Nicholas Owen Gunden, who is also an investor who used LedgerX's platform, wrote in a letter this month that MIAX had been invited to participate in private meetings with members of the parent company's board (LedgerX is split into Ledger Holdings Inc. and LedgerX LLC., each with its own board).      Gunden also alleged a Holdings board member may have accepted payments to help MIAX participate in an insider funding round.      His letter followed the LedgerX board's suspension and subsequent removal of co-founders Paul and Juthica Chou last year. The company named co-founder and former chief technology officer Zach Dexter as the new CEO in mid-January.      Wetjen was most recently the managing director and head of global public policy for the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the U.S. central securities depository (CSD).      MIH Chairman and CEO Thomas Gallagher said in a statement that Wetjen's ""extensive background"" will benefit the company as it builds futures products in the U.S.      ""MIAX has a demonstrated commitment to offering disruptive investment products and providing the marketplace with choice and innovation,"" Wetjen said in a statement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/29/ledgerx-board-member-and-former-cftc-chair-named-ceo-of-miami-futures-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4d7f4965a4f49bdc3fe25e1b688ef88d46eca3f-1356x950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
