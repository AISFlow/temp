Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: In a slow but surprisingly volatile session, bitcoin fell to a six-week low around $38,200 before quickly recovering back above $40,000.  Insights: Crypto had a slow start to the week in Asia amid ongoing fears about COVID-19 lockdowns in China.  Technician's take: BTC's price range could persist for another week.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $40,485 +2.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,016 +3%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE +24.7% Currency Ethereum ETH +2.1% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC +1.6% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −2.5% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC −2.4% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL −2.0% Computing  Bitcoin recovers after dipping to six-week low.  By Angelique Chen  Bitcoin (BTC), after a big price swing over the past week, traded earlier Monday at its lowest point since mid-March but quickly recovered.  As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 2.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at $40,485. Earlier, the bitcoin price fell as low as $38,202, the lowest in almost six weeks.  “Recent volatility has been driven by factors such as inflation, the Ukraine crisis as well as contractionary monetary policies,” said Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen. “This has affected not only the stock market but also the crypto market, which seems to follow in tandem recently.”  Khoo said the fall in prices could be driven by the short-term negative sentiment as people go risk-off on volatile assets. “Many investors are also shifting towards [stablecoins] given the uncertainty and short-term bearish outlook, as the market has become too hot and periods of extreme euphoria were followed by market corrections historically,” Khoo said.  Ether (ETH) was up 0.87% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2,972. U.S. stocks were mixed as China’s Covid restrictions stiffened, with the S&P 500 Index down 0.7% and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.  Traditional Markets  S&P 500: +0.6%  DJIA: +0.7%  Nasdaq: +1.3%  Gold: $1,899, -1.8%  Insights  Slow Start to the Week for Crypto in Asia  Bitcoin’s correlation with the stock market has created a circular economy with China – even though trading the asset is officially banned in the country.  As lockdowns continue in Shanghai with possible expansions elsewhere, the CSE 300, a benchmark index of the 300 largest stocks in China, was down 3% while the Hang Seng Index, Hong Kong’s stock index, dropped 2%.  Year to date, the Hang Seng Index is down nearly 15%, the CSE 300 down 22% and the SP 500 down 11%.  This continued decline in China stocks has now reversed gains made in March when the government pledged to support the market to fight off a double-whammy of U.S. threats to de-list China stocks and continued COVID-19 fears.  The S&P ended last week down 2.7%, partly due to China’s uncertain macroeconomic environment.  Bitcoin, in turn, fell 1% during Monday’s Asia trading day, and pushed further down throughout Monday trading in the U.S. At time of writing, it was up 2.4% to $40,485. Metaverse major Axie Infinity shaved 10% off its value during trading on Monday in Asia while NEAR and NEO, tokens associated with layer 1 blockchains, declined 10% and 9.3%, respectively.  So as the stock indexes of the world’s largest economy nervously watch those in the world’s second-largest to see how this next and hopefully final chapter in the coronavirus plays out, bitcoin is caught in the middle.  It is a reversal, mind you, from March when it was China markets moving up and U.S. stocks staying flat. Bitcoin didn’t follow the trend because it trades in response to U.S. movement – but now the ""circular economy"" of China bringing down the U.S. market has in turn brought down bitcoin in this session.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $37K; Resistance at $43K  Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing after a 3% decline over the past week. Short-term buyers have returned around the $37,500 support level, although resistance at $43,000 could stall an upswing in price.  Momentum signals remain neutral on the charts, which typically precedes a period of range-bound price action, similar to what occurred between May and July of last year.  BTC is roughly two weeks away from registering a countertrend bullish signal, per the DeMARK indicators. If confirmed, buyers could begin to accumulate ahead of a seasonally strong period in May.  Still, bearish signals on the monthly chart suggests limited upside for BTC beyond the $50,966 resistance level.

(CoinDesk Columnist David Z. Morris) ... ""This persistent, simmering crisis around energy, its cost and the politics around it will not end soon. [Russian President] Vladimir Putin has escalated this crisis.

But Mr. Putin didn’t cause this crisis alone."" (University of Cambridge Professor Helen Thompson for The New York Times) ... ""The lack of options has made Russian emigrés worldwide look beyond traditional payment systems. For at least a few, cryptocurrency has proven to be a serviceable, if kludgy, alternative. It's not easy to use but anyone can use it, regardless of location or nationality.

Twitter Inc. was approached last week Thursday by the Dogecoin influencer Elon Musk, who made a cash buyout offer of $43 billion in an effort to take the company private and foster free speech on one of the world&apos;s most influential social media platforms. Dogecoin Reacts to the News Elon Musk has been a vocal advocate of Dogecoin in the past, tweeting many times in support of the meme-based cryptocurrency. As expected, Dogecoin&apos;s market price jumped more than 20% today as a result of the announcement. This price increase might be attributed to the expectation of Musk&apos;s continued advocacy of the cryptocurrency on the social media outlet. This isn&apos;t the first time Dogecoin has moved in response to Musk&apos;s statements and actions. After earning support from Musk on Twitter last year, it saw numerous increases in value and reached a peak of $0.7376 in May. At the time of writing, Doge is trading at $0.16400, representing a more than 20 percent increase over the previous day&apos;s all-time high of $0.13480.

The collection is live on the league’s Polygon and Flow-based marketplace, which it unveiled in November 2021 and has since been used for various playoff game ticketing promotions.  The NFTs will also be given out to members of this year’s “Inner Circle” club, which includes fans selected to represent each team on draft night.  A representative of the league told CoinDesk it has given out more than 500,000 NFTs tied to ticket purchases since the marketplace’s release. Of those 500,000, around 210,000 were directly interacted with by their owner, a 42% figure the league considered a win in terms of engagement.  “Those are just the ones we gave out for free, so we were impressed by the engagement numbers for sure,” Sam Rubinroit, the NFL’s director of club business development, told CoinDesk in an interview. “A good number of the NFTs we released for purchase sold out within 24 hours of their release.”  Rubinroit said the ticketing collectible platform is still very much in its “test and learn phase,” with larger plans cued up for the upcoming season. NFTs from its initial “Regular Season Clubs” collection were one point trading hands for thousands of dollars a piece, but have since cooled off to the $300-$600 range for the more popular teams.

The league’s official blockchain partnerships policy remains lucid and developing, but has seen movement in the realms of fan tokens and crypto endorsements in recent weeks.

Key technical points: DOGE prices crack below the $0.22 mark. The death cross gains a bearish spread. The 24-hour trading volume of Dogecoin is $3.08 Billion, marking a 600% rise. Past Performance of DOGE On the 24th of April, it was reported that the DOGE price hit daily candlesticks closing just below $0.133 support, suggesting that sellers could pull the coin below the bottom of March at $0.111. But, the current chart has a complete rotation as the Dogecoin price increases by 5% and climbs over the crucial support level.

42423449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZqXh,1650918107,Market Wrap: Cryptos Mixed as Global Uncertainty Lingers; Dogecoin Pumps,"Performance across cryptocurrencies were mixed on Monday as investors braced for additional market risk.  Concerns about geopolitical conflicts emanating from Russia and Ukraine, China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak, signs of an upcoming U.S. or European recession and global inflation have kept some buyers on the sidelines.  Typically, investors reduce their exposure to speculative assets, such as stocks and cryptos, when faced with high uncertainty. So far this year, the S&P 500 is down about 12%, compared with a 17% decline in bitcoin (BTC). Meanwhile, gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up 3% over the same period, albeit down 8% from its recent peak in March.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  The recent jump in equity market volatility occurred alongside a decline in gold prices. That could signal a neutral stance among market participants, especially as the rally in Treasury yields begins to cool.  Meanwhile, dogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 26% on Monday after Twitter (TWTR) accepted a takeover bid from Tesla's (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.  Some analysts are waiting for signs of stabilization in the crypto market, which has tracked moves in equities over the past year. So far, speculative traders are starting to return as BTC settles around $40,000. For example, in March, derivatives volumes increased after six straight months of decreased volumes. That could signal a rise in trading activity if BTC is able to break above or below its current trading range.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $40,294, +1.48%    ●Ether (ETH): $3,022, +2.00%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,296, +0.57%    ●Gold: $1,899 per troy ounce, −1.64%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.83%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Liquidation zones  There was a slight uptick in long bitcoin liquidations over the past 24 hours, although not as extreme compared with last week.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. Price moves in the spot market tend to accelerate as futures traders liquidate positions.  Analysts monitor liquidation levels to determine where prices will gravitate in order for buyers/sellers to absorb large pockets of order flow (supply/demand). Over the past three months, BTC has traded around a midpoint of $40,000, albeit with 20% price swings. That suggests a breakout or breakdown below the current trading range could trigger volatile liquidations on the long or short side.  Short-term levels to watch:  Short liquidation zone (forced buy to close): Above $42,000-$43,000.  Long liquidation zone (forced sell to close): Below $38,000-$39,000.  ""Currently, about 30% of long-term and short-term bitcoin holders are underwater on their positions, split roughly 50-50 between the two groups,"" Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in a report. And the average cost basis among short-term bitcoin holders is roughly $45,900, according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode.  Typically, short-term holders are more sensitive to price movements, which means they take profits and/or realize losses quickly. Major turning points occur when long-term holders absorb excess supply from short-term sellers.  The chart below shows the long-term bitcoin holder net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL). Excessive optimism among long-term holders occurred around BTC's earlier high around $64,000 in March of last year. Since then, some profit taking has occurred among traders, possibly in anticipation of long-term losses, similar to 2015 and 2019.  For now, there are no signs of capitulation, which points to flat/negative price action until a significant liquidation (or prolonged period of realized losses) occurs.

42374863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3ES9,1650917956,New York Lawmakers Advance Mining Moratorium Bill to Full Assembly,"New York lawmakers have advanced a controversial bill that aims to put a two-year moratorium on select proof-of-work crypto mining operations in the Empire State.  Members of the New York Assembly’s Ways and Means Committee considered the bill at a meeting on Monday afternoon, ultimately voting to send the bill to the floor for a vote by the full Assembly.  Despite widely circulating misunderstandings that the bill would ban all crypto mining in New York, the scope of the bill is fairly limited. If passed, it would place a two-year moratorium on the issuance of new permits for proof-of-work mining operations proposing the use of an “electric generating facility that utilizes a carbon-based fuel.”  The bill would also require a study by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation on proof-of-work mining’s impact on the state’s ability to reach the ambitious climate goals set forth by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which mandates that New York’s greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85% by 2050.  If passed, the bill could present a serious obstacle for mining operations like Greenidge Generation, which fired up a once-shuttered coal power plant in upstate New York and converted it to run on natural gas to power its bitcoin mining operation – the source of much controversy among both lawmakers and environmental groups.  Though Greenidge Generation’s existing operation wouldn't be affected by the bill because its permit application is already outstanding, it would be unable to expand its operations, and future mining operations hoping to replicate the Greenidge model wouldn't be allowed to do so.  The bill wouldn't affect existing proof-of-work mining operations or those that plan to use the state’s abundant – and cheap – sources of renewable energy. In some parts of New York state, where electricity is generated by the Niagara River and other sources of hydropower, crypto miners have found industrial power as cheap as 1.9 cents per kilowatt hour. The average cost in the U.S. was 7.26 cents per kilowatt hour, according to Statista.  An earlier version of the bill, which died in the state Assembly last year after facing resistance from the electrical workers’ union, originally called for a three-year moratorium on all crypto mining in the state.  Despite the narrower scope of this version of the bill, however, crypto advocates are concerned that its passage would pave the way for future legislation cracking down on crypto mining in New York and that those crackdowns could hurt the crypto industry across the state.  “A two-year mining ban sends a really bad message to the blockchain industry, to crypto companies, to Web 3 companies, that New York is saying ‘You’re not welcome here,'” said John Olsen, New York state lead at the Blockchain Association.  The full Assembly vote could take place as early as Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter. If passed there, the bill will move to the state Senate.

The news garnered an immediate and negative reaction from the broader NFT community, with many voicing frustrations that Carson purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Moonbirds before his exit, possibly using insider knowledge to poach undervalued editions.  Carson’s cache of avian collectibles is currently worth $1.2 million based on floor prices alone, most of which were bought before Moonbirds values ballooned in the days following the initial mint.  The project’s founder, longtime internet entrepreneur and Digg co-founder Kevin Rose, addressed the Moonbirds community in a Twitter Spaces following the news, saying Carson’s actions went against the project’s internal policy.  Rose also said during the Spaces event he had “no idea” how much capital Carson planned on using to buy up Moonbirds NFTs following the release.  “I think one of the special things about Web 3 is we can be transparent and share and learn from each other,” Rose said during the talk. “I can tell you that there’s going to be a kind of communications policy put in place as well, moving forward.”  Rose also mentioned that he had waved Carson’s vesting cliff, a move that stemmed from the trust he had in their personal relationship, according to the Spaces.  While news of Carson’s departure has been framed in a largely negative light for Moonbirds, others are optimistic the project will learn from its mistakes and be better for it in the long term.  Moonbirds currently have a 34 ETH (roughly $100,000) floor price, and have done over $330 million in sales since its April 16 mint, the most of any NFT project in the last 30 days.  “We are not the next Yuga Labs or Crypto Punks, we’re Proof and we're going to keep being Proof and we're confident that alone is a reason why we want to be here,” Rose said towards the end of the Spaces.

42421639,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojNN,1650916172,The Pitfalls of 'Community-as-Company',"Thanks to the runaway success of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, there’s a pretty standard model for running a blockbuster non-fungible token (NFT) collection in 2022.  It hinges on the concept of communities as companies, with an NFT as a form of membership. In the way a traditional company might issue stock, making each stockholder a part owner, crypto communities launch NFT collections, making holders into “members” with varying degrees of influence.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Say you have an online community going, maybe a Twitter following, a fanbase, a group chat or a kind of amorphous online social club. You give (or sell) each person involved in that community their own NFT, sort of like a digital membership pass. These passes become the only way in. As a member, you can either sell your pass to someone outside the community – maybe a speculator, maybe just an enthusiastic spectator – or hold onto it in the hopes of receiving special members-only perks down the line. (Whether the Securities and Exchange Commission will one day see these NFTs as investment contracts is something of an open question.)  Those perks essentially amount to “access” in a variety of different forms. As an NFT holder, you’ll get first dibs on future NFT projects from the community, and potentially have some small say in how those projects play out. Maybe your status as a holder entitles you to 10,000 COMMUNITY tokens, or a special NFT profile picture for flexing your membership on Twitter and Discord.  The community’s founding leadership team usually makes all the business decisions and controls the greatest number of NFTs, but there’s a sense in which the collective makes or breaks the project. There’s rarely any sort of lock-up period, or rules around what creators and shareholders – sorry, uh, NFT holders – can or can’t do with their membership passes.  This was the conceit behind Crypto Packaged Goods, the NFT collective founded by venture capitalists Chris Cantino and Jaime Schmidt last fall, and Proof, a similar effort helmed by erstwhile Web 2.0 entrepreneur Kevin Rose. When Proof launched a new NFT collection earlier this month, existing members were given the opportunity to invest before the general public.  And while that NFT collection, Moonbirds, was mostly a success, generating $58 million for the company’s treasury, the model of an NFT project used to raise capital comes with its own sort of risks.  Read More: Moonbirds Are a Bet on Kevin Rose's Rep  Exploited?  This past weekend, a crypto community led by the former pro baseball player Micah Johnson raised about $35 million with an NFT launch. Shortly after, it announced that it had lost all of the money.  Johnson has spent the past year promoting a brand called Aku, essentially a crypto media company built around a spacefaring mascot of the same name. On Friday, it planned to drop “Akutars,” the official NFT avatars of the Aku universe (similar to how Proof framed the Moonbirds launch). Prices would start high, at 3.5 ETH (around $10,000), but were set to descend as the sale progressed.  Because all the code for the NFT launch mechanism was already public in smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, anyone with an internet connection could take a peek at the NFTs’ inner workings. It’s good for transparency, but bad for security: An hour or so after the sale began, someone was able to use that foreknowledge to exploit the Akutars smart contract.  The exploiter even left a message in the malicious transaction:  “Well, this was fun, had no intention of actually exploiting this lol. Otherwise I wouldn't have used coinbase. Once you guys publicly acknowledge that the exploit exists, I will remove the block immediately. - USER221”  While the exploit didn’t completely break the contract, it set off a chain reaction that ended with $35 million in ETH being “locked” in the treasury. Because code deployed on Ethereum is “immutable” and can’t be modified, the developers have no recourse, and the funds are permanently lost.  The next day, developers used the official Aku Twitter account to ask for help creating a new version of the contract.​​  “We are looking for any code reviewers and auditors to help double and triple check out [sic] minting contract,” the company wrote. “Please @ us!” The new plan was to send Akutars to existing ""mint pass"" NFT holders for free, and process partial refunds for anyone who put money into that initial faulty contract.  Amazingly, this seems to have appeased the Aku community. Traders spent the weekend praising Micah Johnson for agreeing to start the Akutars launch over, “brick by brick,” rather than just abandoning the project. The community launched a hashtag, #weareaku, as a show of solidarity with the embattled developers, and pushed back against skepticism. It’s also widely believed that the initial exploiter was actually a Good Samaritan looking to expose – rather than abuse – the faulty code.  If everyone gets their refunds, it will be the Aku team, not the community, taking the $35+ million loss.  Code is law  There’s an old principle, in crypto, that “code is law.” Once you’ve deployed your smart contracts on the blockchain, they’re only ever going to run one way. This makes it difficult to fix bugs after the fact.  Developers can update their code after reviews or audits, but doing so means migrating assets over to an entirely new contract. It’s part of why the industry’s security philosophy hinges on the “DYOR” ethos – “do your own research,” an extreme emphasis on personal responsibility. Because much of the code is transparent and updates remain burdensome, it’s generally accepted that errors are the responsibility of users, rather than just developers.  So, what happens when the “law” includes a system-breaking bug? There’s no bank to appeal to, no fail-safe that might recover lost funds.  This is the potential cost of doing things entirely on-chain. If crypto-backed communities are the new companies, and NFT projects a new mode of raising capital, then who’s responsible for these sorts of slipups?  Say an early-stage startup raises a few million dollars, and then immediately loses the money; even if it stems from an honest mistake, it’s hard to imagine investors would just be fine with that. The startup couldn’t throw up its hands and claim “code is law” – it wouldn’t hold up in court.  Ultimately, someone is responsible for the loss of funds. But because it’s the Aku brand taking the losses, and because Micah Johnson and his team apparently have the resources to just shell out $35+ million to Aku investors, community members don’t seem too mad about the mistake.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error  The Akutars debacle is a warning for the community-as-company NFT model. Once the code collapsed, Aku investors were effectively at the mercy of this one guy.

42374866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3ETP,1650913911,Bitcoin Recovers Above $40K After Dipping Earlier to 6-Week Low,"Bitcoin (BTC), after a big price swing over the past week, traded earlier Monday at its lowest point in almost six weeks.  As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 1.3% in the past 24 hours, trading at $40,127. Earlier, the bitcoin price fell as low as $38,202, the lowest since March 15.  “Recent volatility has been driven by factors such as inflation, the Ukraine crisis [caused by Russia’s invasion] as well as contractionary monetary policies,” said Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen. “This has affected not only the stock market but also the crypto market, which seems to follow in tandem recently.”  Khoo said this fall in prices could be driven by the short-term negative sentiment as people go risk-off on volatile assets.  “Many investors are also shifting towards [stablecoins] given the uncertainty and short-term bearish outlook as the market has become too hot and periods of extreme euphoria were followed by market corrections historically,” Khoo said.  “The crypto markets tumbled this morning, as bitcoin failed to hold the $40K level,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock. “Fears about a 50-basis point rate hike have strengthened after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments last Thursday.”  Powell said Thursday that “it is appropriate, in my view, to be moving a little more quickly.” He said raising the benchmark U.S. interest rate by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) “will be on the table” for the next Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting in May, in remarks at the International Monetary Fund debate.  “Even though we have a more hawkish Federal Reserve which could lead to more pain for global markets in the short term,” said Sotiriou, “I am still cautiously bullish.”  “Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics are contrastingly bullish,” wrote Sotiriou. “Data from Glassnode shows that the percentage of bitcoin’s supply that has not moved in one year is at an all-time high. I think this data tells us that whilst these macro headwinds are ongoing, bitcoin is being distributed from those who see it as a risk-on asset, to long-term holders who have strong conviction in bitcoin’s long-term potential.”  Ether (ETH) was up 0.87% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2,972.  U.S. stocks were mixed as China’s COVID-19 restrictions stiffened, with the S&P 500 down 0.7% and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/25/bitcoin-recovers-above-40k-after-dipping-earlier-to-6-week-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc6f1fdae1f961ee8b6541d129ed6dcf70ea2348-1156x1178.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Begins To Lose 600-Day MA Support Line As Price Crashes Below $39k Again As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the price of the crypto is crossing below the 600-day MA curve now, a line that has served as support for BTC in the past. A &apos;moving average&apos; (or MA in short) is an analytical tool that takes the average of any quantity over a particular time period. As the name already suggests, this average constantly updates itself as time passes and new values arrive. What this tool does is that it removes any short-term fluctuations from the chart being studied (which is the Bitcoin price in this context), and smooths out the curve. This makes moving averages quite useful for studying long-term trends, where local variations aren&apos;t that important. Related Reading | Is Bitcoin Gonna See Another Big Drop Soon?

Once the deal is completed, Twitter will become a privately held company.  ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a statement. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.""  Bret Taylor, Twitter's independent board chair, said, ""The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.""  In early April, Musk revealed he'd taken 9.2% stake in Twitter for $2.89 billion. He also criticized the social media platform in a series of tweets, saying that ""failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.""  Musk said in an April 13 regulatory filing that he intended to take the social media company private and that he ""invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.""  Twitter shares rose about 5.5% to $51.63 on Monday before trading was halted in the afternoon pending news. The $54.20 per share offer represents a premium of about 38% to Twitter's close on April 1, 2022, the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his stake in Twitter.  Meanwhile the price of dogecoin (DOGE) surged more than 20% since reports of a deal being likely surfaced on Monday morning. Some investors speculate that Musk's fondness for DOGE mean it might play a bigger role in Twitter payments if he were to own the company.  This is a developing story and will be updated.

42421178,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd581,1650909150,Maaria Bajwa: 'People Like to Root Against the Winners',"Maaria Bajwa, who has a background in investing for ultra-high-net worth individuals, had been buying cryptocurrency since 2016. So when a year later she joined the venture capital firm Sound Ventures, which was founded by actor Ashton Kutcher and talent manager Guy Oseary, who has represented Madonna for decades, as well as acts like U2, she knew exactly where her expertise would lie – Web 3.  “It's technically more complex, it requires time, it's new,” she says of the crypto industry. “I knew that I would never be as good at analyzing marketplaces as Ashton or growth consumer deals like Guy, so that's when I started really digging into crypto.”  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  She’s only dug deeper since. With Sound Ventures, Bajwa has invested in Chainalysis, bitcoin rewards app Lolli and metaverse fashion brand The Fabricant. She also co-founded Sixth Wall, a blockchain entertainment company that helps artists use the technology to keep control of their work. The other founders included Mila Kunis, Kutcher’s wife; Morgan Beller, co-creator of libra, the digital currency Facebook tried to establish; actress Lisa Sterbakov; and metaverse consultant Lindsey McInerney.  And Bajwa also sits on the board of the Ape Foundation, which helps govern the Bored Ape Yacht Club community, and has been adding to her own personal NFT collection alongside her enthusiast husband.  “One hundred percent of both my personal and professional time is in crypto,” she says. “My whole day, I'm talking to companies and different projects in the crypto world, and then I come home from work, and me and my husband are just talking about crypto, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and DeFi (decentralized finance). There's not really a divide.”  When you live and breathe crypto like Bajwa does, you get a pretty good sense of where the industry is going and what projects will survive or die. She explained how she gleans these insights with CoinDesk, addressing the importance of building basic blockchain infrastructure, the criticisms of Ape Coin and the voice acting talents of Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain.  How do you and Sound Ventures choose which blockchain companies to invest in? What's some of your criteria?  The way that we think about investing is we do a lot of building in this space. That means being active with folks who are doing really interesting, exciting things in this ecosystem. For example, as co-founder of Sixth Wall, the company behind (animated series) “Stoner Cats,” we just released another show called “The Gimmicks” on Solana. It’s doing very, very well and was the first NFT for a lot of people. Then there’s Guy Oseary and his work [representing] Yuga Labs and World of Women, and I’m helping out with Hop Protocol by running a liquidity bonder that Hop uses for its bridge.  By being active in the ecosystem, we can see the pain points and the infrastructure and technology that doesn't exist yet. That’s where there's a gap. That informs a lot of our investment decisions.  Take MoonPay, for example – they make it very easy for people to on-board into crypto, which traditionally has been a very challenging thing. That's a big unlock for the ecosystem and for the environment. Things like that, that address, how do we get more people into the space? How do we make sure that this is sustainable growth and that we're growing in the smart, right way? A lot of what we do on the building side informs that.  You’re basically making decisions by living them.  Yeah, because in crypto, it's so complicated and technologically hard to use and build. People often make the mistaken assumption that the ecosystem is far more advanced than it actually is. Everyone says, ""We're so early,"" but from a technology implementation perspective, we are still very early. There's still infrastructure that needs to be built to make multi-chain a possibility. We spend a lot of time thinking through, ""What are the pieces of the puzzle that need to be put in place to fuel the next wave of innovation or growth in this ecosystem?""  You've invested in all kinds of different industries in blockchain – like video and virtual fashion. Which industry excites you the most in terms of its prospects in the metaverse right now?  I'm a big VR (virtual reality) person. When the Vive first came out, I was on their early access list, so I got one of the first five. There was this multi-player, first-person shooting game that I played called Hover Junkers – at one point, I was ranked like 250th in the world. I believe in the metaverse and think it is going to exist at some point; I just don't know if NFTs and crypto bring product market fit to that VR metaverse experience that people are talking about. I'm a little less bullish on the metaverse being a thing this year or next year.  I really like things like The Fabricant because they’re building out the infrastructure that's going to be needed for the metaverse when it comes, like by giving people easy tools to create their own UGC (user-generated content). Because it’s so visual, fashion is a big thing that probably will exist in the metaverse. The way we think about metaverse investing specifically is like, what are the building blocks? And what are the tools that are going to be needed for the metaverse when we eventually get to that reality?  Other verticals we focus on are NFTs. We don't invest specifically in any NFTs, but rather in NFT infrastructure – the platforms that enable NFTs, like SuperRare and OpenSea. We're also looking at DeFi. We're investors in Zapper, a portfolio management tool where you can look at all the money that you have in different DeFi protocols in a single place.  The third vertical we focus on is just infrastructure, which I think about as anything that makes it easier for developers to build and for consumers to come in and use. That’s the high-level breakdown of how we think about investing.  You mentioned “Stoner Cats,” and I saw that in addition to Kutcher and Kunis being involved, Vitalik Buterin is one of the voice actors, along with Jane Fonda. How did you get those people to work on the series?  It's pretty incredible. The three creators [one of whom is a Pixar animator] had a show they wanted to create about an older woman who starts getting Alzheimer's, and her cats come to life when they smoke weed and try to save her. They pitched Jane Fonda, who agreed to be a voice actor before the show became an NFT thing. But when the creators pitched the show to all the major studios, no one wanted to create it, because it was cannabis content, or they wanted to pay a very small amount and then own the IP (intellectual property). We thought that NFTs could be an interesting way to go directly to consumers and to allow the show’s creators to have more control over the process and storyline.  Vitalik is a friend of one of Sixth Wall’s founders, so we got him involved. He's very excited about anything that's built on Ethereum and tests new use cases. He plays one of the cats. He doesn't have very many lines, but everything that he says is just wise. He’s like a seer.  I see your Twitter profile picture is a Bored Ape, and you’re on the board of the Ape Foundation. What does being on the board entail?  It’s a lot of getting the community up to speed, making sure they're engaged, making sure that we're doing governance the right way. Decentralized governance isn’t easy. Oftentimes, you need to start off a bit more centralized and then grow into decentralized as the ecosystem evolves and processes are put in place. We (board members) are only chosen for six months, then the community votes on who they want on the board. Now, it’s primarily thinking about some of the proposals that are coming through – like there’s a big staking proposal for Ape Coin. So that's probably where we're spending most of our time. But really, it's about making sure that the ecosystem’s thriving.  You were quoted in an article from The Verge about Ape Coin that brings up some criticisms of the project, like that it's a “SPAC without the legal protections of SPAC,” and the Kyle Chayka analysis that it’s “as close to a fake stock as you can get without being blatantly illegal.” In what ways do you see those criticisms being valid or not valid?  I didn't even realize they had called it a stock. I don't think about it as an IPO or going public. What it's meant to do is to build an ecosystem around NFTs. The Ape Coin airdrop went to Yuga Lab NFT holders. Ape Coin is meant for the entire ecosystem, and leveraging this community and what they're building to expand the environment. I don't think about it as a stock because there's no revenue going back to the Ape Coins. There's no centralized governance. It's just a token that's meant to be the currency for this ecosystem.  You see those types of criticisms a lot about different crypto and NFT projects. Where do you think they come from?  People like to root against the winners. Part of it also comes from a general, not lack of understanding, but lack of a deep, intellectual curiosity about what tokenomics can mean and enable. There's different use cases and parameters around traditional stocks versus tokens. The more that people dig into DeFi, governance tokens, utility tokens and play-to-earn economics, all of that will make a lot more sense. But when you come from that traditional finance world and you see something without diving deep into the space, it's easy to make basic comparisons that might not necessarily apply.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | AIRDROP,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/25/maaria-bajwa-people-like-to-root-against-the-winners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61a29fe9efd29b292643ac4158e492f735a7ddeb-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Still, sellers are in control. Losses below April 18 lows may trigger a panic sell, forcing LUNA to $60. Past Performance of Terra The LUNA price is under the weight of sellers, reading from the performance in the daily chart. It is down three percent in the previous trading day and an impressive 11 percent versus the USDT in the last week of trading. LUNA is the top performer during the previous seven days of trading at spot rates, outperforming ETH and BTC. Terra Technical Analysis As per the LUNAUSDT formation in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand. Even though prices are trickling down, sinking as sellers press on, LUNA bulls are in control. The April 18 bull bar is trend-defining. Therefore, as long as prices are trending above $75 and $80, aggressive traders can double down in anticipation of another leg up to last week&apos;s highs to $98. On a more cautious approach, traders can wait for clean breaks above $98—if buyers take charge—or $75—if bears press on—with targets at $120 and $60, respectively. What to Expect from Terra? LUNA is bullish. However, prices could be dragged down by a free-falling crypto market.

Several funds saw huge outflows, including 3iQ’s $27 million and ETC Group’s $8 million, but ProShares’ $41.3 million inflow provided an offset.  Crypto funds suffered a combined $231 million of outflows over the two prior weeks.

According to the published text of a speech to be given later in the day, Panetta said crypto-assets were harmful to society and without social or economic value.  “Crypto-assets are speculative assets that can cause major damage to society,” Panetta said. “They derive their value mainly from greed, they rely on the greed of others and the hope that the scheme continues unhindered.”  But the bubble could burst, he added, comparing crypto dynamics to a “Ponzi scheme,” and showing “strikingly similar dynamics” to the sub-prime mortgages that caused the 2008 financial crisis.  “We must not repeat the same mistakes,” Panetta said in his speech, set to be given at Columbia University in New York at 1 p.m. ET.  “Now is the time to ensure that crypto-assets are only used within clear, regulated boundaries and for purposes that add value to society” to avoid a “lawless frenzy of risk-taking.”  Panetta has been a keen proponent of the ECB issuing a digital euro – perhaps in part because a central bank digital currency could stave off the need for private-sector stablecoins such as tether (USDT) – but has also called for a crackdown on the crypto market more generally.  Read more: ECB Official Calls for ‘Less Tolerant’ Approach to Bitcoin ‘Gambling’  Tether, the issuer of USDT, has faced legal proceedings regarding the exact content of its reserves – and Panetta warned that holders suddenly seeking to redeem their assets could spread turbulence to commercial debt and banking markets. He added there needed to be an upgrade of disclosure requirements that are at present “highly problematic.”  Crypto-assets are too volatile and transfers take too long to process to be useful as a form of money, are a “potential means” to circumvent financial sanctions, and could also harm investment and climate change, Panetta said.  He called for crypto-assets to be taxed in line with other financial instruments – with extra levies for the most environmentally unfriendly, such as the energy-intensive proof of work mechanism that underpins bitcoin (BTC).

""There is no mint going on today. It looks like BAYC Instagram was hacked. Do not mint anything, click links or link your wallet to anything,"" the NFT project wrote on Twitter.  The fraudulent link claimed that users could mint ""land"" in the upcoming OthersideMeta, which is due to launch later this week.  The wallets of those who clicked the link have now been compromised, with a series of Bored Apes and Mutant Apes being transferred to new wallets by the hackers.  At the time of writing, it is estimated that around 24 Bored Apes and 30 Mutant Apes have been stolen, according to recent OpenSea transfers, although some of these may be holders transferring their non-fungible tokens for security purposes.  The value of the 54 NFTs calculated by floor price is $13.7 million.  Yuga Labs says the scope of the attack is far smaller.

42407310,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSIZ,1650897221,Introducing CoinDesk's Payments Week,"Satoshi Nakamoto was clear about what Bitcoin should be.  “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” reads the first line of the Bitcoin white paper.  Bitcoin was supposed to be a payments system allowing people to send money person to person, without banks involved. But somehow that vision got lost along the way.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  Today, bitcoin (BTC) the currency is a $1 trillion global phenomenon, but not yet a common payment vehicle. By far its biggest use is as digital gold (storing value while inflation soars). Generally, people don’t use it to buy coffee or pints of beer.  For hodlers, or die-hard owners, the argument against using bitcoin to pay for stuff has also been: “Why spend an asset if I believe it’s going to rise in price?” Who wants to be Laszlo Hanyecz, paying 100,000 bitcoin in 2010 for two pizzas? (That BTC is now worth about $4 billion).  And Bitcoin’s decentralized design – with its small blocks and long block time – is better for maintaining censorship resistance than competing with established payments systems. In 2021, Visa (V) processed transactions about 742 times more quickly per second than Bitcoin did.  This has led a lot of people to write off crypto for payments. But that’s a mistake.  Stablecoins, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, fix the price of the asset being transferred, reducing risks for parties involved (though introducing others). The stablecoin sector is now worth $200 billion and was discussed extensively in a recent White House executive order, showing its viability. We’re starting to see central banks issue digital versions of fiat currency, from China to the Marshall Islands. And projects like Stellar, Ripple and Solana all offer greater payments scalability than Bitcoin’s layer 1 blockchain.  “I haven't seen it wane, I've only seen it grow,” said Tammy Camp, who has been doing payments in blockchain since 2014. Camp is CEO of Stronghold, a San Francisco start-up that integrates crypto and legacy payment systems for hundreds of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar clients.  Camp said media organizations like CoinDesk are fixated on Bitcoin and have downplayed the payments innovation happening on other networks. Stablecoins are moving billions of dollars every day, she notes, and Stronghold is onboarding clients from industries underserved by traditional payments providers.  “We focus on customers that have high compliance needs, because they're typically ones that are more underserved,” Camp said. That might include legal but frowned-upon industries like gaming, CBD and alcohol.  Meanwhile, the Lightning Network, a layer 2 system running atop the blockchain, is dramatically improving Bitcoin’s payments use case. It allows anyone to settle fragments of Bitcoin in an instant anywhere in the world with minimal fees. Volume today is small: about $15 million in Q1, according to a recent report from Arcane Research. But the installed base of people who can use Lightning is increasing rapidly. About 80 million now have access through integrations like Block’s Cash App and El Salvador’s Chivo wallet. Lightning is on its way to rivaling the main network for volume of non-trading transactions.  The ability to send instantly settled bearer payments to any phone in the world could be game-changing. It would mean increased access for people excluded from the financial system, lower transaction fees and speedier commerce. Cross-border transactions today involve relationships of correspondent banks and take days to settle, increasing costs for everybody.  Lightning also opens new forms of online activity. Take gaming. For CoinDesk’s Payments Week, our research analyst George Kaloudis interviewed Desiree Dickerson, the founder of THNDR, a mobile gaming startup that rewards players in satoshis, or tiny amounts of BTC. Such projects provide new reasons for people to get involved with bitcoin: In this case, they can play simple handset games and get instantly rewarded for doing so.  Dickerson, an alum of Lightning Labs, a leading Lightning developer, reckons gaming integration could bring millions into the Bitcoin fold. “Gaming is becoming the next social network, and I believe that mobile gaming is how we can onboard the most people to Bitcoin,” she told Kaloudis.  The Lightning Network gives hope that Bitcoin can finally deliver on its founder’s original vision of peer-to-peer payments unmediated by third parties that slow down transaction times and raise costs.  We’ll explore all this for CoinDesk’s Payments Week (April 25-29), from gaming and rewards to regulation and policy. We have deep dives into Lightning, El Salvador’s bitcoin experiment, how Washington, D.C., is regulating payments, the role of crypto in the Ukraine conflict and lots of interviews, op-eds and perspectives from people all over the industry.

51416,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=232890,1650897059,What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs And Why They Are Special,"Due to the public nature of the blockchains, the data is a privacy risk. This is because anyone can access data on the distributed ledger. For instance, you just need a wallet address to access the wallet history on Ether Scan. Hence, there is no privacy of your data. But, here comes zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to the rescue and protect users against data theft in today&apos;s open-source digital world. ZK proofs allow public blockchain users to demonstrate that they have certain information without revealing it because of the inherent cryptographic proof. In this article, we will discuss zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and their significance in today&apos;s blockchain-powered world. Characteristics of Zero-Knowledge Proofs The characteristics of zero-knowledge proofs are explained below: Completeness: An honest prover can persuade a verifier that they know the proper input if a statement is true. Zero-knowledge: If the statement is correct, the verifier simply knows that the statement is accurate. Soundness: If a statement is untrue, no dishonest prover can persuade an honest verifier that they are aware of the correct input on their own. Working of Zero-Knowledge Proofs: An Example It can be difficult to grasp the concept of ZK proofs. Let&apos;s use the game of Where&apos;s Waldo to illustrate this.

42407302,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdUv,1650896707,How to Send Money to the Wrong Side of the War,"I’m probably one of the very few people in the world who uses bitcoin as a currency. I’m paid in bitcoin, use bitcoin to buy things whenever vendors let me, and sell my BTC for fiat only to pay big things like rent and credit card bills.  Over the past several years, I’ve convinced my tennis coach to accept bitcoin, failed to convince a series of landlords to open crypto wallets and paid for drinks using crypto in bars across Europe at a huge loss to myself along the way. For me, cryptocurrency is the narrative of my daily financial life and nothing more.  Masha Sakharova is a Russian emigre writing from Europe. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  But now, ever since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, cryptocurrency has become a narrative of war. The conversation has become – what does it mean that the Ukrainian government is using bitcoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)? Are people donating their crypto with the right intentions? If crypto is the easiest, fastest way to get money to Ukrainian refugees, is it also a tool for sanctions evasion?  And ever since the war started, I’ve had to answer those same questions in a very real way, but from the completely opposite point of view – how can I now use cryptocurrency to send money to my friends and family back in Russia? For the past eight weeks or so, I have been an exile in Europe, maintaining communicative and financial ties to my native country, in part, with crypto.  And while I’ve already mentioned that I’m fairly familiar with most ways to use bitcoin as a currency, I’ve never had to use it to send money to people whose banks have been sanctioned and completely cut off from the outside world.  Right side?  Don’t get me wrong, this is not a story about using crypto to support the Russian invasion. Rather, this is a story about how crypto has proved to be one of the only ways to send money in and out of a rapidly closing country on the wrong side of the war.  See also: No, Crypto Won't 'Fix This' for Russia | Opinion  The Russians left behind do not uniformly support Putin’s war (as many of them call it), but their inability to leave a country assailed from all sides by both Western sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions has cost them their financial independence, leaving them unable to withdraw or use their savings due to preventative bank run measures.  The Russians who were able to leave – those with the right visas, right vaccines and enough money – have also now been financially stranded in unfamiliar countries, as they found their bank cards cut off and no way to access any savings online.  You could have left, you could have stayed – either way, it was as if your money was in a locked safe without a key.  Russians, by and large, were never that wealthy to begin with. That is, besides the very small number of Russian oligarchs with their closely guarded billions. The majority of Russian people draw salaries below the poverty line in America. The average yearly salary in Russia’s two biggest cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, is roughly $20,000 – and that’s only if you are a highly skilled specialist.  Cryptocurrency fills the financial vacuum created by these strange and horrible combinations of economic factors. It’s crypto I’ve turned to, since the war began, to send money into and out of Russia, to and from Russians leaving their home country.  I am not going to address the suffering of the Ukrainian people in this short essay, but that does not mean that I’m elevating the importance of Russians’ economic suffering over theirs — this is a case of writing what I know.  Besides sending remittances to my family members, I’ve received a number of requests from friends, and friends of friends, for crypto advice. As a crypto-savvy foreigner with an American bank account, I’m a financial guru to them (and to them alone).  When a large crypto exchange in Turkey had an outage for a day and none of the crypto ATMs worked, friends turned to me for advice. When a friend’s Russian company was unable to pay their freelancers through PayPal, I paid in fiat and accepted DAI in return. When a friend needed help with rent, I used LocalBitcoins to turn my BTC into rubles for them. When a friend needed to send me her dollars out of a Russian bank before they were seized, I planned to give her USDC in exchange. Unfortunately in this case, the bank canceled her wire transfer and closed her account for even attempting to send money to an American bank.  See also: EU Says Russia, Belarus Sanctions Extend to Crypto  In the two months since the war began, I’ve spoken about the benefits of crypto more than I ever have before. I’ve had to look up Russian words to increase my financial vocabulary and explain how crypto transfers work. If you’re bilingual, do you know how to say “stablecoin” in your second language? What about “peer-to-peer”? What about “gas fees”?  Crypto payments: incredibly useful in a very specific way  All this – and I’m a crypto skeptic! I’ve been able to work in the crypto industry without necessarily believing crypto to be the true future of money, without necessarily believing that blockchain is a world-changing technology. And as I said before, even now when crypto is “working” it still comes loaded with problems. I’ve been talking this whole time about sending money to the wrong side of the war. If helping stranded Russian refugees is crypto’s best use case to date, then crypto might have a PR problem.  Does crypto work for the greater good? Even before the war, I had seen crypto work in weird ways for my underpaid Russian friends: One made a small fortune in NBA Top Shot NFTs (without knowing what basketball is) and was able to buy an apartment. Another used his design degree to make some pretty high-selling NFTs, which is quite important now that he is geo-blocked from every design program he used to work on. Is Russia the case of cryptocurrency truly banking the unbanked?  At the very least, I can say that in the right time, in the right place, cryptocurrency has helped my Russian friends and family enormously. In the future, we can’t know what crypto will do. The war’s course is unpredictable – we don’t know what new economics realities will face the Russian population next month or even tomorrow. And so might crypto’s course be.  All that I can keep doing is helping out my Russian circle in any little way that I can, staying away from proselytizing about the “future of crypto” and sticking to real uses for getting money in and out of foreign countries. This is not a case of HODLing or orange pilling or going to the moon – it’s a case of crypto being incredibly useful in a very specific way. Maybe we need a new acronym – CBIUVSW?

42374874,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3EcD,1650895922,First Mover Americas: The Bitcoin Death Cross,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Risk-off drives bitcoin lower. The cryptocurrency's three-day chart shows an impending death cross.  Chartist's Corner: ‘Built to Fail?’ Why TerraUSD’s growth is giving finance experts nightmares.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Sergey Vasylchuk, founder and CEO, Everstake  Maxim Galash, CEO, Coinchange  Dan Jeffries, managing director, AI Infrastructure Alliance  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's bear market has plenty of steam left. That's the message from an impending death cross on the lesser-followed three-day chart, where each candle represents 72 hours.  The death cross occurs when the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA) crosses below the 200-candle SMA. Aficionados of technical analysis consider the ominously sounding chart pattern a warning of a more profound price drop.  And while its predictive powers are constantly questioned, given it is based on backward-looking moving averages, its past record on the three-day chart as a doom indicator is perfect.  Bitcoin's stalled bear market resumed with prices falling by more than 40% in the weeks following the confirmation of the death cross on the three-day chart in mid-November 2018. Similar price action was observed following the death cross of mid-December 2014.  Notably, bitcoin (BTC) bottomed out a month later on both occasions. In other words, the post-death cross sell-off marked the final legs of the then-bear markets.  So, if history is a guide, bitcoin could be in for another round of beating before prospects turn bright.  Risk-off  Bitcoin dropped to $38,300 early Monday as renewed coronavirus outbreak in China threatened to worsen the high inflation-low growth situation facing the global economy. Ether (ETH) followed suit, dropping to $2,800 at one point, the lowest since mid-March.  Bitcoin's implied volatility, or expectations for price turbulence, spiked on aggressive options buying.  That was expected, given the implied volatility looked cheap compared to its historical standards and lifetime average. The implied volatility is mean-reverting. Therefore, savvy traders buy options when the implied volatility is cheap and sell when it is expensive.

Why TerraUSD’s Growth Is Giving Finance Experts Nightmares  By David Z. Morris  Late on Monday, April 18, the stablecoin terraUSD (UST) edged out Binance’s BUSD to become the third-largest stablecoin by market cap. There are now nearly $18 billion UST in circulation. That’s well below the nearly $50 billion total for Circle’s USDC, or the $82 billion worth of Tether’s USDT roaming the Earth.  But UST is also much different from those competitors, in ways that could make it incredibly risky.  Stablecoins are tokens tracked by a blockchain, but in contrast to assets like bitcoin (BTC), they’re intended to consistently match the buying power of a fiat currency, most often the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins were first created to give active crypto traders a tool for moving quickly between more volatile positions, though as we’ll see, the potential for big interest rates on loans has also helped attract capital.  USDT and USDC are so-called “backed” or collateralized stablecoins. They keep their 1:1 dollar “peg” because they are (ostensibly) backed by bank accounts holding dollars, or by other dollar equivalent assets, for which tokens can be redeemed – although Tether has been notoriously reticent to specify the nature of its reserves.  UST, by contrast, began life as what’s known as an “algorithmic” stablecoin. These could also be referred to as “decentralized” stablecoins because decentralization is their primary reason for existing. A collateralized stablecoin like USDT or USDC is reliant on banks and traditional markets. That makes them in turn subject to regulation, enforcement and ultimately, censorship of transactions. Circle and Tether are run by centralized corporate entities with the ability to blacklist users and even seize their funds. Both systems have done this, sometimes at government behest.  In principle, algorithmic stablecoins like UST don’t have this censorship risk because they are not run by centralized corporate structures and do not hold backing in traditional institutions like banks. Of course, in reality “decentralization” is relative, and most such systems today still have key men, such as Do Kwon at Terraform Labs, or affiliated organizations that provide labor and funding. Whatever a system’s “decentralized” branding, regulators can still go after such public targets, a risk that’s worth keeping in mind.  Read The Full Story Here: ‘Built to Fail’?

It was a milestone moment in history, illustrating the strength of internet communities teaming together to take on the financial world. While this was a groundbreaking event, it wasn&apos;t the first time online communities have pooled their resources to support a worthy cause. It&apos;s true that the cryptocurrency industry has been doing this for years, and it has done so by utilizing relatively new technology rather than decades-old stock exchanges. Even while there are still web forums dedicated to stock purchasing, the cryptocurrency community has grown to be known as one of the most vocal and united in its goal in recent months.

DOGE surged to as much as $0.14 at writing time from the $0.12 level in Asian morning hours. Twitter (TWTR) futures trading in Frankfurt jumped 6.48%, data shows.  Social media giant Twitter is working out the terms of the transaction and could reach an agreement as soon as Monday, as per Reuters. Musk, who owns electric car maker Tesla and space exploration firm SpaceX, among other businesses, currently owns 9.2% of Twitter, as per a filing earlier this month.  Dogecoin's price and Musk’s imminent takeover of Twitter are not directly correlated. However, some analysts say Musk’s repeated endorsement of the memecoin attracts speculation from crypto investors hoping for dogecoin to be included in Twitter’s long-term plans.  “The speculation is that advertisers could be able to pay DOGE for ads and for other uses on Twitter,” Kryptomon Chief Marketing Officer Tomer Nuni explained to CoinDesk earlier this month. “We have seen the same happening when Tesla revealed the ability to pay for its goods with DOGE. So the speculation could be around Musk’s businesses and stakeholdings starting to accept crypto, as Tesla does.”  Earlier this month, Musk teased DOGE payments on Twitter in a tweet, proposing dogecoin as one of the payment options for Twitter Blue, the site’s subscription service with premium features.  Tesla already accepts DOGE payments on its online merchandise store. Musk has also previously lent support to dogecoin development and adoption, such as a May 2021 tweet that saw Musk state he was working with dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/25/dogecoin-surges-nearly-9-amid-reports-that-twitter-will-accept-musks-takeover-offer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3618e3168fec7117255fadf6b35f14e823636898-3626x2417.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hashdex is currently recruiting teams in London, Zurich, Paris and Lisbon to meet its expansion plans.

Crypto projects may burn tokens to reduce supply, which could lead to increased prices in the future as tokens become more scarce.  While the community already burns tokens, the portal incentivizes the process for users. It allows users to send SHIB tokens to a dead wallet address and in exchange sends “burntSHIB” tokens to users.  These can then be staked to generate rewards for users in the form of RYOSHI tokens, a separate token created by the Shiba Inu community.  Some 11 billion SHIB tokens have been burned since the portal started operation on Sunday, data shows. This amounts to just over $251,000 at current prices.

42407280,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSLs,1650887541,Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigrés Opposing Putin’s War in Ukraine,"Imagine traveling abroad and waking up one day to find your debit card has turned into a useless piece of plastic.  This nightmare came true for most if not all of the hundreds of thousands of Russians who fled their country after President Vladimir Putin started a war in Ukraine and introduced a kind of soft martial law at home.  Soon after the Feb. 24 invasion, Visa and Mastercard stopped processing payments for cards issued in Russia. Many Russians abroad found themselves suddenly unbanked. Around that time, the ruble plummeted and Russians at home rushed to banks and ATMs in a panic. Soon, withdrawal limits were introduced.  “When I heard the cards won’t work anymore I went to an ATM and checked it out – yes, it didn’t.” said Artem Loskutov, a modern artist who went on vacation to Thailand before the war and decided not to come back for a while. “I asked my girlfriend in Moscow to take out some dollars in cash from an ATM, but that was the moment when they stopped cash withdrawals from the foreign currency accounts.”  The lack of options has made Russian emigrés worldwide look beyond traditional payment systems. For at least a few, cryptocurrency has proven to be a serviceable, if kludgy, alternative. It's not easy to use, but anyone can use it, regardless of location or nationality.  These Russians have been using crypto as a last resort at the same time as Ukraine has raised over $100 million in crypto donations to fund weapons and supplies for the army, humanitarian aid, evacuation and other things people desperately need during the war.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  Many Russians condemned the war that has caused the destruction of entire cities and thousands of civilian casualties in Ukraine. Some of those Russians decided to leave the country to avoid being penalized for their anti-war stance. Although recent estimates show a significant part of the population supports the invasion, for those who disagree, Russia swiftly passed a law effectively criminalizing any critique of the armed forces, with up to 15 years in prison as punishment.  Journalists, political activists, artists and others flew out of Russia, landing mostly in countries that allow Russians to enter without a visa, including Turkey and the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Armenia. Their flight was made much harder as global payment systems, such as Visa, Mastercard, Western Union, Wise, Remitly and MoneyGram, stopped working with Russia and Russia, in turn, limited the amount of foreign currency one can take abroad to $10,000 per person.  Some countries allow foreigners to register local bank accounts, but oftentimes, it requires paperwork, which can get tricky for Russians, who are being scrutinized even more than usual these days by foreign banks after the U.S. and Europe heavily sanctioned Russia.  OTC brokers and P2P platforms  Stuck with no access to his bank account in Thailand and scrambling to get a local one, Loskutov started asking his friends what could be done.  He found an over-the-counter (OTC) broker. OTC refers to businesses that trade directly with customers rather than through an exchange. The broker agreed to help Loskutov get Thai baht in exchange for the dollars stuck in his Russian account – using USDT, a cryptocurrency whose value is tied to the U.S. dollar, as a bridge. The scheme was elaborate and simple at the same time.  Read More: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post-Dollar Planet  The friendly broker showed Loskutov how the Binance exchange’s peer-to-peer (p2p) platforms work. Although the exchange recently stopped accepting Russia-issued bank cards, on its p2p platform, you still can find offerings to buy and sell crypto using accounts at some Russian banks. So the broker found someone who was ready to sell USDT for a transfer to his account at the same bank as Loskutov used.  Then the broker asked Loskutov to send the payment to the seller, while the seller transferred USDT to the broker’s own account. After that, the broker sold the USDT on the same p2p marketplace by Binance, received Thai baht at his Thai bank account and then transferred them to an account of Loskutov’s friend, as he himself hadn’t yet set up a local bank account of his own. Loskutov ended up paying 7% to 10% in fees on those transactions.  As he kept exploring crypto options, Loskutov realized the p2p market in Thailand was flourishing. The popular channel for currency exchange is a local chat on the Telegram messaging app, where Russian-speaking expats seek counterparties to swap rubles for dollars, baht for USDT and so on in different combinations.  In any case, crypto remains a “working option” for him, Loskutov said. “Our Motherland has failed us, and so did the West – well, what can you do? We need to survive.”  Russian expat communities and crypto payments  In other countries, too, Russian expat communities have been growing, as have specialized chat groups for p2p deals. In those chats, ordinary people look for counterparties and intermediaries like Loskutov’s p2p facilitator who are willing to offer fast deals for a fee.  In Montenegro, a small European nation on the Adriatic coast, the local Telegram group for crypto and fiat currency exchange counts a little more than 3,000 users from Ukraine, Russia and other Russian-speaking countries who are looking to swap their rubles or hryvnias for euros, euros for USDT and vice versa.  “Montenegro is a small country, so in two hours, you can get basically everywhere and meet in person,” says a Russian journalist who relocated there long before the war. He asked not to be named for safety reasons, because some of his family remain in Russia. For this story, we will call him Oleg.  “Here, everybody knows each other, so if someone screws you over, you can easily find them,” Oleg said. “In this small world, it’s quite hard to swindle each other.”  The journalist left Russia when he felt the authorities’ attention to his work was growing increasingly hostile.  “For years, I’ve been living with this picture in my mind of how the police would raid my house with my little daughter watching,” Oleg said, referring to the police raids at journalists’ homes that became a source of routine harassment for reporters who annoyed the authorities the most.  “At some point, I felt that my every day is overshadowed by this anxiety, and it’s just impossible to live like that; you start degrading.”  Montenegro is one of the no-visa countries where Russians can easily enter and legally stay for long periods of time, and the costs of living are low, compared with the rest of Europe. Ukrainian refugees have moved there, too, as they escaped the war via the southwestern border of Ukraine, going west through Romania, Hungary and then the Balkans.  Ukrainians could have been the reason the fees recently went down for p2p trades and liquidity grew, Oleg said, because Ukrainian citizens, unlike Russians, still can use their bank cards abroad, as well as global remittance services.  Read More: Ukraine Is Buying Bulletproof Vests and Night-Vision Goggles Using Crypto  “My hypothesis is that Ukrainians can cash out their money much easier, so now, Russians turned to Ukrainians” to exchange money in Montenegro, he said.  ‘Worse than a bank’: A Russian’s emotional letter to Binance  Oleg started paying attention to crypto after he left Russia last year, and has tried a bunch of things since then. To get his money out of his Russian bank account, he decided to use crypto so that Russian authorities couldn’t track his funds in the global banking system. So he bought some ether with funds from the bank accounts.  Then, he swapped ether for USDT and invested all the money in futures contracts. Futures trading seemed exciting at first, and Oleg even made some money, he said. That, however, was “neophyte's luck.” Last September, the market went down, and Oleg lost all of his investment.  Then, another chance came: His wife got paid for her work in crypto. Oleg did some research and found out that very few crypto exchanges allowed withdrawals to Montenegro bank accounts (which Oleg at that point managed to get), and those that did allow withdrawals didn’t look reliable to him, he said. So he used the p2p way and swapped his crypto for cash with a stranger at a local cafe.  If there was no crypto, our losses and sufferings would be much bigger.  Now, Oleg is trying to relocate his mother to Montenegro, too, and get her savings out of Russia using Binance, he said. His mother was on board with the plan, but because she is an elderly lady with little IT experience, Oleg is doing everything himself. At one point, Binance froze the account, requiring additional verification.  “That was worse than a bank!” Oleg said of the experience.  He had only a few days between Visa and Mastercard announcing they wouldn’t work with Russian cards anymore and the moment Binance stopped accepting such cards. Oleg got his mom an account on Binance, his sister back home helped take her picture, and then Oleg started buying USDT. After that, Binance noticed “suspicious activity” with the account, possibly triggered by the inconsistency of Oleg’s IP address and his mom’s actual location. The account was frozen.  Read More: Ukraine Crypto Exchange Founder Accuses Binance of 'Cooperating' With the Russian Government  As he was waiting for his appeal to be processed, Oleg wrote an emotional letter to Binance.  “I said, ‘Look, these are my lifetime savings, and if you don’t speed this up, my Russian bank card will stop working and all my savings will go to fund Russian bombs and tanks. So that will be your fault, and I will end up with no money,’” he recalled.  Soon after that, the account was unfrozen, Oleg said, and his parents’ savings ended up on a Binance account in USDT. But then, Binance banned the account from withdrawing funds, demanding additional detailed verification. At the moment, Oleg is working on getting this resolved and getting his mom out of Russia.  Despite the quirks of the crypto world, Oleg said he is glad this channel exists.  “If there was no crypto, our losses and sufferings would be much bigger. When your government goes berserk, it’s good to have this little argument you can put against it,” he said.  Crypto as a backup option  For some Russian emigrés, cryptocurrency proved to be not the main money-moving tool, but rather a clumsy and expensive back-up option in case nothing else worked.  Another expat, whom we’ll call Alexander, works at a startup helping people invest in in-game items (like skins, virtual weapons, etc.) as if they were stocks. He asked that his last name and employer’s name not be published. The company did invest in NFT (non-fungible token) projects, Alexander said, but he hadn’t really used crypto for his personal needs until the war started and he left Moscow for Batumi, Georgia.  Alexander spent most of his life in Moscow, but his family came out of Georgia and his grandparents live there. When the war started, it wasn’t clear whether Russia was going to close its borders, Alexander said. He hadn’t seen his grandparents for a long time because of the global COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions. And so he decided there was no better time to visit his historic Motherland.  Alexander flew to Georgia in March and is now planning to establish his residence there. But although his company operates in virtual reality, it is legally based in Russia, and so his income accumulates in an account in a Russian bank.  Alexander used Binance’s p2p platform to buy USDT, but then it turned out he couldn’t withdraw Georgian lari to a local debit card because Binance didn't support Georgian cards, he said. So he withdrew USDT to another exchange, in this case CEX.io, where Alexander sold USDT for a lari transfer to his relative’s bank account.  When the war started, both these centralized exchanges, in a sense, “sanctioned” their Russian users, although differently: While Binance stopped accepting Russian bank cards, CEX.io suspended deposits and withdrawals for users from Russia.  However, this method, at the end, felt too costly and clunky for Alexander to use regularly, he said. Now, he’s looking into more traditional, fiat remittance options that still work for Russian citizens. For example, KoronaPay, a Cyprus-registered fintech company, allows users to send money between Russia and multiple other countries, including some in the European Union, similar to what Western Union does.  Read More: US Sanctions Russian Crypto Mining Host BitRiver  In Georgia, it’s possible to receive cash via KoronaPay at the offices of local banks for a small fee, Alexander said. The only downside is that banks, apparently, have daily withdrawal limits for KoronaPay customers, and so one day, Alexander walked into a bank branch just to hear there was no cash for him left, he said. The next day, everything worked.  Another option Alexander is considering now is Bankoff, a service that issues virtual debit cards that cannot be topped-up via Russian bank accounts, but can be with USDT. Alexander heard about Bankoff in Georgia and tried it out for a small payment, he said.  Now, crypto seems a good option for transferring large amounts, while for smaller transfers, other arrangements look better, Alexander said.  Savings choice  “I keep around 80% of my savings in crypto. It gives me peace of mind and a sense of freedom from any sanctions,” said Tim, a digital security consultant for a Russian nonprofit, who relocated to Asia in December. He too asked that his family name not be published.  Tim got his first crypto in January, when he convinced his employer to send his paycheck in bitcoin, and then he converted it to USDT.  “I had an income from outside of Russia and I wanted to keep it outside of Russia in order not to pay taxes funding Putin’s regime – which funded another war, it turned out – and also not to get a status of a foreign agent,” Tim says. He was referring to the recent practice in Russia to label independent journalists and political activists as foreign agents if they receive any funds from abroad. This became a method of pressure on those who made the ruling regime unhappy.  At first, Tim wasn’t planning to emigrate. In December, he went to Europe for a training trip with a Russian nongovernmental organization he’s working for – he asked that it not be named. Then, he traveled some more and ended up in Asia. Then the war started.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Tim admitted that he’s still arguing with himself whether he should return to Russia and advocate for stopping the war from inside.  “I’m staying, and I feel shame for this. But here, I can still work and be helpful, and there, I will just end up in jail,” he said.  Because Russian debit cards stopped working abroad, Tim’s main source of cash for living has been his crypto savings. And here, again, the gray market is king.  “There are Telegram channels where OTC desks advertise, I tell them the amount and my location, they connect me to someone working in that area. I meet them in their car, send them USDT and get local currency in response,” Tim said.  According to Tim, people are using centralized exchanges in the country he’s in, and bank accounts have recently become available for foreigners, too. The local currency, however, is “falling faster than the Russian ruble,” and Tim doesn’t want to lose money on exchange rates.  “I’m using stablecoins because I haven’t done enough research to find the best cryptocurrency for me yet. Next step is to invest in various cryptos in order to diversify my bag,” he said.  Binance declined to comment for this story.

42407304,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdbX,1650886715,Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background,"You know you are still in the early days of a new industry when conferences are entirely devoted to the hardware and software, rather than the outcomes that people care about.  With the just concluded Bitcoin Miami behind us, it seems fair to ask whether Satoshi Nakamoto's promise of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system will be made possible, even while bitcoin maximalists declare that the cryptocurrency will be the only currency in the world of tomorrow.  The promise of crypto payments may seem elusive 13 years after the publication of the pseudonymous Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper ushered in the blockchain revolution. However, it is useful to go to another conference (one that is more of a mainstream payments event) to get a read on whether crypto remains “fringe finance,” or if it is breaking into the mainstream.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  At Money 20/20 late last year in Las Vegas, the crypto conversation, which used to be relegated to the margins, was a main stage conversation. Many events were standing room only, including those with stalwart payments, banking and traditional financial services firms (or TradFi in crypto parlance).  The evolution in interest among TradFi, which was once dominated by diehard crypto skeptics, from crypto curiosity to crypto commitment is perhaps the industry’s most important move yet. Not because digital assets needed the legitimization of Wall Street, but because Wall Street needs the always-on power, trust and business model transformation of open blockchain networks.  The most prominent crypto about-face belongs to JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon infamously threatened to terminate any employee caught trading in crypto; his bank now embraces blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). They are no longer alone among financial services firms that are household names.  Antithesis or synthesis?  The question, however, is whether crypto payments will compete with existing payments and banking rails, or will a trend of convergence make crypto payments an alternative settlement layer for traditional players, thus building a bridge to everyday use.  Nowhere is this trend clearer than in the stablecoin segment, which are asset-backed cryptocurrencies designed to maintain price stability to underlying reference assets. Indeed, precisely because stablecoins hold the promise (more so than any other activity in the crypto economy) of being used by billions of people for everyday economic activity, they have animated a global policy and regulatory review.  Even though not all stablecoins are created equal, by solving crypto’s original sin of buyer’s and spender’s remorse, stablecoins like USDC are breaking into a class of use cases that require underwriting. In short, the ability to satisfactorily “show me the money” has marked a breakthrough in stablecoin use in real-world payments.  Indeed, as the blockchain development race gathers steam, high performing blockchains, such as Solana, and newer chains, such as those launched by Novi alumni, one innovation transcends them all – the stablecoin, despite myths and occasional FUD.  The years ahead  Are we headed to an omni-chain future that may very well replicate the walled gardens in the traditional economy? Or are we headed to a world with one chain to rule them all?  This cycle of creative destruction in the blockchain or Web 3 market means the internet of value is already here, but it may still be in its dial-up phase.  What will the transition look like to “mainstream adoption,” whatever that even means? Is it that the promise of crypto payments merely gets co-opted by traditional players that were late to the party? Or, will mainstream adoption really mean population scale peer-to-peer payments, where friction and the lack of interoperability not only fade to the background, but national borders do as well?  Blockchain will change the world more than it already has when the technology fades to the deep background. Likewise, crypto payments will have changed the world when there are no longer conversations about cross-border payments, but rather low-cost instant payment networks of global scale enabling instant value transmission between trusted parties.  Achieving this state won’t be possible for any single firm, no matter how big or technologically endowed they may be, or what regulatory or operational moat they may enjoy courtesy of proprietary technology or political favor. Rather, turning every internet connected device on the planet into a compliant payment endpoint may very well be one of the world’s most important technological priorities.  Some projects have famously (or perhaps infamously) endeavored to connect these dots, while others continue to forge ahead committing to open source innovation and public blockchains as the financial infrastructure of the future.  More than 200 million people have taken the long position on this bet, and some now can even buy a cup of coffee with a stablecoin.

42407287,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSj1,1650886692,"Drugs, Drugs and More Drugs: Crypto on the Dark Web","It’s a website that sells products. Just like on Amazon, the products have customer reviews. “Was the harshest tar I’ve ever smoked. I’m never using this vendor again,” grumbled one customer. Another: “Nice big rocks.” A third: “F#cking fire.” One more: “Quality BTH, very strong, great for smoking and shooting.”  BTH stands for black tar heroin. And these are all reviews for drugs sold – openly, in plain sight – on illicit marketplaces on the dark web. The drugs have names like “Connoisseur Colombian Cocaine (off the brick) BEST IN THE US” and “Crystal Meth 99% (FREE SHIPPING).”  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  Each vendor has a bio and profile page. “I am a PHD student and I LOVE chemistry!” said one vendor in their bio. “Anything about chemistry absolutely gets my heart. I let this passion flow into my work.” And this work, of course, is making and selling drugs like MDMA. Customers rate the vendors on the usual metrics you see on Amazon – the quality of the product, the speed of shipping – but also something called “Stealth.” As one happy customer gushes, “Incredible stealth, great communication.”  You don’t pay with a credit card. You don’t pay with Venmo. You don’t pay with cash.  You pay for the drugs with cryptocurrency.  In the case of this dark market, you pay using monero, a privacy coin. And in some ways, this corner of the dark web is a throwback to the earliest days of cryptocurrency adoption. “A lot of purists don’t like to admit it, but Silk Road was the first major use case for Bitcoin,” said Eileen Ormsby, author of “Silk Road: The Shocking True Story Of The World's Most Notorious Online Drug Market.”  And to some extent, that use case has never really gone away. “The ecosystem is still quite vibrant,” said Nicolas Christin, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who has studied dark web markets since 2011 and wrote the original study of economic activity on the Silk Road. Cristin estimates that these markets still represent “between half a billion dollars and billion dollars per year,” as new sites pop up – inevitably – to replace the ones that shut down, such as Hydra. “We’ve seen this story five or six times,” said Cristin. “At this point, it starts to look a little bit like ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies. You think something new is going to happen, but it’s always more of the same.”  Before we go any further, some critical perspective: By any measure, illicit activity is only a tiny slice of the overall crypto pie. According to the most recent crime report from Chainalysis, transactions involving illicit addresses accounted for just 0.15% of all cryptocurrency volume in 2021, which is down from 0.6% in 2020 and 3.4% in 2019. That’s consistent with other findings. “Bitcoin transactions linked to illicit activity are below 1% of total transactions and have been for some time,” Jess Symington, research lead at Elliptic, wrote me in an email. “We have seen a clear downward trend in the overall proportion of illicit activity as mainstream acceptance of crypto-assets has rapidly increased.”  It’s also true that cryptocurrency is generally easier to trace than cash (more on that in a bit), which means that when people use bitcoin for shady purposes, law enforcement is more likely to catch them. Saying “crypto is for crooks” is one of the oldest misconceptions in the space. This has long been debunked. It’s classic “FUD.”  All of that is true.  That said, CoinDesk’s “Payments Week” is exploring the various ways that cryptocurrencies are actually being used to pay for goods and services. There are other features covering how crypto can be leveraged as a force for good, such as improving international remittances. Crypto helped people send aid to Ukraine with breathtaking speed; this almost certainly saved lives. Illicit activity is only a small piece of the overall crypto puzzle. So, this is not about moralizing or pearl clutching. (And to put cards on the table and in full disclosure, I personally own bitcoin.) But if we’re exploring the current state of play for how cryptocurrency is actually being used as a form of payment, it would be intellectually dishonest to ignore its role in illicit activity.  Okay. So with that said, on these dark markets, what are people buying with their cryptocurrency?  The short answer is drugs, drugs and more drugs. “You can find anything, but the vast majority of it is cannabis, cocaine and MMDA,” said Christin, who calls these drugs “the big three,” and estimates they account for 50% to 75% of the illicit action, which can vary from market to market. This trend is not new. The high percentage of drugs “has been surprisingly stable over the past 10 years,” he noted.  Kim Grauer is a coauthor of the Chainanalysis crime report. She agrees that on marketplaces like the Silk Road, drugs are by far the biggest category. “We see any drug under the sun,” said Grauer. They also see less common items: stolen passports, stolen credit cards, skinny pills, Ivermectin, weapons like grenade launchers and even vials of COVID. (She stresses that this is rare.)  The weapons market might be smaller than you think. “That’s a blip,” said Cristin. “That’s almost nothing.” The reason? “The largest market for this [weapons] would be the United States, and you don’t need to go to the dark web to buy a weapon, no questions asked,” he said. Cristin acknowledges that the demand might be higher in countries with stricter gun regulations (like in Europe or Australia), but there are other practical constraints. “It’s very easy to drop MMDA in the mail,” said Cristin. “But it’s really hard to send a Glock in the mail. It’s incredibly hard to send a bazooka in the mail.”  An easier item to send or receive: hacked customer data. And the dark market for hacked data is on the rise, said Ormsby. The real goodies are something known as ""Fullz,"" as in the “full information” on a customer. Fullz can be bought and sold. “Someone says, ‘I hacked Big Company X, and I have all of their customer names, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers. I’m willing to sell one million of these to anyone who wants to buy them,” said Ormsby. Then the buyers can use these Fullz to open new bank accounts or create bogus identities.  Then there’s the darker stuff. “Hit men sites are still prolific,” said Ormsby, adding that these are usually scams. Here’s how it works, as Ormsby describes it: You pay upfront to ask a hit man to kill someone, but then he takes your crypto and he bails. “What recourse does the guy have? The hit man has no incentive to carry out the murder,” said Ormsby. “The fake hit men, they take in lots of money.” (Aside: Hey Netflix, free show idea. DM me.)  Ormsby, Grauer and Christin all agreed that the truly despicable dark stuff – such as sex trafficking, or anything involving children – is largely absent from the dark web marketplaces. “They won’t touch certain things that will make them an immediate target [by law enforcement]. Child sexual abuse materials is definitely one of them,” said Grauer. “For anything that would be like a red, red, flag, a lot of these marketplaces say in capital letters at the top, that they don’t do that stuff.”  Ormsby found the same thing. “There’s no dark-net market that will allow child abuse markets on it,” she said. “Mainly because they would turn customers away in droves. For most people that are buying drugs online, that’s their only crime. They’re buying drugs online for themselves. … They don’t want perverted stuff on their site.” As for porn? Crypto’s use at sites like OnlyFans has been well-documented (and debated), but Ormsby adds that dark-net markets sometimes sell “log-ins to premium porn sites. A way of getting the stuff that you’d normally pay for. That’s as far as they’d go.”  At this point, you might be wondering, why the hell are people buying drugs online, given the risk of getting traced and tracked and caught? “People really like buying their drugs online,” said Ormsby, explaining that it’s for the same reasons we enjoy buying legal goods online – convenience and trust. “At least when you’re buying online, you have pretty good feedback on vendors.”  Just like on Amazon, drug vendors have star ratings that users can see. “They depend on repeat customers,” explains Ormsby. “They don’t want to sell bad drugs once, and then [the customer] never comes back and tells all their friends. They do their best to live up to their reputation.” And as for how vendors can broadcast their “reputation” without fear of exposure? “Tor is a complete privacy browser,” said Ormsby, referring to the anonymous browser used to access the dark markets. “It scrubs out information from people on both sides. It can host a site that can’t be found.”  Using Tor itself is not illegal. They’re used by whistleblowers and investigative newspapers. (The New York Times has a Tor page.) The CIA has a Tor website so that people can anonymously report tips on, say, a possible terrorist attack. “You just download Tor,” said Ormsby. “That’s legal. That’s simple.” And suddenly you’re in the dark web.  Some of these dark markets accept bitcoin, some only take privacy coins like monero. It’s common for buyers to pay for their drugs with bitcoin, and then for the vendors to swap their bitcoin into a privacy coin. But this can be tough to do at scale. Vendors could face a liquidity problem.  “If you have $600 million in monero hacked, you’re going to have trouble liquidating all of that monero,” said Grauer. “It’s just not as liquid as many of these other cryptocurrencies.”  So how common are privacy coins compared to bitcoin? It’s a tricky question that still puzzles the experts. “It’s a complicated ecosystem that we’re throwing our heads together to try to figure out,” said Grauer. She adds that ChainAnalysis currently has R&D efforts underway involving monero, but she’s not yet allowed to share any details.  There are two final points to consider.  First, it’s true that the amount of illicit activity from cryptocurrency is a tiny slice of the overall pie. “It’s a really tiny percentage, and as a percentage it’s going down all the time,” said Ormsby. Grauer – who studies the role of cryptocurrency in crime – believes that “the industry is becoming more safe overall.” This has broad consensus.  However, there’s one complicating wrinkle that’s rarely discussed: We also know that the bulk of cryptocurrency transactions are related to investing, speculation and financial trading. Actual legitimate payments for goods and services are a small slice of the crypto pie. “The vast majority of transactions are for cryptocurrency derivatives, Binance futures and things like that,” said Cristin. “To the tune of between $50 billion and $100 billion per day.”  Why does this matter? It’s true that illicit activity only accounts for a small fraction of crypto. But much of crypto is used for financial speculation. What if we ask a different question: When we look only at the scope of cryptocurrency payments for goods or services, what percent is used for illicit activity?  “That’s such a good question,” said Grauer. And it’s one that no one seems to have a solid answer for, not even using the sophisticated tools at ChainAnalysis. “It’s something that we have trouble figuring out,” explains Grauer, because there’s no obvious way to tell if a transaction is used to pay a merchant or to buy and hold bitcoin. So how can Chainanalysis track illicit activity with confidence, but only have a fuzzy sense of legal payments? “Crime data is just easier,” said Grauer. “If you identify a ransomware wallet, you don’t have to speculate as to what’s happening with the funds.” It’s just easier to track dark payments than normal payments.  And finally, to underscore a point made earlier, in general, using cryptocurrency for illicit activity makes it more likely that you’ll get busted. This is the ultimate irony for crypto and crime. In the early days of bitcoin, people thought it was the perfect way to do naughty things online. Then they found they could get traced and caught.  Just ask Michael Morell, the former acting director and deputy director of the CIA. Morell conducted a sweeping review of crypto’s role in illicit activity. In his reporthttps://cryptoforinnovation.org/resources/Analysis_of_Bitcoin_in_Illicit_Finance.pdf, he noted that one expert said that “if all criminals used blockchain, we could wipe out illicit financial activity.”  Morrell, a 33-year veteran of the CIA, concluded that “Based on our research, I have come to believe that if there was one financial ecosystem for bad actors to use that would maximize law enforcement’s chances of identifying them and their illicit activities, it would be blockchain.”  More from Payments Week:  Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  The evolution in interest among TradFi, which was once dominated by diehard crypto skeptics, from crypto curiosity to crypto commitment is perhaps the industry’s most important move yet.

42407285,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxScP,1650886665,Why Banks and Payment Processors Shun Perfectly Legal Businesses,"“Bitcoin fixes this” is a popular refrain whenever a gun store or exotic dancer loses access to payment processing. But what causes “this” in the first place?  As long as people have been going online and paying to do things viewed as socially undesirable, there have been movements to use the payments system to prevent transactions associated with that activity from taking place.  More than 20 years ago, Rep. Jim Leach, a Republican congressman from Iowa, led a yearslong crusade to make it illegal for banks chartered in the United States to process payments for online casinos, even though the majority of those operations were legal in the countries where they were located.  More recently, the Obama administration’s Justice Department, from 2013 to 2017, ran Operation Choke Point, which targeted banks offering services to a vast array of businesses it deemed to present a high risk for fraud or money laundering. The list covered everything from the blatantly illegal, such as Ponzi schemes, to the simply disfavored, including tobacco sales, payday loan operations, “racist materials” and porn.  Choke Point was discontinued in 2017 amid accusations that it wrongly targeted legal businesses and the settlement of lawsuits brought against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. by businesses that were cut off from banking services.  While there may no longer be a concerted effort in the U.S. to block disfavored industries from accessing the payments system, many of the same legal businesses targeted by the feds in the past, and some that have only recently emerged, including firms in the cryptocurrency industry, still find it difficult to get access to payments services.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  In most cases, the problem isn’t attributable to law enforcement and bank regulators, as it was under Operation Choke Point. Rather, banks that serve as gatekeepers to the system simply don’t wish to do business with what they perceive as high-risk clients.  In general, companies in the payments industry label businesses as “high risk” if those businesses generate a large number of disputed transactions or if they operate a business that presents the possibility of damaging a bank’s reputation.  In some cases, intermediaries succumb to public pressure to remove merchants from their platforms. In 2018, PayPal (PYPL) announced it was blocking Infowars, the media company associated with conspiracy theorist and internet personality Alex Jones, from using its services, claiming that Jones “promoted hate.” The decision followed months of public pressure and came weeks after other major tech companies, including Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), had cut Jones off.  (As of last week, though, it remained possible to buy “Brain Force Plus” dietary supplements, “Alex Jones Was Right” T-shirts and a vast array of other items on the Infowars Store website, using any major credit card.)  The category of “high-risk” merchants is broader than one might assume, extending far beyond the realm of adult entertainment, gambling, drug paraphernalia and online psychics. Other businesses labeled as risky include large segments of the travel industry; furniture sellers; electronic retailers hosted by Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY) or Google (GOOG); and magazine subscriptions.  To be clear, while it is difficult for many of those businesses to get payment services, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Most legal businesses operating in the United States can find a way to hook into the payments system, but they have to pay a steep risk premium to do so.  “It is more expensive,” said Maria Sparagis, founder of DirectPayNet, which helps companies labeled as “high-risk” find payment processing services. “And sometimes it can be highway robbery. It depends on who you're working with.”  Skittish gatekeepers and financial exclusion  For merchants who want to be able to accept credit cards for their goods and services, the key relationship they need to have is with an “acquirer,” which is typically a bank that can process payments on the major networks, including Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and American Express (AXP).  While the payment systems themselves have rules that exclude some businesses, primarily outright illegal activities, most of the decisions about the kinds of business that can easily access the payments system are made at the bank level.  To simplify decision-making, banks usually divide prospective payments clients into categories, said Thomas A. Layman, president and CEO of Global Vision Group, a payments consultancy.  “Each merchant acquirer usually has a set of three,” he said. “Some are favored and they go right through. Others have to have more review. And then others, they just are prohibited.”  Because the decisions are made on a bank-by-bank basis, it can result in seemingly arbitrary distinctions between different kinds of businesses.  “A particular board of directors of a bank just does not want to be in adult entertainment, but they'll be happy to do gambling,” Layman said.  In some cases, bank management may decide to bar certain industries, like adult entertainment or gambling, because they don’t want their institution associated with those areas. In many cases, though, the decision about which industries to bar and which to accept is less about drawing moral distinctions between specific industries and more about simple risk management.  “To underwrite an account in a high-risk industry, you need an underwriter who understands that business in and out, and understands the risks, the implications, the fraud that can happen in this type of business on a transactional level, not just reputational risk,” Sparagis said.  “Say you're selling online prescriptions,” she continued. “It's legal to do that, but it's difficult for processors to accept these because there are licenses involved, there's a lot of research that the underwriter has to do to make sure that you're operating legally, that you're taking all the precautions that are necessary, that you’re keeping up with legislation.”  A person whose spouse finds a porn site subscription on the family credit card bill may well claim that the card was stolen and demand the charges be reversed.  One thing that most of the businesses labeled as high-risk have in common is a higher rate of disputed charges and refund requests than typical merchants.  A person whose spouse finds a porn site subscription on the family credit card bill may well claim the card was stolen and demand the charges be reversed, a request card networks require banks to honor.  Merchants like travel companies, where the payment is made far in advance of the service being delivered, often receive payment from the acquiring bank before a customer cancels a trip and demands a refund.  In both cases, the acquiring bank needs to trust that the merchant will have enough cash on hand to make the bank whole after a purchaser’s money is returned.  Higher costs for “high-risk” merchants  In a typical payment processing arrangement, a merchant pays a fee to the processing bank for each transaction. The fee covers the “interchange fee” collected by the card issuer, as well as the acquiring bank’s own fees. The interchange fee usually adds up to 1.5% to 3.5% of the total transaction, depending on the network.  For low-risk transactions, acquiring banks typically compete on price, with processing fees well below 0.5% of the total transaction.  “It's sort of a race to the bottom when there's no risk involved,” said Michael Liquornik, president of Fin-Serv Advisors, a payments consulting firm. Mainstream payments processing is a business that operates best at scale, he said, and so most providers focus on building up a large base of merchants.  In the high-risk sector, however, the calculus changes. According to personal finance site NerdWallet, typical processing fees charged by acquiring banks can be five times as high as those for more traditional businesses.  Startup struggles  For a high-risk startup trying to establish the kind of track record that would make a mainstream processor willing to take it on as a customer, the cost of entry can be even steeper.  Many turn to aggregators, which are companies that have relationships with acquiring banks and, for a price, assume some of the financial exposure related to high-risk businesses. That price can be 8%, 10% or even 12% of total transaction fees.  A typical startup’s strategy is to spend as little time as possible doing business with aggregators, building up enough of a reputation to persuade an acquiring bank to take it on.  But even with a history of steady business and a manageable rate of disputed charges, said Liquornik, some banks decide that the elevated processing fees just aren’t worth the trouble associated with high-risk clients.  “We would usually advise our clients to steer clear of a lot of these things. Whether it's financial, reputational or regulatory [risk], who needs this headache?” he said. “You have to remember, if you're providing a payment service, you typically have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of clients. How do you monitor the activity of all of those clients? It becomes almost impossible. The only way to approach it is to prohibit some edge cases.”  High-risk businesses that break through that reluctance and find an acquiring bank willing to work with them may face further hurdles. A common practice in the industry is to require them to establish a reserve account to protect the processor against unexpected claims in the event the merchant doesn’t have the funds to satisfy them.  A typical arrangement is a six-month “rolling reserve” of 10%. Under that arrangement, 10% of a merchants’ receipts are placed into an escrow account held by the processor. After the first six months of the relationship, the processor continues to withhold 10% of receipts, but pays out the first month’s reserve in order to maintain a balance of 10% of the previous six months’ receipts.  Hiding transactions  The difficulty of finding a payments processor leads some merchants into the legally dangerous practice of pretending to be a different sort of business altogether.  “Many merchants don't always tell you everything that they're selling,” said Layman of Global Vision Group. “There are a lot of websites out there that are really masking what I would call very high-risk merchants behind the scenes by appearing to be something else.”  Often that involves “miscoding” transactions by providing false information about the nature of a charge. In 2020, Visa and Mastercard imposed heavy fines on Wirecard, a now-insolvent German payments processor, for miscoding gambling transactions.  Misrepresenting the nature of a business in an application to a payment processor is an extremely risky move, said Adam Atlas, a New York-licensed crypto and payments lawyer.  “It is a crime in the U.S. to include false information in a bank account application, and the application for a payment processing account is tantamount to a bank account application,” he said. “There are a handful of criminal cases that I have seen where the prosecution has put its finger on factually incorrect information in the merchant account application as one of the bases on which to proceed with a criminal prosecution.”  The threat of prosecution doesn’t deter everyone, he said, and “willful blindness” on the part of some acquiring banks means that many legally dubious merchants are alive and well inside the payments system.  “If one were to audit every merchant account of every U.S. bank all the way down to the cardholder, the transaction and the settlement of funds, I would not be surprised if there were substantial volumes” of illegal activity, Atlas said.  The irony of crypto  Arguably, one of the few successful use cases for cryptocurrencies is as a means of payment for businesses, legal or otherwise, that have a hard time accessing mainstream payments processing at a reasonable price, or at all. Ironically, crypto businesses themselves struggle to gain acceptance by acquiring banks.  Much of the hesitation about providing payment services for crypto companies is a result of a lack of expertise among underwriters. If banks don’t understand the risks associated with a business, the thinking goes, they shouldn’t be processing payments for it.  According to Atlas, many banks also have doubts about crypto firms’ anti-money laundering screening processes and are afraid of “unknowingly assisting in money laundering.”  “Every crypto exchange, crypto liquidity provider or other crypto business that I see is having difficulty finding and maintaining banking and payment processing,” Atlas said.  “When a crypto exchange or crypto seller is looking to take payment by credit card or automated clearing house, they face a very difficult challenge of convincing the banks that control those services that they should be accepted as customers,” he said, though the reluctance is slowly fading.  “There was a time when absolutely anything to do with crypto was simply forbidden,” Atlas said. “I think we're past that era right now, and we're into an era where there are processing banks that welcome crypto businesses as clients, other acquiring banks that simply don't, but at least they understand what they're rejecting.”  Sparagis, of DirectPayNet, said there is still a fundamental lack of understanding within mainstream processors, of the crypto industry, making it a challenge to underwrite.  “Their staff is not necessarily up to date with everything that's happening in crypto,” she said. “I mean, we get a lot of leads. People who say, ‘Hey, I want to sell my NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and take a deposit with a credit card.’ Well, you've just lost like every payment processor in the world. … If they don't understand it, even if it's a valid business model, they're just going to say no.”  More from Payments Week:  PayPal’s Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments  Blockchains offer unique advantages, but these must be combined with a user experience that feels similar to the one consumers know today, writes Senior Vice President Jose Fernandez da Ponte.

42424696,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVyZh,1650886596,PayPal’s Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments,"The remarkable increase in adoption of cryptocurrencies over the last two years has laid the foundation for one of crypto’s loftiest promises.  The possibility of modernizing our existing payment system, upgrading traditional rails toward faster speed, lower cost, heightened security and reliability and increased access for everyone. We are just now approaching the combination of a technology reaching its potential, a user base on the cusp of mainstream adoption and encouraging steps toward clearer regulation.  Jose Fernandez da Ponte is PayPal’s senior vice president of blockchain, crypto and digital currencies. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  Now this opportunity can be expanded to retail payments for the benefit of millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.  The anatomy of payments  For this adoption to happen, it is necessary to acknowledge that a payment is more than just a transaction. It involves more than the streamlined transfer of value from one wallet to another. It includes processes sometimes taken for granted, like managing transaction disputes and reconciliations, detecting fraud, preventing illegal activity, processing chargebacks and bank reversals, integrating with accounting systems and handling taxes and financial reporting.  This complexity must be simplified for consumers and merchants if we want to make crypto payments available to the next billion users. Consumers and businesses alike demand to feel comfortable when they use an instrument to transact. They require straightforward interfaces, familiar models, feedback mechanisms and analogies with the instruments they know.  The path to global crypto payments  To enable the wide adoption of crypto payments, the goal is to create a user experience that feels similar to the solutions they know today but is augmented to deploy the unique advantages that blockchains offer in terms of speed, cost, security, privacy, programmability, and resilience. Delivering such an experience requires progress on several areas involving the combined efforts of developers, designers, policymakers and regulators, and payment providers.  Read More: Stripe to Let Clients Make Payments in USDC Stablecoin via Polygon – Starting With Twitter  First, the underlying decentralized infrastructure is better served by open protocols designed, improved and maintained by the developer community. Despite its fast growth in relative terms, the total number of developers working in decentralized protocols is still a small percentage of all software engineers. Recruiting new developers to the community, fostering the growth of vibrant ecosystems and providing an environment where existing and new protocols can be improved and battle tested is a prerequisite for any scenario of success.  Second, the wide adoption of payment applications requires stable instruments of exchange, such as stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), that are appropriately regulated, secure, reliable, optimized for payments and provide choice for consumers and merchants.  The payment layer must also provide auditable transaction mechanisms that maintain the privacy of merchants and consumers while preventing illegal activity in the network. There is a need for identity attestations that are compatible with a decentralized environment and provide adequate proofs on-chain. Continued improvements in network and transaction monitoring and anti-money laundering measures are required, both in terms of technology platforms and uniform data sharing mechanisms. And, finally, custody mechanisms must continue to evolve at the speed of the industry and provide secure storage and utility for an increasingly diverse set of assets.  Friction in user journeys is a major deterrent for adoption. Breaking out from a core audience of sophisticated users into the mainstream requires a radical redesign of the experience for fiat on-ramps into Web 3 applications. The complexity of calculating gas fees, opening wallets, remembering passphrases, waiting for tokens to top up and managing self-custody of assets is a significant barrier to entry for non-experts. Combining the safety and security required with a simple, easy-to-use interface will be a defining factor of success for crypto payment wallets.  Finally, we need a regulatory environment with clear requirements that are commensurate with the activities regulated and designed to protect consumers, maintain financial stability and foster innovation. The process started in the United States with President Joe Biden’s recent executive order on digital assets is a welcome step in the direction of providing a whole-of-government approach – an approach that considers the risks that must be managed along with the foundational sources of consumer value and innovation that the technology can bring.  Into the mainstream  There is still much to be explored as blockchain technologies enter the mainstream of retail payments. The realities of knowing that what works in Silicon Valley or Berlin will not work in Sao Paulo, Singapore or elsewhere are exhilarating and endless. Variations in local currencies, local regulation, local distribution networks, merchant preferences, or business and policy matters are all opportunities to innovate. It is an exciting moment to be part of this progress.  Read More: Jack Mallers’ Strike Announces Shopify Integration for Bitcoin Lightning Payments  Major enterprises and startups alike are building decentralized and immersive experiences. Many companies and ecosystems already offer specific-use virtual currencies. The time is now to enable individuals to experience digital currencies within a landscape that puts consumer experience and protection first.  As we build toward the future of financial services – and specifically the use of cryptocurrencies – it is crucial that the entire ecosystem remains committed to responsible innovation as the future of payments is shaped, and that we work collectively to build an inclusive transition to the digital economy.

42407296,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdB5,1650886570,The History of Cash-Like Digital Payment Instruments,"As the U.S. Congress considers a digital dollar that replicates the privacy-respecting features of physical cash, a lot can be learned by seeing how previous attempts at something similar in other countries back in the 1990s ultimately failed. Many innovations have taken place since then, of course, but how and why those original projects are no longer with us today can give us an idea of what needs to be done to do it right.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  Last month, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) introduced the Electronic Currency and Secure Hardware (ECASH) Act (H.R. 7231). The bill directs the U.S. Treasury Secretary to develop and test a digital dollar that would be a digital bearer instrument running on secured hardware devices capable of instantly settling peer-to-peer offline transactions with no need for any third-party approval or validation.  Third-party validation, in which a payors’ unspent balances are verified against a record of previous transactions (i.e., a ledger), is commonly thought to be needed to prevent double spending. However, what is being proposed here are devices that verify funds locally via a dedicated or trusted computing environment located on the devices themselves. The possibility of individual hacks causing systemic consequences would be reduced by holding and transaction size limits hardwired into the devices.  What’s old is new again  Such secure hardware technologies are not new – they have been around for decades. The Avant stored-value card, which was capable of anonymous payments using a custom-made card reader device, was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1993. At first, only non-reloadable disposable cards were issued, but reloadable cards were launched in 1994. Technically, the cards could do offline peer-to-peer payments, but that feature was disabled in the Avant system.  Initially cost-free for users, the Avant card was introduced when debit cards were pricey to use. However, fees were later added as operating the system turned out to be expensive.  When the Avant card launched, one of Finland’s leading convenience store chains, R-kioski, was recruited to sell, load and unload cards; other retailers joined the network later. Starting in 1997, existing ATMs could be used to reload and unload cards, which was technically challenging because ATMs were based on magnetic stripe technology.  However, Avant cards never gained wide acceptance. That was mostly because there were fees for reloading and unloading money while ATM withdrawals at the time were free and the cost of using debit cards was decreasing. Avant was spun off to a consortium of commercial banks in 1995, and died quietly in 2006.  Mondex  National Westminster Bank (NatWest) tested a similar stored-value payment platform, Mondex, in the U.K. for three years starting in 1995. In 1997, NatWest sold the controlling rights to Mondex to Mastercard, which expanded the pilot to other countries throughout the late 1990s. However, Mondex fizzled out before the turn of the century.  Although the various pilots demonstrated that the technology worked, as was the case with Avant, the commercial proposition was not sufficiently robust. For one thing, not enough merchants were buying or leasing the required point-of-sale devices. And even though the Mondex platform allowed person-to-person transactions, users had to buy special devices to do it.  Recent developments  New interest in a central bank digital currency has revived interest in digital bearer instruments. For example, BitMint, Idemia and WhisperCash offer digital payment platforms that are capable of consecutive offline payments, including peer-to-peer functionality without requiring an intermediary device and transaction privacy with no online tethering. In other words, they come very close to offering cash-like digital functionality. Also, DigiTally successfully tested a prototype with similar functionalities.  There are also some not fully cash-like products, such as those offered by Crunchfish and Giesecke+Devrient, that require intermediary devices or online connections to fully settle offline transactions. Although that reduces cash-likeness, it keeps the cost of the smart cards down and eliminates the need for internal battery power. For that reason, WhisperCash offers a “Lite” device that relies on NFC (near field communication)-capable phones to effect transfers. Conversely, Giesecke+Devrient’s technology isn’t bound to the use of intermediary devices.  Some argue that online settlements are necessary to avoid double spending. A 2021 memo from Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, made that assertion with little substantiation, except to say that 100% tamper-proof devices don't exist. However, even if that were true, software countermeasures can limit the impact of a hardware hack, like holding and transaction limits and mutual authentication requirements. That’s the approach that WhisperCash has taken. Plus, BitMint has patented a hardware wallet with quantum-grade security that will erase all of the currency stored in it upon any tampering attempts..  Lessons learned  The experiences of Avant and Mondex suggest that the possibility to make anonymous offline transactions isn’t as important to users as some, such as the sponsors of the ECASH Act, assume. A 2021 European Central Bank (ECB) survey claimed privacy was a top-two feature of a prospective digital euro for 58% of respondents, but a more recent ECB-run focus group effort found that very few participants opted for the kinds of high privacy levels suggested in the proposed U.S. ECASH Act.  Earlier efforts contain a lesson for digital currency issuers that is also reflected in a recent International Monetary Fund working paper.

The aforementioned equipment had been seized in a special operation with Tenaga Nasional (TNB), the country&apos;s main electric utility company. Acting on a tip, local police carried out 38 raids at 21 locations around the Kota Setar district to investigate electrical power theft, electric meter tampering, and other levels of damage inflicted on electricity supply lines. Apart from mining machines, the authorities also disposed of 14 units of modems and 37 units of desktops. Illicit mining performed on stolen electricity is pretty common in Malaysia.

42374872,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3EYR,1650884661,GPUs Get Cheaper as Ethereum’s Switch to Proof-of-Stake Gets Closer,"Graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used for mining ethereum, are getting cheaper as the network prepares to switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model from proof-of-work (PoW), which will render these computer parts virtually useless for those mining ethereum.  The asking price for popular GPU models on eBay has dropped by 37% since May 2021, when Chinese authorities issued a renewed crackdown on crypto mining in the country, CoinDesk calculated, using data from Tom’s Hardware.  But the price drop has accelerated this year, as Ethereum developers have been testing the PoS model and the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency has slumped.  The price of 10 major GPU models on the online marketplace dropped by 7.4% in January, 9.5% in February and 12% in March.  Crypto mining accounts for about 35% of the consumer demand for GPUs globally, Tristan Gerra, managing director and senior analyst for semiconductors at investment bank Robert W. Baird, told CoinDesk.  Read more: How Ethereum Will Be Transformed in 2022  GPU miners “are not really investing in new equipment at the moment, since prices have been high for a while,” and “most of them are likely waiting for when Ethereum moves to PoS, to buy up the secondhand GPUs” from those who will give up when the shift happens, Joe Downie, chief marketing officer at hash power broker NiceHash, told CoinDesk.  “It's widely accepted as a poor investment right now, since the ROI (return on investment) is much longer,” Downie said.  The network’s hashrate, a measure of computing power, has been relatively stable since the start of the year, data from information platform Etherscan shows.  When Ethereum eventually moves to PoS, even more GPUs will be dumped on the secondary market, and prices will likely spiral even further, Gerra said.  Adding to the downward pressure is that the price of ethereum has been relatively low, while the difficulty of mining has increased. The price has picked up a little recently, but “there is still some distance to the previous peak,” said a spokesperson for f2pool, the second-largest Ethereum mining pool by computing power according to information platform MiningPoolStats.  At the same time, the difficulty of mining ethereum continues to rise, and so GPU miners’ mining revenue is declining continuously, the f2pool spokesperson said.  When the Ethereum network reached record difficulty in December, NiceHash saw about 300,000 miners drop off its platform, Downie said.  In February, the war in Ukraine depressed crypto prices, which in turn made mining less profitable, and so GPU prices fell even more, said Haohao, a sales rep from Xuxin Science and Technology, a company that resells mining machines in China.  Haohao estimates that only 20% to 30% of crypto mining equipment that was in China has been sold after the crackdown.  Since the ban, the domestic market has been “flooded with a lot of secondhand equipment, and although most of this is ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), there was also some big GPU mining there, this also brings prices down,” Downie said.  In the past month or so, slowing consumer demand in China and Europe has led to even more excess inventory, pushing GPU prices even lower, Gerra said. For that reason, the investment bank downgraded chip maker Nvidia’s stock to neutral from outperform earlier this month.

The primary hurdle for the banks, which serve corporate clients rather than individuals or small organizations, has been the lack of a clear regulatory framework, analysts led by Betsy Graseck wrote. Still, greater regulation may not be a panacea, as that might encourage more direct participation from institutional investors, leaving the banks still on the sidelines.  Nevertheless, wholesale banks have several advantages over “crypto natives” that may give them a chance to catch up as regulation transforms the market, according to the note.  “Experience operating in a regulated environment, business models designed to deliver returns as margins compress and capital requirements increase, and trusted counterparty status for institutional clients,” are some of the advantages that wholesale banks benefit from, the note said.  Morgan Stanley estimates there is currently as much as $5 billion in revenue and $1 billion in economic value for wholesale banks from direct participation in the crypto ecosystem. That might grow to as high as $16 billion in revenue in the next three to five years, with more possible opportunities from efficiency benefits derived from streamlining the infrastructure for several wholesale banking businesses.  Wholesale banks have both the expertise and business models needed to thrive in a more regulated institutional market for digital assets, the note added.

Past Performance of FTM The FTM price gradually lowered in a falling parallel channel for the past three months. The current bear cycle initiated on April 4th, when the coin price turned down from the $1.64 resistance. The V-top reversal plunged the altcoin to $1 support, registering a 40% decline.

42374870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3EZh,1650879137,Bitcoin Falls to Six-Week Low Amid Risk-Off Sentiment,"Bitcoin (BTC) is again on the losing end as the ever-increasing list of macro uncertainties weighs over traditional risk assets.  At press time, the No. 1 cryptocurrency traded near $38,450, the lowest price since March 15 and down nearly 3.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  The global equity markets are a sea of red, with European stocks hovering at one-month lows and the futures tied to the S&P 500 nursing a 0.7% drop. Commodities also faced heavy losses, ending their recent resilience. Gold, a traditional safe haven and inflation hedge, fell nearly 1% to $1,917 per ounce.  The U.S. dollar is the only one to climb, proving its dominance as a safe-haven asset. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, topped 101 for the first time since March 2020. The Chinese yuan fell to 6.553 against the dollar, hitting its lowest since November, a sign that markets are concerned about a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.  The renewed coronavirus outbreak in Beijing has triggered fears of a hard lockdown, which will likely exacerbate global supply chain issues, bolstering already elevated inflation worldwide. Chinese authorities have leaned heavily on lockdowns to control the virus, as Shanghai's recent experience suggests.  China's coronavirus woes couldn't have come at a worse time, as fears of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have already dented animal spirits in asset markets.  ""It's more of the same for markets, but with a decidedly bearish sentiment slant for TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a Telegram chat. ""I don't remember this level of bearishness amongst contacts and Twitter, even back on cycle lows in January. The contrarian in me wonders if this is not a good time to push against the narrative.""  Indeed, sentiment appears to be quite bearish, with crypto Twitter worried about an impending flag breakdown on bitcoin's technical chart, a bearish pattern that would supposedly open doors for $20,000.  While extreme fear is often observed at market bottoms, it may be too early to catch the falling knife as long as the macro uncertainty persists.  ""We could potentially see BTC drift as low as $33,000 if macro sentiment further weakens,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. ""We have observed consistent selling in line with the downside of the Nasdaq during Friday's trade. We expect this to continue in the near term and trade tightly with equities.""  On Friday, bitcoin fell below $40,000 as the tech-heavy Nasdaq index slipped over 2% on Fed rate hike fears.  Laurent Kssis, managing director and head of Europe at crypto exchange-traded fund firm Hashdex, said, ""I still see general downward pressure coupled with intermittence short pushes that produce very little and get beaten down due to long liquidations. (around $25 million in BTC and $8 million in ether today). I remain technically bearish on BTC short term.""  Bitcoin's daily chart shows the cryptocurrency's drop under $40,000 has exposed the trendline connecting Jan. 24 and Feb. 24 lows. As of this writing, the trendline support stood at $37,420.  While near-term prospects look bleak, the worst may be behind us regarding the inflation scare and market pricing for Fed rate hikes, according to Tagus Funds' Solot. Last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell outlined his most hawkish approach to controlling inflation, putting at least two or more half percentage-point (50 basis point) interest rate increases while calling the labor market overheated.  ""We are not far from peak inflation hysteria, especially after the additional frontloading of Fed tightening last week,"" Solot said.

In an all-day meeting Friday that ended in the early hours of Saturday morning, lawmakers, governments and the European Commission finalized provisions for the Digital Services Act (DSA), one of a range of laws intended to bring big tech companies like Apple (AAPL) and Meta (FB) to heel.  First proposed by the commission in December 2020, the DSA aims to restrict the ability of social networks, app stores and content-sharing platforms to target ads. It also requires sites to take down illegal content. The commission will have the power to inspect the algorithms of the very largest sites and search engines – those with over 45 million European users – and to impose fines as high as 6% of annual worldwide turnover.  The final legislation also seeks to outlaw “dark patterns” – when platforms use nudges or site design to push people into unwanted actions – a practice lawmakers and governments regard as deceptive and manipulative.  “What is illegal offline, should also be seen and dealt with as illegal online,” Margrethe Vestager, the European Union commissioner responsible for digital issues, said in a video statement after the deal was finalized. “Democracy is back, helping us to get our rights and to feel safer when we’re online,” she said.  The proposals also limits targeting ads at children and those based on sensitive data such as race or sexuality.  The DSA could “become a constitution for the internet, curbing hate, polarization and disinformation,” Alexandra Geese, a Green Party lawmaker involved in the talks, said in a statement circulated shortly before the final agreement was confirmed.  In March, the EU reached a legislative deal on the related Digital Markets Act, which seeks to stop big tech players unfairly curbing competition from smaller rivals.

The 24-hour trading volume of Near Protocol is $722.83 Million, marking a 23% hike.

The bloodbath creates a streak of bearish candles starting from the $17.5 cracks below the psychological mark of $15. Source-Tradingview NEAR Technical Analysis The fall in the NEAR token price triggers an end of the flag pattern and indicates a potential selling point for traders who trade price action. But, the pattern of EMAs aligned with bullish sentiment can create ripples of reversal skepticism to shake off the bearish traders. The 50-day EMA does not stop the fall and then collapses due to the high selling pressure. While the 100 and 200-day EMAs continue to rise and are ready to offer any bullish reversal chance. This is the reason why EMAs are critical support zones that can alter the trend of bearish action. MACD Indicator: The fast and slow lines continue the bearish approach to reach the zero line.
