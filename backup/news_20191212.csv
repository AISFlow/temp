42403674,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVHM,1576192294,Russia's Largest Darknet Market Is Hawking an ICO to Fund Global Expansion,"Here’s one initial coin offering (ICO) that’s almost certainly illegal, and not just under securities laws.       Hydra, reportedly the largest darknet marketplace serving Russia and neighboring countries, claims it is seeking to raise $146 million through a token sale to fund a worldwide expansion. The sale is scheduled to launch Dec. 16, according to an investment memorandum on the site, which is hard to access without a special anonymized browser.       The tokens, priced at $100 each, will be available to purchase on the platform for bitcoin. A “package” of 100 tokens will provide a buyer with a 0.00333333 percent share of Hydra’s profit, the memorandum says. It makes no mention of which blockchain (if any) the tokens would run on.       Given the illicit nature of its business, Hydra’s token offering may be the most brazen ever, even compared to the ICOs that pushed the envelope of U.S. registration requirements in 2017. Russian news outlet Forklog warned that the sale could be an exit scam, a common occurrence in darknet markets.      The claims in Hydra's offering memorandum are nothing if not bold. Boasting proficiency in security and attack resilience, the team behind Hydra says it wants to introduce the rest of the world to its “contact-free” method of trading contraband, in which the buyer, seller and courier never meet.      “It will start a new era in the West. The scale of expansion is hard to imagine,” the memorandum says.       The ICO would fund the development of a new service dubbed Eternos, described as a worldwide darknet marketplace combined with an encrypted messenger, a crypto exchange, a Tor-like anonymous browser, AI-based dispute resolution and an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace.       “No KYC, everything will be anonymous and on the highest level. We’re no TON,” the announcement says, a dig at the Telegram messaging app’s blockchain project, which required buyers of its tokens to undergo know-your-customer screening.       Hydra is planning to issue 1,470,000 tokens representing 49 percent of the new project and promising $500 monthly dividends in bitcoin for each token if the buyers get more than 100.       That means Hydra operators are expecting Eternos to generate over $15 million monthly. “The estimate is based on Hydra’s growth metrics,” the announcement says.      CoinDesk reached out to several moderators of Hydra listed on the website. No one responded by press time. One moderator marked the request as spam.    'Millions' of users    Hydra opened in 2015, providing a marketplace for illegal goods such as drugs and their ingredients, counterfeit documents and money, and hacking services. According to the Russian investigative outlet The Project, Hydra’s user base exceeds 2.5 million accounts, 393,000 of which have made at least one purchase.       According to Hydra itself, the number of users exceeds three million, and they make over 100,000 deals every day, trading Colombian cocaine, home-grown cannabis, fake passports, stolen official databases and cash in exchange for BTC.       Purchases at Hydra are paid for in bitcoin or electronic money transfers, like at the oldest (and now defunct) illegal marketplace Silk Road, whose founder Ross Ulbricht is serving a life sentence in the U.S. However, unlike at Silk Road, Hydra buyers don’t get prohibited goods delivered by mail but rather hidden in secret locations around the cities where they live.       After paying for the purchase, buyers get detailed directions to the right spot in a park, mailbox or another place where the “delivery” is waiting for them. The parcels are delivered by paid contractors, and none of the three participants in a transaction meet in person.       The Project estimated that since 2016, users have spent over $1 billion on Hydra. The website has its own team of developers, security service and drug counselors, according to an anonymous staffer who talked to The Project.       According to its jobs page, Hydra is hiring its own chemists to check the quality of the drugs sold on the marketplace.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/12/russias-largest-darknet-market-is-hawking-an-ico-to-fund-global-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c5028105aff8abc5cc01ff8ad9be209898b1c4e-1200x782.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm, which now has a headcount of 11, has changed focus and is now courting crypto hedge funds and exchanges as well as the nascent decentralized finance space.       “Unfortunately we had to let go of seven individuals - three executives and four developers,” said Alex Batlin, CEO and founder of Trustology. “We needed to restructure, we needed to downsize.”       The move is another sign of belt-tightening in the blockchain industry following the crash in cryptocurrency prices of early 2018. It follows recent news that Trustology backer ConsenSys has been forced to cut its operations in India and the Philippines.       Almost exactly a year ago, Trustology raised $8 million in seed funding from ConsenSys and Two Sigma Ventures, the VC arm of the technology-focused quant fund.       Trustology started out with a vision to build an enterprise-grade custody technology to secure crypto assets on behalf of banks and institutional clients. Over the past year, there’s been lots of engagement with banks, said former UBS banker Batlin. (The Trustology founding team also comprises ex-bankers from Bank of America, RBS, Goldman Sachs and Barclays).       However, this year’s Sibos banking conference, which took place in London in September, turned out to be a watershed moment, said Batlin.       “I talked to most of the folks that I'd expect to be doing something - all the top tier banks - and had great conversations, but one of the things I was able to take away from it: there wasn't a provisioning of budget in the coming fiscal year dedicated to production rollout of custodial services,” he said.       Batlin blamed this in part on the crypto winter, or industry downturn following the 2017 boom, which reduced buy-side demand from institutional hedge funds, and also the general fact that many banks are now planning for a recession of some degree and looking out for undue costs.       “It's still not something that they are prioritizing for the next year,” said Batlin. “What we decided was, this will take longer than originally anticipated back in 2017. Very simply, we needed to have a longer runway,” he said.      There are still signs of bank interest in crypto custody, such as a report this week from Reuters, citing unnamed sources, that Dutch lender ING was developing storage tech for digital assets.      Batlin said staying in a long game was part of startup life which is something his investors understand.       “One of the reasons I partnered with ConsenSys as an investor is because Joe [Lubin] has got a remarkably long term vision,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/12/crypto-custody-firm-trustology-cuts-staff-as-banks-delay-on-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3eaf89423ae51c0d25fd595f678439e1ac14963-1200x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403671,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVEP,1576181426,Mining Giant Glencore to Trace Cobalt Using 'Responsible Sourcing' Blockchain Consortium,"Cobalt producer Glencore PLC is joining the Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN).      In a press release Thursday, the publicly traded company, one of the world’s largest cobalt producers, announced it would utilize RSBN’s Hyperledger Fabric platform for its cobalt production and become a full consortium member by February 2020.      The announcement follows Glencore's earlier pledge to consider blockchain in its supply chain. In October it agreed to ""design and deploy blockchain solutions"" in conjunction with the World Economic Forum and six other mining stakeholders.      RBSN appears to be the beneficiary of that drive. The cross-industry consortium of miners, carmakers, refineries and tech companies has already been building out an audited minerals-tracing platform, which runs atop the IBM blockchain.      It seeks to add transparency to the mining supply chain, an industry often marred by reports of unethical worker treatment including widespread child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a global cobalt hotspot.      To that end, RSBN’s member groups have focused on cobalt as the platform’s first test mineral. Cobalt is a crucial component in lithium ion battery design, leading companies including Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo, LG subsidiary LG Chemical and IBM to sign on.      The pilot run traced a 1.5 ton batch of cobalt from Congolese mines to a Ford Motor Company plant in Mexico.

42403651,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgUyf,1576179912,Kraken Job Ad Hints at Plan to Build Special-Purpose Wyoming Bank,"Kraken appears to be preparing to open a limited-purpose bank in Wyoming that would let it store customers’ fiat deposits – and possibly operate in New York without a BitLicense.       The cryptocurrency exchange has opened up a position for an operations director to oversee a Wyoming special-purpose depository institution (SPDI). The job includes building out an operations team, developing systems and operational processes to be an SPDI and integrating that entity into the exchange’s platforms.       The director would also ensure the functionality of the different capabilities that come with being an SPDI bank, including access to Fedwire, Fed Master Accounts, the Automated Clearing House and correspondent banking.       It’s unclear whether Kraken has applied yet for an SPDI from Wyoming. While it and other firms have expressed interest in pursuing the charter, none have announced doing so. Kraken did not respond to request for comment by press time.       Created under Wyoming’s new blockchain-industry friendly laws, an SPDI would, in theory, solve two longstanding problems for any crypto exchange.       At CoinDesk’s Invest: NY conference last month, Wyoming officials touted the charter as a potential end run around New York’s notoriously strict BitLicense, which the Empire State is in the process of revising. Kraken CEO Jesse Powell had previously said his company stopped serving New York customers several years ago because of the BitLicense’s requirements, which he considered overly burdensome.       However, even Wyoming boosters acknowledge a court fight may be necessary to cement the SPDI’s status as a path around the BitLicense. More immediately, chartering an SPDI (which is not FDIC-insured) would allow an exchange to rely less on the handful of crypto-friendly banks to hold and transfer dollars.       Kraken is looking for someone who has been a senior leader in a bank or regulated financial services firm and understands payments, trust services, the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money-laundering regulations and capital markets.       Having senior banking experience on staff would help the firm get through the application process. The chartering process resembles that of a traditional community bank, according to a spokesperson at the Wyoming Division of Banking.

42403655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgV2b,1576179892,Development Group: Southeast Asian Consumers Too Bullish on Crypto?,"Southeast Asian investors may be too bullish on crypto assets for their own financial good, a new study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found.      The Japanese government-funded report of Vietnamese, Filipino and Malaysian consumer crypto sentiments found that out of 3,006 respondents, 80 percent were aware of cryptocurrencies while 53 percent reported a desire to hold such assets despite a “strong likelihood” such investment would place them in financial danger.      “While the majority of financial consumers investing in cryptoassets say they could afford to lose the money invested, given the general lack of understanding of cryptoassets or the risks involved, the reasons for investing, the use of credit by some and the lack of professional advice among many when purchasing, there is a strong likelihood of a misalignment between the risk profile of some financial consumers and the level of risk they are exposed to,” the report said.      In short, many consumers might not be aware of just how risky investing in crypto assets can be.      “For those of us who are concerned with the protection and education of financial consumers, these are familiar warning signs,” said Greg Medcraft, head of financial and enterprise affairs at the OECD, according to a video transcript of his comments on the study Wednesday, “especially when coupled with low levels of understanding among many consumers.”      “Consumers need to be alerted to the risks they face,” he added.      The survey found many consumers show interest in establishing or even increasing their crypto investments, even as they admit they don't really understand crypto. Only 17 percent of respondents said they understood cryptocurrencies “very well.”      Another potential issue is the respondents’ investing motivations versus financial reality. According to the study, 41 percent of one-time crypto holders bought in “to make money quickly” and 29 percent did so as a retirement plan.      Of those currently holding crypto assets, the report said that “almost one in three (28 percent) [said they] had invested more than they could afford to lose.”      The survey’s findings place Vietnamese, Filipino and Malaysian investors in the upper tiers of crypto holders worldwide. All three sample groups reported comparatively high current crypto ownership rates: Vietnam with 35 percent market penetration, followed by the Philippines at 32 percent and Malaysia at 23 percent.      Other government-conducted surveys have found far lower figures in selected populations. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority found 73 percent of UK consumers don’t know what crypto is and only 3 percent have bought it; 5 percent of Canadians held bitcoin in 2018, according to the Bank of Canada; and 18 percent of Dutch households invest, reports the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets.

42403666,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVCR,1576179000,Decentralizing the Web Is More Necessary Than Ever,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Galen Wolfe-Pauly is the co-founder of Tlon, the company behind Urbit.      It’s vogue to say the internet is broken, even if there’s little consensus on how to fix it.      Enter Galen Wolfe-Pauly, who thinks the root cause of online dysfunction is the over-reliance on monolithic service providers like Facebook, Twitter and Amazon. Many would agree.      His solution, Urbit, is an attempt to decentralize the web starting from first principles. The project allows users to run their own servers and own their data. In theory, this would democratize the current digital-fiefdoms controlled by Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Bezos, et al.      Whether the public will throw its weight behind Urbit is up for debate. Built using two custom-designed programming languages, Urbit remains esoteric even for those with a background in computer science. Potentially worse – the project is the brainchild of Curtis Yarvin, also known as Mencius Moldbug, whose blogging in the early 21st century has inspired global neoreactionary and alt-right uprisings. Yarvin left the project and Tlon in early 2019.      On the fringes of Silicon Valley and under the big tent of decentralized tech, CoinDesk spoke with Wolfe-Pauly to hear his side of the story.      What struck you as the most important theme of the past year?      I think the most impactful issue has been the bear market, which I find super refreshing. Having worked on this stuff for a long time and watching the craziness of late-2017, I think it’s much healthier for things to have contracted a bit.      Do you think a bear market will weed out people who aren’t “true believers?”      I don’t know if I believe that in the abstract, but it may be true to some degree. I’m not such a fundamentalist that people should only be in crypto because they believe in some set of values. I believe people should use the stuff because it has actual value. But I think the excesses of speculation, or presence of obsessive people who are just speculating, is not great. That ethos and attitude and the way it affects the conversation is just anathema to me. I want stuff that people actually use.      If there isn’t an obvious financial reward will developers ditch the industry?      I don’t completely buy this idea that crypto will accelerate the open source project because developers make money. There’s some truth to that. But there’s a limit. There’s a point where the number goes up and it may be detrimental to developers. Certainly you want them to hang around, but you don’t want the ethos to be impacted in such a way that people can’t focus on the fundamentals of what they’re doing.      You’ve been in San Francisco for about a decade. How do you think the ethos and mentality of the Valley has changed?      I’ve been on the fringes of the technology since I was a kid. I feel like those fringes today are very much the same. It’s the same sort of cypherpunks. Silicon Valley has definitely become a power center in a global sense in a way that it didn’t used to be. I find that to be a good thing, or at least not entirely dysfunctional.      Is the tech industry moving towards consolidation?      I think the tech industry has no choice but to remain centralized until people working on projects like Urbit or in the blockchain ecosystem building things like IPFS [InterPlanetary File System - a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data] can deliver infrastructure that’s as easy or easier to use than the existing stack.      What do you make of the midway model, highly centralized entities using decentralized platforms?      WeChat offers an unbundled version of what would otherwise be highly centralized platforms. It’s good for options and flexibility. But WeChat also has this “one weird trick,” in the Buzzfeed sense, that they use to their advantage: the Chinese government is on their side. That’s their biggest wedge. While I think flexibility and consumer choice is a great advantage, WeChat is not an open system that anyone can build on, nor is it secure or private.      Could you talk about the issue of centralization with an eye to the debate over no-platforming?      Deplatforming is such a funny thing. I think most deplatforming isn’t really a legal free speech issue. It’s a byproduct of trying to get everyone in the world to share spaces. When you get millions of people who don’t agree with each other to speak in public all of the time, these sort of inhumane algorithmic systems have to be put in place to keep order. From a user experience perspective, it sucks. But from the standpoint of these platforms, there’s no way around it. Until you have a decentralized system where it’s possible for people to form their own small communities that can self moderate, it will go on forever.      Does that make discussions over free speech pointless?      Most web platforms are engineered to broadcast to the whole world. One effect of throwing people into a position of addressing the whole world is they want to test the limits of what they can say. Because there’s nothing to lose, my account costs nothing, no one really knows who I am. It’s not a question of whether humans are capable of conducting themselves civilly. It’s that Facebook and Twitter have constructed a way for people to trivially be assholes to each other, which is great if the goal is to attract a lot of eyeballs to sell a lot of ads.      If these companies weren’t as reliant on ad revenue, and could monetize through something like a Basic Attention Token, would that alleviate some of the issues?      I think we need to separate what are effectively broadcast technologies from communication technologies. Influencers and content producers delivering content looks like TV to me. Advertising isn’t a bad way to monetize newspaper or broadcast like content platforms, but the problem is that advertising becomes part of the way people are trying to communicate, and stay in touch. You don’t get to dictate the way communication happens. Subredditors can’t take their subreddit and leave, and you can’t take your Slack group and leave.

42403658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgV4Z,1576177200,"Hold Tight, Here Come the Blockchain Wars","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Gavin Wood is the co-founder of Ethereum, Parity Technologies, Polkadot and the Web3 Foundation.       I don’t want to romanticize what, at the end of the day, is only a few of the many pipe-dream promises finally starting to be fulfilled. That said, I will stick a flag in the sand and state that I do believe that a renewed flurry in the world of blockchain is coming. Whether we see any knock-on effects beginning now or in twelve months’ time, there are important developments going on behind the scenes that, when translated into tangible products, will jerk the industry forward one way or another. In short, blockchain 3.0 is well on its way.       I wouldn’t exactly call this a Golden Age. There’s a bit too much baggage for that. The days of money raining from heaven before quickly being irrigated into a swampy Caymans company are, I think, over. There’s still some “dumb” money around, but there’s less of it; natural selection did its job over crypto winter. “Smart” money will undoubtedly do its homework before getting into bed with a new project. The upshot of this is threefold.       The first is that to attract the generous funding of the past, projects will need to look as though they’re actually delivering miracles rather than merely promising them. Since actually delivering stuff is hard, projects will need to start employing a hybrid approach: deliver whatever is actually possible to deliver and then fill the gap with appropriate use of stakeholder engagement, communications and marketing. The latter is hardly new, but as time goes on and projects fall short of promises (or their competitors) this gap increases and projects will need to ramp up their efforts in a kind of public-positioning arms race. Misdirection, FUD, misinformation, exaggeration, bad analogies, partisan “unbiased” reviews and bloated claims that are already prevalent will become more so.       Secondly, the natural instinct of this slightly-less-dumb capital is to pick projects with defendable moats. Monopolies make great returns for their backers. Duopolies are okay too. But an active market saturated with great teams doing awesome things is just not worth the bother. Large and vaguely strategic investors act as catalysts, unfairly popularising their own bets, sometimes against better alternatives. In other words, it’s winner-take-all. This makes the industry-wide “open-source” collaboration and technology sharing, which has characterized blockchain innovation so far, that much less likely to continue.  Consider that Silicon Valley startups are not well known for giving away the engineering secrets to their core products. Sure, Apple “open-sourced” Darwin, but it kept the real jewels of OSX for itself. Ditto Facebook. Ditto Google. Companies share what makes strategic sense to share, but that rarely means sharing the really cool stuff. The game becomes increasingly zero-sum. This is already happening to some degree in our space with numerous well-funded and research-heavy startups like StarkWare and Dfinity refusing to open up the important bits of their technology. Some are even apparently considering patents.       Finally, as the payout from the winning ticket increases and the total winners are fewer, then in a zero-sum game the participants necessarily begin to start looking at each other not as comrades or a valuable resource but as obstacles to victory, to be removed. This, sadly, doesn’t paint a pretty picture of the future.     When there is no omnipotent force of just oversight, ruthless realpolitik rules.    While there is surely some below-the-belt fighting in the corporate world, it is mostly kept in check by national governments and legal systems. Google would never dream of directly attacking Facebook’s servers to drive people to its alternative platform. Mastercard wouldn’t employ a team to find and exploit holes in the Visa protocol. The punishments for such activity would be existential. But blockchains are less like corporate entities and more like nation-states. They share core properties like nationalism (“maximalism”), currency, and sovereignty. And as we know from the news, there is a quiet cyberwar going on between the world’s powers. When there is no omnipotent force of just oversight, ruthless realpolitik rules.       And so it is between the crypto-states where the equivalent of “international law” or, more aptly, lawlessness, exists. Everything is trust-free and the choir sings “code-is-law, bugs-and-all.” If you take the view that an exploitable and obviously unintended bug, such as that used by devops199 to disable hundreds of wallets, must be considered “fair and intended use” of a platform, then it surely becomes morally permissible for one platform to actively support efforts to find—and exploit—those same bugs in competitive platforms.       While we are still in the world of Blockchain 2.0, platforms are still very much “dumb” and either ungovernable and/or governed centrally. Such attacks would need to be sponsored and coordinated by a singular major stakeholder, rich enough to fund them and ruthless enough to carry it through. Thus far, we have likely seen one or two examples of individuals or groups using their existing wealth to attack competitors and threats, but I expect it’s otherwise fairly rare. Chains themselves are unable to use the resources they have at their disposal for lack of effective, decentralised and binding governance.       But Blockchain 3.0 will change that. Platforms will become smart, amoral economic actors in and of themselves. Decisions of multi-billion-dollar platforms will be made, and be autonomously enforced, by the largely anonymous crowd that constitutes its stakeholders. As Bitcoin has demonstrated, crowd-driven decentralized crypto-systems are laws unto themselves. They cannot be imprisoned, forcibly split, fined or shut down. And so, just as full-nodes in the Bitcoin network are unaccountable for the financial service they provide, so the decision-making crowd in smart platforms will be accountable to nobody. Stakeholders will be driven only by the pure desire to see the platform succeed.       The Devcon Shanghai attacks and the EthCC Polkascan denial-of-service attacks figure as a couple of the initial instances of what might be called renegade blockchain terrorism. Yet in both cases, there was little to no real cash at stake. As smart systems operating under their own brutal rules backed by dizzying sums of money wake up and gain a form of self-awareness, existential desire will put those resources to work. Over time, governance-backed, economically-incentivized positive action will turn into outwardly-directed negative action against competitors. Initially, it will be the dumb networks that are eliminated. Blockchain “wars” will follow.

42403672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVGN,1576173641,"Ride 'Em, Cowboy: Bitmain's Marketing Gambit Ups Its Texas-Sized Position on Bitcoin","Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu unveiled his company’s new marketing strategy on Monday in China, but part of it sounded like pure Texan – or more precisely, a “Texas hedge.”      Trying to hold on to his company’s threatened market dominance in bitcoin miners, Wu announced a series of incentives for buyers of at least 1,000 of Bitmain's machines, worth $1.5 million. One of those incentives is 62 “put” options with a strike price of $5,000 expiring on March 27.      Owners of puts get the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price (the “strike price”) on a specified date (“expiration”). A put option is essentially an insurance policy for the buyer.      What Bitmain is saying by giving away puts is that its customers’ downside risk will now be limited when buying a pack of 1,000 miners.      For example, if the price of bitcoin falls to $3,000 by March 27, the miner owner will get a payout of $124,000. On the other side of that transaction is Bitmain, which will be obliged to buy those bitcoins from its customers at $5,000 regardless of how low BTC prices fall.      Bitmain is already exposed to the price of bitcoin by the very nature of its business. Demand for miners tends to increase or decrease along with BTC prices. Thus, if bitcoin tanks over the next three months, not only could Bitmain have to pay out on the options it gave to customers, but it may also face fewer sales.      What’s more, the company may have considerable holdings in bitcoin on hand already. In its prospectus, filed last year when it pursued a public offering, Bitmain valued its June 2018 cryptocurrency reserves at $886.9 million. Current balances are not readily available.      Normally, a company would use options to offset risk, not increase it the way Bitmain appears to be doing. Doubling down, rather than offsetting, exposure is sometimes cheekily referred to as a “Texas hedge” among options traders. Everything is big in Texas, as they say, including risk.      Bitcoin options, like those of other assets, tell us a bit about how the market thinks things could go in the future. Based on data from analytics company Skew, traders are betting there’s a 21 percent chance that between now and March 27 BTC will change hands as far down as $5,000. That’s roughly the same probability they’re assigning to the idea that it will trade above $9,000 by then. As of this writing, bitcoin’s market price is close to $7,200.      Conceivably, Bitmain can go into the market and buy a lot of puts with a strike price of $5,000 expiring on March 27. Netherlands-based bitcoin exchange Deribit is pricing each of those options at $197.74 for buyers as late as Wednesday. At Wu’s Monday presentation, he claimed the value was $255.      Yet there doesn’t appear to be significant activity at the $5,000 strike level. Premiums are in line with other put options at different strike levels if one were to price them based on expected volatility. If Bitmain has taken an offsetting options position, it’s not evident from market data.      There are other ways Bitmain could have hedged instead of buying options in anticipation of its sales.      It’s possible the company sold bitcoins in the cash or futures markets, as options traders often do. Given market prices, the time to expiration and the market’s expected volatility, the company would only have to sell just 7.4 bitcoins for every 62 options it gives away to be effectively hedged. If it expects to sell 500,000 units while the incentives are in place, for instance, Bitmain will need to sell 3,700 BTC – $26 million worth – to offset its options.      Indeed, there was a bitcoin selloff Monday morning New York time. As the price of the cryptocurrency dropped, BitMEX, for example, saw a spike in futures volume at 15:00 UTC that day. However, this occurred several hours after Wu’s announcement.      CoinDesk reached out to Bitmain to ask how, or if, they hedged their options but the company refused to comment.      Perhaps audiences will know more if Jihan Wu shows up to his next presentation wearing a Stetson.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/12/ride-em-cowboy-bitmains-marketing-gambit-ups-its-texas-sized-position-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cf29e898df9d0b4c88490538baee31855c47f84-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgV7W,1576172065,Security Token Offerings Are (Finally) Set for Takeoff in 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Emma Channing is the CEO of the Satis Group and a FINRA Registered Representative with ConsenSys Digital Securities.            2019 saw technology for security token offerings come on leaps and bonds, which promises well for more issuance of these regulated digital assets in 2020.      2018 began with only three STOs previously to market, and then saw a boom in infrastructure build-out and applications for Alternative Trading System (ATS) licenses, which are required in the US to trade private security tokens. But, of the three ATSs that were licensed, trade approval did not come until late 2018 and other than the tZero and OFN STOs, there were only two financial institution issuances: JPMorgan Chase’s test of Quorum with the National Bank of Canada and the World Bank’s $81 million Bond-i. Many potential STO issuers faced high upfront costs, while they struggled to stitch together STO technology resembling existing investment platforms.      2019, by contrast, has seen infrastructure technology improve markedly, while costs have fallen precipitously. At the same time, platforms have initiated thoughtful design around end-to-end functionality and compliance, including functionality that broker-dealers need (for example, around suitability data, such as a potential investor’s investment experience and risk tolerance, so broker-dealers can fairly advise them in line with FINRA rules). These developments, along with the emergence of a critical custody and control industry, bode well for the long term maturation of the asset class.      In early 2019, the Satis Group partnered with ConsenSys and helped develop its digital asset platform Codefi. There has been an increasing awareness that issuers need to be able “force” certain functionality on token holders (appropriately disclosed) including forced upgrade, transfer, burn and mint. Burning means destroying the tokens, and minting means creating tokens, in each case in a cryptographically secure manner. Forced transfer, burning and minting need to be available in the event of a court order, but also offer necessary functionality if tokens are lost or stolen. Upgradeability is important because the state-of-the-art for security tokens continues to evolve at a rapid pace. There are various approaches, but Codefi’s upgradeability function is at the smart contract level via a proxy pattern (a piece of software that allows you to swap one thing for another).    The STO deal flow slowed in 2019, with notable exceptions such as Blockstack’shttps://stackstoken.com/ successful Regulation A+ STO offering. The 2018 delay in secondary market trading of security tokens on ATSs, as well as the sizable bid-ask spread once they did start trading, put a dent in the high liquidity dreams that had driven many STO projects. Relative liquidity is a benefit, but not a silver bullet reason for STOs (other than for funds, particularly funds with active, co-investing LPs who want to trade with one another). Custody and control solutions, for individuals, registered investment advisors and broker-dealers, are vital, but still nascent and complex, both practically and legally. Another issue has been poor quality, under-qualified or over-zealous attorneys advising on STOs and failing to deliver. In particular, over confidence on Regulation A+ filings, which have always been expensive and lengthy – and have been particularly so for many STOs – has led to significant delays and failed offerings.  Investors want high growth, high margin, technology-driven investments that private placements have traditionally attracted.    It has also been a year when certain erroneous concepts have, thankfully, been dropped by the wayside. For example, the industry no longer thinks STOs are easier to sell than other types of private placements. While STOs are a great match in many ways for the §506(c) of Regulation D exemption from registration, which allows a certain amount of public marketing unlike other private placements, and Regulation A+, which is a “mini” public offering and doesn’t have an accredited investor test, ultimately it has to interest high net worth investors who have historically been involved in private placements. Offerings that are entirely dependent on relatively unknown management or risky pipelines, creative high risk projects such as pooled film production, fractionalized single asset real estate, fractionalized commodities that already trade well in other ways, single concept projects in unstable countries and similar, don’t generate interest within this investor base. What we believe investors want to see is the kind of high growth, high margin, technology-driven investments that private placements have traditionally attracted, particularly given the technological learning curve involved in security token ownership. What has been significantly difficult in 2019 compared to previous years is to find these kind of issuers amongst the noise of things we don’t think will succeed. But then this is a classic emerging technology and capital market growth curve and everything ultimately bodes well for 2020.      On the institutional side of STO issuances, there was significant build-out of back-office functionality and overseas infrastructure. July saw the launch of 1X, a first-of-its-kind security token exchange based and regulated in Singapore. It has a third party custodian solution (a significant issue for STOs), with ERC technology provided by ConsenSys. August saw the second issuance of a $33.8M Bond-i by the World Bank, this time with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as the issuer and TD Securities and RBC Capital acting as managers. In September, Santander issued a $20M tokenized bond transacted entirely on the Ethereum public network (CommBank's and Quorum’s were on private networks). September also saw Allinfra, another company partnered with ConsenSys, announce a collaboration with Asia’s largest REIT, called Link REIT. Such notable financial industry interest is a strong signal going into 2020 and ultimately for the larger future for STO technology beyond Regulation D private placements.      If the STO industry is to progress further in 2020, it needs to provide a rationale beyond greater liquidity (i.e. that STOs bring investment to previously illiquid assets). STOs need to be designed by properly qualified FINRA Registered Representatives to provide a better mouse-trap, financially speaking, that is not only financially attractive in and of itself, but adds features or enhanced execution or similar that exceed what traditional capital markets offer. To achieve these goals, issuers need to take advantage of a full suite of DLT technologies. That is why we partnered with ConsenSys and Codefi. Much of the key infrastructure and markets are now in place to a technological standard we could have only dreamed of two years ago. It’s now just a question of finding the right issuers, the right products and the right purchasers. Ultimately, we remain confident given the developments of the last two years that STOs will become commonplace across public and private markets.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Emma Channing,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/12/security-token-offerings-are-finally-set-for-takeoff-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4af06f56094988c64c168f0c0098ca37c2ef9a1-1200x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

UPDATE (Dec. 12, 2019, 22:50 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify the status of TokenSoft's registration. The SEC has accepted it but not yet sent the company a notice of effectiveness.      Crypto startup TokenSoft has secured a key regulatory seal of approval as it seeks to build an investment bank for the age of tokenization.      A new TokenSoft subsidiary, DTAC LLC, has been registered as a transfer agent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), public filings show. The SEC accepted the registration on Wednesday and filed the notice of effectiveness on Friday.      Transfer agents act as intermediaries for parties in stock transactions. They can engage in activities like providing stock transfer services, book entries, order reviews, proxy voting, dividend disbursement and providing reports to fulfill regulatory and tax obligations.      Transfer agents like DTAC can also provide less conventional services, such as assisting parties who lose their crypto wallets.      “We service issuers who are doing both exempt offerings as well as registered offerings, so [this] was a request as well as a necessity,” said Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft.      TokenSoft joins a growing number of transfer agents in the U.S. who work with crypto startups, including BlockAgent, run by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) advisor Jeff Bandman, security token startup Harbor and technology provider Securitize.      However, Borda claims his firm’s technology will set it apart, since only DTAC may be able to manage tokenized securities whose private keys are kept offline, in so-called cold storage.      “DTAC will be issuing tokens using our Knox wallet,” he said. “It will be the only transfer agent that can securely issue and manage securities on the blockchain.”      Longer-term, Borda hopes to build out a 21st century version of Wall Street’s underwriters using TokenSoft and DTAC’s registrations, approvals and technology stack.      “We’re building all the things you need for an automated investment bank,” Borda said. “DTAC can help companies go straight to IPO by managing shares on the blockchain. We do have all the pieces necessary.”      TokenSoft already owns an interest in a registered broker-dealer, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the self-regulatory organization overseeing securities markets under the SEC’s guidance.      The company is authorized to provide a number of services around private placements of securities, according to FINRA.      TokenSoft, which has provided technology and advisory services for legally-compliant token sales since last year, plans to consolidate existing financial services infrastructure into a single service, such as using a blockchain tool for disbursement procedures.      “With DTAC we are able to provide more streamlined back office services,” Borda said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/12/tokensoft-scores-transfer-agent-registration-to-build-automated-investment-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d3159036d9986dec3978e1e73620634cb9a081d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On the regulatory front, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Shopin, a developer of blockchain-based tools for retail sales, with defrauding investors after a $42 million initial coin offering      Founder Eran Eyal also is accused of failing to develop the platform as promised while also misappropriating at least $500,000 for his personal use, including spending ICO cash on a dating service      Meanwhile, CoinDesk’s Dan Palmer reports that the liquidator for the collapsed New Zealand-based crypto exchange Cryptopia has retrieved $7.2 million since the hackers stole $16 million from the platform in January      Cryptopia went into liquidation in May after the financial losses, but the assigned liquidator, the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said Wednesday in a report that it's proving extremely difficult to ascertain what assets customers held on Cryptopia, partly since crypto assets were pooled into general wallets instead of individual for customer wallets      In a more positive sign for the crypto industry, Reuters reports that the big Dutch bank ING is working on developing technology to help clients safely store digital assets      ING said it QUOTE “sees increasing opportunities with regard to digital assets on both asset backed and native security tokens,” END OF QUOTE      Brad: BACK TO YOU, ADAM      More ways to Listen or Subscribe           FEATURED STORY - Hunting for Billion Dollar Returns and the Libra Investment Token (Segment 3)      Adam: And for todays featured story, we’re taking a look at recent changes to the Libra Whitepaper. Libra is of course the high profile, dollar pegged, so called “stablecoin” project first proposed earlier this year with the support of Facebook, Paypal, Mastercard and other major players. Stablecoins are designed to have their value match something like the US dollar, a crucial distinction when compared with more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.      Writing for FinTechPolicy.org, Georgetown University law professor Chris Brummer notes      “The key change, of course, is that interest earned from reserve assets will not be used to pay dividends to investors. This is a considerable departure from the plans first spelled out in June. Indeed, on the Libra website I don’t see any obvious mention of dividends at all, or for that matter, any mention of Libra Investment tokens to be offered to early investors. “ End Quote      Although not widely known, the Libra project as originally proposed in June was built around the idea of not one, but two coins; The proposed dollar pegged stablecoin that was simply called Libra, and a “Libra Investment Token” which was available only to select parties, and at minimum purchase amounts of ten million dollars. Those millions would be used to power the network through its early days, but if the network were successful would represent one of the best investment returns we’d ever seen.      In July, I enlisted blockchain CPA Kirk Phillips to help me figure out exactly how good those returns could be under various adoption scenarios. In an article linked in todays shownotes entitled Billion-Dollar Returns, the Upside of Facebook’s Libra Cryptocurrency, we laid out the case, which, without getting into it could have seen a literal tens of billions of dollars per year in returns for individual investors.      Well, since July, things have changed. After a series of frosty interactions with global, but especially US representatives and regulators, this rewrite appears to throw out the entire concept of a second token, and apparently the profit potential that was baked in.      Now, all of this is still hypothetical as the LIBRA token is not launched. Since the original announcement, the basket of companies supporting the project has changed as payment processors Paypal, Mastercard and others seem to rethink their support, at least publicly.      In the big picture, Libra is a project which if it ever sees the light of day will be a game-changer regardless of its implementation. Facebook and some of its partners are the largest companies in the world with staggering reach and enormous audiences, globally.      The removal of the Libra Investment Token concept is both good and bad for differing and perhaps conflicting reasons. On the one hand, by simplifying the concept to just the non-speculative dollar pegged stablecoin, the project seems more likely to see the light of day. It’s just a simpler project without any obvious profit motive, billion dollar returns, or people who stand to substantially gain from its success.      On the other hand, does anyone doubt the companies launching a successful Libra won’t see it as an opportunity to profit? We used to know how that would happen, but now? We’ll just have to wait and see.      SPONSORConsensus2020.com      Hey folks, Adam B.

Markets Spotlight (Segment 4)      Adam: And now, for our market spotlight, we’re looking at the concept of a digital dollar, and whether the late Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker might have embraced it, or not. Brad has the details for you and what it all means for crypto traders      Brad:      Today we’re focusing on central bank digital currencies, which have become a very hot topic both in the crypto space as well as among authorities as they try to grapple with how the global monetary system might evolve in the near future, especially given the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology      These digital assets, unlike private-sector efforts like Bitcoin and Ethereum, would be under the control of central authorities, which as we discuss today can have both pros and cons      Authorities from Ghana to Sweden are examining the concept while China, the world's second-largest economy, is moving forward with tests of a digital version of its national currency, the yuan.      But in the U.S., authorities don’t seem too keen on the idea: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that he and the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, agree that there's no need for a digital version of the dollar in the next five years. Even Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, who died this month at 92, never really said much about cryptocurrencies during his lifetime; in fact he once told a Quartz reporter that he was too old to know anything about bitcoin      But Volcker is regarded as perhaps the most effective and credible Fed chief of the past half century, based on his successful push to combat double-digit inflation in the late 1970s and 80s.      The promise of these government-backed digital currencies is that they might reduce the need for paper bills and coins, making it easier for consumers and businesses alike to exchange payments.      And those are benefits that Volcker likely would have embraced, says Richard Sylla, a New York University economics professor emeritus who specializes in financial history.      After the financial crisis of 2008, Volcker famously said that he thought the ATM machine was the most important banking-industry innovation of the prior 20 years, because it actually improved people’s lives by making it easier for them to get cash      His point was to distinguish such advances in payments technology from the financial-engineering wizardry of Wall Street concoctions like collateralized debt obligations, a type of bonds packaged out of subprime mortgages that were popular in the 80s, that is until they nearly bankrupted the global financial system when the housing market deteriorated      Dick Bove, a five-decade financial-industry analyst for brokerage firm Odeon Capital, says Volcker likely would have opposed bitcoin and other digital assets built by independent developers, since he believed that central banks should have strong control over the monetary system - to help society achieve goals like stable prices      A digital dollar, on the other hand, is something Volcker likely would have gone for, Bove says, since he probably would have wanted the Fed to keep up with the new technology      Of course, some critics of these central bank digital currencies say they just might provide a new way for governments to spy on their own citizens      And Jimmy Song, with crypto-focused venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, says he thinks a digital dollar isn’t terribly different from the monetary system that Volcker oversaw; basically just a technological upgrade      Song says a digital dollar wouldn’t do anything to change the underlying problem that central banks exercise too much control over the economy      Volcker, based on his career, probably wouldn’t have seen that as a problem      Join us again on Friday, for the next Daily Markets from CoinDesk      Thanks for listening, and if you have any thoughts or comments on the Daily Markets show so far send an email to podcasts@coindesk.com",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Adam B.

42403667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVBS,1576166400,Planned $1.1B Sale of .Org Angers Many Open Source Crypto Developers,"In the world of open-source software, a .org top-level domain - think linux.org and bitcoin.org - has always been an imprimatur of philosophical adherence and, to a degree, quality. Now, however, the .org top-level domain (TLD) is going into private hands, a move that is frustrating both traditional and blockchain open-source developers.      The news that Ethos Capital, a secretive group of investors, bought the TLD caused a minor firestorm in the open-source ecosystem. The fact that the group bought the TLD for a reported $1.135 billion added fuel to the flames.      The complaint? That a private .org TLD would lock out open source creators and non-profits. With blockchain projects depending more and more on open source contributions, the move could also affect the crypto industry.      "".Org is usually the namespace for non-profits, foundations, governmental research institutes, and others. Being owned by a private equity firm usually stands for maximizing profits and revenue. The big problem is that non-profits have limited funds and they fear that the domain prices will rise beyond a level that they can afford,"" said Peter Wilfahrt, co-founder of Versangigant.      While not many open-source blockchain projects depend on the .org TLD, the move from the non-profit Internet Society (INSO) to the for-profit Ethos could hasten the end of the public-domain Internet. In fact, INSO's parent, the so-called PIR – which stands for Public Interest Registry – ""has confirmed it will discard the non-profit status it has held since 2003 as a result of the sale,"" according to a Register report.      Although moving the TLD into private hands shouldn't change much technically, it effectively removes the price cap associated with .org domains, allowing squatters to set outlandish prices for sought-after domains.      The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICAAN) is currently investigating the decision after public outcry, noting:    We acknowledge the questions and concerns that are being raised and directed to ISOC, PIR, and ICANN relating to this change. To ease those concerns and maintain trust in the .ORG community, we urge PIR, ISOC, and Ethos Capital to act in an open and transparent manner throughout this process. We have sent a letter to both ISOC and PIR today, asking them to please be clear and open in all of their communications. We have indicated our willingness to publish the request and related materials involved in ICANN’s review including the request for approval, the request for additional information, and PIR’s responses.ICANN takes its responsibility in evaluating this proposed transaction very seriously. We will thoughtfully and thoroughly evaluate the proposed acquisition to ensure that the .ORG registry remains secure, reliable, and stable.    Rick Cohen, COO of National Council of Nonprofits, said that the move will take money out of non-profits' accounts and dump it into the hands of a private rent-seeking organization.      ""There are a number of grave concerns about this transaction, especially as it happened in close proximity to ICANN’s decision to remove price increase caps on .org domains. For the nonprofits that rely on those domains as part of their brand, these two events may prove to be disastrous,"" said Cohen. ""Even taking Ethos Capital at their word that they will only seek to increase prices by an average of 10 percent each year, over 10 years that would mean more than $750 million diverted from the work of nonprofits in communities around the world, right into the pockets of investors in this private equity firm (which happens to count multiple former ICANN executives among its staff and advisors).""    Decentralized DNS?    A number of blockchain devs are concerned with the .org sale primarily because they see it as a typical move by a centralized organization. That said, they hope to change it with new projects.      ""DNS is an antiquated artifact of the early internet. It cedes control to privileged entities and unnecessarily extracts value from companies and individuals,"" said Matt Branton, CTO of Neutral.      ""The .org sale should be a wake-up call that ICANN is largely concerned with ICANN, and we should ask ourselves some hard questions about what value they are really providing. The technology exists to replace them, we should do that,"" he said.      Some projects like Namecoin are attempting to decentralize the domain-name system, ensuring that bad actors couldn't disrupt the fair market. Few of these projects have gotten much traction. In fact, some open-source blockchain developers won't pay for expensive domain names simply because their stakeholders won't allow it.      ""I'm not sure the Decred stakeholders would go along with a significant increase in the cost of domain registration,"" said Decred head of Research & Strategy, RichardRed0x. ""The role that stakeholders play in voting on the network means that control of a particular website doesn't have the power it might otherwise have.""      Open-source proponents maintain that as long as there is upwards of $30 million to be made on a single domain name there is very little incentive for ICANN and domain brokers to want to change the system. And that, they argue, is exactly why it needs to be changed.      ""The ideal registrar is an app that connects to a decentralized system, probably a blockchain,"" said Branton. ""Namecoin was heading in the right direction but lacked easy integration with existing DNS resolvers at launch, and didn’t adequately address squatting. This would put control directly into the hands of domain owners, and also remove our reliance on centralized certificate infrastructure.""

42403663,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgV8V,1576164600,2019: The Inflection Point for Data Privacy,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Naveen Jain is co-founder of Tari Labs.      As individuals, we have become accustomed to being filmed by countless cameras in public. Using GPS, WiFi triangulation, facial recognition, and more, we are continuously monitored by corporations and governments alike. We are surrounded by a multiplying legion of devices that record our every word. And we are living in a world where endless HTTP cookies are set as we browse the web, and every click of the mouse is tracked. Our patterns are being harvested, analyzed, and used to predict our future actions with laser precision.      Over time, as tracking software and related infrastructure have grown increasingly sophisticated, we've consented broadly to have our personally identifiable information collected on a grand scale and weaponized.      The same is not always true for corporations, which operate in a parallel universe where meaningful identifiable information is mostly shielded from mass surveillance. Trade secrets, IP, and the choices they make are often protected under lock and key or by confidentiality agreements with razor-sharp teeth.      This dichotomy should not exist. Everyone deserves a level playing field with regards to maintaining the privacy of their personally identifiable information.      In the US, consumers are growing increasingly concerned about privacy, the vast trove of data collected by companies and governments, and how it is being used. According to a Pew Research Study conducted this year, 81% of Americans say the risks posed by data collection outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about data collected by the US government. Fully 79% of Americans are concerned with how companies use personally identifiable information. Also, a majority of Americans follow privacy-related news closely, and nearly one-third of Americans have suffered some form of significant identity theft.      Thankfully, as we approach the close of 2019, we've reached an inflection point in the battle to prevent the unknowing weaponization of personally identifiable data. There is now a clear path towards a world where this kind of information, regardless of whether it belongs to a corporation, or individual, will only be revealed and used with clear and explicit permission. But achieving this goal will require the combined, sustained effort of corporations, lawmakers, developers, and consumers.    Apple is 2019's privacy winner.    If an award existed for the organization that has done the most to advance the cause of privacy, Apple is this year's winner. Apple started the year with a groundbreaking moment for personal privacy by launching a billboard at the 2019 CES convention in Las Vegas, reading ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone."" In April, Wired published a story on Apple's refusal of the FBI's request to create a backdoor for iOS. Then in August, The Information broke a story about Apple's decision not to allow VoIP apps to run in the background in iOS 13 for anything other than facilitating internet calls. Before this change, developers could use VoIP features native to iOS to allow their apps to run in the background to collect data without the user's knowledge. And most recently, Apple launched a beautifully designed privacy-focused site that is as stunning as any product page on Apple.com.      There were other positive developments this year. From a regulatory perspective in the US, Nevada's SB220 went into effect on October 1, 2019, requiring businesses to provide notice of a designated email, toll-free number, or website address that allows consumers the right to opt-out of the ""sale"" of their personal information. In November, Democratic senators led by Sen. Maria Cantwell introduced a new federal data privacy bill. If ultimately enacted into law, the federal bill would provide similar data protections as GDPR offers in the EU and create a new FTC enforcement bureau. The most comprehensive privacy act so far was passed by the State of California. It goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and is the first meaningful effort in the country to give consumers control over their identifiable information. The law requires businesses to disclose what personal data they collect, what they intend to use the data for, who it will be shared with, and the ability for consumers to opt-out of their personal information being sold or shared. Businesses must also comply with consumer requests for their data to be deleted.      In the world of Bitcoin, privacy-centric projects like Samourai Wallet are implementing a wide range of features ranging from trustless CoinJoin to increasing entropy in transactions via StoneWall. Lightning Network is also making significant progress in enhancing privacy associated with Bitcoin transactions via Sphinx. These projects and other improvements on the horizon for the Bitcoin network will provide more privacy for all types of users.      Meanwhile, we are also seeing increasing consumer support for privacy-focused coins like Monero. Hundreds of merchants now accept Monero as a form of payment, and it has a highly engaged, rapidly growing community driven by a commitment to financial privacy. Zcash, too, is pushing the bleeding edge of privacy research in an attempt to make their privacy-enhancing technology trustless and use less processing power. Many governments and regulators remain skeptical of these and other privacy-focused assets. However, such skepticism is misplaced as the fiat on-ramps, and off-ramps for Monero and ZCash can be regulated and analyzed at the same level as they can be for any other cryptocurrency project. As consumers continue to see the damage caused by having all manner of identifiable information exposed, cryptocurrency projects with privacy by default will continue to gather momentum. And as businesses begin to understand the value of the new trust paradigm created by public blockchains, privacy by default will become a required feature.      What are the next steps towards a world where identifiable information is universally private by default? The privacy of consumer information must be treated the same if not better than that of corporations.      Regulators and law enforcement have an incredibly difficult and important job of protecting the public during a time of constant change. That being said, they must use the tools at their disposal without infringing on personal privacy. They must realize that the risks of mandating backdoors via concepts like ""responsible encryption"" will doom us to a world where there is no privacy, and all identifiable information is continuously weaponized.      In the blockchain space, regulators and law enforcement should focus on enforcing anti-money laundering, know your customer, and travel rule requirements via on-ramps and off-ramps, while allowing layer one blockchains to be private by default. If layer one blockchains aren't private by default, the weaponization of identifiable information becomes inevitable, and therefore blockchains will not be used for a wide range of critical transactions. No business can survive in a world where any competitor can easily find out the balance of a wallet, with whom it transacts with, and the frequency. And few consumers want their financial data harvested in a warrantless manner by law enforcement, or used for precision-targeted advertisements by corporations.      The journey towards a world where identifiable information is revealed and used only with permission is paramount. The meaningful progress made in 2019 gives us strong momentum heading into 2020.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | XMR | RESEARCH,Naveen Jain,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/12/2019-the-inflection-point-for-data-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7df8399bdeba982b0fce727ce9c3e4f23ae91631-1488x882.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403668,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVDQ,1576162800,Bitcoiners Are Building a Sidechain Version of Ethereum's MakerDAO,"The bitcoin community may soon have its own version of ethereum’s flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.      Money on Chain, a startup currently in the process of moving to Uruguay and converting into a nonprofit trust, just launched a DeFi platform based on the bitcoin sidechain Rootstock (RSK). The transition to a trust mimics MakerDAO’s Maker Foundation, which oversees the governance of a loan system with $330 million worth of “locked-in” crypto collateral.      While other projects like the Cross-Chain Working Group are exploring ways to wrap bitcoin in ethereum-based tokens for DeFi use, or offer centralized services for taking DAI loans with bitcoin collateral, this RSK model wants to use an open-source protocol inspired by bitcoin.      “We are going to allow other projects to build the DeFi ecosystem on top of bitcoin,” said Money on Chain co-founder Max Cajurzaa. “We are going to launch lending products on top of Money on Chain, but the ecosystem will evolve. Exactly the same as what happened with MakerDAO on ethereum.”      Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, RSK co-founder and CEO of IOVLabs, said his team is already in talks with MakerDAO to explore bridges between that ethereum-based platform and this new sidechain project.      To be clear, the RSK project isn’t “based on bitcoin,” it’s more bitcoin-adjacent. The RSK sidechain branches off from the bitcoin blockchain and issues bitcoin IOUs, harnessing the power produced by bitcoin miners but using a separate federation to manage the sidechain.      Zaldivar said there are still 15 projects in the RSK federation, down from 25 founding members in 2016, though he declined to specify names. If these federation members turn off their servers, with their built-in nodes, the public RSK protocol will not be able to swap bitcoin IOUs for real bitcoin. However, assuming that scenario doesn’t occur, the RSK DeFi model offers a bridge for locking up bitcoin and redistributing risk.      “It’s most important that we can use bitcoin as collateral,” Cajurzaa said.    Tokens galore    Like MakerDAO, the Money on Chain ecosystem involves many tokens.      There’s Dollar on Chain (DoC), the dollar-pegged, bitcoin-backed token inspired by DAI; BitPRO (BPRO), which can be used for “passive income” by representing bitcoin fees collected from system users; and Money on Chain tokens (MoC), which are basically voting tokens akin to the Maker Foundation’s MKR.      Cajurzaa declined to specify who the investors are that already hold these governance tokens. Instead, he noted that there will be a more accessible MoC token sale in 2020, with details to be announced in the coming months. In the meantime, Money on Chain is kicking off the DeFi system with DoC and BPRO tokens.      “When you mint DoC you can say you are selling your bitcoin for DoC, because you are not getting the same amount of bitcoin back. That will depend on the exchange rate,” Cajurzaa said. “In the case of BPRO, that could be considered a loan … but on top of DoC you can also have people lending it to other people, to make trades, for example.”      He added the goal of issuing fiat-pegged stablecoins, with more Latin American currency tokens to follow DoC, is to make cryptocurrency easier for businesses to accept regardless of bitcoin’s volatility. For example, the startup dexFreight will work with DoC.      DexFreight co-founder Hector Hernandez said, “a stablecoin collateralized with bitcoin will enable us to continue building DeFI solutions for the supply chain and will ultimately be a critical driver of mass adoption.”      Unlike the MakerDAO system, where people lock up collateral with a smart contract and expect to get it back, in the RSK system, people expect to get as much bitcoin back as their new tokens can purchase. That might mean even more bitcoin if they trade tokens advantageously, Zaldivar said.      Much like the DeFi project Uniswap, the Money on Chain portal to the protocol geo-blocks jurisdictions with compliance issues, including the United States, India, China and Egypt. After all, issuing a token advertised as offering “passive income” from a specific system operated by these entities might run afoul of securities regulations in North America.      In part, Zaldivar said, starting with these geographic limitations are fine because this system was designed for Latin Americans, by Latin Americans.      “We want this system to serve the needs of people who aren’t being served by the traditional financial system in Latin America,” Zaldivar said.",POSITIVE,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MKR | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/12/bitcoiners-are-building-a-sidechain-version-of-ethereums-makerdao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9805d7c0fc0a8425280678a670711e83ddcbe810-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to CEO Alex Melikhov, Equilibrium’s EOSDT is now backed by smart contracts that pay out consumers if the dollar-pegged token crashes through its collateralized floor. Much like how America’s FDIC insures consumers’ traditional bank deposits against a run, Melikhov says these smart contracts inject certainty, and stability in the face of “black swans.”      Security comes in the form of a hefty doomsday reserve totaling 6.5 million EOS tokens, worth about $17.5 million at the time of publication. Called the “Stability Fund,” this rainy-day reserve is spread across three smart contracts that maintain equilibrium.      “If the system is triggered, a mechanism will calculate how much additional capital is required to collateralize the system up to 100 percent,” Melikhov said. “This makes sure that every user who has generated EOSDT stablecoin on our framework will get back their funds even if the collateralization of the system will drop below 100 percent.”      Equilibrium says it has taken steps to lock down the Stability Fund. It contracted with DeFi consultancy firm EOS42 to conduct a security audit of its smart contracts, and verified with the auditors the fund will only release funds under the set conditions.      Other withdrawals face a transparency-focused slow-walk, Melikhov said. Equilibrium must give 30 days’ public notice for any fund movement outside the reimbursement system.      “These conditions are coded into the contracts,” Melikhov said.      In the long term, Equilibrium is betting that added transparency and assurance will help further grow what has already become one of the largest single EOS token pools. Melikhov said 4.5 million collateralized EOS tokens place EOSDT at the front of EOS-based dapps.      Melikhov said he hopes Equilibrium’s work could set up “some sort of standard for the industry,” particularly other DeFi projects.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MINING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/12/equilibriums-stablecoin-now-has-175m-in-insurance-that-pays-out-automatically,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/131505fe9ef8da3a240eecf303dc269ee2b19a0d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news agency said in a report on Wednesday that sources ""familiar with the matter"" indicated the ultimate aim of the initiative is to provide secure crypto storage facilities for the bank's customers.      The tech, though still in the early stages, is apparently being built by a team based in Amsterdam.      Responding to Reuters in a statement, ING said it “sees increasing opportunities with regard to digital assets on both asset backed and native security tokens,” and is taking a particular focus on developing blockchain technology to open up the sector for clients.      ING is already involved in a number of blockchain initiatives, with its dedicated development team saying in April that it's working on privacy technology called ""bulletproofs"" to potentially conceal client data.

42403652,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTyg,1576152000,Binance Adds New Fiat Payment Options Through Integration With P2P Exchange Paxful,"Binance has teamed up with peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Paxful to add new ways to purchase bitcoin.      Announced Thursday, Paxful’s Virtual Bitcoin Kiosk will exclusively serve Binance as an additional fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for its users, joining services such as Koinal and Simplex.      Through the kiosk, Paxful can facilitate fiat payments in over 167 currencies. To start with, Binance users will have access to the Russian ruble, Vietnamese dong, Indonesian rupiah, Nigerian naira, Colombian peso, British pound, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, euro and Argentine peso, with more possibly to come later.      Paxful users will also have direct access to Binance, further opening up digital asset trading – and therefore price arbitrage – to Paxful’s P2P network. While Paxful had offers from some of the top-10 crypto exchanges, the P2P exchange is exclusively providing its kiosk service to Binance, Paxful CEO and founder Ray Yousseff said in a telephone interview.      Founded in 2015, Paxful connects traders in a peer-to-peer fashion through its API service and has recently been conducting some $25 million in trades per week, according to UsefulTulips.      Binance also allows P2P trading on its platform for Chinese users and through WeChat and AliPay, although the latter company monitors the platform for trading, which is illegal under the companies terms and services.      Fiat-to-crypto purchases for both the dollar and euro through the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard (PAX) are supported too. The exchange has slowly added stablecoins to its platform under its “Venus” initiative and currently supports the euro, ruble, Turkish lira, Nigerian naira, Ukrainian hryvnia, Kazakhstani tenge and Indian rupee as fiat options, according to Binance.    Paxful’s market    The firms’ integration highlights a mutual interest in philanthropy, according to Yousseff. Noting bitcoin’s use cases in Africa, he said the exchange was rebuilt after discussions with locals across the continent. Binance maintains a philanthropic venture arm, Binance Charity Foundation (BCF), which has worked in Uganda.      While the U.S. takes up the lion’s share of Paxful’s market, researcher Matt Ahlborg at startup accelerator dlab said the exchange is becoming a meaningful alternative in sub-Saharan Africa as ex-pats look to send funds back home.      In the continent’s largest economy, Nigerians are exchanging gift cards sent by relatives in the U.S. for bitcoin and exchanging that for the national currency on Paxful. The process, which can be completed in half an hour, appears to be an effort to avoid more traditional remittance services, Ahlborg said in a blog post.      Paxful has shown resilience even when other exchanges have struggled, in what Ahlborg attributes to its integration on a local level.      “Paxful is able to onboard financially disconnected citizens of developing countries on a level that non-P2P OTC exchanges like Coinbase simply cannot,” Ahlborg said. “Gift card remittance works 24/7 whereas Western Union only works during business hours of Nigerian Banks.”      Comparisons between rival P2P exchange LocalBitcoins and Paxful (see charts below) show more continuous growth for the latter platform through the 2018 bear market, even if total volumes remain far lower.      “The lack of bitcoin liquidity was the first obstacle to solve to introduce bitcoin to Africa,” said Youseff in an email to CoinDesk. “We found a way for them to export an asset, which is gift cards, as a way to go around financial restrictions. Now, bitcoin is flooding out of Nigeria and into other African countries.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/12/binance-adds-new-fiat-payment-options-through-integration-with-p2p-exchange-paxful,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c33a32cfecc999679bb76517b521a6050861050-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Intraday charts suggest scope for a minor bounce to $7,300.  A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  Acceptance below support at $7,087 would bolster the short-term bearish setup and open the doors for a re-test of recent lows near $6,500.    Bitcoin has potential for a small price bounce after hitting two-week lows early on Thursday.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell to a two-week low of $7,072 during the Asian trading hours and was last seen changing hands at $7,160 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.      The week began on a negative note with the cryptocurrency registering a 2.4 percent drop on Monday after facing strong rejection above $7,600.      Since then, the bulls have struggled to make their presence felt despite the weekly chart flashing a golden crossover, a bull cross of the 50- and 100-week averages, for the first time since 2016.      The lagging indicator’s failure to attract buyers is not surprising, given the overall market conditions are currently bearish.      The cryptocurrency has been charting lower highs and lower lows since topping out at $13,880 in June and is currently down more than 45 percent from that level. The short-term technical studies are also biased bearish.      However, intraday charts are reporting seller exhaustion. So, a minor bounce could be seen before a potential deeper sell-off.    Hourly and 4-hour charts    The long-tail attached to the previous hourly candle (above left) is signaling seller exhaustion.      On the 4-hour chart, the RSI is creating higher lows, contradicting the slow drop in prices. That bullish divergence is signaling scope for a price bounce.      Backing that up, the 4-hour chart's MACD histogram is printing shallow bars below the zero line, a sign of weakening of bearish momentum.      Bitcoin may rise to the 10-day MA at $7,336 in the next few hours. The short-term outlook would turn bullish only above $7,870, though.    Daily chart    A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 would invalidate the lower-highs setup and confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.      Currently, that looks unlikely with the MACD histogram printing lower highs above the zero line, confirming the recent drop from highs above $7,600.      The 14-day relative strength index is hovering in bearish territory below 50, having violated an ascending trendline earlier this week.      A break below the immediate support at $7,087, if confirmed, would bolster the bearish setup and open the doors for a re-test of recent lows near $6,500.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/12/bitcoin-eyes-minor-price-bounce-after-hitting-two-week-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4af5c9943c78077d2662189f7d2f6252b7de5067-1500x935.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The assigned liquidator, accounting firm Grant Thornton New Zealand, released a report Wednesday detailing the breakdown of the retrieved assets and the challenges it faces in tracking down some of the user funds.      Overall, the firm recovered NZ$10.9 million in new receipts from May to November include NZ$5 million from a third-party trust fund, NZ$4.4 million converted from the exchange’s own 344 bitcoins and NZ$200,000 from sale of assets such as furniture and equipment from Cryptopia’s office.      However, expenses arising from the ongoing liquidation process amount to NZ$3.7 million including distributions to preferential creditors, salaries, legal expenses and liquidators fees. That leaves NZ$7,164,835 in assets that can potentially be refunded to users.      The start of that process still looks likely to be some time coming. Although said to be ""well underway,"" the report also offers an explanation of the time-consuming process needed to identify each customer’s holdings.      “We are working to reconcile the accounts of over 900,000 active customers, many holding multiple crypto-assets, millions of transactions and potentially over 900 different crypto-assets."" the liquidator said.      It's proving extremely difficult to find out how much of which assets customers held on Cryptopia, the liquidator said, citing two reasons. Firstly, the customers did not have individual wallets, and crypto assets were instead pooled in general wallets.      Grant Thornton explained:    "" While Cryptopia held details of customer holdings and reported these on the Exchange, the crypto-assets themselves were pooled (co-mingled) in coin wallets. As a centralised exchange, customers' trades would occur in the exchange's internal ledger without confirmation on the blockchain.""    Additionally, the exchange never completed reconciliation of its customer databases with the cryptocurrencies actually held in its wallets, leaving a “mammoth task” to ascertain each customer’s holdings.      Also a potential hurdle to eventual payouts is the fact that there are legal issues to be resolved first. The liquidator has appealed to New Zealand's High Court seeking directions on the legal status of crypto assets in the nation.      Whether the court rules that crypto assets count as property or not will decide whether they can be held on trust for affected customers or whether the firm keeps beneficial ownership, Grant Thornton said.      The liquidator’s next statutory report is not due until May 2020, however, it expects to provide another update to stakeholders after the High Court hearing in February.      Cryptopia went into liquidation in May after it suffered from financial losses and plummeting trading volume due to the January hack. Soon after, Grant Thornton filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in order to preserve the only records of customer data that were stored on a server in Arizona.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | WALLET,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/12/cryptopias-liquidator-claws-back-nearly-5m-but-identifying-crypto-ownership-a-mammoth-task,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d6bc74f90218b693356531fca0e80451cc50fc7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgTnr,1576141200,Volcker Might Have Said Yes to a Digital Dollar - If He Knew What It Was,"What would the late former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker have thought about digital currencies issued by central banks?      The short answer is nobody knows; Volcker never really got steeped in the fast-developing world of crypto.      ""Bitcoin? What's that?"" Volcker replied when asked about the largest cryptocurrency by a Quartz reporter in April 2013. ""I'm too old to know anything about that.""      The question is worth asking, though, since Volcker, who died this week at 92, is regarded as perhaps the most effective and credible Fed chief of the past half century.      Volcker led the U.S. central bank from 1979 through 1987 and is known primarily for jacking up short-term interest rates to as high as 20 percent to short-circuit double-digit inflation. The aggressive move helped to push the U.S. into recessions in the early 1980s, driving the unemployment rate to nearly 11 percent from 6 percent and drawing outcry and pushback from corporate executives, unions and lawmakers. But by the mid-1980s, the inflation rate dropped back below 2 percent, and the economy resumed its growth.      Now, the Fed and central bankers around the world are grappling with the emergence of a new form of money: digital currencies made possible by cryptography and advances in the distributed-ledger technology known as blockchain. Authorities from Ghana to Sweden are examining the concept while China, the world's second-largest economy, is moving forward with tests of a digital version of its national currency, the yuan. Some observers of say China's effort might be partly geared to undermine the U.S. dollar's supremacy.      Easier on consumers      The promise of these government-backed digital currencies is that they might reduce the need for paper bills and coins, making it easier for consumers and businesses alike to exchange payments. Those are benefits that Volcker likely would have embraced, says Richard Sylla, a New York University economics professor emeritus who specializes in financial history.      ""One of the arguments for digital currencies is that it could lower the costs of moving money around the world,"" Sylla said in a phone interview. ""And he certainly wouldn't have been against investigating the possibility of that.""      Sylla, who knew Volcker professionally, says he was with the former Fed chief once when he was about to fly to Mexico for a meeting. According to Sylla, Volcker casually remarked that the world might be better off if it had a single currency; things might just be simpler that way.      Of course, the U.S. dollar serves as the de facto global reserve currency, stockpiled by central banks and investors in just about every country. The U.S. is the world's largest economy, and the dollar serves as the default tender for many cross-border loans as well as payments in international trade and big global commodity markets like oil and gold. There's also the need for dollars to buy dollar-denominated assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, seen as a better store of value than risky assets like stocks in an economic downturn or financial crisis.      Volcker was a critic of Wall Street financial-engineering products like credit-default swaps and collateralized loan obligations, and he famously pushed (successfully) after the 2008 crisis to stop banks from making speculative proprietary trades with customer deposits.      But Volcker was reportedly a fan of technological improvements to make the financial system work faster and more efficiently, or to improve the ease of payments in the broad economy. Volcker said in December 2009 that he thought the ATM machine was the most important innovation in the banking industry of the prior two decades, because it ""really helps people and prevents visits to the bank and it is a real convenience.""    'Volcker would have created it'    Dick Bove, a five-decade financial-industry analyst for the brokerage firm Odeon Capital, said in a phone interview that Volcker likely would have opposed bitcoin and other digital assets built by independent developers. According to Bove, Volcker believed that ""central banks should have control of the financial system in a given nation, and it should have control of interest rates and the volume of currency being created, and it should be used to help the country meet whatever goals are needed at any point in time.""      But a digital currency issued by the central bank? Bove bets Volcker would have been all for it - just for the sake of keeping up with new technology.      ""If the need for a central bank digital currency arose, I think Volcker would have created it,"" Bove said.      U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that he and the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, agree there's no need for a digital version of the dollar ""in the near future, in the next five years.""      Paul Brodsky, a partner at the crypto-focused investment firm Pantera Capital, said Volcker likewise might have taken a cautious approach to a digital dollar rollout.      ""He would have waited and let it see how it played out in the private sector before pushing forward with a Fed digital currency,"" Brodsky said.    Keeping a tight lid on money...    Jimmy Song, with crypto-focused venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, says Volcker might have endorsed a digital dollar as a technology. But that leaves unsolved what Song sees as the basic problem that led to the original formation of bitcoin, in the wake of the 2008 crisis: technocrats' efforts to exercise too much control over money, leading to mistakes and excesses.      Volcker is ""not someone who wanted to give people self-sovereignty or freedom,"" Song said in a phone interview. ""A Fed-backed digital currency is conceptually not very different from the system that he oversaw. It's mainly just an infrastructure upgrade.""        ...but not too tight    David Yermack, chair of New York University's finance department, said the late Fed chief was surprisingly conservative when it came to the benefits of limited government. One benefit of some digital-dollar proposals is that individuals might be able to deposit money directly with the Fed, without having to set up accounts at commercial banks.      But that might create the ""risk of abuse for political reasons,"" since the government would have more direct control over people's money, says Yermack, who teaches courses on bitcoin and has co-authored research papers on central-bank digital currencies. Some critics of China's push for a digital yuan argue that it would simply become easier for central authorities to monitor citizens.      The benefits of a central bank digital currency ""might be desirable but encroach on personal freedom,"" Yermack said. Volcker ""had a lot of faith in the private sector. He was never a person who stressed big government for its own sake.""      But according to Sylla, the financial historian, Volcker would not have wanted to cede monetary authority to private companies like Facebook, which is developing a digital asset for payments, known as Libra.      ""What Volcker would have said if he were still with us and we could ask him, is that the idea of a central bank digital currency was an idea worth studying, but I'm pretty certain he would not want it to be under the control of Mark Zuckerberg,"" Sylla said, referring to Facebook's CEO.
