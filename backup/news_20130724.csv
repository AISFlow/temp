42422955,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yuzh,1374693408,Bitstamp bitcoin trading volume overtakes leading exchange Mt. Gox for first time,"Mt. Gox has long been the leader of the bitcoin exchange market, but earlier this week Bitstamp revealed itself as a serious contender.  On Monday (22nd July), 8,294.02 BTC were traded on Bitstamp, compared with 8,215.90 BTC on Mt. Gox. At several points since then, according to hourly data published on BitcoinCharts, Bitstamp has, again, overtaken Mt. Gox.  Nejc Kodrič, CEO of Bitstamp, said: ""This represents a milestone for us as well as recognition of our joint efforts. We will continue to improve and serve our clients to best of our capabilities,"" he added.  Kodrič put Bitstamp's success this week down to the fact that users have found better value at his company than they did at Mt. Gox. However, Tuur Demeester, editor at MacroTrends, suggested people are turning to Bitstamp because of the myriad of issues faced by Mt. Gox over recent months. The Tokyo-based exchange has recently faced periods of downtime and also halted all US dollar withdrawals for two weeks.  ""The main issue [for bitcoin traders] is uncertainty. In the past months we've had major trade engine issues, the Coinlab lawsuit, Dwolla account closure, serious delays in dollar withdrawals, and Jim Rickards stating that the US government would 'shut down Mt. Gox'. People are afraid of having their funds frozen at Mt. Gox,"" said Demeester.  While Bitstamp may now be gaining ground on Mt. Gox, it has long played second fiddle, with its Japanese counterpart consistently handling a vastly greater volume of trades.  In March, Mt. Gox handled the trading of 1,937,524.69 BTC more than Bitstamp. In April it was 4,290,502.01 BTC more, in May it was 1,770,726.03 BTC more, in June it was 796,839.02 BTC more and, so far in July, Mt. Gox is leading by 585,699.23 BTC.  Proud of its dominance, the exchange displays the following sentence on its homepage: ""As of July 2011, Mt. Gox handles over 80% of all Bitcoin trade."" However, according to Bitcoin Charts, Mt. Gox currently handles 52% of exchange transactions, with Bitstamp handling 18%. With this in mind, Bitstamp is still a long way off becoming the number one, but it is certainly catching up.  So, for now, Mt. Gox remains top dog, but when asked whether he thinks Bitstamp will one day become the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, Kodrič said: ""This is one of the possible scenarios. Mt. Gox did a good job getting bitcoin to where it is at today. Time will tell the rest.""  Demeester said he also thinks it could be possible and said he hopes Bitstamp keeps growing because of its high-quality customer service.  ""If they want to remain a large, long-term player, I do think they need to find more bank partners, though. Not only because it allows for more ways to cash out if one bank partner decides to end the relationship with the exchange, but also because it's increasingly important to diversify geographically in order to protect against bail-ins such as the ones that occurred in Cyprus,"" he added.

42425048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq39h,1374682142,Feathercoin enthusiasts celebrate pub meetup by testing merchant interface,"Saturday the 20th of July saw the first meetup for UK based cryptocurrency, Feathercoin, at the Oxford Blue pub in Oxford. CoinDesk was in attendance and took the pulse of what's happening with the altcurrency.  Feathercoin's 51% Attack Explained  Peter Bushnell, Feathercoin's creator, expanded on the technical details of how last month's 51% attack was dealt with, and explained a new checkpointing system which is going to be released. ""Feathercoin's upcoming Advanced checkpointing will be used to stop attackers from orphaning genuine blocks. Checkpoints are used to make sure that clients connect to the correct blockchain which makes the network resistant to blocks being orphaned by attackers. The current approach requires the client to be compiled anew and reissued. This is cumbersome and slow so is not suitable to prevent attacks.""  ""Advanced checkpointing allows checkpoints in the block chain to be created automatically from the latest genuine block. Clients will pick up this checkpoint and will ignore attackers' blocks during attacks.""  ""During the attack someone, presumably the attacker, tried to reverse a Feathercoin deposit to Cryptsy. This works by sending Feathercoin to the exchange, selling them and then trying to replace the blocks in the block chain where the coins were sent. Cryptsy's systems detected the Feathercoin deposit reversal and ceased trading of FTC/BTC.  ""I was happy to hear that their systems spotted this and prevented any major damage from being done. This should be reassuring to all users of Cryptsy that they do have a system in place to protect the coins held there. Cryptsy is an exchange that has many coins much smaller in size than Feathercoin, so have put thought into how to protect themselves.""  SMS and point of sale payment systems  Developer and Feathercoin community member, Mark Leck, demonstrated SMS Address, an SMS-driven payment system for Feathercoin. The site is still in development, but will allow users to sign up by sending a text.  SMS Address works by generating an account key that's associated with the user's phone number. When an SMS is sent, it is encrypted by the SMS provider.  Currently, the SMS to be sent can be generated by the SMS Address website – one needs to enter an account key, receiving address and amount to send. When the users' phone scans the generated QR code, they have the required text to send to the SMS Address service. When the message is received the SMS Address server will then transmit the details of the transactions to the Feathercoin network.  An exciting aspect of the service which was previewed at the Oxford meetup was a merchant interface. Although not quite ready to go live yet, this system presented a QR code that could be scanned by the Feathercoin wallet app for Android. I can personally verify that this worked, as I bought a cup of tea using this system and my Android phone.  It is hoped in the future that merchants might be able to input the transaction amount into a till machine, which would be pre-programmed with account key and Feathercoin address which would then print or display a QR code for the customer to scan.  I was told by Ruth Bushnell, the event organiser, that the Oxford Blue's landlord has expressed an interest in using this system when it is ready. Also according to Ruth, the Oxford Blue took around 2000 FTC (approximately £100) during the meetup, via the experimental merchant interface developed by Mark.

42425036,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2fh,1374678095,Foodler bitcoin orders growing by 30 percent a month,"When US restaurant delivery network Foodler began accepting bitcoin payments in April, it formed a natural combination for programmers: code and steaming boxes of delivered food. So it makes perfect sense that Foodler co-founder Christian Dumontet set up the interface to make Foodler bitcoin-friendly during a few late nights of delivery-fueled coding.  ""Our Bitcoin integration was written with Thai food,"" said Dumontet, a former Cisco Systems software engineer who says he did most of the coding over the course of a week.  In that week, Boston-based Foodler transformed the art of dining on bitcoin from an adventure -- in San Francisco, bitcoiners had to trek to a sushi restaurant in an outer neighborhood for a square meal -- to a few swipes of a smartphone screen and an exercise in patiently waiting for the doorbell.  Bitcoin users have been eating it up. Bitcoin payments have grown by 30 percent each month since Foodler began offering the option, Dumontet said, with an average of 9 BTC deposited in Foodler accounts each day. Bitcoin still constitutes less than 1 percent of the company's payments, though.  Dumontet said he opened the food-ordering network to bring bitcoin out of ""technical curiosity."" While not a bitcoin investor, Dumontet had read about the cyrptocurrency and wanted to experiment with it. He said:  ""We're software enthusiasts ... that was the initial motivation. There are good business reasons for it, but given that it's such a small percent of our revenue, that's not that big of a motivation.""  The major business advantage of accepting bitcoin is avoiding paying 2 percent or more in credit card fees. (Instead, Foodler adds .001 BTC to every customer deposit of .1 BTC or more, to cover the mining fee the customer pays.) Bitcoin transactions are also immune to chargebacks, the unhappy situation where dissatisfied customers reverse credit card charges and leave merchants unpaid.  Another, less expected, advantage was the large amount of media attention the experiment brought Foodler. However, not all media portrayals have been helpful. One called Foodler ""a credit-card-hating business,"" a characterization that Dumontet was quick to correct.  ""We value our relationship [with credit card companies] very much. ... It's very difficult to use bitcoin at this point. Credit cards are very easy to use,"" he said.  Getting started accepting bitcoin was surprisingly easy for a company that coordinates delivery for more than 12,000 restaurants. That's, in part, because Foodler insulates its restaurant partners from bitcoin altogether. Customers may use bitcoin to buy Foodler credits, which they then hold in their account and use to pay for meals. Foodler changes the bitcoins it collects into US dollars regularly -- usually once a day -- and the restaurants get paid and tipped in dollars the same as ever.  Because they are not a money transmission business, Foodler did not need to complete any regulatory paperwork. And because the company is mainly funded by its founders, there were no major investors of whom to ask permission.  ""Foodler runs very fast,"" Dumontet said.  After the initial implementation, the work was not completely done. Dumontet soon realized that using bitcoin could expose information about transactions to the bitcoin-savvy public via the blockchain, a situation that could violate user privacy and give competitors a window onto Foodler's transactions. He fixed that with more coding.  ""The way around it is to take transactions that come in, and divide them into subtransactions of random amounts. And then you do that a random number of times.""  Accepting bitcoin has not increased the company's customer service load at all, Dumontet said.  ""I think if [bitcoin use on Foodler] were to become widespread, it would be an issue. But right now, the people who have bitcoin already understand it pretty well. So we actually haven't had any questions on how to use it. The customer service staff has been briefed, but so far it hasn't come up.”  Massachusetts software tester Ruben Brito recently used bitcoin to order a workday lunch through Foodler. In general he gave the experience the thumbs up, but there were a few hitches.  For one thing, Brito experienced a delay when transferring bitcoin from his wallet to his Foodler account. Foodler says the transfer should be instant as long as you include your wallet's default mining fee, which it reimburses to make the transaction cost-free to the user. Brito believed the bitcoin wallet he was using included a fee, but a review of the transfer showed that for some reason it hadn't.  Another hitch: In the suburbs where he lives and works, the choices in the Foodler network are limited. The Chinese restaurant he settled on was a 15-20-minute drive from his office.  ""I passed a lot of places to eat on the way there,"" he said. Still, Brito said he would order with bitcoin again, especially if Foodler adds more restaurants.  Wondering if pad thai purchased with cryptocurrency tastes just as savory as my usual order, this reporter set out to try a Foodler with bitcoin myself. First I had to acquire some bitcoin, so I opened an account with bitcoin wallet Coinbase, which is incidentally the same company that Foodler uses to convert its bitcoin revenue to dollars.  Setting up the Coinbase account, linking it to my checking account, and ordering 1 bitcoin, for the $88 exchange rate at that time, took about 15 minutes. Sadly, once I was done, I realized that I was going to have to cook that night after all, because Coinbase said my funds would not be available until the following Wednesday. (Coinbase recently introduced instant bitcoin purchases for fully verified users, but I didn't go through that process so mine took longer.)  While I waited, I checked out Foodler's restaurant selection in my area. This was a bit disappointing; we usually order Thai food via Seamless.com, but I didn't see a Thai restaurant in my area on Foodler. In fact, Foodler only lists 14 restaurants when I type in my address, versus 75 on Seamless. I settled on a Chinese restaurant I had never heard of, but which had decent reviews on Yelp.  Once my bitcoin was finally available, I logged onto Foodler and clicked ""My Account,"" and then clicked the link, ""Foodler accepts bitcoin."" This gave me a bitcoin address to send money to. I copied this address, pasted it into the address window of my Coinbase account, and within two minutes, my Foodler account had $97.82 credit. Foodler sent me an email notifying me of my credit, and saying that the Mt. Gox exchange rate at that moment was $97.72. The extra dime is because Foodler deposited an extra .001 BTC, more than covering my mining fee.  That's right. I bought bitcoin at $88 and changed it for nearly $98 in Foodler credits less than a week later. Because the dollar value of bitcoin went up that week, I ended up profiting nearly $10 -- a free entree and an order of egg rolls. I'd become an accidental currency and Chinese food speculator.  Dumontet said that he has noticed that customers sometimes change more bitcoin than usual into Foodler credits when the bitcoin price is trending down. It appears that some people are using burritos as a bitcoin hedge.  After I chose my food, selecting the option of paying and tipping with Foodler credits was smooth. Really, once I sent my bitcoin to my Foodler account, the transaction was like any other. The delivery man who came to the door never took out his earbuds, so I couldn't ask, but he didn't appear to recognize me as a cryptocurrency user.  Both Brito and I purchased food with Bitcoin just to try it out; Brito described his experiencehttp://bitbash.blogspot.com/2013/06/ordering-lunch-via-foodler.html on his blog, Bitcoin Bash. But is anyone out there buying their food with bitcoin on the regular?  If they are, they are likely in San Francisco, the sources of 20 percent of bitcoin orders and the largest hotspot in the United States, according to Foodler. Washington D.C. is second at 16 percent, and after that, no other cities really stand out, Dumontet said.  And what do Bitcoin enthusiasts most like to eat? Sadly, Foodler has not yet pulled the data to answer this burning question.  One thing is certain: Anyone looking to eat using bitcoin is likely to depend heavily on Foodler at this point, since so few restaurants accept the currency on their own.  For those who try, it's not necessary to rely entirely on takeout, Dumontet said. There are a few grocery and convenience stores in the network. You can also hack the system a bit if you don't feel like always eating by the glow of your computer monitor at home or at work.  ""You can just place an order while in the restaurant (and eat in) and that will work just fine. I've actually done that,"" Dumontet said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/24/foodler-bitcoin-orders-growing-by-30-percent-a-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a54db74b925197488c511e63730e65d03aa3198-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2nh,1374662094,Israelis can now buy bitcoins in person with Bits of Gold and local exchange bureau,"Israelis can now purchase bitcoins at their local exchange bureau thanks to a new collaboration between bitcoin exchange Bits of Gold and Global Money Transfer (GMT).  The partnership with GMT means Bits of Gold can ensure it complies with current and future anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations in Israel. At the moment, the maximum amount of cash people can change into bitcoins via Bits of Gold is 10,000 Israeli new shekel (around $2,800).  Jonathan Rouach, CEO of Bits of Gold, said he has been passionate about bitcoin ever since he heard about it back in 2010.  ""I couldn't sleep for three weeks, I was reading everything I could and basically re-learning the meaning of money. But it takes some time for people to really trust the idea of a math-based currency. To me, it took about 1.5 years,"" he explained.  Rouach said he got to the stage where he supported the bitcoin idea enough to ""get bold, quit my nice job, seize the opportunity and open a company"".  He told CoinDesk he believes bitcoin's main strength is its ""cross-border nature"" – the fact it can be transferred from one user to another on the other side of the world with ease.  ""As larger online service markets begin to accept bitcoin, Israelis who wish to participate in that economy will jump in. We are also in talks with large local retailers to have Israeli products sold in bitcoin, but that will take some time,"" he explained.  Rouach said there is currently no regulation in Israel that specifically refers to bitcoin or digital currencies in general. ""The Israeli government is essentially waiting for the US to take a clear stand. Both the Israeli equivalent of FinCEN and the Central Bank do not want to get involved in this new technology until they really have to.""  The government is already studying the subject and has started engaging with the Israeli bitcoin community, said Rouach, who is involved in setting up an Israeli branch of the Bitcoin Foundation.  As for what's next for Bits of Gold, Rouach said the company is looking to expand in South America and the Middle East, with the expansion in South America set to go ahead in the first quarter of 2014.
