The merger brings more production capacity to Hut 8 and new revenue segments. But that growth comes with a cost. As of December 31st, USBTC had just $6.7 million in cash, $750k in BTC, and $265 million in total liabilities. Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company that I covered for Seeking Alpha earlier this year. At one point, HUT happened to be my largest BTC mining equity position. However, since the proposed merger with US Bitcoin Corp (""USBTC""), I've taken a much more cautious outlook for HUT shares as I've moved to the sidelines while we wait out merger finalization. If you're not familiar with what I wrote back in January and February, I'd encourage you to also read those notes as well: Hut 8 Mining: More Questions Than Answers , 1/11/23 Hut 8: Even More Questions Now , 2/16/23 The purpose of this article will be to add context to my previous HUT coverage given the latest information. New HPC Client In early 2022, Hut 8 completed the purchase of its high-performance computing subsidiary TeraGo. Since then, growth in that category has been slow nominally even though the segment has become a larger portion of the company's total revenue by percentage: Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Total Revenue $53,333 $43,845 $31,671 $21,833 $19,021 HPC Revenue $3,290 $4,711 $4,403 $4,487 $4,495 HPC % of Total 6.2% 10.7% 13.9% 20.6% 23.6% Source: Hut 8, 000s of CAD On June 14th, Hut 8 announced a new HPC services client in the healthcare sector. The agreement is for 5 years with a company called Interior Health and the services will go through Hut's Kelowna location. We don't yet know what the revenue from the agreement will look like but we do know the deal goes through 2028. If my interpretation of the press release is correct, Hut won't see realized revenue from this agreement until first quarter 2024. Revised Merger Details The company also recently revised the post-merger ""New Hut"" mining capacity projection higher to 7.5 exahash. This revision up in mining capacity is as a result of additional miner energization at US Bitcoin's mining sites. June Investor Deck, Slide 6 (Hut 8) In addition to the fresh capacity figures, we now also have more insight into what US Bitcoin Corp's balance sheet looked like at the end of 2022. My expectation in February was that USBTC's financial position would be in tough shape: I think we can safely assume US Bitcoin Corp is bringing some financial baggage with that EH/s capacity and probably not a lot of BTC. That has proven to be true per Hut 8's merger prospectus . As of December 31st 2022, USBTC had about $751k in bitcoin and just $6.7 million in cash against roughly $106 million in current liabilities. USBTC also showed $157 million in non-current liabilities. The unaudited pro-forma current assets are mainly coming from Hut 8: ​Current assets USBTC Hut 8 Acquisition Transaction Adjustments Debt Extinguishmentand Joint Venture Investment New Hut Pro Forma Cash 6,707 22,530 -13,620 ​ 15,617 Accounts receivable 110 1,173 ​ ​ 1,283 Cryptocurrency, net 751 118,768 32,154 -285 151,388 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 16,923 7,304 -200 -9,801 14,226 Total current assets 24,491 149,775 18,334 -10,086 182,514 Source: Hut 8 S-4, figures in 000s of USD The $13.6 million reduction in cash for the combined entity is due to banking, legal and accounting fees from the merger transaction. The $32.2 million transaction adjustment in cryptocurrency is due to revaluation of the assets from the date of the purchase rather than December 31st. Though the current Hut 8 entity is providing most of the current assets in the deal, the majority of the non-current assets come from USBTC: ​Non-Current assets USBTC Hut 8 Acquisition Transaction Adjustments Debt Extinguishment and Joint Venture Investment New Hut Pro Forma Property and equipment, net 75,906 87,284 ​ -39,917 123,273 Right- of- use assets 623 — ​ ​ 623 Deposits on miners 62,320 — ​ -20,753 41,567 Other deposits 6,277 20,097 ​ -2,500 23,874 Investment in unconsolidatedjoint venture 100,169 ​ ​ ​ 100,169 Intangible assets andgoodwill 4,427 11,175 218,787 ​ 234,389 Total non-current assets 249,722 118,556 218,787 -63,170 523,895 Source: Hut 8 S-4, figures in 000s of USD As of December 31st, New Hut would have had $123 million in property and equipment as well as $41.5 million in miner deposits. One of the major assets USBTC is bringing to the table is the company's joint venture investment in King Mountain JV where it shares 50% of mine capacity. As was previously noted, USBTC forfeited property to settle with a lender. We now know the value of that debt was over $97 million and settlement came primarily through relinquishing miner deposits, equipment, property, and prepaid expenses. At the end of 2022, the combined entity would have had $706.4 million in total assets, of which $182.5 million were current. Also somewhat telling is the $219 million adjustment to intangible assets and goodwill due to the transaction. I view that as a bit of a red flag. ​ USBTC Hut 8 Acquisition Transaction Adjustments Debt Extinguishment and Joint Venture Investment New Hut Pro Forma Total current liabilities 105,954 22,248 — -95,355 32,847 Total non-current liabilities 158,646 23,038 156 — 181,840 Total Liabilities 264,600 45,286 156 -95,355 214,687 Source: Hut 8 S-4, figures in 000s of USD From a debt standpoint, USBTC is still saddled with quite a bit of obligations even after adjusting for the debt extinguishment. Current HUT had just $45 million in total liabilities as of year end. That figure rockets to just under $215 million in the post-merger company. And this is obviously before factoring in any new liabilities from Q1 or Q2 of this year. Which is certainly a possibility given the losses each of these companies experienced last year as individual companies: 6 months ended 12/31/22 USBTC Hut 8 New Hut Pro Forma Total revenue 45,985 40,488 86,473 Total costs and expenses 113,833 190,873 285,140 Operating income (loss) -67,848 -150,385 -198,667 Total other expense 15,213 3,350 5,640 Loss before income tax provision (benefit) -83,061 -153,735 -204,307 Income tax provision (benefit) -1,808 — 5,014 Net loss -81,253 -153,735 -209,321 Source: Hut 8 S-4, figures in 000s of USD At $46 million, USBTC generated slightly more revenue than Hut 8 in the second half of 2022 and it did so while losing less money. Even when factoring in income tax provisions and adjustments from the acquisition transaction, New Hut still has a $209 million loss in the second half of last year alone. It's certainly possible the new company may be able to cut expenses and operate more efficiently as a combined entity, but this company needs much higher bitcoin prices to break even if the pro forma numbers are an indication of current operations. Reasons for Optimism? Even though USBTC's balance sheet is unsurprisingly in bad shape, I think it's a good sign that HUT hasn't been forced to liquidate much of the company's BTC holdings in treasury since the deal went public. Hut 8's merger was originally announced in early February. At that time, the company indicated that it would be selling both mined BTC and HODL'd BTC to pay for operations. As of January 31st, Hut 8 held 9,274 BTC in treasury. Hut 8, Author-generated Image As of May 31st, Hut 8 holds 9,233 BTC. This is actually up 100 BTC from the company's end of March balance. From a year to date standpoint, the company has still been able to grow holdings to a larger degree than many of large industry peers like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Bitfarms ( BITF ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), and Cipher Mining ( CIFR ): Month-end balances RIOT MARA HUT BITF CLSK CIFR December 2022 6,952 12,232 9,086 405 228 394 May 2023 7,190 12,259 9,233 510 451 407 YTD Change 238 27 147 105 223 13 % 3.4% 0.2% 1.6% 25.9% 97.8% 3.3% Source: Company filings, values in BTC Only Riot Platforms and CleanSpark have been able to add more BTC to balance sheet holdings year to date. Risks One thing that I've maintained in almost all of my public miner coverage is my belief that most of these companies aren't great long term investments due to the declining BTC-denominated revenue from the block reward halving every four years. The recent surge in transaction fees as a percentage of the block reward can certainly challenge that viewpoint, but it remains to be seen if the Ordinals/BRC-20-driven spike in fees from May is more of a flash in the pan or if it's the beginning of a sustainable long term trend. But to be clear, that's an industry-wide risk. More specifically to Hut 8, while we have much better insight into the balance sheet of USBTC than we did back in February, the pro forma data for the two companies is as of December 31st and a lot can change in six months. While I think it's encouraging that Hut may soon have a top 5 operating exahash figure in the public equity markets, I'm concerned that such a large portion of New Hut's projected total assets will come from goodwill and intangibles. Summary Hut 8 currently has one of the largest BTC treasury balances in the entire public equity market. To me, that's the only real reason to consider longing HUT shares at this point. We don't have all of our answers yet on Hut 8 Mining. But we're starting to get some of them. USBTC's balance sheet isn't terribly surprising. Going forward, I would like to see some clarity on how much revenue the company expects from the recently announced HPC deal. If nothing else, New Hut should have a better diversified revenue segment breakout following the merger. The exahash growth and new revenue segments are coming with a price; namely quite a bit more debt. Since there are other miners that will have cleaner balance sheets and solid production capacity, I still think it's wise to wait on HUT for now.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612625-hut-8-mining-starting-to-get-answers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14028205.jpeg

14027542,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538837,1687303825,Bitcoin On The brink Of Historic Golden Cross As Experts Predict Bull Run,"Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market appeared to have regained its bullish momentum after taking a liquidity hit of $25,000 in long positions last week. As of June 20th, Bitcoin is trading at $27,800, reflecting a 4% surge in just 24 hours. This recent development has led many experts to believe that the newly formed bull run is in its early stages, with institutional investors eagerly seeking to capitalize on the trend. Related Reading: Why The Ripple General Counsel Demands Impartiality From SEC Staff BTC’s MA20/200 Set To Make Never-Before-Seen Golden Cross Crypto trader under the pseudonym Moustache recently made a bold prediction about BTC’s future price action, stating that the cryptocurrency will make the first golden cross of the Moving Average (MA) 20/200, which has never happened before. This unprecedented event has led many to speculate that a major bullish trend is on the horizon, with the potential for a big green candle shortly. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, a golden cross occurs when the 50-day moving average (MA50) crosses above the 200-day moving average (MA200), indicating a bullish trend in the market. Conversely, a death cross occurs when the MA50 crosses below the MA200, indicating a bearish trend. Moustache’s prediction is significant because it suggests that Bitcoin is about to enter a major bullish trend that has never been seen before. This starkly contrasts with the death cross in September 2022, which preceded the FTX crash. However, This time, the market appears to be poised for a major rally, with institutional investors and retail traders eagerly seeking to capitalize on the trend. Bitcoin Breaks Multi-Month Downtrend, But Can It Sustain The Momentum? Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has recently observed the current state of Bitcoin’s price action. While Bitcoin has broken out beyond the multi-month downtrend, there is still uncertainty about the sustainability of this momentum. Rekt Capital has noted that it is difficult to look for daily breakout confirmation for Bitcoin in the context of the blue lower high diagonal resistance, seen in the chart below, as Bitcoin has failed many post-breakout retests on the daily timeframe. Bitcoin’s recent breakout is undoubtedly a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market, suggesting that the previous bearish trend may end. However, as Rekt Capital notes, there is still a significant amount of resistance to overcome before the breakout can be fully confirmed. Rekt Capital suggests it may be better to look for confirmation on the weekly timeframe, as this would provide a more reliable indication of the sustainability of Bitcoin’s breakout. A weekly close beyond the downtrend would strongly confirm the breakout, indicating that the bullish momentum is likely to continue. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Before Attempting Reversal Bitcoin’s short-term bullish trend is contingent on the cryptocurrency consolidating above the resistance level of $27,500. Failure to do so may result in consolidation for the largest cryptocurrency in the market. To achieve higher levels, bulls must maintain consolidation above this resistance mark.

42420195,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa5YD,1687300620,Flashbots Confirms Top Strategy Researcher Obadia to Depart Amid ‘Strategic’ Hiring Push,"Flashbots, a crypto research and development firm focused on maximal extractable value, or MEV, confirmed a series of personnel changes on Tuesday as it pushes to raise funds at a reported $1 billion valuation, including the departure of top strategy researcher and co-founder Alex Obadia.  Obadia, who helped found Flashbots in 2020, tweeted Tuesday that he was stepping down for personal reasons and released a statement mentioning “differing opinions within leadership.”  Obadia was a key figure within the strategy division at Flashbots and held the formal title of a “founding steward” of the firm – a kind of corporate signifier used to denote his leadership role in the company’s horizontal organizational structure.  “I leave for multiple reasons, some more personal than others, but really what it boils down to is that I feel my vision and values will be better served somewhere else,” he wrote in a statement released on Twitter.  “We’ve often had differing opinions within leadership, and that has been part of our strength. However, I believe we will now achieve better results going our separate ways,” he added. “This is normal, and happens in every growing organization.”  “Looking ahead, Flashbots faces serious challenges,” Obadia continued. “As we’ve grown into an incumbent, we now also need to protect the system against ourselves, to avoid becoming the very Moloch we’re fighting against.”  A Flashbots representative told CoinDesk: “We'd like to thank Alex Obadia for his amazing contributions to the Flashbots ecosystem and to the crypto industry as a whole, and we look forward to collaborating with him into the future.”  Obadia didn’t respond to a request for further comment.  Flashbots builds software to help facilitate the extraction of MEV – extra profit that can be earned by strategically ordering how transactions are organized into the “blocks” that get written to a blockchain’s ledger. The Flashbots-built MEV-Boost middleware is used by virtually all of the validators that help operate Ethereum, and its upcoming SUAVE network aims to extend similar MEV-extracting functionality to other blockchains.  Flashbots – originally a “public good” research organization – is reportedly close to announcing a Series B funding round that will value the firm at $1 billion. The ""reported"" round “will secure funding for MEV research and development as Flashbots works closer towards SUAVE and their vision to illuminate, democratize, and distribute MEV,” a Flashbots representative told CoinDesk in a statement.  New Hires  Among the company’s highest-profile new hires is Andrew Miller, who joins the team as research lead working on Trusted Execution Environments and SUAVE. Miller is best known as one of the researchers who broke Intel’s SGX code – an insight that required a massive overhaul of the Secret blockchain and had major security ramifications beyond the crypto industry.  Miller has been working as associate director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) and will be taking a leave of absence from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where he is an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.  Flashbots has added 13 team members in the past six months, bringing the total size of the team above 50. Also joining Flashbots are Danning Sui, formerly head of data science at the decentralized finance infrastructure firm 0x; and Daniel Marzec, previously an engineer at Blocknative, another major MEV industry player. Sui will lead Flashbots’ data science team and Marzec joins as a research engineer.  “Flashbots is working closer towards its goal to illuminate, democratize and distribute the dark forest,” a representative for Flashbots told CoinDesk. (The term “dark forest” refers to the under-the-radar competition between blockchain actors to squeeze out MEV.)  “There is consolidation happening in the MEV supply chain because we're on the precipice of the next market design for MEV,” the representative added. “We're now in the latter-renaissance of MEV, and Flashbots is closer towards shipping larger and more detailed specifications for their solution to MEV, called SUAVE.”  CORRECTION (June 21, 2023, 16:06 UTC): Clarifies Alex Obadia's role within Flashbots prior to his departure.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ZRX | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/20/flashbots-confirms-top-strategy-researcher-obadia-to-depart-amid-strategic-hiring-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1aaeeb6b10879bbe4479b1c97a96822191ce16dc-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
14025975,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538751,1687300248,"Bitcoin Miners Deposit To Exchanges, What Does This Mean?","On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have been depositing large amounts to exchanges. Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Miners Have Been Depositing Big To Exchanges Recently An analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out that BTC miners have been transferring coins out of their wallets recently. The relevant indicator here is the “miner outflow,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin miners withdraw from their combined supply. The counterpart metric, the “miner inflow,” naturally keeps track of the reverse flow of coins. Here is a chart that shows the trend in both the Bitcoin miner outflow and the inflow over the past few days: Looks like the value of one of the metrics has been elevated in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin miner outflow has observed a spike during the past day, while the inflow has remained relatively low. This would imply that the miners have transferred a net amount of coins from their wallets in this period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue To Accumulate As BTC Makes Recovery Push Generally, whenever miners withdraw coins from their wallets, there is always a risk that they are doing so to sell said coins. Such selling can naturally have a bearish effect on the cryptocurrency’s value. One way to better guess the intent behind these withdrawals is by checking whether the destination of the coins is a centralized exchange platform. The chart also shows the data for the Bitcoin miner to exchange flow. This indicator specifically keeps track of the coins flowing from these chain validators’ holdings to exchange wallets. This indicator has also seen a sharp spike at the same time as the miner outflow surge. The magnitude of both spikes is also pretty much the same; both are slightly above 1,000 BTC. Thus, almost all the outflows from the past day appear to have headed toward exchanges. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels Knowing that there have been deposits to exchanges only tells us a part of the story, however, as the indicator used here doesn’t specify which type of platforms the inflows have been towards. A modified version of the indicator, which only tracks deposits to derivative exchanges, reveals that the transfers have been almost entirely toward the derivative platforms. The value of the metric seems to have spiked recently | Source: CryptoQuant When miners plan to sell their coins, they make deposits to spot exchanges. Since they have sent their Bitcoin to derivative platforms instead this time, it would seem likely that the intent behind their transfers may not have been selling after all. As for what effect this might have on the market; usually more derivative positions being opened usually results in higher price volatility. However, this volatility can go either bullish or bearish, depending on the wider sentiment. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,400, up 6% in the last week.

14024342,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538799,1687296648,Dash Price Surges 10% In A Single Week; Is A Bullish Momentum Forming?,"Digital Cash, popularly known as DASH, has been on a remarkable spring, reaching today’s top gainers. The cryptocurrency is on a good streak, with its value jumping by 5% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Soars Over 6% Following Launch On BNB Chain Dash Surges Over 10% In A Single Week – Price Overview The price of DASH soared by more than 10% in the past week. As of this writing, the token is valued at $32.08, gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, it boasts a daily trading volume of nearly $45 million. However, a broader look at the market shows that the price of DASH has barely made it out of consolidation in the past 10 days. This is following the almost-vertical price dip earlier this month, which saw the token lose nearly 26% of its value. DASH, a scalable payment network, has had a mixed first half of the year. On the 28th of February, the cryptocurrency’s price reached a crest of $74.26. The token has been on a downtrend since March, recording a 56.8% price decline. Although the current price rally of DASH is a bit encouraging, it would take an extraordinary run for the token to return to its peak from earlier this year. Is Bullish Momentum Building for Dash? As DASH continues gaining momentum and captivates the crypto community’s attention, many investors wonder if the token could attain the heights reached earlier this year. Based on DASH’s 24-hour chart, RSI (Relative Strength Index) has just crossed above 36, indicating that a bullish run may be on the horizon. Meanwhile, the token’s Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) has just crossed above the signal line below the baseline, indicating a strong bullish signal. DASHUSD trading at $31.73 | Source: DASHUSD chart from TradingView According to the price prediction site, Coincodex, the current investor sentiment surrounding the DASH token remains bearish, with a neutral Fear & Greed Index of 49. Coincodex predicts DASH to plummet by 6.53% in the next five days, falling to $29.69. However, they project the token to make a recovery trading as high as $35.12 later in one month. Notwithstanding, investors are advised to approach the market cautiously, having done their due diligence.

Read more: Deutsche Bank Applies for Digital Asset License in Germany as TradFi Pushes Further Into Crypto  With the launch of its digital asset market comes a new round of capital which includes investments from Miami International Holdings, DV Crypto and GTS among others, the company said.  The launch follows the news just last week that asset management giant BlackRock had filed paperwork with the SEC to create a spot bitcoin ETF.  One thing that separates EDX Markets from other crypto exchanges is that it doesn’t custody customers’ digital assets. Instead, users will have to go through financial intermediaries to buy and sell crypto assets, similar to how trades are executed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq (NASDAQ). Regulators like the different approach, Nazarali said, because they think it’s important that there’s separation between the exchange function and the broker dealer function.  “What we’re seeing is that increasingly, investors want to trade through their trusted intermediaries and that’s especially true post FTX, which was supposed to be the leader in the digital market. If you can’t trust them, who can you trust?” Nazarali told CoinDesk in an interview in April. “So people are falling back on the firms that have been around for a really long time and that have really stood the test of time and that’s a really important tailwind for us.”  The company will later this year launch EDX Clearing to settle trades matched on EDX Markets.  So far, the exchange only offers four tokens – bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LITE) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – partly because of the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S.  “We have a limited set of tokens because until there is more regulatory clarity, we don’t want to trade something that’s potentially a security,” Nazarali said in April. “Regulators really like that we don’t take that risk.”  While EDX Markets will consider an international expansion “down the line,” for right now, it will solely focus on its operations in the U.S., Nazarali said in April. “We were founded really to solve a problem in the marketplace in the U.S.""",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH,BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/new-crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-and-citadel-launches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02bb5b0c96cac85f1150b2103e5a6d2cd7a09948-1056x560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It works just like Bitcoin in this way as it happens every four years, and creates an environment of scarcity for the cryptocurrency. This is why the halving can be a bullish event for the digital asset. LTC’s next halving is taking place approximately 44 days from now at a block height of 2,520,000. This halving reward will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, and a block is produced on Litecoin approximately every two-and-a-half minutes.

42420194,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa5XB,1687292406,What Can You Do With a Blockchain Token That Is Classified as a Security?,"At last count, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement division has singled out at least 68 blockchain tokens as being securities. This is the running tally of cryptocurrencies named in the SEC’s various lawsuits filed against crypto companies, promoters and developers over the years. With “bluechip” tokens including Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA tokens, alongside the dozens of other assets with greater or lesser utility, on the list, the SEC is essentially saying assets together worth over $100 billion (i.e. something like 10% of the total crypto market cap) are being illegally traded.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This is to make no mention of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has made his opinion known that almost all crypto tokens fall under his remit. Besides bitcoin (BTC). And maybe ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum. Would it be nice if there was more clarity around the primary asset used by the second-largest blockchain by value and the top network by number of active users? Obviously, yes. But despite Gensler’s remonstrations that the rules are clear, there’s remarkably little that can be said for sure about crypto’s current regulatory standing – at least in the U.S.  Take just one reasonable question: what could users do with a token that’s been labeled a “security?” At one level, a word is just a word, and if a blockchain truly is “sufficiently decentralized” then users should be able to trade its token and use its open source code whatever the law says. These are stateless networks, after all. So what can a user do with a token that is a security? Everything you could with a token before it was declared a security.  However, this understanding would be to ignore the fact that many of the world’s crypto users access these networks and buy these assets using centralized exchanges and services. And centralized exchanges and service providers generally have to follow the rules. If users cannot access a token because crypto’s on-ramps cannot list it, then discussions about “stateless currencies” and open source access are moot for many people. So what can a user do with a token that’s a security? Everything and nothing, depending on the limitations set by the SEC.  See also: The Case for Regulating, Not Banning, Crypto | Opinion  According to Marc D’Annunzio, the general counsel for compliance-friendly trading and rewards platform Bakkt, the classification of a token as a security has two main impacts: it affects the disclosures companies need to provide to prospective investors and the manner in which an asset can be offered. These restrictions could limit the type of platforms that can legally offer an asset, like registered broker-dealers, securities exchanges and other trading systems, and whether more than “accredited investors” can trade the tokens.  “We don’t believe that classification drastically impacts the use cases for those tokens,” D’Annunzio said in an email. However, it clearly matters whether companies like Robinhood, Coinbase and eToro want to provide access to a token and whether they can legally do so. It’s here that it might be worth rephrasing the question: Are we heading towards a world where upstanding citizens in the U.S. cannot trade Cardano’s ADA or Solana’s SOL?  As mentioned, these are two tokens named as securities in the SEC’s recent lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, and two of the largest tokens that some (but not all) trading platforms decided to delist. Trying to get a hard answer out of a lawyer about the specific qualifications they used to determine whether to keep or delist a token is like pulling teeth. Solana and Cardano, at least to my mind, have as much of a claim to be called decentralized as most other blockchains, but it’s within the realm of possibility that trading of SOL and ADA is severely restricted in the U.S. If this sounds like an exaggeration, there’s an antecedent.  In 2020, the SEC launched a lawsuit against Ripple, the corporate entity perhaps most-closely associated with the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC alleged that XRP is a security, and that Ripple illegally sold over $1 billion worth of tokens. The SEC’s case is essentially that XRP meets the qualifications of the so-called “Howey Test,” or one of the standards enacted during the 1930s to determine whether an asset is an “investment contract.” An asset passes (or fails, depending on your POV) if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others.  By that definition it often seems as if cryptocurrencies at least resemble securities. Most people buy crypto, truth be told, because they expect to make a profit based on the success of some network or application that is built and maintained by other people. There’s no going around that, even if a token often has other utilities (or in the case of non-fungible tokens, the “intrinsic value” of being associated with a work of art).  However, there are many cases where it’s clear a token is being used for more than speculation and also many reasons it would be worth considering the novel attributes of cryptocurrencies that set them apart from traditional assets like stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds (i.e. the SEC’s bread and butter). But more on that later.  What is important here is that after the SEC said XRP is a security, most exchanges in the U.S. delisted the token. If you look at CoinMarketCap today, you’ll find that XRP is still doing fine. It’s the sixth-largest token by market capitalization three years after the SEC first sued Ripple. Though you’ll notice almost all of the XRP trading volume is on offshore exchanges – except for the pittance traded on U.S.-based Kraken.  In a way, this is likely the clearest example of what you could expect if any token is found to be a security: It will likely be inaccessible to U.S. users, given the current exchange ecosystem, but be available for trading around the world to anyone with a Bithumb, Bitstamp or KuCoin account (and in the U.S., if you have a VPN). Astute readers might note I left Binance – the largest U.S. exchange, by far – off that list. That’s not only because it's currently being sued by the SEC, but to make the next point.  Today, Binance sees more trading activity of XRP than every other exchange combined (though if the SEC is to be believed, there’s also a lot of wash trading). If Binance didn’t exist, however, that trading activity would simply move elsewhere. Blockchains are open and their tokens are always accessible to trade peer-to-peer with the right know-how, and so if there is enough demand someone will always try to find a way to supply those tokens easily.  I’d go a step further in saying this is likely the case even under the catastrophic scenario where crypto is banned by every nation on Earth, which for a variety of reasons – including the recent regulatory advancements in Europe and Hong Kong and the game theory position that some nation somewhere would probably like to be sole regulator of a lucrative industry – is not going to happen. A more likely scenario is that some regions will be friendly to crypto and some will be hostile, and so crypto will always have a home.  Crypto’s regulatory uncertainties stem in part from the fact that the industry’s most important projects are universalizing technologies. Because there’s a part of crypto that functions like a boundless natural resource (like coal to mine, or a river to bend), many have argued the entire industry should be left untrammeled by regulators or treated like commodities of the Earth and put under the purview of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Not everyone agrees.  See also: Binance and Coinbase: Experts Weigh What's Coming Next  Bakkt, for instance, acquired a broker-dealer entity in early 2023 because it “will be useful for the offering of those tokens that are determined to be securities,” D’Annunzio said. Several other companies have taken a similar approach including BitGo and Coinbase. These licenses satisfy some of the surveillance requirements the SEC has been asking for, but it is not a complete approach for all of crypto’s regulatory uncertainties. Who exactly should draft a cryptocurrency’s risk disclosures? In just one case, would it be SOL’s validators or the Solana Foundation?  Crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro has argued that cryptocurrencies are essentially shares in collectively-owned (through token holders) and employee-run (miners or validators) not-for-profit corporations. A token is “the closest one can come to acquiring equity in a network that is not owned by anyone,” he wrote. What makes crypto totally distinct from traditional equity like stocks however is that the technology is always open by design. There can be rules that limit on-ramps ability to provide trading services, but the networks themselves are supra-regulatory.  “The SEC appears to be interpreting the Howey Test liberally when it comes to determining which tokens may be securities,” D’Annunzio said. “While these issues ultimately may be resolved through litigation and/or federal legislation, the SEC’s viewpoint is certainly relevant in the current landscape.”  In a sense, the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities effects who can access a token, but not what they can do with it.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/20/what-can-you-do-with-a-blockchain-token-that-is-classified-as-a-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/571a08998e3c9a3abca75e6a899e10d7fd047cf1-6599x4399.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14021253,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538772,1687289436,Stacks (STX) Registers 11% Gains As Broader Market Suffers Volatility,"While the broader crypto market experiences turbulent times and volatility, Stacks (STX) stands out with an impressive performance. Stacks is a network created in 2017 as an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to create and deploy smart contracts. In recent times its native token, called STX, has been exhibiting positive performance in its price movement following the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals. Amidst Market Turbulence, Stacks (STX) Defies the Odds, Showcasing a Resilient 11% Surge The price of STX recorded a significant increase of 21.57% in the last 7-day trading session. At the time of writing, STX is still maintaining its bullish momentum. It shows a notable increase of 11.33%, representing its current value of $0.6300. Related Reading: Best Crypto Narrative For This Summer? Everything About LSDfi According to data from CoinMarketCap, STX’s 24-hour trading volume is experiencing a massive pump of 387.11%, standing at $147 million. This increase suggests strong investor demand and positive sentiment surrounding the asset, potentially indicating a bullish trend. A fundamental factor driving the price of Stacks (STX) is the Bitcoin-based NFTs called Ordinals that have experienced increased adoption. Based on data from Dune analytics, the launch of Ordinals has led to nearly 12,906,466 Bitcoin inscriptions on the network. This has increased network activity, causing the price of STX to rise significantly. However, with increasing scrutiny and regulatory measures impacting various cryptocurrencies, STX became the first token approved by the SEC. This approval may have contributed to boosting its price by attracting investors. This regulatory approval sets STX apart from other tokens and reassures investors regarding its legitimacy and regulatory compliance. Stacks Daily Chart Stacks (STX) price is currently above the middle band at the time of analysis. It is heading straight toward the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a strong upward momentum. This indicates potential bullishness, with the possibility of the price continuing to rise and reaching higher levels. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is above the signal line; the histogram bars also display strong green bars. This suggests the asset’s positive momentum is strengthening, potentially signaling further upward price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue To Accumulate As BTC Makes Recovery Push The Stacks token, STX, currently trades between its significant support and resistance levels of $0.4679 and $0.6762, respectively. Based on the chart, the asset is moving straight to its primary resistance level of $0.6762. The move suggests that the buyer’s pressure has outweighed that of the sellers. If the bulls break this level successfully, the next significant resistance point is $0.8294. General Crypto Market Performance Might Boost STX Notably, the global crypto market cap has reached $1.07 trillion, marking a 0.44% increase in the last day. In the past 24 hours, the total crypto market volume has also surged to $29.04 billion, a significant 44.09% rise. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin’s dominance has risen to 48.45%, showing a 0.30% increase throughout the day. These metrics suggest that the crypto market is regaining its positive move today and might also rub off on STX.

Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was also trading in the green, drifting up 3.6% to $1.78K. The bullish price action comes as BlackRock's ( BLK ) bet on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ""shows Bitcoin continues to be an asset of interest for some of the world’s largest financial institutions,"" CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung said in a statement this past week. “An estimated 20% of Americans have now owned bitcoin at some point,"" he added. ""BlackRock’s proposed ETF potentially offers the other 80% an option that is altogether more familiar and accessible.” Note that this isn't BlackRock's ( BLK ) first foray into the crypto space. The company last August unveiled its first-ever private trust offering direct BTC exposure to its U.S.-based institutional clients. Shortly before that, it teamed up with crypto exchange Coinbase Global ( COIN ) to provide institutional clients access to direct BTC trading capabilities. The BLK ETF filing also helped to repair the discount on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's ( OTC:GBTC ) share price relative to net asset value, narrowing to the lowest level since last September at around 33%.

14020450,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/deutsche-bank-latest-institution-to-enter-crypto-arena,1687287653,Deutsche Bank latest institution to enter crypto arena,"Deutsche Bank is seeking to increase its income in the digital assets space and has applied for a licence in Germany. A potential income stream According to a report earlier on BNN Bloomberg, the largest German bank has applied to the regulator for a licence to be able to custody cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Bloomberg quoted David Lynne, Head of Deutsche’s commercial banking unit, who said at a conference on Tuesday: “We’re building out our digital assets and custody business. We just put our application into the Bafin for the digital asset license,” Lynne was also quoted as saying that the licence application was part of a strategy to increase fee income at Deutsche’s corporate bank division, something that is also being done at Deutsche’s investment arm DWS Group. Institutions finally entering the crypto space The Deutsche Bank move into crypto is fresh on the heels of other major institutional sallies in this direction. Blackrock’s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF was announced late last week, while Fidelity is also rumoured to be doing the same thing, as well as eyeing up the possible purchase of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. It does seem rather portentous that just as retail investors are fleeing the cryptocurrency market in droves, some of the biggest Western institutions are going in the opposite direction and are finally entering the crypto asset space. Deutsche Bank’s colourful past However, not all in the cryptocurrency sector might be appreciative of Deutsche Bank’s latest step into the world of digital assets. Some might say that in the traditional finance world Deutsche Bank makes FTX look like a man stealing a loaf of bread. The largest of the German banks has been made to pay many millions of dollars in fines over recent years for an absolute litany of financial misdemeanours that range from interest rate manipulation, to bribes, to Russian money laundering, and to turning a blind eye to Jeffery Epstein’s use of the bank, to name but a few. Add to this that Deutsche Bank is said to be in a parlous financial situation and could be one of the next banks to fall. Although given that it is judged to be one of the Globally Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), in short “too big to fail”, central banks might potentially backstop Deutsche if it came to it.

14019638,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538770,1687285814,Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal,"After losing the crucial $0.34 price support, Cardano (ADA) has experienced a significant downtrend. In the past 24 hours, ADA has declined by 1.6%. On the weekly chart, ADA has struggled to recover from an over 8% depreciation. The technical outlook indicates that bears have control of the price, with low demand and accumulation. Although ADA has started rebounding from the $0.20 level, a strong bullish influence has yet to be observed. If buying strength does not recover in the upcoming trading sessions, ADA may break below its immediate support line. The volatility of Bitcoin makes it challenging for other altcoins to stabilize their prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue To Accumulate As BTC Makes Recovery Push ADA’s potential to reach the $0.30 level depends on consistent demand and support from the broader market. However, even if these conditions are met, ADA may encounter strong resistance at the $0.30 price mark. The decrease in market capitalization suggests that sellers are currently dominating the ADA market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.25. Since being rejected at the $0.30 level, ADA has lost several support lines. The coin currently faces overhead resistance at $0.27, and if it manages to breach this level, it may aim for a target of $0.29. If buying strength does not recover, ADA is expected to experience a consolidation phase within the range of $0.22 to $0.28 before attempting a breakout. The local support level is currently situated at $0.22. In the event of a fall from $0.22, the price may further decline to $0.20. The trading volume of ADA in the last session has declined, indicating a decrease in buying strength and overall market activity. Technical Analysis At the time of writing, ADA has struggled to regain investor confidence and show signs of recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped below the 30-mark, indicating an oversold condition. This suggests that selling pressure persists and investor sentiment remains weak. Additionally, the ADA price has moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, highlighting low demand and indicating that sellers are currently driving the price momentum. In terms of demand, another significant indicator has generated sell signals on the ADA chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed red histograms, indicating sell signals for the coin. This suggests a bearish momentum for ADA. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Regain Strength If It Clears This Resistance Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and fluctuations, showed wide bands indicating potential significant volatility for ADA in the upcoming trading sessions after it breaks out of its consolidation phase. Given these indicators, the next few trading sessions are critical for determining the direction of the Cardano price.

The upgrade would make the main chain into a zkEVM validium, meaning that the chain would still be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. A validium differs slightly from a ZK rollup, as they use an off-chain data availability model. Polygon also currently offers a ZK rollup, which went live back in March.  If approved by the Polygon community, the major upgrade would bring increased security and make the framework of the blockchain more “future-proof,” according to the blog post written by Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic.  In addition, Bjelic argues that this upgrade would completely eliminate reorgs, allow for faster transaction confirmations, and scale the blockchain.  Bjelic told CoinDesk in February that Polygon was exploring ways in which it could bring ZK technology to its mainchain.  The proposal comes as Polygon has begun to rebrand itself with Polygon 2.0, in which a series of announcements about its blockchain, token, and governance will be made public.

A report by the Financial Times revealed that Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com has teams trading tokens for profit. Citing five unnamed people with direct knowledge of the company’s trading practices, the report indicates that the exchange operates proprietary trading and market-making teams. One of the persons with direct knowledge about the exchange’s trading teams said executives at Crypto.com gave external trading houses “absolutely dramatic sworn statements that Crypto.com was in no way involved in trading.” Another person said employees at the exchange were asked to “say there is no internal market maker type operation.” Crypto.com denied these claims and said employees were not asked to lie to other trading houses. The exchange conceded that it does have an internal market maker but said, “This is not a controversial practice.” We have an internal market maker that operates on the Crypto.com exchange and that internal market maker is treated exactly the same as third-party market makers that identically facilitate tight spreads and efficient markets on our platform. Exchange Revenue Is Derived from Its Retail Trading App The exchange told media publication Decrypt that it does not rely on proprietary trading as a source of revenue, as the Financial Times reported. In an email, the exchange said: This market making activity is a regulated practice, as long as there is a level playing field, i.e. all market makers have to follow the same ruleset, that assures market fairness & integrity. The company further told the Financial Times that most of its revenue comes from its retail trading app, where the exchange was traders’ counterparty for transactions and which operated as a broker model. As such, the Crypto.com trading team ensures that Crypto.com is risk neutral by hedging these positions on a number of venues, including the Crypto.com exchange, the exchange said. One of the people familiar with the matter said the company’s proprietary trading desk trades on Crypto.com’s exchange and other venues. Another person added that the proprietary trading team’s sole objective is the make money “and not facilitating an exchange.” The exchange’s trading practices have been called into question during intense regulatory scrutiny in the US. The SEC recently accused crypto exchange Binance and its rival Coinbase of securities violations. In response to the lawsuits, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC: These trading platforms, they call themselves exchanges, are commingling a number of functions. He added: In traditional finance, we don’t see the New York Stock Exchange also operating a hedge fund, making markets. Crypto.com Shutters US Institutional Exchange Services Following the news of the SEC’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, Crypto.com announced that it would shut down its institutional exchange services for US customers. The exchange explained that demand is drying up due to the current market landscape in the US. The company did not specifically reference the regulatory action, but it was undoubtedly a concern for the exchange. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14018109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538754,1687282209,Why The Ripple General Counsel Demands Impartiality From SEC Staff,"In a recent post, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple, Stuart Alderoty, stated that legally federal employees must act impartially. As such, the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) especially should comply with rigid rules. Alderoty reaction relates to the Hinman documents and allegations of William Hinman’s favoritism towards Ether. SEC Counsel Emphasizes On The Law In the tweet, Stuart Alderoty stated the law requires SEC employees, like all federal employees, to act (and appear to act) impartially. Notably, he cited the basic obligations of public service from (5 CFR 2635.101(b)(14)) covering the general principles and code of conducts for employees. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels The sub-section states that federal employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or ethical standards. Alderoty quotes this while referring to the SEC and their perceived evasion tactics in the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple. Interestingly, the released Hinman documents imply that former Director of the SEC’s Corporation Finance William Hinman refused to heed caution while drafting the speech. In the documents, Hinman said that Ethereum and Bitcoin were not securities and noted that a token would no longer be grouped as a security if it became sufficiently decentralized. However, some crypto community members believe the infamous speech deliberately favors Ether implying that Hinman wasn’t impartial in the speech. On June 13, Stuart posted; An investigation must be conducted to understand what or who influenced Hinman, why conflicts (or, at the very least, appearances of conflicts) were ignored, and why the SEC touted the speech knowing that it would create “greater confusion.” Ripple To Investigate Who Influenced Hinman On June 13, Stuart Alderoty gave a brief recap of the Hinman emails on Twitter, stating that he ignored multiple warnings that his speech contained a made-up analysis with no legal basis. Also, he noted that although Hinman claimed the speech was his personal opinion, the SEC used it for guidance and retained it on their website. Notably, other top executives at the SEC warned Hinman that the speech would create more market confusion. A warning he refused to heed when he delivered the speech. A Twitter user Mr. Huber, asked Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse if they had plans to address the issue aside from calling for an investigation on Twitter. The CEO of Ripple replied in the affirmative to the inquiry but did not reveal how they would execute the planned investigation on Hinman. Meanwhile, ex-SEC director Marc Fagel stated that he believes a ruling on the ongoing case is coming within days. He noted that even if he is wrong, there is no basis to think that the delay is due to the complex nature of the case. Finally, he said that the speech did not cause greater confusion as Ripple is substantially different. featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/why-the-ripple-general-counsel-demands-impartiality-from-sec-staff/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/14018109.jpeg
42410350,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJt9R,1687282134,EU Commission Brushes Off 'Data Act' Fears by Crypto Industry,"New EU data rules won’t make smart contacts illegal, the European Commission has said, brushing off industry concerns about killing off blockchain innovation.  The industry fears that the Data Act, an EU bill now being deliberated, imposes unworkable requirements that smart contracts should withstand manipulation, safely reset, and control access – but officials say there’s nothing to worry about for Web3 entrepreneurs.  “There is no reason to fear existing smart contracts would become illegal upon the entry into force of the Data Act,” a spokesperson for the commission, which proposed the bill in 2022, told CoinDesk.  Though acknowledging the law goes wider than just covering the Internet of Things – meaning connected devices such as smart fridges – “the new provision is intended to cover software, which is used to automatize the execution of contracts (in the context of data sharing),” the spokesperson said, adding that requirements in the controversial parts of the law “are quite high-level and they should not be problematic for the vendors of smart contracts software.”  That explanation seems to have done little to assuage the concerns of industry lobbyists, who worry the law could end up going much wider than intended.  “The drafting as it stands is extremely wide, and it will therefore almost inevitably create uncertainty about what the intended scope is,” CoinDesk was told by Chris Donovan, general counsel at the NEAR Foundation, an organization which supports the NEAR blockchain protocol.  “We've seen what regulatory uncertainty can do to our industry in other jurisdictions,” Donovan added, referring to the U.S., where multiple crypto companies are now being pursued by securities regulators, adding that the EU’s proposed strictures “would probably be extremely challenging, or in some cases impossible to fulfill.”  Smart contracts are programs that use blockchain technology to release funds automatically when given conditions are met – and have numerous applications in decentralized finance.  While the EU’s plans could be workable for some private blockchains where there’s a central gatekeeper, Donovan worries they could undermine the whole point of public, permissionless networks where the fact that no party can manipulate the contract is the whole point.  “In a public permissionless context where everything is done on an open source basis, and often smart contracts are deployed in a way that is truly immutable, they can't actually be subsequently updated, paused or reversed,” he said. “That's deliberately by design to create trustless transaction environments.”  A recent open letter sent to lawmakers and the commission last week calls for a range of drafting changes to be made to the law to sweep away those unhelpful ambiguities.  The letter, signed by companies such as Fujitsu, Ledger and Ripple and lobbying organizations the European Crypto Initiative and Blockchain for Europe, says that the law would jeopardize smart contracts written on blockchains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Cardano, NEAR and Polkadot, potentially conflict with recently agreed Markets in Crypto Assets law, and damage the European economy.  In terms of the legislative process, it’s late in the day. Both arms of the EU legislature – the Council which groups member states, and lawmakers at the European Parliament – have approved their own versions of the text, in each case containing the controversial smart contract provisions.  But Donovan remains optimistic.  “I'm hopeful that we will be heard, and that those modest requests will be accommodated,” he said.

The original bill included plans to regulate stablecoins, but provisions for managing crypto as a regulated activity were later included. Legislators subsequently added crypto promotion supervision as the bill passed through parliament. The FSMB will now undergo its final stages before becoming law: Consideration of Amendments and then, finally, Royal Assent. Consideration of Amendments is the bill’s final reading by both Houses of Parliament. During this final reading, the House of Commons will amend the bill before the House of Lords approves or deny these changes. The bill will then go between the two Houses until they reach an agreement. Following approval from the Houses, the bill will undergo Royal Assent, where King Charles III formally agrees to make the bill a law. The FSMB will likely become law soon.

The altcoin has managed to break past a crucial recovery region, indicating that the bulls are making an attempt to regain control. Over the last 24 hours, Ethereum has experienced a modest 0.2% increase in price. But on the weekly chart, it has successfully reversed most of its previous losses. However, it is important to note that Ethereum is still trading near a vital support line, and another push from the bears can make the altcoin potentially drop below its immediate support level. The volatility of Bitcoin has had a similar impact on most altcoins, causing them to exhibit comparable price movements on their respective charts. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels While Ethereum is currently showing positive momentum, it is crucial for buying strength to increase in order to sustain the upward trend over the next trading sessions. From a technical perspective, the bears still maintain some control, while the bulls continue to face challenges. Demand and accumulation levels have remained relatively low on the chart. Furthermore, the market capitalization of Ethereum has declined, indicating a decrease in buying strength based on the one-day chart. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) was trading at $1,730, showing signs of recovery over the past few days. The altcoin remained in proximity to a significant support line at $1,717. On the upside, there was an overhead resistance at $1,770. If buying strength strengthens, Ethereum may aim for the $1,740 level. However, for the bulls to regain control, a move above $1,770 would be beneficial. Conversely, if the current price level experiences a decline, ETH could drop below the $1,717 support and potentially trade around $1,710. Unfortunately, the trading volume of ETH in the last session was in the red, indicating more selling pressure in the market. Technical Analysis Following a visit to the oversold zone, Ethereum has made attempts to reverse the situation. However, the demand for ETH has remained low. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates increased selling strength as it remains below the half-line. Furthermore, the price of ETH has moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. In line with other technical indicators, Ethereum showed sell signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed a red signal, indicating a bearish price momentum. Although, it’s worth noting that the signals were declining, suggesting a potential turnaround in the price in the upcoming trading sessions. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Indicators Suggest Strengthening Case For More Upsides On the other hand, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicated a decrease in capital inflows as it remained below the half-line. This decrease in buying interest for ETH may further contribute to the bearish sentiment.

42410351,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJtCk,1687277127,Web3 Charity Teddy DAO is Raising Money Through Daily NFT Auctions,"Web3 software company Lucky Friday is introducing Teddy DAO, a perpetual non-fungible token (NFT) collection that donates its sale proceeds to charity.  Teaming up with global fundraising organization JustGiving, Teddy DAO aims to utilize crypto as a funding mechanism to promote social impact worldwide.  Starting June 23, Teddy DAO will hold daily auctions for one of its teddy bear NFTs, created by digital artist Yumi and minted on cross-chain smart contract platform Moonbeam. Auction winners can then donate the proceeds to one of 400 charities supported by JustGiving, where the crypto is then converted to fiat and donated through the platform.  Teddy DAO eventually plans to leverage 450,000 charities supported by JustGiving as part of its mission to help solve real-world problems through cryptocurrency donations.  David Chapman, founder of Teddy DAO, told CoinDesk that the project was inspired by an NFT sale he conducted last year, where he sold a one-of-one collectible and raised $15,000 for humanitarian aid organization UNICEF. He noted that this event not only highlighted the demand for NFT-backed charity donations but also indicated that the method could be used to onboard people new to Web3.  “Whereas NFTs have largely been for-profit and the few instances of charitable giving have been a one-time donation, we thought it best to showcase a new use for NFTs by creating digital collectibles that will be minted once per day, thereby guaranteeing a constant stream of revenue for charities within JustGiving's network of partners,” said Chapman.  Teddy DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) registered as a 501(c)(3) organization, aims to build out its community to collectively contribute to social good.  “Over time, we would love to see it develop to where donors are selecting the Teddy DAO as a charity to donate to and build a treasury that can be voted on by the holders of the NFTs as to what social good initiatives to deploy to, whether that is to build wells in a place of need or a school etc.,” said Chapman.  Despite an ongoing bear market that has largely chilled NFT sales, crypto-based charity donations have caught on as a way to leverage blockchain-based currencies and NFTs for social impact.  Earlier this month, Ethereum-founder Vitalk Buterin donated $10 million in funds from the sale of memecoin Shiba Inu to an India-based covid relief organization. And in May, crypto funding platform Endaoment teamed up with non-profit Global Giving to expand its roster of organizations that accept crypto donations.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | DOT | FIAT | SHIB | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/20/web3-charity-teddy-dao-is-raising-money-through-daily-nft-auctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b939185ad77241957200d0489cef2071a5c8b43-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410356,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJtTH,1687276010,"GBTC Share Price Soars, Discount Narrows to Multi-Month Low on BlackRock ETF Filing Optimism","Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) share price continued to soar on Tuesday morning amid optimism about converting the fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) after investment management firm BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF.  The price of GBTC shares on secondary markets rose past $16 for the first time since May 10, according to TradingView data. It is currently trading at around $15.9, gaining some 24% since Thursday, the day of BlackRock's filing.  The discount on GBTC’s share price relative to net asset value narrowed to as low as 33% during the morning, according to CoinDesk’s calculation. This is the lowest level since last September, and lower than the 34% it recorded in early March.  The surge came as investors turned optimistic about being able to redeem funds in the future, and Grayscale potentially winning an on-going lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about converting the fund into an ETF after news about BlackRock’s filing for an ETF. GBTC doesn’t allow redemptions at the moment, which led to a price discount.  “Many are taking BlackRock's conviction as a sign that they expect Grayscale to win its case against the SEC, and want to be in with an ETF filing should that happen,” macro analyst Noelle Acheson said in a note.  “While this doesn't mean that GBTC could convert into an ETF right away if Grayscale does win (it depends on whether Gensler pulls out more tools in his box to fight it), it certainly makes it more likely that GBTC holders would be able to redeem in the near future.”  ""The discounts have also narrowed further as GBTC's liquidity remains low,"" Vetle Lunde, analyst at digital asset research firm K33 Research, said in a note.  He said that at the current discount level, ""the market is still implying that GBTC will remain close-ended until 2042 (when adjusting for annual fees). Thus one could very easily make the argument that GBTC still remains substantially underpriced due to backlash from all the built-up leverage from 2020-2021.""  Rumors also emerged about Fidelity, another investment management giant, possibly filing for a spot BTC ETF or acquiring Grayscale. A Fidelity spokesperson told CoinDesk that the firm had not publicly announced any plans to file. ""No filing or refiling has been made since the SEC's denial of the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust application,"" the spokesperson added, referring to the firm's application for a BTC-focused ETF in March 2021.

14015068,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538727,1687275001,Optimism (OP) Soars Over 6% Following Launch On BNB Chain,"Optimism price is basking in the news of BNB Chain’s newly introduced Optimism-powered layer-2 testnet opBNB. On June 19, BNB Chain announced the launch of its opBNB testnet. The newly launched layer-2 scaling solution based on Optimism Stack will boost the Binance Chain network’s security and scalability. Following the launch, the Optimism token has scored an over 6% price increase today, June 20, after an over 3% decline on June 19. Binance-owned Blockchain Newly Introduced Optimism-powered Layer-2 Scaling Solution The scaling solution, opBNB, will increase transaction throughput, reducing network fees. BNB Chain currently processes about 2,000 transactions per second at $0.10 per transaction. However, according to the latest announcement, opBNB would support over 4,000 transactions per second at a cost below $0.005. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels BNB Chain noted that opBNB optimizes data accessibility, and catching layer, and adjusts the submission process algorithm to enable simultaneous operations. That would allow the network to increase the gas limit to 100 million per block from the 30 million currently allowed on Optimism. Binance described opBNB as the solution to the scalability challenge limiting the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Optimism scales transactions using Optimistic Rollups, which process data off-chain to fasten things on the Ethereum mainnet. The newly launched scaling solution is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible. That means it is interoperable with Ethereum-based smart contracts, networks, and ERC-20 token standards. Furthermore, the announcement noted that the remote procedure call service layer simplifies the integration process through a user-friendly interface. With that, developers can focus on building applications without worrying about complexities associated with layer-2 scaling. News of this development has increased Optimism (OP) sentiment, evident in the increased trading volume. At the time of writing, the Optimism token has recorded a 24-hour increase in trading volume of over 140%. BNB Chain isn’t the only network to leverage Optimism’s scalability. Optimism is known for its excellent scaling capability. In a previous development, World ID and World App, a grass-free crypto wallet founded by OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, migrated to Optimism to leverage its layer-2 scaling solution. OP Coin Price Outlook Optimism’s bullish price momentum has propelled it to second place among top-gaining coins today. Optimism (OP) price has increased by 6.61% over the past 24 hours, with a seven-day price rally of 1.15%. Despite the current price pump, real-time technical analysis suggests a sell option for Optimism (OP). The moving averages suggest a strong sell signal, while the oscillators indicate a buy signal. But BNB Chain is the third-largest blockchain in DeFi total volume locked (TVL) after Ethereum and Tron. DefiLlama data shows a TVL of $3.35 billion and a 24-hour volume of $264 million.

Now, big institutions are increasing their Bitcoin exposure even though the prices have begun plummeting toward the red zone. Alongside all of this, Tradecurve, an upcoming hybrid exchange, has been forming a bullish pattern. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Why Large Companies Are Bullish on Bitcoin Throughout the recent months, large corporations have injected huge amounts of liquidity into MicroStrategy, and some of the largest companies to do so include BlackRock and Fidelity, alongside Bank of America. For corporations that are not interested in buying Bitcoin directly, MicroStrategy shares typically serve as a reliable proxy investment, with the goal of getting exposure to the price performance of BItcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity are the top five stock owners of the company, as reported by CNN. With all of that taken into consideration, Bitcoin has been trading at a value of $25,528.55 as of June 16, 2023. In the last week, the low point for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was at $24,864.61, while the high point was at $26,653.24. Moreover, the all-time high of Bitcoin occurred on November 10, 2021, at $69,044.77, indicating that the cryptocurrency now trades 62.96% under this point of value. In the last 30 days, Bitcoin decreased in value by 4.9%, while in the last 24 hours, it saw an increase of 2.4%. Tradeucurve Has Begun Forming a Bullish Price Pattern After the large accumulation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bank of America, it is clear that interest in the blockchain space has spiked, and Tradecurve has also seen a bullish outlook as a direct result of this. The TCRV token spiked by 20% in the previous week, and analysts predict that it can spike 50% by the end of June. Tradecurve is an emerging player in the online trading ecosystem, and it is undergoing its presale run, offering a unique proposition for investors and traders. The platform combines derivatives and crypto trading within a single platform and eliminates any sign-up KYC checks, prioritizing privacy. On Tradedcurve, users from all around the world can trade all derivatives from a single account just by opening one using their email, lining a crypto wallet, and making a deposit. What differentiates Tradecurve from its peers is also the implementation of features such as algorithmic trading using AI and its implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR). With PoR, transparency is prioritized, and with AI trading bots, trades can be executed a lot quicker and more efficiently when compared to manual trading. Analysts are bullish on the future of TCRV as well and predict a climb of 100x, especially when it gets listed on TIer-1 exchanges and on Uniswap. During Stage 3 of the presale, TCRV traded at $0.015, and now at Stage 4, its price spiked by 20% to $0.018, indicating a bullish pattern. The presale stage kicked off with a flying start, as even after a day, 4,810,042 TCRV tokens have already been sold, indicating that interest is high in the project.

Meanwhile, Uwerx, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, has been making waves with its impressive presale achievement. Let's delve into the current state of Polygon (MATIC) and Uwerx and explore the factors contributing to their respective performances. Will Polygon (MATIC) Emerge Stronger Amidst Regulatory Hurdles? Polygon (MATIC)—previously known as Matic Network—is a groundbreaking platform designed to scale and develop Ethereum infrastructure effortlessly. Its cornerstone is the Polygon SDK, a versatile framework supporting various application types. By effectively transforming Ethereum into a comprehensive multi-chain system, Polygon (MATIC) introduces the concept of an Internet of Blockchains. However, the recent regulatory scrutiny by the SEC has cast a shadow on Polygon (MATIC)'s price and future prospects, leading to a decline in its value. Polygon (MATIC) is currently priced at $0.6473, with a trading volume of $386,410,068 in the last 24 hours. Despite a live market cap of over $6 billion, the value of Polygon (MATIC) has experienced an almost 25% decline during this period. Market predictions for Q4 2023 indicate a possible price of $1.27 for Polygon (MATIC).

14013692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538703,1687271455,Bitcoin Whales Continue To Accumulate As BTC Makes Recovery Push,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin whales have continued to accumulate recently as the asset has been trying to make a push toward recovery. Bitcoin Whales Have Continued To Add To Their Holdings Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the whales have bought around $3.5 billion in the digital asset since the first week of April. The relevant indicator here is the “BTC Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that each wallet group in the market is holding right now. The wallet groups here refer to cohorts of addresses divided based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balances currently. In the context of the current discussion, the 1,000-10,000 coins group is the one of interest. Naturally, this cohort would include all addresses or investors who are holding at least 1,000 BTC and at most 10,000 BTC. As the only holders that own such large wallets would be the whales, this group can provide insight into the behavior of these humongous investors. If n the Supply Distribution is applied for this specific cohort, it would track the combined amount of Bitcoin that all the whales falling inside this range are holding currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC Supply Distribution for the whales over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the 1,000-10,000 coins group has registered an increase in its supply recently. More specifically, since the first week of April (that is, just before the rally had hit what has so far been the top), the whales have added around 131,600 BTC (worth about $3.5 billion at the current exchange rate) to their wallets. Related Reading: Stablecoins Supply Finally Shows Rise, Here’s Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin It would appear that these humongous Bitcoin investors were constantly adding to their addresses as the price was going down, perhaps hoping to catch the bottom. Recently, however, the group had slowed down as the decline was showing no signs of stopping, and fresh FUD like the SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase had emerged in the market. But a few days back, when Bitcoin had plunged below $25,000, the supply of the whales had started showing a rapid rise, implying that this cohort was heavily bought at the low prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Still Bullish, Will Rally Restart? Generally, while buying is a bullish sign for the price, it would appear to have held up for the asset this time as well, since the coin has shown some recovery efforts since this latest buying spree from these holders began, with the price even going above $27,000 for a brief period during the past day. So far, the whales haven’t shown any signs of stopping their latest accumulation streak, as their supply has now risen to a seven-month high of 4.65 million BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,700, up 2% in the last week.

Several miners, including Applied Digital Corporation (APLD), Crusoe Energy, Hut 8 Mining (HUT) and Hive (HIVE) have recently branched out into other types of compute. Demand for data center space for AI is estimated to grow to $76 billion by 2028, with large language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT becoming increasingly popular.  Shares of Iris Energy were up 19% on Tuesday early afternoon, and other publicly-traded bitcoin miners such as Hut 8 and Hive that have announced pivots to AI were also up sharply.  Read more: Nvidia's Blockbuster Outlook Reminds Bitcoin Miners to Give AI a Look  Iris Energy plans to increase its data center capacity to 9.1 exahash/second (EH/s) by early 2024, from its current 5.6 EH/s, the miner said.  ""Significant time was invested in exploring"" a strategy for high performance computing about three to four years ago, ""including signing a strategic memorandum of understanding with Dell Technologies in March 2020 to test and develop potential data center solutions for energy intensive compute applications, including leveraging Dell Technologies’ HPC and artificial intelligence expertise,"" said Iris Energy.  Given recent developments, ""the time may be right to expand into this sector,"" using either Iris Energy's existing sites or the ones under construction, the company said. The miner has procured items with long lead times to expand to build out another 100 megawatt (MW) facility, which would bring its mining hashrate to 13.6 EH/s if filled with mining rigs, said the press release.  Miners' access to cheap energy and data center infrastructure may make it seem like it would be easy for them to pivot to AI and cloud computing. However, the requirements of high-performance computing industries differ significantly from mining in terms of quality of operations, uptime and customer service.

Dubbed the 'Code Reader,' this application aims to enhance users' understanding of Ethereum source code by harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT, an algorithmic implementation for natural language developed by OpenAI. Decoding Ethereum Contracts via AI: A Glimpse into Code Reader Powered by ChatGPT, Code Reader's function is to generate insights into Ethereum contracts' source code files based on user prompts. After a user inputs a prompt, the tool responds with AI-generated interpretations of the contract’s source code files. In the world of blockchain analytics, Code Reader represents a significant advancement, as it provides comprehensive lists of smart contract functions related to Ethereum data and offers deep insights into the interactions of the underlying contract with decentralized applications. Using Code Reader, however, requires a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. The tool does not store any user's API keys, safeguarding user privacy and data security. Etherscan’s Beta Integration of ChatGPT: A Prudent Approach While Etherscan's integration of ChatGPT signals a major leap forward, the company maintains a cautious stance. The firm highlighted that the newly launched Code Reader is currently in its beta phase and that user feedback is actively encouraged for the tool’s refinement. Importantly, Etherscan reminds users that the tool is for informational purposes only and cautions them against taking ChatGPT's responses at face value. This precautionary approach relates to the AI industry's common issue known as ""hallucinating,"" where AI may generate false or misleading results not supported by real-world data. In light of this, Etherscan has been explicit in advising users to always verify the responses they receive from the tool. AI in Blockchain Analytics: Future Prospects and Challenges The launch of Etherscan's Code Reader comes amid a growing trend of AI integration in blockchain analytics, seen with Alchemy's recent launch of its own ChatGPT-based tool, AlchemyAI. However, the burgeoning role of AI in the blockchain industry also presents considerable challenges, especially regarding feasibility and data capacity. A report by Singaporean venture capitral firm Foresight Ventures highlighted the substantial resources required to train large AI models, which can exceed the capacity of most networks. This report suggests that small AI models remain a more feasible choice, underlining the need for caution amidst the excitement surrounding the integration of larger AI models like ChatGPT. Etherscan’s launch of the AI-powered Code Reader, and its integration of ChatGPT, marks a significant development in the use of AI in blockchain analytics. However, the challenges presented by AI hallucinations and data capacity constraints underline the importance of careful management and continuous improvement in this fast-paced industry.

14012263,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538731,1687267818,Best Crypto Narrative For This Summer? Everything About LSDfi,"Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) on Ethereum were one of the biggest topics in the crypto market in the first months of 2023. Thanks to Ethereum’s shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), LSD projects such as Lido Finance (LDO) and Frax Finance (FXS) flourished. In simple terms, LSDs are financial instruments that represent tokens that have been used as receipts within a DeFi protocol. Through these, users are able to stake their token while having the flexibility to use these LSDs in other decentralized applications. Best New Crypto Narrative For H2 2023? And according to some experts, LSDfi could become the new biggest trend for the second half of 2023. Crypto analyst @DaanCrypto recently wrote: “My best guesses for narratives going into the Summer: BTC Chain/Layer, LSDfi. Been loading up on some ALTS that fall into these categories.” Remarkably, Binance Research also recently published a detailed report on LSDfi that is well worth reading for investors. LSDfi refers to DeFi protocols built on liquid staking derivatives. By providing additional yield opportunities, LSDfi protocols allow LSD holders to leverage their assets and maximize returns. According to Binance’s report, LSDfi protocols have seen a rapid increase in Total Value Locked, TVL in recent months, benefiting from the introduction of liquid staking. Related Reading: Crypto King Do Kwon Behind Bars: Sentenced To 4 Months In Montenegrin Jail Cumulative TVL across the major LSDfi protocols has surpassed the $400 million mark, more than doubling in the last month. Tailwinds for LSDfi growth include the rise of staked ETH as well as the current low adoption of LSDfi. Remarkably, the trend is still relatively young. LSDs currently hold an $16.9 billion market cap, while LSDfi only accounts for 2% of that market, creating a massive opportunity. In addition, ETH’s staking ratio is significantly lower than the average of the top 20 PoS chains. The ETH ratio is just 16.1%, while the average ratio is 58.1%. The growth potential is therefore also huge in view of this. Popular crypto researchers @MooMs and @Flowslikeosmo looked into the Binance report and examined the most important projects in the LSDfi space at the moment. Currently, the LSDfi landscape is relatively concentrated, with the five largest players owning over 81% of TVL. Lybra is the market leader, and its rise to the top has been rapid, considering that the project only went online on its main network in April. Lybra Finance (LBR) was a pioneer in the LSDfi space, launching eUSD, one of the fastest growing yielding stable coins in the space. To date, Lybra holds over 36% of all LSD TVL and is working on some big changes to its tokenomics model for V2. LBR v2 is expected to bring some huge changes to the tokenomics model. “With Lybra currently trading at a significant 70% discount from its previous highs, it is definitely worth keeping an eye on.” says @Flowslikeosmo. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price In second place is currently Instadapp (INST), which is revolutionizing the DeFi industry by creating a comprehensive hub for all things DeFi. Instadapp’s IETH has seen explosive growth and currently holds 13.38% of the LSDfi market share. With the current smart strategies, users can earn higher returns on their ETH by using dApps such as AAVE, Morpho, MakerDAO and Compound. The third largest LSDfi protocol is currently Pendle, which allows users to use “upfront” returns to create customized strategies that match their risk tolerance and time preferences. Notably, Pendle has two return aggregators that have recently launched to add value to the Pendle ecosystem. Important to note: Even though LSDfi offers attractive opportunities for LSD users, users should be aware of the risks involved. At press time, Lybra Finance (LBR) traded at $1.65, down 66.9% from the all-time high on May 29.

42410365,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJttj,1687267622,Cardano's ADA Paints 'Death Cross' Amid Regulatory Uncertainty,"An ominous-sounding technical analysis pattern called ""death cross"" has appeared on the daily price chart of Ethereum competitor Cardano's ADA token.  A death cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) drops below the 200-day SMA. Followers of technical analysis consider the death cross a warning the market is about to head into a tailspin.  ADA's 50- and 200-day SMAs crossed bearishly over the weekend, confirming the first death cross since December 2021, according to charting platform TradingView.  The moving average crossovers are backward-looking and considered unreliable as standalone indicators. That said, the latest death cross is consistent with the dour regulatory outlook for ADA and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), in general.  Crypto traders were caught off guard earlier this month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its lawsuit against Binance, classified a slew of tokens as securities, including ADA.  Cardano development company IOG promptly rejected the SEC's claim. Still, ADA ran into selling pressure and has lost 30% of its market value this month, the most significant single-month decline since March 2022. The sell-off probably stems from fears that being categorized as security would subject ADA to greater regulatory oversight.  ""If the SEC ultimately prevails (which may take several years or even a decade), altcoin issuers and liquidity providers will face unprecedented difficulties,"" Matt Hu, CEO of crypto asset management firm Blofin, said in a report published over the weekend.  Hu added that the regulatory risk is ""mainly concentrated on altcoins investors, which has a limited impact on holders who only hold BTC and ETH.""  ADA changed hands at $0.26 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.

Last month, Cuscal cut off payment services to Binance Australia. At the time, Binance Australia said that it will no longer be able to facilitate Australian Dollar bank transfers using PayID, blaming Cuscal without naming it. Australia's blockchain industry had denounced recent restrictions by local banks on crypto payments and invited platforms like Cuscal and government stakeholders to a roundtable discussion on June 27 to discuss the issue.  CoinDesk has viewed the ""restrictions"" in a document titled ""Zepto Compliance Survey for Digital Currency Exchanges (DCE).""  ""Our banking partner, Cuscal has updated its Merchant guidelines which contain new requirements for all digital currency exchanges that are supported by Cuscal,"" the ""survey"" reads. ""If you do not currently comply with the new requirements, we are happy to consider a reasonable time frame for implementation. Please note, if you are unable to comply with the requirements, Zepto and Cuscal will not be able to continue to support you.""  Zepto's ""survey"" said the requirements were to put in place appropriate controls for the users of services from fraud and required the response from the exchanges by June 21.  Some of the requirements are a 24-hour hold on first-time inbound payments of any size, real-time verification of user identity and unspecified transaction limits on cryptocurrency exchange payments, according to the Blockchain Australia statement.  ""The new requirements appear to only be targeted to digital currency exchanges,"" the statement read. ""Blockchain Australia supports efforts to enhance and promote secure digital transactions while still preserving users’ freedom to decide how to spend their own money and use their own assets.""  It isn't clear how many Australian exchanges Cuscal and Zepto provide payment services to since the data is not public, but Australia has about 400 crypto exchanges registered for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations.  ""The move will have a major impact in Australia,"" said Blockchain Australia Chair and Digital Assets Lawyer Michael Bacina. “In a time of growing economic uncertainty, scams and fraud across the economy are expected to increase. Australians rightly expect businesses they deal with to pitch in to help tackle this problem, but they also expect to be able to spend their money and use their assets as they choose, without undue restrictions.""  Cuscal did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  ""We're not in a position to comment on whether or not any of our customers may be impacted if they are unable to meet the new requirements,"" said a spokesperson from Zepto.

This Optimism-based Layer-2 network offers promising solutions, aiming to increase transaction speed, lower costs, and enhance network security. Unveiling opBNB: The New Era of Scalability On June 19, BNB Chain announced the opBNB testnet launch, an innovation in the blockchain space that seeks to enhance the scalability of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). opBNB represents a tangible commitment to ensure a seamless, efficient experience for users, developers, and projects within the BSC ecosystem. This development is a clear demonstration of BSC's ambition to bring the power of blockchain to everyone, despite falling to exploits in the past. An Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 chain, opBNB uses Optimism OP Stack to further bolster BSC's scalability while maintaining cost-effectiveness and security. This revolutionary layer-2 solution leverages Optimistic Rollups, a technique that reduces computational load on the main chain by executing transactions off-chain and only posting transaction data on-chain. Scaling Beyond the Challenges Blockchain networks often grapple with network congestion and high fees during periods of heightened network demand. The existing BNB Chain can handle around 2,000 transactions per second at transaction costs of roughly $0.10. However, with opBNB's advanced features, the Binance blockchain network is set to push its gas limit to an incredible 100 million per block, a considerable increase from the 30 million limit allowed by Optimism. This dramatic upgrade will allow opBNB to process over 4,000 transfer transactions per second, with the average transaction cost dropping to less than $0.005. These improvements are part of opBNB’s efforts to streamline data accessibility, enhance the caching layer, and addjust the submission process algorithm to allow simultaneous operations. The Potential Impact of opBNB The introduction of opBNB marks a turning point in BSC’s evolution, offering enhanced scalability and robust security measures that will enable the network to cater to a growing user base and expand its range of applications. For developers and projects, opBNB provides a solid, EVM-compatible platform for building diverse ecosystems and reaching more users. It offers a substantially improved throughput and lower transaction costs, providing a more seamless user experience. Projects previously hampered by the high volume of transactions on BSC can now thrive in the new, more scalable opBNB environment. Skeptics and Prospects Despite the promising innovation, some critics, such as Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran, argue that BNB Chain’s decision to launch an Optimism fork, instead of opting for other options like becoming a layer-2 directly on Ethereum or even a layer-3 on Optimism or Arbitrum, doesn’t make sense. He blamed the scaling issues on the centralization of an Ethereum fork and unsafe gas limit settings. Despite skepticism, opBNB continues to show potential, especially given BNB Chain’s status as the third-largest blockchain network in terms of DeFi total value locked. Its TVL stands at $3.38 billion, with a 24-hour volume of $264 million and roughly a million active daily userrs. The launch of opBNB invites developers and projects to experiment, build, and contribute to the broader BSC ecosystem, fostering the future of blockchain technology and paving the way for the next generation of blockchain innovation.

Georgieva emphasized the importance of avoiding fragmented CBDC solutions and highlighted the need for systems that connect countries, promoting efficiency and fairness through interoperability. “CBDCs should not be fragmented national propositions. To have more efficient and fairer transactions we need systems that connect countries: we need interoperability,” said Kristalina Georgieva. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels Over 114 central banks are currently exploring CBDCs, with approximately 10 nearing completion, she added. Georgieva further warned that failure to agree on a common platform could lead to a void filled by cryptocurrencies. CBDCs, controlled by central banks, differ from decentralized cryptocurrencies in that they are controlled by an entity. Georgieva stressed that CBDCs foster financial inclusion by granting more individuals access to cost-effective financial services. She noted that remittances, which currently cost an average of 6.3% or around $44 billion annually, could be made cheaper through CBDCs. “The average cost of money transfers stands at 6.3% amounting to $44 billion annually,” the director said. However, she cautioned that CBDCs must be asset-backed to ensure stability, distinguishing them from speculative investments when cryptocurrencies lack such backing. Total market cap still holding above $1 trillion despite bearish trend | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com IMF Highlights Risks Of Poorly Designed CBDCs, Calls For Unified Regulatory Framework The IMF’s proposal for a global CBDC platform aligns with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enhancing cross-border transactions. A standardized platform would bridge the financial divide, strengthen payment systems, and make remittances quicker and less costly. While CBDC benefits are evident, the IMF also underscored risks associated with their design. Poorly designed CBDCs could pose financial stability risks, encounter legal challenges, face cyber risks, and lead to operational risks for central banks. The IMF’s efforts to establish a unified regulatory framework and develop a global CBDC platform built upon previous discussions held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Recognizing the complex technological and legal aspects, the IMF aims to leverage its expertise to guide the platform’s development, fostering trust and providing oversight.

42410363,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJtqQ,1687263159,First Mover Americas: Tokenization Might Be a $5T Opportunity: Bernstein,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The benefits of tokenization are simple, the process brings operational efficiencies and improved liquidity and accessibility, Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday. Tokenization is the process by which real-world assets are converted into blockchain-based tokens. Bernstein estimates that the size of the tokenization opportunity could be as much as $5 trillion over the next five years, led by stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), private market funds, securities and real estate. Currency tokenization, via stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, will see application in on-chain deposits and payments, the report said, with about 2% of global money supply to be tokenized over the next five years, which is about $3 trillion, the report added.  Japan's cryptocurrency exchanges are urging regulators to relax margin trading restrictions on popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC). Exchanges in the country once offered leverage of up to 25 times principal capital, and trading volumes reached as high as $500 billion annually in 2020 and 2021, according to Bloomberg. In early 2022, however, Japanese regulators limited crypto exchanges to offering leverage of only twice the principal, which led to trading volumes dropping drastically last year. The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association, a self-regulated body of local exchanges, is now arguing that these restrictions hinder market growth and discourage new participants.  Bitcoin (BTC) traded little changed on Tuesday as China's first cut in benchmark lending rates in 10 months failed to lift the mood in traditional markets. The People's Bank of China lowered the one-year and five-year loan prime rates by 10 basis points to 3.55% and 4.3%, respectively. The one-year rate is a medium-term lending facility for corporate and household loans and the five-year figure is the reference rate for mortgages. Last week, the country’s biggest state banks cut rates on demand deposits by 5 bps and 15 bps on three- and 5-year time deposits. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The looser conditions contrast with continued monetary tightening in western economies and follow recent economic reports that indicate the world's second-largest economy is losing steam and is on the brink of deflation.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a 1% bid depth in top stablecoins or dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. The 1% bid depth is the collection of buy orders within 1% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask prices and is widely tracked to gauge liquidity in markets.  Circle's USDC has flipped tether (USDT) as the most liquid stablecoin.  ""Today, USDC has the highest market depth for its 'price discovery' markets, as we will call them, which include both fiat and stablecoin pairs like USDC-USDT, USDC-EUR, and USDC-USD,"" analysts at Paris-based Kaiko said in the weekly research note.  ""Another way to think about the data would be: to push down the price of USDC by 1%, you would need to sell $38mn,"" analysts added.

This proposed solution centers around the increase of the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE (MaxEB), an Ethereum parameter currently capping the effective balance of Ethereum validators at 32 ETH. A Case for Bloating: Validator Set Size Under the current structure, the MaxEB has inadvertently caused the validator set size to bloat, compelling large-scale staking operations to run a vast number of validators. With over 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 in the activation queue, the Ethereum network experiences substantial strain. This proposal asserts that by increasing the MaxEB, it's possible to unblock future consensus layer upgrades, improve the performance of the current consensus mechanism and peer-to-peer (p2p) layer, and enhance operational efficiency for validators of all scales. Preserving Decentralization, Enhancing Efficiency The research team emphasizes the need to maintain Ethereum's core principle of decentralization while simultaneously boosting efficiency. As such, the proposed increase in MaxEB does not tamper with the 32 ETH minimum requirement to become a validator. The aim is for an opt-in approach, offering validators a choice to partake in the changes. Unlocking Ethereum's Roadmap: SSF and ePBS The Ethereum roadmap includes significant consensus layer improvements, such as single-slot finality (SSF) and enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS). Currently, these upgrades are hampered by the inflated size of the validator set. Increasing the MaxEB could potentially facilitate the realization of these roadmap goals, which are critical to Ethereum's evolution and efficiency. Relieving the Consensus Layer, Improving Rewards Ethereum's consensus layer experiences high stress levels due to the massive validator set size. A case in point is the multi-epoch delays in finalization the beacon chain faced in May 2023. By opting for an increased MaxEB, validators could choose to keep their stake wjithin the protocol for compounded rewards, thereby mitigating some of this strain. In addition, the proposal outlines potential benefits for validators themselves. A higher MaxEB could democratize the compounding of stake, benefitting solo-stakers, who currently do not earn staking rewards above the existing MaxEB. For large-scale stakers tasked with managing thousands of validators, this change could significantly reduce operational overheads. Assessing Potential Trade-offs While counter-arguments against raising the MaxEB exist—primarily the appeal of the current simplicity and considerations around committees—the research team believes the proposed benefits significantly outweigh potential costs. The adoption of this proposal could mark a significant step towards a more sustainable and upgradeable Ethereum consensus layer, offering a feasible solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges.

Binance creates Bitcoin Lightning Network Nodes The Lightning Network uses micropayment channels which facilitate faster and cheaper off-chain transactions. By deploying Lightning Network nodes, Binance is looking to improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions, allowing for seamless and near-instantaneous transfers. Binance recently tweeted from its Twitter account, confirming that it was indeed setting up new lightning nodes, and that these would be used to enhance deposits and withdrawals. #Binance is working to integrate the #Bitcoin Lightning Network for deposits and withdrawals.

How We Picked the Best Crypto Casino Sites The process of selecting the best crypto casino sites for our top list requires a comprehensive evaluation of various factors. Our approach is systematic and thorough, ensuring that we provide our readers with accurate and reliable recommendations. Here’s a look at the key criteria we considered in our selection process: Security and Regulation First and foremost, we prioritized the security measures implemented by each platform. We looked for casinos that use advanced encryption technologies to protect user data and transactions. Additionally, we considered the regulatory status of each crypto casino. Brands that are licensed and regulated by recognized authorities provide an added layer of security and accountability. Game Selection The variety and quality of games offered by a casino is a crucial factor. We looked for crypto gambling sites that offer a wide range of games, from slots to jackpot games and live dealer games. We also considered the quality of the games, including their graphics, gameplay, and fairness. Cryptocurrency Support Given the focus on finding the best crypto casinos, we evaluated the range of cryptocurrencies supported by each platform. Casinos that support a wide range of cryptocurrencies offer more flexibility to players. We also considered the ease of transactions, including the speed of deposits and withdrawals. User Experience We looked at the design and usability of each platform, including the ease of navigation and the availability of essential features. We also considered the quality of customer support, as prompt and helpful service can greatly enhance the user experience. Bonuses and Promotions We evaluated the range and generosity of bonuses offered by each casino, including welcome bonuses, deposit bonus, and loyalty programs. However, we also considered the terms and conditions associated with these bonuses, as they can sometimes be restrictive. Reputation and Reviews Finally, we considered the reputation of each platform within the Bitcoin casino communities. We looked at user reviews and ratings, as well as any notable complaints or issues. A strong reputation is often indicative of a reliable and trustworthy platform. Our selection process is rigorous and comprehensive, ensuring that we recommend only the best and most reliable crypto casino sites to our readers. However, we always advise players to do their own research and due diligence, as the suitability of a casino can depend on individual preferences and circumstances. Bitcoin casino Vs. Crypto casinos While the terms “Bitcoin casino” and “crypto casinos” are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference between the two. An online Bitcoin casino is a gambling platform that allows players to gamble directly using BTC, and the bitcoin casino games are often based on blockchain technology for transparency and fairness. On the other hand, a crypto casino is a broader term that refers to online casinos that accept multiple types of cryptocurrencies, not just BTC. These can include Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and many others. Crypto casinos offer the same services as Bitcoin casinos but provide players with more options for deposits and withdrawals. The choice between the best Bitcoin casino sites and a crypto casino will largely depend on the player’s preferences and the type of digital currency they own or prefer to use. Some players might prefer the best Bitcoin casinos due to the widespread acceptance and recognition of BTC. In contrast, others might opt for crypto casinos to take advantage of the different features and benefits offered by various cryptocurrencies. Maximize Winnings at Crypto Casinos To maximize your winnings at crypto casinos, it’s crucial to understand the games’ mechanics and the platform’s payout structure. Look for games with high Return to Player (RTP) percentages, as these games are more likely to pay out over time. Additionally, take advantage of bonuses and loyalty rewards, which can significantly boost your potential winnings. Games with high RTP High RTP games are the bread and butter of savvy crypto casino players. Games like Blackjack, Baccarat, and certain online slots real money games have RTP percentages upwards of 99%, making them potentially lucrative choices. However, it’s important to remember that RTP is a long-term measure, and short-term results can vary significantly. Wagering requirements Wagering requirements are a crucial aspect to consider when playing at crypto casinos. These requirements dictate how many times you must wager your bonus funds before they can be withdrawn. Lower wagering requirements are generally more favorable, as they allow you to access your winnings more quickly. Bonuses, Free Spins, and loyalty rewards Crypto casinos often offer generous bonuses and loyalty rewards to attract and retain players. These can range from deposit bonuses, free spins, and specific Bitcoin casino bonus gifts. Some platforms also have VIP programs, offering additional benefits to loyal players. However, always read the terms and conditions associated with these bonuses, as they often come with wagering requirements. Casino Games Tournaments Casino game tournaments are a thrilling aspect of crypto casinos, offering players the chance to compete against each other for substantial prizes. These tournaments can range from Bitcoin slots to video poker games, and they often come with significant prize pools. Participating in these tournaments can be a strategic way to maximize potential winnings. Conclusion In conclusion, crypto casinos offer a unique and exciting opportunity vs. traditional online casinos for those interested in both gambling and cryptocurrency. However, as with any investment, it’s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved. With careful planning and responsible play, crypto casinos can be a rewarding and enjoyable venture. Remember, the world of crypto casinos is still relatively new and evolving. As such, it’s crucial to stay updated with the latest developments and trends. This will not only enhance your gaming experience but also help you make informed decisions that can potentially lead to significant winnings. In the end, the key to success in crypto casinos, as in any other investment, is knowledge. The more you understand about the games, the platforms, and the technology behind them, the better equipped you’ll be to navigate this exciting new world. So, whether you’re a seasoned gambler looking for the best Bitcoin casino sites, or an enthusiast interested in exploring new ways to grow your digital assets, crypto casinos could be the next frontier for you.

However, it’s important to remember that crypto casinos come with risks that online casino real money sites might not have, and it’s essential to do your research and play responsibly. Responsible Gambling While the allure of crypto casinos is undeniable, it’s important to practice responsible gambling. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose, and always seek help if you feel that your gambling is becoming a problem. Many crypto- and bitcoin casinos offer self-exclusion options and have links to organizations that can provide help and support. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem, seek help from a professional or a trusted support group. Here are three reputable organizations that offer a range of services: National Council on Problem Gambling: This national non-profit organization is dedicated to helping problem gamblers and their families. They offer a variety of resources, including a 24/7 helpline, text and chat services, and a directory of treatment providers. Gamblers Anonymous: This is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other to solve their common problem and help others recover from a gambling problem. They offer online and in-person support group meetings. Gambling Therapy: This global service offers free practical advice and emotional support to people affected by problem gambling. Their resources include online forums, email support, live chat, and a variety of self-help tools. Remember, it’s important to seek help if you feel that gambling is negatively affecting your life. You’re not alone, and there are resources available to help you. Disclaimer This article is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal or financial advice.

14009362,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538719,1687260262,Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels,"As the Bitcoin price continues to struggle, some metrics have begun to emerge that could mean that the current bearish trend is only temporary. The realized profit and loss levels for BTC have continued to fall over the last six months and have now hit a level that suggests the start of another upward rally. Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss At Two-Year Lows Data from on-chain aggregator Glassnode shows that the realized profit and loss among Bitcoin holders have been on the decline. This fall in realized profit and loss follows the rollercoaster price action recorded over the course of 2023 so far, and as the price has struggled with the $26,000 level, the realized profit and loss margins have fallen to October 2020 levels. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy? Now, the realized profit and loss levels are important because it shows the amount of profit-taking and loss-taking happening in the market. Profit-taking occurs when investors are selling their BTC for a higher price than they purchased them, and loss-taking is when they are selling for a lower amount than it was purchased. A drop in both of these indicates that there is less selling happening in the market right now. BTC realized profit and loss drops to 2020 levels | Source: Glassnode This is bullish for the price of Bitcoin because the selling pressure is now dropping, making room for the price of BTC to rebound. It also means a reduction in the available BTC supply in the market as investors opt to hold rather than sell. This allows room for growth in demand and can translate to a further increase in the price of the digital asset. The Start Of Another BTC Bull Run? The last time that the realized profit and loss levels fell this low was back in October 2020 which marked the start of the bull market. It was an almost non-stop climb from October 2020 to the new year where BTC went from around $11,000 to over $30,000 in a matter of months. BTC price recovers above $26,700 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com If this exact scenario were to repeat once more, then it is possible that the price of BTC would climb as high as $40,000 in a month, provided that the bulls are able to sustain this rally. This also presents a more bullish scenario for the digital asset, showing that the bearish trend may have reached the end of its rope. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price A similar climb to the October 2020 rally would mean a 200% rise over the next couple of months, and from the current level, a 200% increase would see BTC peaking above $60,000. Nevertheless, the bulls continue to battle the bears as BTC was rejected at the $27,000 resistance on Monday. The digital asset remains in the green, however, up 1.46% in the last 24 hours to trade at $26,765 at the time of writing.

42410357,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJtWa,1687258800,"Unified Ledger for CBDCs, Tokenized Assets Could Enhance Global Financial System: BIS","A new type of market infrastructure in the form of a unified electronic ledger could enhance the global financial system, argues a Tuesday report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  This ledger, proposed by the umbrella group for central banks as part of its annual economic report, could combine central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) along with tokenized money and assets on one platform, with the help of automated smart contracts that power transactions on blockchains including Ethereum.  “Bringing together central bank money, commercial money, and different assets on the same platform, all tokenized and interacting, opens up a whole new range of possibilities,” said BIS Economic Adviser and Head of Research Hyun Song Shin in a press release.  The current monetary system is not seamless because databases must be connected by third party messaging systems such as SWIFT that send messages back and forth with participants having incomplete views of actions, the report said. A new unified ledger would eliminate “delays and uncertainty,” the report added.  This envisioned finance system would, according to the BIS, provide new methods for securities settlement combining all individual steps into one transaction and enable tokenized deposits with built-in regulatory checks for wholesale CBDCs. Such a system could also reduce the cost of trade finance for smaller companies, the report said.  The unified ledger proposed by the BIS may exceed in scope a similar combined platform envisioned by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for CBDCs. Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department said in a speech on Monday that a global CBDC platform could be more efficient and safer than traditional platforms.  “We are at the cusp of another major leap in the monetary and financial system, which will have far-reaching consequences for the economy and society at large,“ said Shin. “This would be a game-changer in how we think about money and how transactions take place.”  A unified ledger for cross-border payments would also require significant policy harmonization across jurisdictions, the BIS report said.  Although central bankers and economists at the BIS are not set on the technological and design aspects of such a unified ledger, Shin said the institution is not thinking of using a permissionless blockchain though the mechanism used for effecting the transaction can be decentralized.  “I think the actual choice of technology will really have to be decided for that particular use case,” Shin said at a Monday press briefing on the report. “It could be decentralized, like in a permissioned blockchain, but it doesn't have to be. It could be a centralized system as well where there is a rigorous set of controls on data confidentiality, cyber resilience, and so on.”  The next step would be for a group of central banks to come together to take the project forward under a public policy mandate with the help of the private sector, which would handle most of the customer-facing activities, according to Shin.  “I think it's going to be a very important coming together of both the official sector as well as the private sector and rest assured this is going to be something that we will be discussing going forward,” Shin said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | WALLET,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/20/unified-ledger-for-cbdcs-tokenized-assets-could-enhance-global-financial-system-bis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28529e296d468e814f09339d2e37a95ac3427853-1200x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

First Blackrock, Now Fidelity Blackrock’s decision to apply for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) seems to have encouraged another leading asset management firm to go down the same route and capitalize on the growing demand for crypto investment products among institutional and retail investors. According to an anonymous source, Fidelity Investments applied the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to develop a Bitcoin ETF similar to BlackRock's structure, allowing investors to gain exposure to the digital asset without owning it directly. The ETF would primarily focus on physically-backed Bitcoin futures contracts, providing a more regulated and accessible investment vehicle for traditional market participants. Fidelity Also Eyeing Grayscale? Furthermore, if the word on the street is to be believed, the latter is also looking to acquire another asset management giant, Grayscale Investments. The latter currently offers the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional security. If the rumors are true and if Fidelity is able to successfully acquire Grayscale, then the former asset management firm will gain access to an already established platform for its Bitcoin ETF. With Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), being in financial hot water for some time, Fidelity’s possible swooping in could salvage the situation. Fidelity’s Crypto Offerings The potential move by Fidelity signifies the increasing acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. With over $10 trillion in assets under management, Fidelity's entry into the Bitcoin ETF space would bring significant credibility and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional investors. The company already offers several crypto products to its investor base. Notably, Fidelity Investments was the pioneer in providing investors with the opportunity to include cryptocurrency assets in their 401(k) retirement accounts. Additionally, in December 2021, the company introduced the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Canada. To top it all, the company opened access to Bitcoin and Ether trading to all its retail traders in March 2023, further expanding its offerings in the cryptocurrency space. Will The SEC Approve? Bitcoin enthusiasts have long awaited the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, as it could potentially open the floodgates for massive institutional investment, driving the price of the digital currency to new heights. Moreover, the introduction of a regulated Bitcoin ETF could also alleviate some of the concerns around market manipulation and investor protection. However, it is important to note that the reports about Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF filing and the potential acquisition of Grayscale remain unconfirmed at this time. As with any financial product, the approval process for a Bitcoin ETF involves rigorous scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The timeline for approval and implementation of such a product can be uncertain. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410362,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJtn7,1687256255,Bitcoin Is Becoming Illiquid at 147K a Month in Signal of Steady Accumulation,"Bitcoin (BTC) is flowing into wallets controlled by illiquid entities, or network participants with little-to-no spending history, at the fastest rate in six months, indicating a bias for accumulation from long-term investors.  Glassnode's illiquid supply change metric, which measures the number of coins held by illiquid wallets on a specific date compared with the same day the previous month, rose to 147,351.58 BTC ($3.9 billion) on Monday, the most since Dec. 19. The total held by illiquid entities has jumped to a record high 15,207,843 BTC, with the tally increasing by 215,000 BTC in the past four weeks alone.  The data shows investors remain confident of bitcoin's price prospects despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened regulatory risks.  Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, pausing a 15-month rate-hike cycle. The bank, however, ruled out rate cuts this year while keeping the doors open for more increases if required. The so-called tightening was partly responsible for last year's crypto market swoon.  Early this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed lawsuits against prominent digital assets exchanges Coinbase and Binance, accusing them of offering a number of alternative cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities. The lawsuits did not mention bitcoin, triggering a rotation of money out of altcoins and into the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  The rate of flow into illiquid wallets is ""supporting the case for a gradual and steady accumulation taking place,"" Glassnode analyst James Check said in a weekly report published Monday, noting the record balance held by illiquid entities and the dwindling exchange balance.  ""Overall, the market appears to be in a period of quiet accumulation, which suggests an undercurrent of demand, despite the regulatory headwinds of late,"" Check added.  The illiquid supply change indicator turned positive on May 24, signaling renewed accumulation, and has increased sharply since then.  Other things being equal, faster accumulation means weakening supply in the market and potential for price rise. Technical charts suggest scope for bull revival as long as crucial support at $25,200 is held intact, that is the bitcoin price doesn't drop below that level.  Bitcoin changed hands at about $26,750 at press time, having put in a high above $27,150 during the Asian trading hours, according to CoinDesk data.

This marks the first time since 2021 when China announced a complete ban on crypto mining and Tesla distanced itself from the asset that the dominance metric has risen above 50%. Recapturing Its Throne Bitcoin dominance is the measure used to determine how much Bitcoin makes up the total crypto market capitalization. The dominance crossed the 50% mark on the 6th of June, 2023, and then settled slightly lower at $49.9%, according to data sourced from TradingView. At present, Bitcoin dominance is back above the 50% mark, hovering at around 50.5%. This means that Bitcoin now accounts for half of the total $1.1 trillion market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market. Out of this, Bitcoin’s currency market capitalization is around $520 billion, according to data from Coingecko. Bitcoin’s market dominance has surged by over 10% since the 27th of November 2022. This increase has primarily been driven by investors looking at Bitcoin as a safe haven for their investments following the dramatic collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX exchange and growing regulatory scrutiny of altcoins in the United States of America. Bitcoin was last near the 50% mark in June 2022, after which the crypto markets saw a significant drop thanks to dogged and persistently high inflation in the US. This high inflation led the Federal Reserve to take aggressive steps to contain it. However, Bitcoin’s dominance metric has come under some criticism for under-representing Bitcoin’s actual market share by also including stablecoins in its calculations. But, this year has also seen the stablecoin markets struggle, with the Securities and Exchange Commission ordering Paxos to shutter its BUSD in February. This move erased billions from circulation. Ethereum Holds Steady While Bitcoin had dropped significantly in 2022, Ethereum had seen an even more significant drop, with the ETH/BTC pair dropping to a ratio of only 0.05%. However, with Bitcoin’s market dominance on the upswing, Ethereum (ETH) has held its position quite steady and has been around the 20% mark for the better part of a year. At present, the combined value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) make up around 70% of the entire crypto market. Bitcoin Dominance To Grow? Some, such as MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, believe that Bitcoin’s market dominance will continue to grow, eventually reaching 80% of the total market in the next few years. According to Saylor, increasing regulatory scrutiny and pressure from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would eventually cause a majority of other market assets to “go away.” “Regulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors. Bitcoin dominance will continue to grow as the #Crypto industry rationalizes around $BTC and goes mainstream. The entire industry is destined to be rationalized down to a Bitcoin-focused industry, with maybe half a dozen to a dozen other Proof of Work tokens.” Saylor also blamed the lack of any institutional money making its way to the crypto markets on the confusion and anxiety created by the thousands of other cryptocurrencies that have positioned themselves as an alternative to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. He also pointed out that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has called a commodity. “Bitcoin is the universally, globally-acknowledged digital commodity in this industry.” Despite the fear and uncertainty prevailing in the markets, Bitcoin’s value has grown over 3% over the past week. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $26,768, according to data from Coingecko. The BlackRock Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) One of the major drivers of Bitcoin’s price and dominance in recent days is BlackRock announcing that it is filing for a Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), according to crypto research firm Santiment. Investors are quietly confident that the ETF may receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the SEC, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon would custody the fund’s fiat currency. However, some have also raised concerns about the Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Fund after details hidden in the filing shed light on what BlackRock could potentially do in the event of a Bitcoin hard fork. According to the ETF filing, in the event of a hard fork, BlackRock would get to decide which fork to go with, effectively deciding on the future of Bitcoin.

42410358,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJtZt,1687254048,Japan’s Crypto Exchanges Push for 10 Times Leverage on Margin Trading: Bloomberg,"Japan's cryptocurrency exchanges are urging regulators to relax margin trading restrictions on popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC).  Exchanges in the country once offered leverage of up to 25 times principal capital, and trading volumes reached as high as $500 billion annually in 2020 and 2021, according to Bloomberg.  In early 2022, however, Japanese regulators limited crypto exchanges to offering leverage of only twice the principal capital, which led to trading volumes dropping drastically last year.  The Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulated body of local exchanges, is now arguing that these restrictions hinder market growth and discourage new participants.  Among the body's demands is a request for higher leverage limits of at least 10 times the principal.  JVCEA Vice Chairman Genki Oda told Bloomberg in an interview that reforming the leverage rule could make Japan “more attractive for crypto and blockchain companies” and encourage more trading.  The regulators are expected to evaluate the proposals, taking into account market risks and investor protection. Any revisions to margin trading caps will undergo thorough reviews and consultations with industry participants.  The push for revised margin trading caps aims to attract diverse traders, including institutional investors, while enhancing market liquidity. Allowing higher leverage would also enable traders to manage their positions more effectively, JVCEA said.  Japanese crypto exchanges processed just over $110 million worth of trading volumes in the past 24 hours, data shows. Most volume was generated on bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and xrp (XRP) trading, the data shows.  JVCEA’s comments come as Japan warms up to crypto regulation and stablecoin usage. Lawmakers are said to be exploring Web3 regulations to support the growth of NFT and virtual lands-related businesses in the country, while local banks are working on plans to issue their own stablecoins – tokens pegged to a fiat currency such as the Japanese yen – in the coming months.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/20/japans-crypto-exchanges-push-for-10-times-leverage-on-margin-trading-bloomberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db098663204a34ba46394ebc74f1a9958c9571e0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It achieves this by setting up payment channels that conduct off-chain transactions between users with fees of a few cents.  In May, Binance said it would integrate the Lightning network to ease deposit and withdrawal activity for users. Binance had temporarily paused bitcoin withdrawals citing network congestion at the time – which led to concerns among users around the exchange’s reserve funds.

The company, which operates data centers that host bitcoin mining equipment, also raised $26 million in fresh capital from Sandton Capital Partners, which it intends to use to fund an ""aggressive expansion"" into North America, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. That's on top of the $28 million it raised in November, when it bought Hydrokraft AS, a renewable energy-based data center in Norway.  The acquisition is likely to be ""the first of several"" over the next year, CEO Joshua Payne said in the statement.  The data center in Ohio is designed for a capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) and is expected to add up to 3.3 exahash per second (EH/s) to the firm's hashrate by the end of 2023. Arkon said it hopes the facility will offer a predictable revenue stream by providing server hosting services to bitcoin mining firms.  Bitcoin mining firms felt the pain of the last year's crypto bear market as they were squeezed between falling valuations and high electricity costs, with some firms going bankrupt as a result. Further uncertainty lies ahead with bitcoin's next halving, now less than a year away, which will reduce rewards for mining blocks, and so challenge firms' profit margins further.  “Raising capital in the current climate, particularly amidst a crypto downturn and increasing regulatory scrutiny, was indeed a challenge,"" Payne said. ""However, the uncertain market landscape also presents very well priced buying opportunities for those that are able to navigate the storm and protect the downside.""

14005690,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538672,1687250458,Why Is The Bitcoin Price Up Today?,"After the Bitcoin price reached a three-month low of $24.835 last week, the bulls currently seem to be gaining the upper hand again. The BTC price has continued its upward trend in the last 24 hours and has risen by 1.6% to currently $26,795. At one point, BTC had already hit $27,203 before a corrective move took place. Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? As always, one can only speculate about the reasons why the Bitcoin price is rising. But thanks to the filing by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, for a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the US, bullish sentiment has returned to the market. A Bitcoin Spot ETF is predicted to open the flood gates for institutional investors. As NewsBTC reported, the history of the first gold ETF in the US in 2004 could be an indicator of the bullish impact that the approval of a spot ETF could have. The gold ETF has been instrumental in the adoption of gold by institutions. Within eight years of the first ETF, the price of gold more than quadrupled. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge Basically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has 240 days (about eight months) to decide on the application. However, David Attley, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, asserted yesterday that he had heard a compelling argument that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could be approved shortly (“days to weeks”). This news may have had as positive an impact on the market as yesterday’s news that Fidelity may also soon apply for a Bitcoin Spot ETF along the lines of BlackRock. Obviously, crypto Twitter has become much more bullish as a result of the BlackRock news. Related Reading: What Happens To Bitcoin Price If Spot ETF Is Approved? Gold ETF Story Reveals And large investors in BTC, so-called whales, have also turned bullish on the leading cryptocurrency for quite some time. As reported by on-chain data analytics service Santiment, whales have been busy over the past two months as the crowd watched the price fall. “Now back above $27k once again, it’s far from coincidence that wallets holding 1K to 10K $BTC have accumulated a combined $3.5B since the first week of April,” Santiment states. Intraday trader @52Skew makes a similar observation with regard to BTC perp CVD buckets & delta orders: “Whales mostly driving price still, longs aped on this bounce, shorts still twaping on every bounce.” Moreover, the trader observed in the last few hours that there was a lot of demand in the spot market on Binance, the largest crypto exchange. According to him, spot buying is a sign of a sustained rally, so ideally spot buying needs to persist. In terms of the Binance open interest and funding, Skew states that many shorts are chasing the price after the longs were squeezed earlier. Outlook For H2 2023 Another bullish impact on the market could be the technical chart outlook for the second half of the year. As Aksel Kibar, Chartered Market Technician (CMT), writes via Twitter, BTC could be on the verge of a breakout from the correction that has been taking place since mid-April: Looks like we have a valid downward sloping channel on $BTCUSD with the upper boundary acting as short-term resistance at 27K. Breakout from the channel can complete the existing pullback to the larger scale H&S bottom reversal. At press time, the Bitcoin price saw a slight correctional move and was trading at $26,795.

A New Class Of Cross-Border Payment Systems The International Monetary Fund Director stated at a conference in Morocco that the IMF was working on a principle of interoperability. According to her, the concept involves a “shared infrastructure.” This would help avoid the emergence of settlement blocks, which is the last thing that anyone wants as they look to avoid further economic fragmentation. The International Monetary Fund presented the outline of the new cross-border payment system, which it states uses a single ledger to register and record central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions, programmability, and improved information management. The new platform concept was unveiled on the 19th of June at a roundtable on CBDC policy held in Morocco. The event was held in partnership with the Central Bank of Morocco. At the event, the International Monetary Fund’s director of monetary and capital markets department, Tobias Adrian, stated that the new platform could benefit individual and institutional users by offering faster transaction times and significantly lower fees. He added, “Some of the 45 billion dollars paid to remittance providers every year may then go back in the pockets of the poor.” Furthermore, the new platform can help central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets, resolve disputes, and aggregate information on capital flows. It can also be adapted for domestic, wholesale, and retail CBDCs as well. Details Of The Platform Further details about the platform, called the XC (cross-border payment and contracting) platform, were disclosed in an IMF FinTech note. The note was co-authored by the International Monetary Fund’s monetary and capital markets department director and released the same day as the announcement. “XC platforms offer a trusted single ledger – a document representing property rights -- on which standardized digital representations of central bank reserves in any currency can be exchanged.” The XC platform has been designed on the same model as the infrastructure of central bank digital currencies. It would consist of a settlement layer with a single layer and access to the layer would be gradually expanded. At present, institutions must have a reserve account with their respective central banks in order to conduct cross-border operations. However, the XC platform would directly allow the trading of tokenized central bank reserves, with liquidity still coming from institutions that held reserve accounts. The XC platform will also offer a programming layer that would give institutions the opportunity to innovate and customize their services as required, while an AML layer would help to meet privacy protections and trust conditions. The platform would also not require CBDCs. Instead, the platform would facilitate interoperability between assets and money tokenized by the private sector and create standards and a safe environment to program financial contracts. In a press statement, the IMF Managing Director stated, “As we proceed to the upcoming 2023 IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings, I have just wrapped up an excellent panel discussion with Governor of Bank Al Maghrib Abdellatif Jouahri on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as part of the High-level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies: The Role of the Public Sector in Money and Payments – A New Vision.” The Rise Of CBDCs According to a report by the Atlantic Council, 11 countries have launched their own central bank digital currency. Additionally, all G7 countries are currently in the developmental stage of creating a CBDC. A total of 114 countries, representing 95% of the global gross domestic product, are exploring creating a central bank digital currency. This is in stark contrast to only 35 countries in 2020. Supporters of central bank digital currencies argue that they can provide significantly better financial services for citizens, while critics argue that they pose a considerable risk to privacy. Although there are signs of a division, the United States is also exploring CBDCs, with treasure officials stating that the agency is looking into privacy concerns associated with CBDCs. The assistant secretary for financial institutions at the US Treasury, Graham Steele, stated at the Transform Payments US 2023 conference that retail CBDCs have pros and cons, with one challenge related to privacy. Some lawmakers, such as Florida Governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, have openly opposed CBDCs. DeSantis had signed a bill banning CBDCs, making Florida the first state to do so. “The movement to establish a central bank digital currency is an attempt to surveil & control the finances of Americans. It would violate privacy, limit consumer choice & undermine market competitiveness.” Republican Senator Ted Cruz has also opposed CBDCs and has even mooted banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC.

42410364,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJyxq,1687246933,Bitcoin Holds Steady as China Rate Cut Fails to Encourage Risk Taking,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded little changed on Tuesday as China's first cut in benchmark lending rates in 10 months failed to lift the mood in traditional markets.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the one-year and five-year loan prime rates by 10 basis points (bps) to 3.55% and 4.3%, respectively. The one-year rate is a medium-term lending facility for corporate and household loans and the five-year figure is the reference rate for mortgages. Last week, China’s biggest state banks cut rates on demand deposits by 5 bps and 15 bps on three- and 5-year time deposits. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.  The looser conditions contrast with continued monetary tightening in western economies and follow recent economic reports that showed the world's second-largest economy is losing steam and is on the brink of deflation.  Bitcoin, a pure play on liquidity, struggled to gather upside direction. The largest cryptocurrency by market value changed hands near $$26,819 at 07:27 UTC after failing to keep gains above $27,150 during Asian trading hours, according to CoinDesk data.  The Australian dollar, which is sensitive to the Chinese economy due to the strength of trade ties between the two countries, fell 0.7% against the U.S. dollar, and China's benchmark equity index, CSI, traded flat to negative. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell more than 0.5% and S&P 500 futures traded 0.3% lower.  The risk-off action suggests investors are unsure the rate cuts will be enough to shore up the slowing economy and are looking for a bigger stimulus package.  ""That could be the market's way of saying that the rate cuts are telling of more problems than it being a solution to China's recent economic struggles,"" ForexLive's analyst Justin Low said in a market update.  Some crypto observers say a bigger China stimulus could compensate for the hawkish biases of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and others, eventually pushing risk assets higher.  ""Reports also suggest that China is readying 1 trillion yuan stimulus package. This is BIG news as it relates to global liquidity,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, said in the latest edition of Macro Pulse.

To help investors break the digital ice, our task is to see which assets best simulate the role and behaviours of cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, no other investment serves as an entirely seamless proxy for crypto, even within the risk-on category of assets. By Ryan Giannotto, CFA Manager of Equity Index Research For investors new to the crypto ecosystem, the natural impulse is to try to visualize digital assets within a framework of well-known and familiar investments - we understand what is novel in terms of what we know. To help investors break the digital ice, our task is to see which assets best simulate the role and behaviours of cryptocurrencies. Ultimately no other investment serves as an entirely seamless proxy for crypto, even within the risk-on category of assets. If we expand the mental framework for this question, however, we can see that gold often best analogizes digital assets' role as a non-correlating, if volatile, investment. Out of Stock: Crypto Comparisons Show me your correlations, says the statistician, and I will tell you what you are. There is a prevailing assumption that digital assets behave like growth equities, but as which much received wisdom, this narrative is at odds with empirical data. The key factor is that for all their volatility, digital assets are remarkably uncorrelated to stock market risk. For instance, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) maintained a daily correlation to the Russell 1000 Index of only 0.231 since the end of 2015; this value means the two assets explain only 5.3% of each other’s returns, an impressively small figure.[1] If the same analysis is run against the Russell 1000 Growth Index, the explanatory power increases to only 5.7%. Even if we purposely select the stocks with the greatest sensitivity to the digital asset ecosystem, the connection remains tenuous from a quantitative perspective. The makers of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) in the semiconductor space are arguably best positioned as stock market proxies for cryptocurrencies, as they manufacture the devices used to mine and power many blockchain platforms. Indeed, the leading actors in this segment, AMD ( AMD ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ), had their stocks priced as low as $2 and $5 in 2015 - each has since witnessed over a 60-fold rally. Constructing an equal-weight portfolio of these two companies, rebalanced annually, illustrates just how different cryptocurrency and (modestly) crypto-correlating stocks can be. The figure above depicts the 100 and 200-day rolling correlations between the aforementioned GPU portfolio and Bitcoin since 2015. Notably, the average correlation over the preceding three years is only 0.253, meaning even the best candidate for a digital asset proxy in the stock market explains only 6.5% of crypto returns, an insignificant sum. At the height of the 2022 H1 drawdown, the 100-day correlation between Bitcoin and the GPU portfolio peaked at 0.620. This figure is certainly elevated, but it remains somewhat unremarkable given the depth of the sell programs that were pervading all asset classes at the time. A total of 63% of returns are attributable to other risk factors; even in the most favourable possible circumstances, the potential for crypto-proxy behaviour is limited indeed. Moreover, this period of higher correlation should be viewed as a deviation from long-run patterns, and not as a typifying trend. In 2023, the rolling correlations are rapidly approaching long-term averages, and indeed the 50-day correlation stood at 0.07 as of May 31 st . Hence, in a period of profound market stress, digital asset correlations only resembled the very closest stocks as much as utilities historically correlate to broad equities, which is to say they trade quite distinctly. Another challenge arises in that these stocks only became crypto-correlating, and subject to meteoric rise, after the emergence of digital assets - it is a classic causation problem. Investors therefore cannot examine AMD and Nvidia in the early 2000s and draw inferences of how digital assets might have behaved in such a period. The truth is that no equity serves as an analogue for digital assets, either pre or post the crypto big bang, because stocks and digital assets do not behave like one another. What is the Right Digital Benchmark? If under the most conducive of circumstances possible, stocks do not parallel digital asset performance, where else can investors turn for a benchmark? Other alternative currencies, namely gold, best serve as substitutes for cryptocurrencies in terms of store of value, medium of exchange and non-correlative properties. Gold has demonstrated idiosyncratic returns and long-term gains since 1971; amplifying gold’s daily returns by 400% (the vol differential between gold and Bitcoin) and it could be easily mistaken for a digital asset. This assertion does not imply that gold and bitcoin model each other’s behaviour, merely that they are both in a non-correlating class of assets. Moreover, some of the PGMs (Platinum Group Metals) do exhibit crypto-level volatility and trading patterns - palladium achieved 49% annualized volatility over the last year, and rhodium 215% volatility over the last 20 years. Indeed, these more exotic metals may be representative of the broader basket of digital assets now available to investors. While not stocks, gold, palladium and rhodium – for the moment – are proving the best assets to contextualize digital asset performance and their diversifying role in the portfolio.

Tokenization is the process by which real-world assets are converted into blockchain-based tokens.  Bernstein estimates that the size of the tokenization opportunity could be as much as $5 trillion over the next five years, led by stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), private market funds, securities and real estate.  Currency tokenization, via stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, will see application in on-chain deposits and payments, the report said, with about 2% of global money supply to be tokenized over the next five years, which is about $3 trillion, the report added.  “Over the next five years, we expect a swell in the stablecoins and CBDC tokens in circulation, led by China’s CBDC program,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. “Stablecoins and CBDC tokens, coupled with yield farming in decentralized markets, will compete with bank deposits as an investment or saving instrument,” the analysts wrote.  Still, the broker notes current regulatory uncertainty, and says that “tokenization using blockchain can only succeed when policy-makers appreciate the benefits of blockchains and how crypto tokens are an indispensable part of blockchain operations.”  “How policy-makers regulate blockchain-based businesses will determine how they view tokenization of real-world assets,” the note said, adding that “regulations may blunt the advantages of tokenization.""

42410378,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJzbW,1687241657,Alibaba's New Chairman Will Be Crypto-Friendly Joseph Tsai,"Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) said on Tuesday that Joseph Tsai, one of its founders, will step into the role of Chairman come September.  This leadership shuffle, which also saw the company name Eddie Yongming Wu as its new CEO, comes as it reorganizes itself into multiple units, separating its technology services from retail divisions.  But crypto stakeholders bullish on the China narrative – the idea that Beijing is slowly warming up to crypto – might be closely reading the tea leaves on this one as Tsai is a vocal proponent of crypto and an active Web3 investor.  Having someone like this at the top of such a large institution in China might be a signal that Alibaba could be positioning itself to embrace the new reality of Web3, and crypto, in China if that day comes.  Joe Tsai Likes Crypto  Tsai first announced his interest in the Web3 space in December 2021 with a short tweet: “I like Crypto.”  At the time, Tsai didn’t elaborate what he meant, but in the year following, he has been an active investor in the space.  Blue Pool Capital, which Tsai uses as his family office, was a minority shareholder in FTX, the South China Morning Post reported in January 2023, participating in two of its fundraising rounds. This wasn’t known at the time and was only revealed in court documents.  But Tsai has also been involved in better-known investments, such as Polygon’s February 2022 round, Web3 fantasy sports platform Fast Break Labs fundraise, and NFT platform Artifact Labs May 2023 round (which was a spin-off of the South China Morning Post, where he serves as chairman).  Tsai also owns the Brooklyn Nets, which has seen two of its key players, Kevin Durant and Spencer Dinwiddie, get involved in crypto; Durant signed a deal in 2021 to promote Coinbase (COIN), as well as a two-year deal with Dapper Labs, while Dinwiddie has tokenized his employment contract and has spoken at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference.  But Does China Like Crypto?  At the same time, the belief that China is warming up to crypto remains to be seen.  Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the country which currently enjoys some autonomy, has put forward a list of crypto rules to allow for licensed trading of digital assets in the territory.  Critics say that these rules are overly restrictive and make the market a pass for most serious institutions.  ""Hong Kong's framework as it exists today is highly unattractive. The market is small and unproven, banking partnerships are non-existent, and products are highly restricted,” Leo Weese, co-founder and President of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, previously told CoinDesk.  Banks have been reluctant to get on board, with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority forced to put pressure on some of the largest names in finance to bring on crypto clients.  In the rest of the country, there’s an embrace of digital assets on the blockchain – so long as they don’t have crypto.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for instance, are allowed, provided they don’t have any speculative attributes. In 2021, Alibaba’s Alipay restricted sales of NFTs until the user had held them for 180 days.  Beijing itself defines Web3 as an internet enhanced by artificial intelligence, blockchain, faster computing chips, and more resilient networks. It’s the third version of the internet, not something synonymous with crypto.  Alibaba might know something we don’t and wants an executive team ready for crypto in China – when that day comes. This could also just be the company moving around executives and putting one of its founders at the top.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/alibabas-crypto-friendly-joseph-tsai-set-to-become-chairman,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5df91f380fecb5dba4e9f15be0100dad00bd0872-800x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410385,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJzyf,1687240473,First Ever Canadian Bitcoin Conference Wraps Up in Toronto,"Hundreds of bitcoiners flocked to the swanky Chelsea Hotel in downtown Toronto on June 17 and June 18 to attend the first ever Canadian Bitcoin Conference. It wasn't the first Bitcoin-exclusive event in the Great White North, but it was the first conference with that specific name. The event featured talks from podcast host Stephan Livera, a “build your own open-source Bitcoin miner” workshop by Quebecan mining service provider D-Central, and a sneak preview of the new mobile wallet by bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin.  The event was organized by Bitcoin enthusiast couple Daniel and Manuela Carlin, with the help of roughly a dozen volunteers. It attracted over 300 attendees who each parted with anywhere from 180 to 498 Canadian dollars (about $136 to $377) depending on the type of ticket purchased.  Despite a bear market that has dragged on since last year, the introduction of a more stringent regulatory regime responsible for the exodus of large marquee exchanges like Binance from the country, and prior public ridicule of the dominant cryptocurrency by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the inaugural launch of the Canadian Bitcoin Conference is proof that the country's Bitcoin ecosystem remains intact, and may even be thriving.  “Bitcoin adoption has been steadily growing over the last number of years and that will continue. I think it will accelerate,” Daniel Carlin told CoinDesk in an interview. “One day we’ll wake up and it’ll just be a big green candle to the moon.”  Highlights of the conference  Bull Bitcoin mobile wallet  Bull Bitcoin CEO Francis Pouliot discussed self-custody before unveiling a beta version of the new Bull Bitcoin mobile app. The app is a non-custodial bitcoin wallet that is fully integrated with the Bull Bitcoin exchange. The integration allows users to purchase bitcoin (BTC) from the Canadian exchange directly from within the app.  “Still a bunch of work to do before I'm happy with a release,” Pouliot later tweeted. “But testing is still appreciated!”  Last week, Jack Dorsey’s FinTech company Block (SQ) also launched beta testing for its new self-custody bitcoin wallet, Bitkey. The wallet will allow bitcoin purchases from the app via an integration with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) and Block’s financial services platform Cash App.  Read more: Jack Dorsey-Backed Bitcoin Wallet Bitkey To Integrate With Coinbase and Cash App  The catastrophic implosions of decentralized finance platforms like Celsius and BlockFi, the shocking unraveling of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, and now the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and fellow crypto exchange Binance, have all triggered a flight from centralized platforms – billions worth of crypto deposits – to self-custody wallets like the ones being tested by Block and Bull Bitcoin.  Panties for Bitcoin  One of the few Bitcoin startups at the conference not directly involved in technology was underwear manufacturer Panties for Bitcoin.  The company’s booth featured oversized banners with images of scantily clad supermodels donning orange panties and bras.  The Panties for Bitcoin founder who only goes by Pablo, is an Argentinian industrial engineer who immigrated to Canada. Pablo says he’s a 50-year veteran of the underwear manufacturing industry and now proudly runs his new Bitcoin startup with the help of his son Michael.  “Before Bitcoin I was a panty manufacturer,” Pablo told CoinDesk. “Now I'm a Bitcoin nerd who manufactures panties.”  Michael says their panties and bras are high quality undergarments manufactured in Italy, and that the company is planning to expand its product line soon.  “So we have one style of bra and three styles of panties,” Michael said. “The next step will be to get a boxer around the time of Pacific Bitcoin.”  Stephan Livera and D-Central  The conference concluded with Livera delivering a lively talk on self-custody, contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem in non-technical ways, and the future of Bitcoin’s two primary use cases – digital payments and acting as a store of value. He also denounced the plethora of speculative tokens and affiliated platforms which he cheekily branded “sh*tcoin casinos.”  “If you sit by the bank of the river long enough, you can watch the bodies of your enemies float by,” Livera said, quoting ancient philosopher Sun Tzu’s famous book, Art of War. “So I think we’ll see that with some of these sh*tcoin casinos.”  After it was all said and done, D-Central led a small exclusive group of Bitcoin mining hobbyists in a 3-hour “build your own open-source Bitcoin miner” workshop. Participants purchased premium tickets for the exercise and received kits with BM1397 Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips that they eventually turned into working bitcoin miners.  Canadian Bitcoin Conference origin story  Carlin was born and raised in Ireland, but after the 2007-2009 Great Recession, the mechanical engineer was laid off and given a meager severance package. He used that money to immigrate to Canada with his wife Manuela, where the couple eventually stumbled across Bitcoin circa 2016.  “I took the money and said let's go to Canada,” Carlin said. “So we packed up, sold everything, came to Canada, and started a life here. That was back in 2009.”  While in Canada, Carlin took a liking to the ideas of finance journalist Max Keiser. One of those ideas was buying bitcoin.  “I was listening to a lot of Max Keiser,” Carlin explained. “Investing in gold and silver and eventually bitcoin.”  Despite being an engineer, Carlin didn’t contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem in a technical way. Instead, he leveraged his people skills while Manuela brought her event management expertise, and the couple created the country’s first Canadian Bitcoin Conference.  “I wanted to give something back and use my skills to contribute to the community,” Carlin said. “Manuela, my wife, she's a professional event manager. So we combined forces and said, ‘Look, this is something we can do.’”  UPDATE (June 20, 2023, 15:15 UTC): Clarifies that it wasn't the first Bitcoin-exclusive event in Canada.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/20/first-ever-canadian-bitcoin-conference-wraps-up-in-toronto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3709c0e1ff4c0ed465882932b6d66a6ffa1ab3cf-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410379,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJzep,1687221856,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin 'Looks Vulnerable': Analyst,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: BTC was trading at $26.8K, but Oanda Senior Market Analyst Craig Erlam is skeptical that bitcoin's price will rise significantly in the months ahead amid uncertain industry and economic news.  Insights: A number of crypto exchanges feature market makers. Do they create conflicts of interest? An FT story looks at Crypto.com's market maker.

While the market remains optimistic that BlackRock will be successful with its application for a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, Craig Erlam, a Senior Market Analyst with OANDA, said in a note that bitcoin still looks “vulnerable”.  “Bitcoin ended last week quite positively after dropping to three-month lows on Wednesday, but it continues to look vulnerable to further declines,” Erlam said. “The two-month trend is not in its favour, and the news flow isn't exactly helping the situation either. It's had a remarkable year and remains more than 50% higher, so it's hardly a dire situation.”  Erlam still thinks there’s a bull case for bitcoin, it just hasn’t been realized yet.  The recent downturns, he argues, are simply a correction phase within an overall optimistic bull market.  “However, there's little evidence indicating any imminent improvement, especially considering the Securities and Exchange Commission's intensifying scrutiny of major exchanges,” he concluded.

Crypto.com has joined the club of crypto exchanges that operate an internal market maker, the Financial Times reported Monday.  Market makers are entities that use their own capital to facilitate the trade of tokens on exchanges by taking the counter position on a trade, allowing investors to rapidly exit positions without a counterparty at the other end. If exchanges didn’t have market makers, their liquidity would be considerably thinner on all but the largest tokens.  “We have an internal market maker that operates on the Crypto.com exchange, and that internal market maker is treated exactly the same as third-party market makers that identically facilitate tight spreads and efficient markets on our platform,” the company told the FT. “This is not a controversial practice.”  In the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), automated market makers are what allow platforms like Uniswap to exist.  By their nature, most crypto exchanges operate internal market makers. Famously, Binance has Sigma Chain and Merit Peak,which have been in the news recently. Disgraced FTX, had Alameda. Coinbase denies that it runs one.  Participants on the platform, including market makers, are treated equally,” Crypto.com also told the FT. “[The exchange] does not rely on proprietary trading as a source of revenue”.  Without having an internal market maker, it simply wouldn’t be profitable – or even perhaps possible – to list smaller cap tokens and expect a market to form around them. There just won’t be enough activity to quickly match buyers and sellers, making the bid depth unappealing to traders.  Some exchanges instead choose to allow external market makers to operate on their platform. Bullish, for instance, uses B2C2, as an example.  Operating internal market makers raises lots of possibilities for allegations of conflict of interest. Alameda was an investor in many of the tokens it traded as a market maker. Allegations that Sigma Chain or Merit Peak manipulates markets have yet to be proven in court.  Of course, this isn’t a great look for the industry. But it’s just how it works. So many retail equity trades operate in the same way – it's just how the industry works. DeFi’s automated market makers perhaps are a better option, as they are algorithmic and open source, but even these can be accused of bias.  If Crypto.com really lied to outside parties, as the FT claims, about its market-making operations, then that’s a story. But as it stands, and as it said in its rebuttals to the FT’s questions, it’s just doing what everyone else does. Poor optics, yes, but welcome to crypto.

13994024,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538643,1687221048,"Binance Faces Regulatory Headwinds: UK Registration Canceled, Exits Netherlands, Cyprus","In the latest development surrounding Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, the company has officially canceled its registration in the United Kingdom. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved Binance’s request to deregister Binance Markets Limited (BML) (BML) on May 30, 2023, effectively ending its authorization to provide regulated services in the country. While the termination of Binance’s registration with the FCA may seem significant, it will not impact the exchange’s operations as BML never conducted any business or had users in the UK. Ilir Laro, Binance’s sub-regional manager for growth in the UK and Europe, clarified that BML had remained dormant since its acquisition by Binance Group in 2020 and had not engaged in any regulated activities. Related Reading: Report: Do Kwon Refutes Passport Forgery Claims, Shifts Blame To ‘Chinese’ Agency In March, Binance halted the process of allowing UK customers to withdraw or deposit funds in British Pounds following the termination of its operational agreements with local partner Paysafe. According to data from Kaiko, the exchange previously held a dominant position in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume denominated in Sterling until it lost its banking partner. Laro stated, “BML was successfully acquired back in 2020 by Binance Group, intended to launch a regulated business in the UK. This attempt was not successful, however, and has since then remained dormant since its acquisition.” Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Faces Regulatory Hurdles Binance’s decision to exit the UK comes amid a series of regulatory challenges faced by the cryptocurrency exchange. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have both filed lawsuits against Binance, alleging various violations, including misleading practices and manipulative trading. The company’s move to withdraw from the Netherlands was prompted by its failure to meet the registration requirements, while in Cyprus, Binance is preparing for the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) framework. BNB price struggles as exchange battles regulatory headwinds | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com With the upcoming enforcement of MiCA in 2024, Binance aims to focus on obtaining permits to operate in key European Union (EU) countries. Binance’s sub-regional development manager in the UK and Europe, Ilir Laro, mentioned that the exchange still holds regulated organizations in Poland, Sweden, France, Italy, and Spain. Laro emphasized, “Because MiCA, the European law on the regulation of cryptocurrencies, will come into force in 2024, the company will focus on obtaining permits to operate in EU countries.” Binance’s exit from multiple markets and ongoing regulatory challenges highlight the intensifying scrutiny faced by the cryptocurrency exchange. However, Binance’s strategy director, Patrick Hillmann, expressed the company’s commitment to regulation in the UK despite the difficulties it is encountering in the United States. Related Reading: Stablecoins Supply Finally Shows Rise, Here’s Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin Hillmann stated, “We are committed to working constructively with regulators in the UK to develop and promote responsible crypto adoption and innovation.” As Binance navigates through these challenges, it remains to be seen how the exchange will adapt to regulatory frameworks and maintain its position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency industry.

13994023,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538638,1687221046,PEPE Down 78% From May Peaks But Holder Count Rising,"While PEPE is down 78% from its May 2023 peaks, token holders continue to rise. As of June 19, there are now 119,229 unique addresses holding the token, an increase from early June, Etherscan data shows. The meme token is based on Pepe the Frog meme, created by Matt Furie in 2005. Falling Prices, Rising Token Holder Count The token gained substantial recognition as a meme coin and enjoyed exponential price growth a month after launching in late April 2023. With surging prices and the meme coin culture providing tailwinds, the token soon rose higher in the market cap ranking, securing a position in the top 100. Related Reading: Stablecoins Supply Finally Shows Rise, Here’s Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin As of June 19, PEPE is perched at 89th position with a market cap of $364,936,703, according to CoinMarketCap. PEPE is down 78% from May 2023 peaks, and prices remain fragile. Despite falling prices, PEPE holders continue to maintain an upward trend. With over 119,000 holders, users appear keen on accumulating. In crypto circles, token holder count can be used to measure interest and adoption. Projects with a higher token holder count can be used to indicate strong community support, which can translate to success. It can also indicate the level of utility and adoption. Tokens like USDT, a stablecoin, have high token holder counts considering their role in decentralized finance (DeFi), remittance, and more. In the case of PEPE, token holders are mostly speculating because the coin has no utility but is deflationary. An extract from their homepage reads: PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only. PEPE is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and can be bought on platforms like Binance, KuCoin, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, and others. At the same time, the token’s derivatives have been listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, which began supporting the token on its Innovation Zone while listing PEPE’s perpetual futures in early May 2023. Binance To Delist PEPE From Flexible Loan Program Following increasing regulatory scrutiny, Binance announced plans to delist PEPE as a borrowable asset from their Flexible Loan program. The delisting would take effect on June 21 and also coincide with the cancellation of any open PEPE loan holdings. Related Reading: Report: Do Kwon Refutes Passport Forgery Claims, Shifts Blame To ‘Chinese’ Agency Binance strongly encourages its users to settle any outstanding debts related to PEPE. Accounts that face liquidation will incur a 2% charge, where applicable.
