The prototype, dubbed Juno, was presented by developer Will Martino on 3rd March. JPMorgan executive director David Voell said during the meeting that the proposal has been under development since September of last year, and that it is one of several concepts that he said the bank has been working on.  Juno provides support for a smart contract language called 'Hopper' within a permissioned ledger network. Further, Juno was inspired by a consensus algorithm called Tangaroa, itself based on another consensus algorithm called Raft, which it contends offers improved scalability over proof-of-work mining.  By contrast, consensus on the Juno platform is reached through an election-type system, according to the presentation.  The meeting also featured a demonstration of how value could be transferred between participants on the network. Nodes in the network hold an election that determines a 'Leader' and a group of 'Followers'.  Once the election is complete, the client-side node issues a command to the Leader – in that case, transferring $10 between two of three accounts created by the client, which is then distributed to the group of Followers.  The project's GitHub page goes on to explain:  ""Once the command has been replicated to a majority of nodes, the command is applied by the Leader and a response to the Client is issued. Followers also apply the final transfer command around this time. After all this is completed, it's time to test resiliency of the network. As such, the Leader is terminated. Eventually a Follower calls for an election and is chosen as the new Leader.""  Both Martino and Voell cautioned in the meeting that the prototype remains in-progress, and that future versions of the Juno project would be released with additional extensions.  Overall, JPMorgan sought to emphasize the scalability of the distributed ledger, and its interest in continuing to develop the project with input from the community.  The presentation is the latest from the Hyperledger Project, launched late last year with 300 major firms and startups among its membership.  Last month, the committee elected its first chair and heard a presentation by tech giant Intel that included details about a blockchain test focused on a fantasy sports league.

42378643,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwlV,1457041233,Blockchain Startup to Secure 1 Million e-Health Records in Estonia,"Data security startup Guardtime has announced a partnership with the Estonian eHealth Foundation that will see it deploy a blockchain-based system to secure over 1 million patient healthcare records.  Under the deal, the foundation will integrate Guardtime's keyless signature infrastructure (KSI) blockchain into the foundation's Oracle database engine to provide ""real-time visibility"" into the state of patient records.  Estonia has become notable for its e-government systemhttp://estonia.eu/about-estonia/economy-a-it/e-estonia.html, which was established in 1997. This is enabled by a chip-embedded ID card that gives the nation's citizens access to over 1,000 e-government services, such as filing taxes and voting, almost instantly and via just one website.  Also included in the system are electronic patient records, which the rollout of Guardtime's technology is aimed to protect with an ""independent forensic-quality audit trail"". The company claims this will make it impossible to alter the information, illicitly or otherwise, without it being noticed.  A spokesperson for the company told CoinDesk:  ""In guarding sensitive records, the danger is that they could be altered, deleted, improperly changed or updated, affected by hackers, malware, system issues, etc. The blockchain in this case can prove the integrity of the record, and everything that has happened to it over time.""  Margus Auväärt, who heads the eHealth Foundation, said that Guardtime will allow it to maintain real-time awareness of health records.  ""It enables us to react to any incidents immediately, before potentially larger-scale damages can occur,""Auväärt said.  Blockchain shift  Launched in 2011, Guardtime originally marketed itself as a provider of "" keyless signatureshttps://e-estonia.com/guardtime-keyless-signatures-cure-cloud-paranoia/"" that would help prove data validity, with members reportedly contributing Estonia's Digital Signature Act and ID card in the late 1990s.  Perhaps owing to its longstanding work in the cryptography space, Guardtime said its KSI blockchain has been running continuously since before bitcoin in April 2008.  ""[Bitcoin]'s built out of ideas that have been around for a while, and has a lot of similarities with our blockchain. I would say that bitcoin is a ledger and blockchain. Hyperledger [and] Ripple are ledgers without blockchains. KSI is a blockchain without a ledger,"" a spokesman for the company said.  He continued by stating that the system files and signs data, in a method similar to blockchain startup Factom. Every time a file changes, a new signature is generated and stored in the firm's blockchain.  ""So the records themselves aren't stored there – just a series of hash values that show every time a file was updated,"" he said.  By signing key digital assets that protect a digital infrastructure, such as application components, log files and firmware, the system can provide real-time alerts to any compromises (eg: hackers or malware), ""allowing organizations to identify and manage breaches in real time"".  Unlike other approaches that depend on asymmetric (or public) key cryptography – bitcoin being the most famous example – KSI uses only hash-function cryptography, the company said.

42378657,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwzL,1457029771,"Bitcoin's Capacity Issues No 'Nightmare', But Higher Fees May Be New Reality","While bitcoin may not be facing a ""nightmare"" scenario as indicated by the media, digital currency users are now paying higher-than-average fees and waiting longer for transactions to confirm due to an unknown disruptive network user.  The incident has sparked a flurry of questions about the nature of the increased transaction load on the network as it comes amid the ongoing debate over scaling the bitcoin network.  Known as the ""block size debate"", the issue has fragmented the bitcoin community into two camps: Bitcoin Core, the network’s volunteer developers, who are seeking to change to how signatures are stored, thus increasing capacity as early as April of this year; and Bitcoin Classic, a contingent of developers and enthusiasts who have launched software that would more quickly force an update to the 1 MB cap on transactions they believe is an impediment to user adoption.  At issue, is that when a user sends a bitcoin transaction, an extra cost is attached in the form of a fee. Effectively, bitcoin transaction fees serve as a way for users to bid to be included in a block, with that cost rising or falling with demand for space.  Adding to the current problems is that a number of bitcoin wallets use a hard-coded fee amount: 0.0001 BTC (about 4 cents). Fees determine the priority that a transaction will receive as miners bundle them into the latest block. The higher the fee, the more priority it typically receives.  Signs suggest that the commonly used amount, at least for the time being, may not be enough, which in turn is affecting wallets that are still using standard fees.  The result is that some transactions with low priority remain unprocessed, which in turn is putting added pressure on users and businesses.  Services like South American bitcoin exchange Bitex.la and peer-to-peer bitcion trading platform BitQuick are paying more in transaction fees, and observers are pointing to the situation as the scenario for the bitcoin network.  ""We are paying more fees and the transactions are taking more time to deliver,"" Bitex chief marketing officer Manu Beaudroit told CoinDesk. ""For deposits it's taking up to one day and we are paying five [times] more of the [average] fee.""  At press time, data from 21.co indicates that users paying the standard wallet fee of 10 satoshis per byte would have to wait between five and 67 blocks for transactions to confirm, a process it estimates could take as many as 13 hours.  For more expedient transaction times, 21's service recommends a fee of 0.0023 BTC, or about 97 cents, a 2,200% increase from the default fee.  Service disruption  Talks with bitcoin wallet providers suggest that issues resulting from the current block capacity shortage are specific in nature.  BitQuick  CEO Jad Mubaslat said that his company is paying three to four times more than before for transaction fees, though the issues are related to receiving transactions rather than sending them due to the way that the firm computes fees.  ""More concerning is on the receiving side. We'll have sellers have to wait [more than] 12 hours just to get their transaction confirmed so their order will go live,"" he said.  Bram Celeen, founder of Netherlands-based bitcoin exchange Anycoin Direct, said that some users of the service have seen disrupted transactions that are incoming – typically a result of paying low fees.  ""It has affected our selling customers because a lot of customers who sell coins send a standard or low fee,"" he said. ""If they do this it takes a lot longer than usual for the transactions to get confirmed. Up to three days (with low fee transactions). Or the transaction even gets rejected.""  Celeen said that, because Anycoin sells bitcoins prior to any transaction confirmations, the exchange is at risk of taking a loss should that transaction be rejected.  Outgoing transactions, he added, have not had any issues.  Of note, however, is it seems mostly hosted wallets are having problems. Both BitGo and Ledger offer wallets with a dynamic fee option, meaning users are able to respond in real time to increasing demand for transaction capacity.  Ledger CEO Eric Larchevêque told CoinDesk:  ""Our users are not really affected by the current spam attack issue.""  The situation has so far pushed at least one merchant to publicly declare its intention to stop accepting bitcoin given the risk of having transactions get stuck.  Nottingham-based micropub The Barrel Drop said in a Reddit post that it won’t accept bitcoin payments ""while there is such a high probability that transactions will not confirm"".  The micropub indicated that it would resume taking bitcoin once the situation is resolved.  Network 'anomaly'  The bitcoin network has been on the receiving end of spam attacks during most of its history, including spam events last fall that were revealed to be the work of an entity called CoinWallet that claimed it was seeking to showcase capacity issues on the network.  Yet this week's occurrence appears to be of a different sort, involving a string of transactions with relatively high fees – something that appears to be pricing out users who are using hard-coded fees that, as a result, leaving them at a disadvantage.  Certain industry representatives interviewed were also split on whether to call the new transactions 'spam' due to the fact that identifying the nature of the activity is difficult.  Justus Ranvier, a contributor to the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, which aims to assess the privacy featured offered by bitcoin wallets, said the transactions could be coming from a badly designed exchange wallet or a malicious attack ""designed to sway the block size debate"", but that there is no way to tell definitively.  Avalon’s Yifu Guo told CoinDesk that he believes the effort may be an attempt to tumble coins – or obscure the transaction history of funds by mixing them repeatedly.  A video posted to YouTube further illustrates the activity, further supporting the idea that some individual or group is pushing up overall network fees through a stream of transactions.  However, he noted the fact that the transactions seemed to be using a ""poor and outdated"" method for tumbling coins that didn't seek to provide privacy.  ""The only thing it does on the network is increase load,"" he said.  Transaction backlog easing  Network data suggests that the congestion problems caused by the payment of low fees may be subsiding – possibly as a result of higher fees being paid by network participants.  According to TradeBlock, the size of the bitcoin network memory pool, which contains all the transactions awaiting inclusion in the next block, has shrunk from more than 50 MB on 1st March to roughly 19 MB at press time, constituting roughly 15,000 transactions totaling about 77,000 bitcoins.  Yet the incident raises the question of whether wallet software should be programmed to allow for dynamic fee adjustments.  BitGo software engineer Jameson Lopp told CoinDesk that if these kind of mechanisms were more common, fewer users might see stuck transactions – but that fees would likely rise as a result.  He said:  ""I suspect that if everyone was using dynamic fees, we wouldn't see as many complaints, but we'd see a larger spike in the fee market.""  Pete Rizzo co-authored this piece.

In a post on its website, Philips said that the lab follows six months of exploratory research, and that the goal of the effort is to unite the company's IT experts, healthcare professionals and blockchain developers to continue this progress.  Philips indicated that it is seeking collaborators and developers to conduct projects, offering a form on the website where users can subscribe to a newsletter or voice their interest in participating in future initiatives.  Notably, the company also hinted at to how it believes blockchain could be applied for healthcare use cases.  Arno Laeven, initiator and head of the Philips Blockchain Lab, said in a statement:  ""As a company committed to innovation you need to constantly explore new and emerging technologies and their application in areas where they might have an impact and added value. Our aim is to learn if blockchain technology could potentially add value to the process of data exchange in the healthcare industry.""  The announcement follows the October news that Philips had partnered with blockchain recordkeeping startup Tierion on an unspecified project that examined how the technology could be applied to use cases in healthcare.

42378636,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwfD,1457017858,BaFin: Blockchain Could Lead to 'New Standard' in Financial Markets,"Germany's top securities regulator published an internal journal last month with a cover story on the topic of blockchain tech, exploring its inner workings and offering early hints at how it views the emerging technology.  In a newly published English translation, the agency, known as the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, or BaFin, explored potential applications of distributed ledgers, including its use in cross-border payments, interbank transfers and the storage of trading data.  Though light on regulatory details, the publication suggests that BaFin sees a possible future in which the technology reshapes how some elements of the financial system function, though it posits that this outcome is far from certain.  The agency states:  ""The impact on the financial industry of increased or even full-scale deployment of DLT cannot be foreseen as of yet. However, it seems that it has the potential to establish a new standard in the financial market.""  BaFin argues that acknowledgement of the possible risks of applying the technology ""is more important than ever"", going on to echo other regulatory bodies worldwide by calling for greater oversight.  ""Adherence to regulations on anti-money laundering, governance and compliance as well as for clearing and settlement must also be ensured,"" the agency notes. ""The lack of a central authority on conduct and regulations could pose problems here in particular.""  The agency previously released guidance on bitcoin and digital currencies, referring to them as ""financial instruments in the form of units of account"" that do not have legal tender status.

""The country’s unique experience with FinTech, cyber and cryptography, has positioned Israel as a hotspot for blockchain innovation,"" Deloitte says.  The report provides an overview of blockchain technology and its use cases and introduces 38 young firms that it believes are ""leading the blockchain revolution"" in the Middle Eastern nation.  Each firm's blockchain focus and business model is profiled, along with information such as its managing executives, staff figures and funding to date.  A bridge to blockchain  The report comes at a time when Deloitte is become increasingly engaged in the global blockchain industry, and predicting that 2016 will be the year in which the technology will start ""making waves"".  As well as a number of reports and surveys on blockchain topics, the 'Big Four' professional services firm has announced several projects that have moved it into the blockchain space.  In October 2015, Tel Aviv-based 'coloured coins' startup Colu revealed it was embarking on a partnership with Deloitte.  The company itself has also set up its own blockchain project to move it further into the industry. Called Rubix, the service is described as a ""one-stop blockchain software platform"", aimed to help mainstream financial institutions launch pilots and proofs-of-concept with the emerging technology.

42378639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwkF,1456967337,40 Banks Trial Commercial Paper Trading in Latest R3 Blockchain Test,"A consortium of financial institutions led by startup R3CEV has completed a trial of five different blockchain solutions.  The blockchain concepts tests were presented by Eris Industries, Ethereum, IBM, Intel and Chain, according to reports by Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. Preparations began early last month, culminating with the test during the last two weeks of February.  Forty banks took part, drawn from the collection of banks that have thrown their support behind the R3-led consortium. A number of those banks have launched trials of their own in addition to the work conducted as part of R3. Cloud infrastructure was reportedly provided by Amazon, Microsoft and IBM.  The test comes in the wake of a smaller trial conducted in January. Eleven banks took part in that test, leveraging the Microsoft Azure blockchain-as-a-service platform to use a version of the Ethereum network. Future tests are expected to take place with the involvement of government regulators.  Eris Industries COO Preston Byrne told CoinDesk that one element of the most recent test was the use of a blockchain network to facilitate the exchange of debt instruments.  ""[Participants] modeled a financial asset, commercial paper, a short-term debt instrument. You can create it, you can buy and sell it and you can redeem it. It's a short life cycle for that instrument,” he said, adding:  ""We were asked to model a series of smart contracts that were a template for commercial paper transactions.""  Chain CEO Adam Ludwin told CoinDesk that his startup worked closely with the member banks to leverage its development sandbox for the offering, and that it ended up with an end-product he described as ""involved and extensive"".  ""We gave all 40 banks a separate node which formed a network for this use case, and each node had an application for a user interface and login and web browser to issue, trade, transfer and redeem commercial paper,"" he explained.  Ludwin suggested that banks were likely to evaluate the technologies provided by participants, with those with the most strategic interest in the proof-of-concept perhaps deciding to take it further.  According to The Wall Street Journal, the goal of the test was to give those banks an opportunity to compare and contrast different blockchain offerings on the market today.  ""It’s not clear there’s a well-defined playbook in how to evaluate these technologies side by side. We want to help bring that clarity,"" R3 managing editor Tim Grant told the publication.
