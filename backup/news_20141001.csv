42426094,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiath,1412199043,8 US Politicians to Receive Bitcoin By Mail This Week,"A carefully selected group of US Congress members will soon receive bitcoin donations in the mail. For some, it will likely be the first time they come into direct contact with digital currency.  Led by a Washington, DC-based political action committee (PAC) focused on bitcoin policy called BitPAC, the initiative will distribute $250 worth of bitcoin in paper wallets to eight members of Congress, including Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Rand Paul (R-KY) and Paul Ryan (R-WI).  Additional politicians who will receive the donations include Ron Wyden (D-OR); Ted Cruz (R-TX); Jeb Hensarling (R-TX); Maxine Waters (D-CA); and Jared Polis (D-CO).  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitPAC founder Dan Backer said that he expects the initiative to have an impact on Capitol Hill, which he believes must become familiar with decentralized money.  In May, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) offered more direction, issuing a report advising that political campaigns and action committees could accept bitcoin donations.  Yet, Backer said that the FEC needs to do more:  ""The FEC’s guidance [only] created a safe harbor of permissible activity.""  Backer told CoinDesk that the donations are in the mail, and will be delivered sometime this week.  In-kind donations  BitPAC’s funding comes from an assortment of donors, many whom want to put pressure on US policymakers to make concrete decisions regarding bitcoin and broader campaign finance law.  An attorney, Backer represented the Conservative Action Fund as it sought clarity as to whether political campaigns could accept bitcoin for fundraising. The formal request led to a November 2013 FEC hearing that concluded with guidance that bitcoin should be treated as an in-kind donation.  Backer believes his BitPAC donations represent a pivotal step toward US politicians realizing the value of bitcoin as a tool for political fundraising, though the process by which this occurs may be unorthodox.  Backer told CoinDesk:  “I think whomever on their staff gets [the paper wallet] will scratch their head. It’ll go up the ladder, someone will call the FEC which will be of no help, and someone will decide that money is money and they will accept and liquidate the transaction.”  As such, Backer and his group chose to issue paper bitcoin wallets to the politicians. Paper wallets hold the public and private keys to bitcoin represented on the technology's block chain, or general ledger.  Backer told CoinDesk:  “For these first ‘baby steps’, we think paper is the easier way to go.""  Reportable donations  Backer said that the $250 amount was chosen because it's above the $200.01 threshold reportable by a recipient as an itemized donation.  Federal Campaign Finance Laws  read:  “Candidates must identify, for example, all PACs and party committees that give them contributions, and they must identify individuals who give them more than $200 in an election cycle.”  Given the history of price volatility in bitcoin, $250 measured in today's BTC value provides enough of a cushion to meet that requirement once these donations are reported as in-kind.  Pressuring the FEC  BitPAC’s aim right now is to focus on clarifying election laws that may relate to bitcoin. This is why the group has targeted both Republicans and Democrats, and members of the government's two legislative bodies, the House of Republicans and US Senate.  The donations are meant to entice members of Congress to pressure the FEC, as BitPAC wants the FEC to provide more guidance to solidify the digital currency's use in political fundraising.  “Certainly it keeps the issue at the forefront as the FEC considers this,” said Backer.  He told CoinDesk that while some of the selected members of Congress have never had to deal with bitcoin, they're unlikely to turn down a campaign donation.

42426101,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIib3h,1412195417,Ex-VeriFone Exec: Bitcoin Isn't Just Another Crazy Payments Idea,"However, perhaps more crucially, former VeriFone CFO, current Tanjarine president and new BitFury board member Bob Dykes believes that the payments industry is struggling to separate bitcoin from the scores of new payments technologies that have emerged in the last decade.  Dykes chooses to view bitcoin and its road to mainstream adoption through this lens, noting that the payments industry has seen the rise and fall of a number of technologies – including QR codes and near-field communication (NFC) – that have promised to bring disruption and change overnight, only to be met with a long road to adoption or a cold shoulder by the industry.  As a result, Dykes told CoinDesk, the traditional payments industry is struggling to see how bitcoin will be able to gain wider adoption:  ""If you go back three-to-four years, there were lots of companies cropping up with what people in the payments industry were thinking were a bunch of crazy ideas and they got big for a while, but I think you're going to see them fade, because they weren't a very good idea in the first place. When it comes to bitcoin, I think it's a bit different. It has legs because it's a fundamentally more efficient way of having a transaction.""  Dykes indicated that his ability to recognize this potential lead him to join the team at bitcoin mining services giant BitFury, which raised $20m in May from VC firms like Crypto Currency Partners and angel investor Bill Tai. BitFury manufactures mining hardware and computer chips, and recently completed a 20MW data center in the European country of Georgia.  Citing the company's impressive data centre presence and ability to provide low-cost transaction processing through its mining infrastructure, Dykes added:  ""If you're going to ride a horse in the bitcoin space, BitFury is the best horse to ride.""  Profit potential for payments space  Notably, Dykes suggested that one reason the traditional payments industry has been slow to react to bitcoin is that its businesses see bitcoin as a threat to their cost and profit structures.  [post-quote]  His former employer VeriFone, for example, earned $436.1m in net revenue during Q1 2014 through products such as multimedia point-of-sale devices, mobile wallets and payment processing, all offerings that bitcoin aims to improve or replace.  However, Dykes said that over time, the opinion of his former industry will change because bitcoin will offer new ways for these companies to cut costs and generate revenue through their existing services.  Core to this belief is Dykes' assertion that the bitcoin industry is already generating significant revenue, a factor that provides a crucial advantage over past payments technologies:  ""It's not like an industry that's going to require massive funding, this is a place where you can make a lot of money already.""  Dykes said that this could prove to be an advantage to bitcoin that helps propel adoption faster than other types of payment technologies.  Behind-the-scenes revolution  Despite his bullish beliefs about bitcoin's long-term prospects, Dykes suggested that the payment industry isn't likely to embrace bitcoin anytime soon, simply due to its historical resistance to technology.  Dykes told CoinDesk:  ""The payment industry is an enormous industry and it moves slowly – look at EMV and chip cards in the US for example. Nothing is going to move very fast even though we have a lot of new entrants, but it's got to move at a steady rate and in places where bitcoin has a fundamental advantage.""  Dykes mentioned cross-border and e-commerce payments as two areas where bitcoin could gain a strong foothold. Elsewhere, he sees the technology becoming more widely used in the background, with established payments giants using bitcoin behind existing services.  ""You're going to have bitcoin sitting behind a card with a logo on that card, and then [that brand] making a bitcoin wallet and bringing attention to it, so it will create some efficiency in the industry but it's not going to be a major change,"" he explained.  Bitcoin is at critical mass  Unlike many of his peers, Dykes said that he believes bitcoin has already reached a ""critical mass"" in the market, though he suggested that his definition may be different from other observers.  For example, he mentioned bitcoin processors and bitcoin debit card providers that are building on bitcoin's core infrastructure as evidence of this assertion, saying:  ""It has reached a point where regular people can use bitcoin at every merchant that takes a major credit card. Infrastructure pieces are in place, and now it's just a matter of growing these activities.""  Still, he cautioned that bitcoin enthusiasts should temper their expectations even in light of his high praise for the industry.  Taking a long-term outlook, Dykes concluded:  ""The payments space is truly enormous and even with really high growth, it's still going to be a very small portion of the payments space. There's no expectation that the whole industry is going to be overturned in the next few years.""

42426096,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiaxh,1412187386,Butterfly Labs Seeks Government Approval to Reopen Business,"Attorneys for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Butterfly Labs are allegedly holding talks that could lead to a possible reopening of the troubled bitcoin mining business.  The conversation, while still in its early stages, may allow Butterfly Labs to exit its previously announced court-ordered shutdown, The Kansas City Star reported.  Butterfly Labs was placed in temporary receivership by a US judge last week, a condition that was extended during a hearing on Monday when prosecutors made the case that both the company and its employees effectively profited at the expense of customers.  US District Judge Brian Wimes asked at the time if both sides could potentially agree to what he called a “business plan”. The media outlet suggested that both parties were reportedly enthusiastic about the idea, and discussions have been ongoing since the end of that hearing.  Jim Humphrey, an attorney defending Butterfly Labs, said that he was unable to comment at the time but voiced positivity about the future viability of the company.  Humphrey told the Star:  “I’m unable to comment on ongoing negotiations, but the parties continue to work together. We remain optimistic that we will be able to serve our customers again soon.”  Case continues to evolve  The discussions follow allegations levied by the federal regulator that Butterfly Labs defrauded customers and failed to deliver mining devices as promised. Further, the action by the agency, which polices anticompetitive or deceptive business practices, follows months of complaints against the company.  Documents released  prior to Monday’s hearing allege that the company used equipment built for customers to mine bitcoins for extended periods prior to shipment.  Details about an inaccurate online mining profitability calculator and evidence that Butterfly Labs employees created paraphernalia that mocked customer complaints were also divulged in the documents.  Customer recourse  At this time, it remains unclear whether Butterfly Labs will reopen completely or partially under court control. Yet, the idea does represent a potential avenue for providing recourse to customers that together lost millions in both investment costs and future profitability as a result of not receiving equipment.  There are also questions about if and when customer refunds will be processed. As previously explained by FTC attorney Leah Frazier in an interview with CoinDesk, any refunds that were being issued were frozen as a result of last week's court decision.  She remarked at the time:  “The accounts are frozen right now and the receiver is in control of the business. So, we can’t make any predictions on an ongoing basis as to the status of the refunds. A lot of that will hinge on the court’s decision.”  The order extended on Monday continues the asset freeze placed on Butterfly Labs. However, should the company resume operations, there could be provisions put in place mandating that some or all revenue be directed toward customer refunds.

42426105,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIib7h,1412180833,Georgia Tech Integrates Bitcoin into Student Payment Cards,"The Georgia Institute of Technology has become the first university to integrate bitcoin into its students' dining and shopping experience.  Campus payment cards, known as BuzzCards, can now be topped up with the digital currency at the university's BuzzCard Centre, located inside its bookstore.  BuzzCards can be used at more than 200 locations on campus, allowing students to pay for meals, parking, recreational facilities and tickets for various sporting events using bitcoin. Georgia Tech also features 10 BuzzCard ATMs where students can withdraw hard cash.  Former students and current bitcoin executives Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair will handle payment processing for the institute via their company BitPay.  Home turf  The university's Bobby Dodd Stadium is another key venue in the rollout. The stadium already sports a bitcoin logo, courtesy of a BitPay partnership with the Georgia Tech Athletic Association announced last July.  Now, using any bitcoin wallet, Georgia Tech sports fans can pay for drinks and snacks at two point-of-sale devices in its student area.  Students are, however, likely to use Georgia Tech's own ‘Jacket Wallet’ at the checkout. Unveiled last week, the custom implementation of Pheeva's bitcoin wallet is only available to users with a campus email address.  As a 'gamified' concept, the wallet rewards users based on how they promote its in-built social network, the COG Cooperative.  Innovation and expansion  BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi said BitPay was proud to offer an innovative bitcoin payment system to the university and its students.  Georgia Tech's athletic director Mike Bobinski said:  “At Georgia Tech, we are always looking to lead in innovative ways, and this partnership with BitPay gives us an opportunity to do so by integrating this new technology at a sports venue and in the daily lives of our students.”  Bobinski said Georgia Tech is looking forward to working with BitPay to make bitcoin a viable payment option for students and sports fans.  Georgia Tech is currently ranked as one of the top 10 public universities in the US, with more than 100 centres focused on interdisciplinary research. More than 21,000 tech-savvy students attend the university and soon they will all have access to bitcoin.    In addition, Stephanie Wargo, vice president of marketing at BitPay, revealed the company has ambitions to take the programme further afield:      ""We see the student market as a huge potential as these millennials are the executives of the future. They have grown up with technology and are quick to embrace new ideas, like bitcoin.""            Around the world  Although Georgia Tech may be the first university to fully integrate bitcoin in its student payment system, a number of campuses are currently experimenting with the currency.  The University of Nicosia in Cyprus started accepting bitcoin payments for tuitions and fees last December. It now offers courses on the digital currency along with a number of US universities, including New York University and Duke University.  On campuses where the formal university leadership has yet to embrace bitcoin, students groups are looking to start these conversations.  For example, earlier this year the MIT Bitcoin Club announced plans to distribute $100 in BTC to each student on campus. Several bitcoin-related apps developed by students were also awarded £15,000 in cash prizes at a MIT Bitcoin Project competition last month.

42426108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIibFh,1412173859,DigitalTangible Expands Crypto 2.0 Gold Trading Platform to Asia,"Gold-to-bitcoin trading platform DigitalTangible is expanding to Asia through partnership with Hong Kong-based exchange Melotic.  The company is framing the move as a way of allowing customers to trade gold assets via Melotic’s simple interface at lower costs than are normally associated with bullion exchanges.  DigitalTangible  allows investors to move value from physical gold holdings to bitcoin, which can then be stored or traded. The firm says its Proof of Custody global gold accounting ledger lowers investment and portfolio management costs for customers.  In the last year, China has become a important centre for some segments of the bitcoin industry, most particularly mining and trading.  Founder and CEO Taariq Lewis said expanding to Asia was a response to a growing need in the region:  “We are responding to the immense Asia and US demand for Asia-based physical gold linked to the bitcoin block chain. We are also expanding our dealer and vaulting with new gold dealers and vault partners in Asia.”  Figures from World Gold Council suggest China has become the world's number one producer of gold in recent years, and last year became the biggest consumer. Asia in general accounted for 63% of total consumption of gold jewelry, bars and coins last year, up from 57% in 2010, the council has said.  Gold on the block chain  The partnership with Melotic will extend new opportunities to DigitalTangible customers, allowing bitcoin buyers access to altcoin markets and gold buyers the ability to trade asset tokens with others.  DigitalTangible says customers trading on Melotic will pay transactions fees no higher than 0.25%, although the latter company's website indicates rates may be as low as 0.1%.  “DigitalTangible is the only service that links real physical commodities to a block chain, stores it in provable custody through its gold partnerships, and also enables customers to take delivery of the goods,"" said Melotic’s CEO and Founder Jack Wang, adding:  ""They have effectively put gold into the bitcoin block chain, which allows customers from all over the world to invest and trade in assets in a way that was previously impossible.""  Melotic  provides a platform for the exchange of digital assets for bitcoin and gold. Users can trade with altcoins such as dogecoin, litecon and stellar, as well as appcoins like ltbcoin and storjcoin.  According to Lewis, DigitalTangible has taken over $210,000 in total gold sales since its July launch. Additionally, its peer-to-peer trading platform completed $35,000 in transactions in just one week.  He added that with the continuing decline in the price of bitcoin, the company stands to see increased business as ""bitcoin holders take refuge in gold's relative stability"".  Bitcoin-to-gold trading platforms are offered by several other companies, including Singapore-based Bullionstars and Bullion Bitcoin in the UK.

Dublin’s first bitcoin pub has removed its bitcoin ATM and stopped accepting payments in the digital currency, citing legal issues.  Earlier this year, The Baggot Inn became the first pub in Ireland's capital to accept bitcoin, announcing its first transaction via Twitter back in March.

However, according to the machine's co-owner Ronan Lynch it was removed following a change in management.  Although The Baggot Inn's previous owners were keen to install the machine and accept bitcoin payments, its new owners do not want to be associated with the digital currency, he said.  Legal status  The Baggot Inn issued a statement explaining its decision to suspend its bitcoin services:  “We regret to announce, but due to ongoing issues regarding the legality of bitcoin ATMs in the Republic of Ireland we can no longer accept bitcoin payments.”  However, Lynch was keen to dismiss this. ""There is no legal issue or question surrounding Bitcoin in Ireland. In fact, Arthur Cox, the most prominent law firm in Ireland, published a report on the matter over the summer,” he told CoinDesk.  CoinDesk contacted the venue for further comment but no response had been received at press time. The bitcoin section of the pub’s website is still live, but the main page states: “Unfortunately we can no longer accept bitcoin payments.”  Although other establishments in Ireland have started accepting bitcoin, as far as active ATMs go, the country is now down to one – a Skyhook machine operated by BitEx.ie, installed at computing retailer GSM Solutions on Abbey Street, Dublin.  Lynch said he is still looking for a new location for his Robocoin machine.  ATM woes commonplace  New Zealand’s Bitcoin Central was forced to shut its doors late July, after local banks refused to provide financial services to the company. Bitcoin Central had launched its first Robocoin ATM just a month prior on 3rd June.  A planned rollout of Robocoin machines in Taiwan was derailed after the local regulator said it would block the installation of bitcoin ATMs.  Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) cited a joint statement it made in partnership with the country’s central bank, which stated that bitcoin is not a currency and that no bank deposits are allowed in bitcoin.  Installing a bitcoin ATM would require FSC approval and the regulator made it clear that approval would not be granted.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/01/irish-pub-abandons-bitcoin-cites-legal-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d7bd5e1394761b9a0e61f04df05c087da73f75b-1387x797.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
