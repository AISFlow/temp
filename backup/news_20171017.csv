Alastria, formerly known as Red Lyra, was unveiled in May with the backing of several notable Spanish banks, including Banco Sabadell, Banco Santander and BBVA, as well as a group of law firms and corporations.  That effort has gathered steam in recent months, according to a new announcement. Some of the new members include utilities firm Gas Natural Fenosa, telecom provider MásMóvil, Japanese IT firm Fujitsu and several public universities within Spain. In statements, the consortium emphasized the inclusion of regional academic institutions, stating that they will ""play an important role"" as the project moves ahead.  Alastria’s  aim is to facilitate data sharing between different companies, with the platform being described as a ""national multi-sector network.""  The idea is that Alastria will serve as a common hub between businesses in Spain hoping to utilize the blockchain network, which as previously announced will support smart contracts and digital identity tools.  ""We should be proud that a pioneering and unprecedented project throughout the world has been born in Spain, which places the industries of our country at the forefront of digital transformation,"" Julio Faura, president of Alastria and head of R&D for Banco Santander, said in a statement.

42400524,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuSA,1508274051,Broadridge Pilots Blockchain for Repo Trades With French Banks,"Broadridge Financial Solutions has completed a blockchain pilot with two French banks aimed at recording the details of bilateral repurchase, or repo, agreements.  The U.S.-based investor services firm worked with Natixis and Societe Generale on the pilot, which Broadridge said had demonstrated a distributed ledger's benefits for this kind of transaction. Specifically, those benefits include less manual intervention, reduced risk, greater transparency and faster processing, Broadridge said.  ""Within the bilateral repo market, blockchain has shown that it can play an instrumental role in reducing operational cost and complexity,"" Vijay Mayadas, president of global fixed income and analytics at Broadridge, said in a statement.  The company said that a private blockchain was used, based on the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 codebase.  Repos are a form of secured short-term financing in which the borrower, typically a brokerage firm, sells securities (usually government bonds) to an investors and agrees to buy them back at a specified date and price. In bilateral repos, the parties are responsible for settling the transaction, rather than relying on a central counterparty.  While that may sound arcane, the market for repos is a significant one, with a notional amount outstanding of $2.3 trillion, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. And Broadridge indicated it plans to do more with the technology in this area.  The trial's success ""lays the foundation for the development of broader collateral management solutions on blockchain,"" said Jerry Friedhoff, head of Broadridge’s securities finance and collateral management group.  Broadridge has been actively testing out other use cases for blockchains in financial markets.  Earlier this year, the company took part in a blockchain pilot focused on proxy voting, in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, Northern Trust and Banco Santander. That test used a private version of ethereum as a basis.

The financial services firm's new report, ""Cryptocurrencies – Beneath the bubble,"" dives into both cryptocurrencies and wider applications of blockchain in the enterprise space. It notably declares that, in the view of UBS analysts, ""the sharp rise in crypto-currency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble.""  Yet on the broader question of ""investing in the blockchain wave,"" as articulated by the report's authors, UBS highlights the kinds of companies that would enable adoption as well as those that might be on the forefront of actually using blockchain in a meaningful way.  As the reporthttps://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/follow_ubs/ubs-economic-insights/paul_donovan/2017/10/16/cryptocurrencies-beneath-the-bubble.html states:  ""... investors seeking long-term opportunities from blockchain technology can start to position in two broad groups: technology enablers – in software, semiconductors, and platforms; and early [and] successful adopters – in finance, manufacturing, healthcare, utilities, and the sharing economy.""  In particular, the paper posits that hardware companies – including those manufacturing application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, that are used by bitcoin miners – would potentially see an increase in business if they're building and shipping products to be used as part of future blockchain networks.  ""Encryption of blockchain networks requires additional processing speed, benefiting companies exposed to semiconductors like application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) central processing units (CPUs), application processors, and graphics processing units (GPUs),"" the report notes.  The paper also notably suggests that investors trying to gain early exposure should steer clear of companies that ""fail to invest"" in the tech, as well as those ""most exposed to significant disruption risks.""

Bitcoin accessibility is a problem: One of the biggest problems with digital currencies is that they are not that accessible, which makes it very difficult for new users to obtain any, or even know where to begin.

42400536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJugv,1508265641,Web Creator Tim Berners-Lee: Blockchain Builders Should Beware Misuse,"""Be careful. Think.""  Said by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, best known for inventing the World Wide Web, this statement of caution cut to the heart of his whirlwind talk at Ripple's Swell conference in Toronto today.  During the keynote, Berners-Lee recounted his time creating the web, leaving attendees with takeaways for the blockchain industry. Citing recent controversies surrounding Facebook, he went so far as to discuss how some of the same technologies he created have been leveraged in unintended ways, such as by political organizations in efforts to sway elections.  ""The message here is that in these things we build [on the web], there is a time for creativity; there is a time for consortia working together; and there is a time of consequences,"" he said.  Berners-Lee told the audience:  ""And we have to think about the consequences.""  Elsewhere, Berners-Lee hinted at what he sees as the vision for a world powered by blockchains, noting how he foresees banks in different countries using the technology to enable safer transactions.  But still, he returned to the idea entrepreneurs interested in creating these applications must think about the future and how that technology could affect humanity and the economy.  ""Great things could come of it,"" he said. ""But maybe you'll end up producing huge waves of crime.""  It's an interesting forewarning given the associations between cryptocurrencies and illicit activity, such as the drug trade and money laundering. But he suggested the admonition should be heeded by those building private blockchain projects, as well.  Overall, the message was clear – we can never quite tell how technology will be used.  Work to be done  Of course, Berners-Lee also noted the work he is helping spearhead toward this goal.  Berners-Lee, who is now director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), develops standards in an effort to keep the internet open and neutral, and already, there is work going on inside the W3C on blockchain.  Ripple, through its hand in the Interledger Protocol, for instance, is part of the W3C's Web Payments Working Group, and there are other API initiatives being developed with the technology in mind.  But according to Berners-Lee, neither blockchain or standards that support them are magic bullets that will solve all the world's problems, especially the hackers, prying eyes and government spying that have hindered experiences on the web.  ""Moving everything to blockchain and Tor will give us a false sense of security,"" he said.  Instead, Berners-Lee advised advocates to engage in constructive discussions with governments, regulators and companies, and to even encourages protests, if warranted.  He concluded:  ""Make banners and signs and protest in the streets; we had to then, we'll have to again.""

According to RttNews, central bank president Ilan Goldfajn was dismissive of recent price appreciation in the bitcoin market. And while he said it was key to ""separate"" bitcoin from other applications of its underlying technology, Goldfajn said that those buying cryptocurrencies are chasing the same kind of returns as those who invest in pyramid scams.  He was quoted as saying:  ""The bitcoin is a financial asset with no ballast that people buy because they believe it will appreciate. That is a typical bubble or pyramid [scheme].""  In a pyramid scheme, organizers solicit investors who are then encouraged to find new buyers themselves, thereby creating a revenue stream based on new investments rather than the underlying product itself.  The president continued by confirming that the Banco Central do Brazil ""is not interested in bubbles or illicit payments"" and that such activities are ""not something the central bank would like to encourage."" The stance is notable given that legislators in Brazil are currently working on rules for cryptocurrency activity in the country.

A publication released today by LabCFTC, a fintech initiative within the US regulator, covers the basics of the technology as well as a number of use cases. However, it also highlights the CFTC's existing regulatory posture toward cryptocurrencies – back in 2015, the agency said that it would classify bitcoin and other cryptographic assets as commodities.  Notably, the document includes comments on recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statements around ICOs. In July, the agency said that blockchain-based tokens sold through the funding model could fall under the federal definition of a security, thus triggering a host of regulatory implications.  In the LabCFTC release, the agency threw its support behind that determination.  ""There is no inconsistency between the SEC’s analysis and the CFTC's determination that virtual currencies are commodities and that virtual tokens may be commodities or derivatives contracts depending on the particular facts and circumstances,"" the agency wrote, adding:  ""The CFTC looks beyond form and considers the actual substance and purpose of an activity when applying the federal commodities laws and CFTC regulations.""  Echoing other releases from US agencies, the CFTC document closes with a section on the risks for investors, including a warning about performing due diligence before engaging with an exchange.  ""Conduct extensive research before giving any money or personal information to a virtual currency platform,"" the report states.

42400531,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuc0,1508245216,JPMorgan Integrates Zcash Privacy Tech Into Quorum Blockchain,"Now you see it, now you don't.  The development firm behind the privacy-focused public blockchain zcash has announced the first integration of its zero-knowledge security layer (ZSL) into an enterprise blockchain, with JPMorgan today revealing it has added the functionality to its Quorum blockchain.  Derived from zcash's zk-snarks technology, the code now integrated into Quorum obscures all identifiable information about a transaction – including the user's public key and the amount transacted – while promising to also give accountants the ability to audit those transactions.  Zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox told CoinDesk:  ""What we have now done through our partnership with JPMorgan is use zcash technology previously pioneered in the open zcash cryptocurrency to create protected and auditable transfer of token ownership on the JPMorgan blockchain.""  To complete the project, JPMorgan partnered with Zcash Company (the firm that manages the open-source development of zcash) in May of this year and tapped into support from Microsoft.  ""Today's announcement is a prime example of how big banks and fintechs can work side-by-side to build groundbreaking technology for the financial markets,"" Umar Farooq, head of blockchain initiatives for JPMorgan, said in a statement.  Auditable assets  Crucially, however, the integration doesn't have a so-called ""god key"" that would give some trusted authority the ability to go in and make changes after the fact.  Rather, Quorum's private smart contract language, called Constellation, would require that when building a financial product that doesn't require a centralized authority, the creator include the public key to all relevant regulators, giving them the necessary access to ensure compliance.  While the proof of a transaction's underlying value can take 40 seconds, according to a senior JPMorgan exec with knowledge of the project, that process only occurs at the very last step of a smart contract workflow.  If the merging of the two technologies ends up doing what the developers claim, the results could be an entirely new ecosystem of financial products developed without the need of a central authority. As an example, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation could be removed from secondary trading.  ""There's been extensive investment in research and proofs-of-concept for blockchain in enterprise over the last several years, and very little of it has reached enterprise value yet,"" Wilcox said, adding:  ""One of the major blockers that has been preventing larger adoption is the privacy problem, and we have a live solution to that privacy problem for the first time.""  Beyond zcash  But while this is the first implementation of ZSL in an enterprise blockchain, it may not be the last.  As part of the announcement, JPMorgan and the Zcash Company jointly expressed plans to continue working together with other enterprises building blockchain technology. Further, variations of the ZSL integration could someday include different parameters to define the proofs.  In the initial implementation, those parameters came directly from zcash (which has a market cap of $559 million as of press time), but the JPMorgan source said they could be modified to accommodate other concerns in the future.  Also revealed, as part of an expansion effort to attract new talent, ZSL is scheduled to be released as open-source software at a future date. In this way, individuals and other organizations will be able to experiment and test new applications of the code.

There is too many of them, and one of the most prominent ones when it comes to cryptocurrency refers to Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of gold. Nevertheless, when the price of this so called ‘digital gold’ quadruples that of its physical equivalent per unit – if a troy ounce could ever be equated to 1BTC – then it is time to call the cliché into question. The truth is that gold prices cannot keep up with gold because the comparison is profoundly flawed.When we Equate Bitcoin to Gold, we can Explain it to a Broader AudienceThere is no doubt that both assets bear some resemblance. That is enough to create a cliché and then use it to explain a complex digital asset to a broader audience. The following are some of the characteristics that gold and bitcoin share. These are the characteristics upon which the cliché was built: Both assets are scarce. Some of their value derives from scarcity. Gold was the earliest for of a globally accepted medium of exchange, as much as bitcoin is the first globally accepted medium of exchange that is internet-based. Neither are issued by a central bank. Extraction of both requires mining, albeit bitcoin mining is a radically different procedure. Even if mining for gold and mining for bitcoin are fundamentally different activities, they both require sizeable amounts of energy, and both become more difficult as the resource becomes scarcer and/or its price increases. Mining on both progressed from an ‘artisanal’ phase into one controlled by several large corporations. Economies based on either asset are by default deflationary in nature. Both can be used to hedge against an economic downturn like the 2008-09 collapse. However, Bitcoin and Gold Should not be Compared!There might be more similarities between both assets, but as we run out of similarities to write on that list, we start stumbling upon the differences between them. The following is a brief list of different features that put gold and Bitcoin in radically different categories: Storing, transacting and transporting gold is cumbersome while doing the same with bitcoin is extremely practical. The scarcity of bitcoin is known – 21 million coins – whereas the scarcity of gold is unknown – estimates vary between 155,000 tonnes and 2.5 million tonnes. Given that we know how many coins there will be, miner rewards are also known and fixed according to an algorithm. With gold there might be a sudden discovery that can throw prices off. Mining on asteroids or on other planets, could dramatically increase the supply of gold. Bitcoin’s supply cannot be changed. Gold can be controlled by governments and its markets often are, whereas Bitcoin cannot be controlled by governments. Various industrial processes require the use of gold – the production of electronics is a good example. No economic process requires Bitcoin – besides hedging against the economic policies of governments and monetary policies of central banks. Bitcoin is digital, and it relies on an innovative technology to operate. This technology has the potential to revolutionize accounting, as well as many other fields of knowledge. Gold is physical and is a chemical element which can be used in a variety of forms, but is not revolutionary. Gold Can’t Fill Bitcoin’s ShoesThe differences between these 2 assets make them ultimately incomparable. Moreover, the differences between gold and Bitcoin debunk the ‘digital gold’ cliché, and leave us with a situation in which we can conclude that gold can’t fill bitcoin’s shoes. Apart from industrial usage, the arguments in favor of using bitcoin instead of gold are all arguably superior. Hedging with gold forces the investor to trust multiple parties, given how difficult it is to transact with, transport and store gold. The gold game exposes the investor to a myriad of risks, including the nationalization of their wealth. Bitcoin is completely trust-less and governments would find it extremely difficult to take away from its owners.Now that markets are catching up to this reality, it is not difficult to see why gold prices can’t keep up with those of bitcoin. The troy ounce of gold could well be bound to trail the price of a single coin from now on. Eventually Bitcoin could become as universally acceptable as gold even if it is not as culturally significant. Nevertheless, if any investor is looking for an asset that can keep them safe while competing with gains in other traditional markets, then Bitcoin should be their choice. Ultimately, gold has shown it can’t keep up with traditional markets, let alone Bitcoin prices.

42400554,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuhu,1508241604,Top Secret? Microsoft Opens Door to Government Blockchain Use,"The U.S. government's most sensitive data could soon be secured on a blockchain.  Revealed today at Microsoft's Government Cloud Forum 2017 in Washington D.C., the tech giant is launching Azure Government Secret – a service designed to provide government agencies better access to cloud computing. In doing so, however, Microsoft is notably opening the door to its blockchain offering – along with the new service, it is also allowing its existing Government Cloud clients access to the Microsoft Azure blockchain-as-a-service suite.  Launched in 2015 as a way for private firms to experiment with blockchain tools, Microsoft Azure's offering now hosts technology offerings from partner providers including Chain, ConsenSys and Emercoin in a sandbox environment. But while private sector users of Microsoft's cloud services have been able to build with those tools for years, the stringent security requirements of the U.S. government have previously prevented these agencies from utilizing such products.  Specifically, six of Microsoft's data centers have now been ""isolated"" and given provisional ""Level 5"" Department of Defense authorization. Further, a number of certifications have been accommodated, including for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).  According to Microsoft Azure's chief technical officer Mark Russinovich: ""The U.S. government requires those data facilities to be operated by U.S. citizens with special clearance, and so the contractor we use meets that.""  Because of all this, Azure Government Secret will offer advanced analytics and more advanced ""detection"" abilities to clients who use ""secret classified data,"" according to a statement.  With all this, Russinovich heralded the project as a new way for governments to take advantage of blockchain's efficiencies and for taxpayers to hold their governments accountable.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Russinovich said:  ""Blockchain makes it much harder for fraud and waste to exist, makes it much more visible if it does exist and potentially gets rid of a lot of layers of bureaucracy that are designed simply to ensure that waste and fraud [don't] exist.""  Waste reduction  There's no doubt that waste reduction is needed in the workings of the U.S. government.  Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published a reporthttps://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/676473.pdf on ""Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication,"" citing 544 instances of waste totaling billions of dollars in the executive branch and Congress alone.  And it seems some agencies are interested in finding a solution. For instance, just last week the U.S. State Department (which is a Microsoft customer) cited blockchain as a possible way to reduce inefficiencies.  While government waste can be as diverse as unspent resources or multiple taxpayer-funded projects tackling the same issues, Russinovich gave an especially pertinent example with several areas of the U.S. recently ravaged by hurricanes.  ""When Congress approves a large package for disaster relief, which is obviously top of mind for a lot of people these days, there's a lot of organizations that are processing funds, purchasing relief goods and transporting them,"" Russinovich said, explaining:  ""And there's potential for fraud and waste there that blockchain's transparency and reconciliation process will eliminate.""  More to come  While the Government Secret platform announced today is so far limited only to U.S. government agencies, Microsoft's Government Cloud clients include 7,000 agencies and 10 million employees all around the world.  Russinovich was unable to confirm whether or not any U.S. government agencies were already using the new services, but officials from Health and Human Services and the U.S. Veteran's Affairs Department will be speaking on stage at the event about the project.  And with other U.S. government clients including branches of the Federal government, the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, Russinovich expects a number of new government blockchain applications to be forthcoming.  Russinovich said:  ""In our work with government agencies, we've seen a huge interest in blockchain.""

42400526,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuZ3,1508239858,Downplaying 'Digital Assets': Blockchain Reigns at Ripple's Swell Event,"At Ripple's inaugural conference, it was all about the use case.  On day one of its much-anticipated Swell event in Toronto yesterday, panels largely centered on the distributed ledger company's existing clients and proofs-of-concept. There, representatives from Banco Santander and Siam Commercial Bank talked about how Ripple – and its XRP cryptocurrency – has provided a beneficial rail for cross-border payments.  Yet, the event was largely pessimistic about the value proposition of other cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin and ether).  Not only did former Federal Reserve chairman Dr. Ben Bernanke (who led the U.S. central bank during the 2008 financial crisis) question whether bitcoin would be successful, but many of Swell's panelists made it clear that just by speaking about blockchain technology, they were not promoting bitcoin and other ""unregulated"" cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrency's ""promise was to replace credit cards and banks and that's been an abysmal failure,"" said Patrick Griffin, senior vice president of business development at Ripple.  He told the audience:  ""Retail payments is nowhere. Every company that went out to do that, they've all pivoted. No one has doubled down on the merchant acquirer business.""  Instead, Griffin continued, XRP is the only enterprise-grade option for banks and other mature financial institutions.  To be fair, XRP wasn't pumped quite so hard until the last panel discussion, when Griffin got on stage with Marwan Forzley, CEO and co-founder of cross-border business-to-business payments provider Veem, and Oliver T. Bussmann, founder and managing partner at Bussmann Advisory.  Most of the day, though, was spent discussing the advantages of distributed ledgers (also Ripple) over the current labyrinthine financial system. Not only does distributed ledger technology grant faster, cheaper and more reliable payments, but Ripple's position in the ecosystem will allow it to scale, according to Ed Metzger, head of innovation at Banco Santander.  ""Payment networks derive value from ubiquity. And the positioning of Ripple in that space is very attractive,"" Metzger said.  If you don't have a network, then the technology doesn't have value in the future, he continued.  Ripple's relevance  Since the summer of 2012 when Ripple first launched, the company has partnered with more than 100 financial institutions who are now utilizing its global payments network. As such, many of Ripple's clients were at the event, some on panels explaining the benefits they observed during proofs-of-concept with the company's technology.  For Banco Santander, its Ripple trial has demonstrated that it can answer customer pain points, like the significant time it takes international remittances to reach their destination and the significant fees that are extracted from those transactions.  ""There are use cases where speed and certainty of the amount being delivered are important,"" Banco Santander's Bussmann said.  He continued, saying that the real question in the UK and throughout Europe is how can institutions replicate the real-time domestic payment system there for international payments.  In separate panels, Dr. Arak Sutivong of Siam Commerical Bank and Veem's Forzley agreed.  Sutivong said:  ""The use case [for us] is cross-border remittance from Japan to Thailand. Overseas workers' hard-earned money in cash [is] sent back home with unknowns. They expect the money to get there on time and in full.""  And Ripple has helped Siam Commerical Bank accomplish that. According to Sutivong, the bank has been transacting with real money for some time, although in a controlled PoC watched by the country's central bank.  On Sunday, during the Swell conference's pre-events, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also announced it's using technology developed by Ripple with its release of open-source software Majaloop, which looks to provide an interoperability layer between financial institutions that offer services to the poor and unbanked.  Ripple news?  But with that being the only news to come out of Swell so far, XRP investors were seemingly less than ecstatic, selling off the cryptocurrency to drop the price about four cents during the day's events.  Twitter was equally mixed in its reception of the event. While many congratulated Ripple on securing key partnerships with the financial incumbents, others were unimpressed. According to Twitter user Nayt Breeze: ""Wasn't impressed by the news seemed like a meeting of speculation.""  The commentary highlights just how contentious Ripple has become over the years, having launched as a bank-focused cryptocurrency play at a time when most cryptocurrency enthusiasts were very much anti-establishment. But Ripple's executives have only fanned that fire.  During the panel, Griffin also said that while cryptocurrency has a role to play in back-office cash management, the uses won't be consumer-facing. And he says that's because the technology lacks know-your-customer (KYC) features required by financial institutions and governments.  While that could be seen as a fine complaint, one that puts Ripple ahead when it comes to mature financial services, Griffin's other accusations were a bit harder to parse.  For instance, he said bitcoin could never succeed if it took four hours to move money from one account to another (which doesn't seem to be the case on average), and contended ether transactions can sometimes take 15 minutes.  But yet, Griffin could not be swayed even as an audience member asked what the panelists thought was causing the rally around bitcoin.  ""The best I can explain is, with a hope-and-pray approach for cryptocurrency investors, that they're betting that digital assets will have a use case eventually,"" he said, adding:  ""Bitcoin, question mark. Ethereum … with machines paying machines, that feels very far away. But for Ripple, there are already funds locked up in nostro-vostro accounts that can use XRP to create efficiencies now.""  He who can't be named  Yet, it's interesting that Ripple would bring up nostro-vostro accounts (local currency-denominated accounts banks hold throughout the world), as the talking point was also on display at a rival conference across town.  There at Sibos, also in Toronto, Swift announced its blockchain PoC focused on freeing up funds in those accounts was a success. In context, many see Ripple's decision to throw an event on the same days in the same city as Swift's big annual Sibos conference as a way to rouse its competitor.  During the panels and presentations at Sibos, presenters seemingly went out of their way not to mention Ripple, the blockchain startup that's taken aim at Swift in recent years. The closest anyone came was when the CEO of Swift Gottfried Leibbrandt took a jab at Ripple while describing the financial incumbent's Global Payments Initiative.  But at Swell, some of the panelists seemed unfazed by the head-butting, speaking broadly about blockchain's advantages to the financial system.  According to Bussmann:  ""It's all about real-time execution … which will be a must-do in the future. [Banks] are going to have to go through a fundamental structural change.""

42400540,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuit,1508238457,Pump or Progress? Bitcoin Cash Nears $400 on Korea Trading Surge,"Backed by strong volumes out of Asia, the price of bitcoin cash jumped to a two-week high today.  At press time, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is $390 – up 25 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 24 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is still nursing a 5 percent loss.  Still, today's move is a jolt for the cryptocurrency, created via a hard fork of the bitcoin blockchain in early August this year. As bitcoin cash was awarded to investors who owned bitcoin before the fork, its built-in investor base helped catapult it to big volumes out of the gate.  However, bitcoin cash is arguably still in a period of price discovery – the digital asset clocked a record high above $970 on Aug. 19 before falling to $280 levels on Oct. 9.  The spike seen today is largely a volume driven. As per CoinMarketCap, the rally appears to have been fueled by Korean desks offering BCH/KRW pairs.  Volumes on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, have jumped by 41%, a development that itself has become a notable trend as cryptocurrencies have seen big boons off listings in the region.  Looking ahead, though, an open question is does this rally have legs?  Price action analysis suggests bitcoin cash could test the psychological level of $400 in the short-run.  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  A base building around $300 followed by a big move higher to $390 on the back of strong volumes.  The relative strength index (RSI) is sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.  Stochastic favors further upside in BCH prices as well.  The trend line sloping downwards from Aug. 20 high and Sep. 20 low is seen offering resistance around $400 levels.  View  A break above the descending trend line hurdle of $400 would mean the sell-off from the record high has found a bottom at $280 levels. The cryptocurrency could then revisit Sept. 19 high of $550.  The odds of a bullish break are high, given the prices have seen an upside move on the back of strong volumes following a long period of congestion around $300 levels.  On the downside, only a break below $300 would abort the bullish view on the daily chart.

42400533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJudy,1508230820,Former Bitmain Chip Designer Seeks to Revoke Mining Giant's Patent,"Bitcoin's most controversial mining firm, Bitmain, is under threat of having a key chip patent revoked.  Forcing a review of the patent is an ex-employee of the China-based mining giant: former director of design Yang Zuoxing, who has now founded a rival mining firm called Bitewei.  According to documents reviewed and confirmed by CoinDesk, the State Intellectual Property Office of China (SIPO) is proceeding with a review that could determine if Bitmain can protect its current market dominance under the shield of the patent claim.  Based on SIPO's data, Bitmain filed a patent application for ""Serial power supply circuit, virtual digital coin mining machine and computer server"" in July 2015, which was authorized on March 30, 2016.  According to the document, the technology provides higher efficiency for cryptocurrency mining chips, reducing electricity consumption and cost. The feature is said to significantly extend the life of miners, potentially resulting in far higher returns from mining activities.  With its patent-backed products, Bitmain is now a dominant force in bitcoin mining. Apart from supplying chips to individual miners and mining pools, Bitmain also runs the mining pool Antpool, which accounts for 20.3 percent of the global bitcoin hash power.  Tit-for-tat battle  Yet, based on the patent law in China, any organization or individual that disagrees with a certain patent authorization can file an application to revoke it, if they provide evidence for their claim. In his review application, Yang claimed that the serial power supply circuit has long been in use and is widely and publicly documented.  While the authority does not specify a timeline when a decision will be made, Yang expects to hear from SIPO in about three months.  He told CoinDesk:  ""If [SIPO] stand by the previous decision, we may need to appeal and file more applications to revoke with different evidence.""  Yet, Yang did not bring up the procedure voluntarily, he indicated. Instead, it is a countermove made in response to a lawsuit filed by Bitmain against him, claiming patent infringement.  A graduate of Tsinghua University with a doctorate in Engineering Physics, Yang's career has focused on chip design, with over a decade working for several hardware companies in China, and authoring over 20 patents authorized by SIPO.  From 2015 to 2016, he served as Bitmain's director of design, during which time the Bitmain patent was filed and authorized. While his name was not among the group of patent inventors, Yang said that he designed the AntMiner S7 and S9, the two popular bitcoin mining chips manufactured and supplied by Bitmain.  After his departure from the firm, Yang started his own company Bitewei, based in Shenzhen, which manufactures the Whatsminer and also uses the serial power supply circuit to lower electricity consumption.  Bitmain subsequently sued Bitewei for infringing its patent right. According to Yang, Bitmain initially asked for ¥26 billion ($3.8 billion), but later changed the claim to ¥2.6 million ($380,000) as per the court's requirement.  When contacted by CoinDesk, Bitmain did not respond to inquiries for comments on the lawsuit or the application for revoking its patent.

42400522,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuT9,1508227220,The New Classic? Protesters Are Already Plotting Alternative Ethereums,"An ethereum hard fork wouldn't be complete without a protest movement (or two).  The second-largest public blockchain by total value, ethereum successfully forked yesterday, activating a bundle of upgrades that make its blockchain faster and better-suited for developers. But while the shift looks to have gone smoothly (with no problems impacting transactions or contracts), groups that disagree with some of the changes are already gearing up to galvanize like-minded supporters for moves in different directions.  That new blockchains would materialize out of the upgrade is perhaps not a surprise – ethereum classic, the best-known example, showcased last summer that launching a successful protest project in the wake of an unpopular upgrade can be a $1 billion opportunity.  At press time, two projects have cropped up with the goal of launching new cryptocurrencies using the old blockchain, and though evidence of support is slim so far, the reasons behind their efforts may sound familiar.  Like ethereum classic, which took aim at ethereum's plans to alter how rewards were distributed on the platform (among other issues), newer protest projects focus on appealing to the miners that today secure the blockchain. Specifically, they're looking to offer alternatives to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 649, an upgrade some miners believe might impact their bottom line.  Intuitively, the case made by the fork protesters makes sense, since one of the main reasons miners secure a blockchain is to make money. But that doesn't mean the projects will find enough supporters to take off.  Ethereum Vega, one protest fork, has less than two hundred Twitter followers and Etherite, the other protest fork, has only two posts on its official Reddit page.  Mining movements  A day removed from the news, though, there's much we don't know about the projects, including how much support they have or will achieve. But, information is emerging.  Ethereum Vega  plans to counter EIP 649 by breaking off from ethereum and creating a new blockchain that removes the code that reduces mining rewards. The developers are now in the process of setting aside newly created cryptocurrency to fund the development of the project and its roadmap.  The strategy is designed so that other ethereum miners can't try to mine the blockchain until they've created 300,000 blocks and made the blockchain public. So, it won't be until then that users can see how many miners are actually supporting the new blockchain.  Of course, just how serious the project is taking itself is another unknown.  ""A new legend borns [sic],"" the official project Ethereum Vega Twitter tweeted out, complete with a screenshot of the command line and block number where the fork took place. (""Make Ethereum Decentralized Again!"" the account later tweeted.)  Other tongue-in-cheek references are apparent. For instance, the Vega developer team has also released a new ethereum client (called ""weth"" instead of ""geth"") and code for a compatible open-source mining poolhttps://github.com/CAHF/EVA-00.Miningpool so that miners can move over to secure the new blockchain if they so choose.  Etherite  has similar goals, aiming to empower ethereum miners who might not have had a chance to weigh in on the reduction of block rewards. But it seems the project's leaders are taking a slightly different approach: namely, they are not creating any coins to give to developers and have been much quieter about their plans on social media.  Either way, both projects can also be read as a sign that there's big money in forks.  Rebellions or cash grabs?  Despite the sparse announcements so far, though, there is one group that appears to be taking the idea an alternative blockchain could be created with some degree of seriousness: ethereum developers, many of whom are cautious after what happened with ethereum classic.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin even went so far as to execute some rough calculations in a public developer channel on whether the projects could succeed. His conclusion? Protest forks won't make very much money unless they prove very successful.  Others, like developer Alex Van de Sande see the projects as little more than quick cash grabs.  ""They created a development fund for themselves, so if they're successful they would make money out of it. I think that's why they want to push the fork,"" Van de Sande said.  Adding to the mystery, though, are the remaining unknowns following yesterday's fork. For example, there looks to be a portion of miners and users that have yet to upgrade to the new software. Since hard forks require all users to upgrade to the new rules, it's more than likely that some participants were slow to notice the hard fork and are simply dragging behind.  Still, it's not outside the realm of possibility that it's in part due to these smaller protest movements.  Ethereum developers, however, are confident overall that the network will stay in one piece. Developer Nick Johnson, for one, believes the latest ethereum upgrade will prove effective, arguing that the Greek colony it was named after foreshadows this future.  Johnson wrote:  ""[Byzantium] was famous for its unbreakable chain protecting the harbour from invaders.""
