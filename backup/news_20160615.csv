42378752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhmR,1466021723,"After Two-Year High, Will Bitcoin's Price Rise or Fall?","The price of bitcoin is back in the spotlight, but following weeks of sky-high gains, market observers are beginning to assess what could be next.  After hitting two-year highs earlier in the week, bitcoin prices fell notably entering Wednesday, nearing correction territory after enjoying a sharp rally. However, several market observers asserted this decline was only temporary, and that the price could push its price higher in the coming weeks.  Experts pointed to a number of factors, including rising volatility, the coming decline in bitcoin rewards, falling bond yields and the looming possibility of a 'Brexit'.  Combined, market observers believe that bitcoin prices have only experienced a 'temporary pullback', and that future price appreciation remains a strong possibility.  Support persists  Though hovering at a press-time total near weekly highs, the price of bitcoin has been on the move over the past few days.  The digital currency fell to a low of $661.60 on 14th June, after reaching $719.85 the day before, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index data revealed. This represented a decline of more than 8%, just short of the 10% drop required to signal a correction.  However, this $661.60 low seems to have represented strong support, as bitcoin prices then began a steady climb, hitting an intraday high of $691.70 by 20:45 UTC, according to BPI figures.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk that he believes this action has established $660 as a key price indicator.  Zivkovski told CoinDesk:  “$660 is now very ‘hot’ support. [The] price pumped almost $30 quickly after touching that level.""  Confidence high  Even as prices fell, Zivkovski said Whaleclub observed that this didn't correspond to an increase in short positions.  ""Rather, traders adopted a neutral position with the aim of buying at lower prices, creating support and limiting downside,"" he continued.  This is different from what could have been observed should the market have been fearful the price would fall. In this scenario, Zivkovski said shorts would have likely risen sharply as a sign of future expected losses.  Other market experts said such fluctuations are inevitable, especially as the price tries to solidify support in a new range.  ""It is important for traders to understand that markets are always following cycles,"" Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Regardless of the asset type, if a price increases too quickly, the safe assumption is that a correction will occur in the short term.""  Xu Qing, a spokesperson for China-based bitcoin exchange Huobi, provided a similar assessment, emphasizing that temporary price declines are normal and predicting that bitcoin will continue to fluctuate in the coming days.  'The perfect backdrop'  Going forward, several developments could help place upward pressure on bitcoin.  Market expert Arthur Hayes went so far as to describe a combination of macro-economic factors that he believes will provide ""the perfect backdrop"" for continued price gains.  ""Global macroeconomics is heating up,"" noted Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX.  Another variable that could impact bitcoin prices is the looming possibility that the UK could exit the European Union, and Hayes recently singled this out as a factor that helped bitcoin prices rally over the weekend.  Key role of halving  Still, all eyes are fixed on mid-July, when the real test for the price will come to pass.  Market observers expect the halving to play a major role in demand through virtue of reducing the available supply of new bitcoins minted each day by 50%.  ""There’s been so much talk around the halving that it’s built up all this hype which is in turn causing a lot more speculation,” said Bitfinex director of community Zane Tackett.  Zivkovski stated that “the backdrop of the bitcoin halving” is “ensuring that market sentiment remains bullish and resilient” to temporary price declines.  A handful of market experts went even further in emphasizing the importance of the halving, asserting that bitcoin prices will remain range bound until after this event takes place.  Rik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic Group LLC, predicted that bitcoin will hover close to $685 until the halving. Further, Vinny Lingham, an investor and entrepreneur, provided a more specific forecast, projecting prices will be range bound until after halving day.  Charles L.

42378754,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhnh,1466011699,Microsoft Launches Blockchain Fabric to Help Enterprises Form Consortia,"Microsoft today unveiled a new project designed to make it easier for businesses across a wide range of industries to build consortiums that better take advantage of blockchain technology.  Since a distributed ledger technology is only as powerful as the number people or companies that use it, Microsoft intends this new suite of tools to help build those networks.  To date, a number of blockchain consortiums have been formed to test the technology, with the most notable including banking consortium R3CEV, the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group (PTDL) and Dubai's Global Blockchain Council (GBC). In statements, Microsoft’s director of business development and strategy, Marley Gray, spoke to the need for a technology that could continue to support such collaboration.  Gray said in a statement:  ""Project Bletchley is a vision for Microsoft to deliver Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) that is open and flexible for all platforms, partners and customers.""  The project will be open to multiple blockchain protocols, providing support to unspent transaction output (UTXO) protocols such as Hyperledger, and account-based protocols like Ethereum, with others added as they are developed.  Rooted in Azure  Named after Bletchley Park where Alan Turing famously helped break the German Enigma code during World War II, Gray says that Project Bletchley is a response to working with the existing members of Microsoft’s Blockchain-as-a-Service platform on Azure.  Launched last November, that platform now hosts a wide range of open-source tools built by Tendermint, Augur and more, and lets users build and experiment in a “sandbox” environment to identify use cases and see how well prototypes function.  Microsoft built Project Bletchley as an ""open, modular blockchain fabric"" interacting with identity and key management, the ability to rapidly scale, and to help construct ""members-only, permissioned"" consortium blockchains, which Gray says have been deemed ""ideal"" by early adopters across industries.  In a white paper also publishedhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md today, Gray described what he termed an “Enterprise Consortium Node”:  ""A modular framework will allow consortiums to pick the best of breed components and build their distributed applications regardless of the detail underneath.""  Blockchain middleware and cryptlets  As part of the Project Bletchley announcement, Microsoft also introduced what it calls two “new” concepts: blockchain middleware and cryptlets.  ""Blockchain middleware will provide core services functioning in the cloud, like identity and operations management,"" wrote Gray. ""In addition to data and intelligence services like analytics and machine learning.""  The blockchain middleware is designed to help users take advantage of the increased security of blockchain and its immutable record of transactions, while at the same time delivering business intelligence in the form of reports required by regulators and others.  Cryptlets, on the other hand, only come into play when blockchain users need additional transaction information such as date and time in order to execute a contract.  ""Cryptlets, a new building block of blockchain technology, will enable secure interoperation and communication between Microsoft Azure, ecosystem middleware and customer technologies,"" wrote Gray.  The entire white paper is available here and more information about Project Bletchley will be disclosed at Microsoft's World Wide Partner Conference from 12th to 16th July in Toronto, Canada. Pilots of the service are expected to be ready later this summer.

42378744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhdd,1466006784,IMF Economist Examines Bitcoin Blockchain's Role in Banking,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has published an article in Finance and Development magazine that examines the case for bitcoin's blockchain technology and suggests that while the technology might have been built to ""avoid banks"" it could have benefits for the banking and trading sectors.  Authored by Andreas Adriano, a senior communications officer in the IMF’s communications department, and Hunter Monroe, a senior economist in the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, the piece, titled ""The Internet of Trust"" provides an overview of bitcoin's history, its underlying blockchain technology and the potential uses of both.  Unsurprisingly, the article leans towards the financial sector and ponders whether blockchain tech could make payments and trade settlements cheaper and simpler.  Warning that some people view bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme, the authors say: ""Bitcoin – or more precisely, the underlying technology that allows it to function, called distributed ledgers, or blockchain – could allow what many see as radical rewiring of the financial sector.""  More intended as a primer to the technology than any form of guidance, the piece avoids making any strong commitments for or against, but it does at least provide an open-minded presentation of the facts; clearly explaining why bitcoin is viewed as a tech revolution and quoting the likes of Marc Andreessen on its potential impact.  The European Central Bank's director general of market infrastructure and payments, Marc Bayle, is quoted to temper the piece's tone.  Asked whether the blockchain can really live up to its promise and speed up the world of finance, he says: ""There’s nothing in the current technologies preventing instant settlement. The problem is the structure of markets.""  In conclusion, the article is neutral, saying: ""It is probably too early to say whether blockchain is 'the next Internet' or just an incremental evolution"", but it ends on a positive note with:  ""The blockchain game is only beginning.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/15/imf-economist-examines-bitcoin-blockchains-role-in-banking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aba803ab8d2b5388fee3bb306b9cf27d471e2049-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lftR,1466002120,Allianz Tests Blockchain to Boost Catastrophe Bond Trades,"Germany-based insurance giant Allianz has reported it has successfully used blockchain-based smart contracts to handle catastrophe swaps and bonds, adding that the technology could boost marketability of the financial instruments.  ""Cat swaps"" and bonds are tradable instruments that allow insurers to guard against huge potential losses following a major catastrophe, and which are triggered under predefined parameters.  However, the payments between insurers and investors can drag on for weeks or months after a disaster. Automating the process via smart contract technology, though, has the potential to reduce that time to as low as a few hours, the organization said.  The trial – which was carried out in partnership with investment management firm Nephila – demonstrated that transaction processing and settlement of funds between insurers and investors can be ""significantly accelerated and simplified"" by using blockchain smart contracts.  The firm cited other benefits of the trial, too, including the increased marketability of the swaps and opportunities to use the smart contracts in other insurance transactions.  Richard Boyd, chief underwriting officer at Allianz Risk Transfer, said:  ""Blockchain technology will increase reliability, controllability and speed for both cat swaps and cat bonds because less manual processing, authentication and verification is needed through intermediaries to confirm the legitimacy of payments [and] transactions [to] and from the investors.""  ""By replacing manual operations, which are currently embedded across the entire process, delays and the risks of human error are ruled out,"" Boyd continued.  The news is the latest in a number of announcements in recent months that see large insurers starting to investigate blockchain technology.  Just this week, PwC said it would sponsor research into the blockchain's potential in the wholesale insurance industry, as well as the creation of a proof-of-concept prototype. Further, in April, insurance provider John Hancock began work on proofs-of-concept using blockchain in partnership with ConsenSys Enterprise and BlockApps.

42378718,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfkd,1466000704,CPA Trade Association Pushes IRS for Bitcoin Tax Guidance,"The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) has submitted comments to the IRS that seek to encourage the US tax agency to provide additional clarity as to how bitcoin and digital currency users should report their handling of the technology for tax purposes.  The comment, submitted on 10th June 2016, asserts that the lack of specificity in the tax treatment of virtual currency has become a ""concern"" for tax professionals, and details 10 areas where the 400,000-member organization believes improvements can be made to the original guidance.  The comments come more than two years after the IRS issued a notice indicating that it would tax digital currencies as property, meaning that users had to report profits and losses, even when using the technology for everyday payments.  In multiple sections, the lack of clarity as to how the everyday use of digital currency is meant to be accounted for was the main subject of focus.  Lewis wrote:  ""Taxpayers are required to specifically identify which virtual currency lot was used for each transaction in order to properly determine the gain or loss for that particular transaction. In many cases, it is impossible for a taxpayer to track which specific virtual currency was used for a particular transaction.""  Further questions sought further detail on how digital currency users should assess the fair market value of digital currency at the time of sale, and whether they are supposed to use one exchange, or an average between exchanges, in their calculations.  Elsewhere, Lewis said that additional clarity was needed for how digital currency held by merchants should be considered, and whether charitable donations with the technology would need to abide by traditional rules of property appraisal.  The AICPA also sought to ask for clarity on whether digital currencies could be held in retirement accounts and how foreign reporting should be assessed given that the currency has no precise location.
