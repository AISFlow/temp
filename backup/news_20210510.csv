42386709,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeQB,1620686460,Card-Based Digital Yuan Wallet Manufacturer to Use Fingerprint ID Tech,"China’s Chutian Dragon, a maker of high-end smart cards, plans to make a card-based wallet for the digital yuan with fingerprint identification technology from Norway’s IDEX Biometrics ASA, according to a statement from IDEX on Wednesday.      But a new wallet that requires its users’ fingerprints could strike a nerve among those concerned about privacy when using a central bank digital currency.      Chutian Dragon’s move is one of the many recent efforts from Chinese tech companies to support the mass adoption of the digital yuan. The AliPay-backed online payment services within the digital yuan mobile app have gone live, and all four major commercial banks in China already allow customers to pay for food delivery and online shopping services with their digital yuan apps.      Beijing-based Chutian has been a longtime provider of smart cards for Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises, such as telecom conglomerate China Mobile and UnionPay China. It has made card-based wallets to provide a hardware infrastructure for the digital yuan.      The collaboration between Chutian Dragon and IDEX is built on top of a license and commercial agreement in 2019, when the companies jointly developed secure payment cards, according to IDEX’s statement.      It is unclear whether the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, was involved in the collaboration. Last month, Chutian said only a small number of digital yuan cards have been made, noting that it hasn’t been able to mass produce the cards yet.      “There are still a lot of uncertainties in our businesses related to digital yuan, including research and development, production and marketing,” the company said at the time.      Shares of Shenzhen, China-listed Chutian Dragon have risen more than eight-fold since the company went public in March, reaching $2.7 billion market capitalization. The shares have hit a daily limit of a 10% increase in price in each of the last three days. China mandates that limit.      Chutian Dragon is hardly the only Chinese public tech company that is benefiting from China’s digital yuan push. The stocks of many payment technology startups have soared thanks to the digital yuan initiative.      The PBOC has introduced “controllable anonymity” for the digital yuan, which means users can make transactions anonymously to certain individuals or entities, but the central bank can still look through the data if the transactions are deemed suspicious or considered illegal. Larger amounts in the digital yuan account could also lead to less privacy.      U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has suggested a digital dollar should be better at protecting privacy than its Chinese counterpart. The Fed, however, hasn’t revealed any technical details on how its digital currency could be more private.      Some critics contend that the centralized nature of CBDCs means they can’t replace cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in terms of security and privacy. In fact, CBDCs may provide central banks with a more efficient way to collect data from individuals, the critics say.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/10/card-based-digital-yuan-wallet-manufacturer-to-use-fingerprint-id-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f53afcb79697111c428b0e38b06873e38c014c5e-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415763,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXNld,1620686021,Cboe Kicks Fidelity-Linked Bitcoin ETF Application to SEC,"Another would-be bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has taken a step toward regulatory review.  Cboe BZX Exchange has filed a 19b-4 form, acknowledging its support of Wise Origin's bitcoin ETF application and kicking the process to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Wise Origin, a fund affiliated with investment giant Fidelity, first filed for the ETF with the SEC in March. The SEC, however, needs an exchange partner like Cboe or NYSE Arca to file a corresponding 19b-4 form before it will consider the application.  With Cboe's filing on Monday, the ball is in the SEC's court. The agency has an initial 45 days to make a decision on the ETF application.  Bitcoin ETF proponents claim such a product would open bitcoin to more investors, namely those who are wary of investing in bitcoin directly, such as retail traders, and those who may be able to invest only in certain regulated investment vehicles, such as some institutional or financial traders.  The SEC, the U.S.'s federal securities regulator, is also considering bitcoin ETF applications filed by VanEck, Kryptoin and WisdomTree. All three firms have also filed with Cboe BZX Exchange. Another would-be ETF issuer, Valkyrie, is working with NYSE Arca, which has also filed a 19b-4 form.  Four other bitcoin ETF applications and one ether ETF application have also been filed, though they lack the requisite 19b-4 forms. Those include Simplify, SkyBridge, NYDIG and Galaxy Digital (bitcoin ETFs), and VanEck (ether ETF).  The SEC has typically taken a full 240 days – the maximum time allowed by law – to evaluate a bitcoin ETF application. In the past, the agency has rejected every crypto ETF application it has received, though industry viewers say this may be the year such an ETF is finally approved.  The bitcoin market's growing maturity and evolution in recent years, as well as the possibility that new SEC chief Gary Gensler may be friendlier to crypto than his predecessor, Jay Clayton, are two signs that a crypto ETF will be approved.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/10/cboe-kicks-fidelity-linked-bitcoin-etf-application-to-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e4f8b8a9613ff360c98032e1dae3140eeb8c80-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeRR,1620684197,"'Panda' Malware Targets Crypto Wallets and Users' Discord, Telegram Accounts","A new ransomware attack is going after cryptocurrency wallets, along with account credentials from other applications such as NordVPN, Telegram, Discord and Steam.      Dubbed “Panda,” the new information-stealing malware (also called infostealer for short) was discovered by Trend Micro, a cybersecurity software company.      “Crypto wallets are now as big of a target for online theft as banking accounts are,” said the Trend Micro researchers who discovered the attack. “With more people getting into cryptocurrencies and the values of said cryptocurrencies still increasing, this will only become a greater threat moving forward.”      They also said there is more risk here because unlike with a bank robbery or credit card theft, there may not be a central authority that can undo malicious transactions. Once you lose your money and the transaction goes on the blockchain, it's likely gone forever.    The malware attack    At a high level, according to the researchers, the attack begins with spam messages that contain a malicious attachment. The attachment uses PowerShell scripts, a task automation and configuration management coding language Microsoft, to download the actual Panda Stealer malware (in encoded form), which is then loaded without files onto the affected system.      “None of this is particularly novel in and of itself – malicious Office documents are well known, so is fileless loading,” the researchers said. “The main 'new' aspect here is the target of the data theft.”      Beyond just targeting cryptocurrency wallets with malware, attackers are now setting their sights on applications like Discord and Telegram – popular communications platforms for cryptocurrency communities.    Read more: This Elusive Malware Has Been Targeting Crypto Wallets for a Year    The attack campaign, which was active in April, uses spam emails and the same rare fileless distribution method as a separate recent attack. Morphisec, another cybersecurity firm, discovered a Phobos ransomware campaign in early April that uses an identical fileless distribution method to Panda, making it more difficult for security tools to spot.      ""The fileless distribution used in this case means there is no signature for antivirus software to detect the threat, and it can bypass detection,” said Michael Gorelik, chief technology officer and head of threat intelligence at Morphisec. “Therefore, it's dangerous for both consumers' wallets and even enterprises, with more lines of security set up.""    Follow best security practices    The Trend Micro researchers said following long-standing security practices still applies here. Not opening up attachments sent via email, making sure you don’t click on unknown links and keeping software upgraded still are basic security measures people can take to avoid malware and other security breaches.      Specific to cryptocurrencies, they said the best advice is to secure your cryptocurrency wallets. They weren’t able to give specific recommendations given the wide array of wallets on the market, but recommended using strong, unique passwords.      “If the wallet you're using offers multifactor authentication (and many do – if anything, they may support multiple methods), use them,” the researchers said. “For investors who are more interested in holding cryptocurrencies for the long term instead of actively trading them, the use of hardware-based/offline wallets may well be safer, if less convenient to add to or sell from.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/10/panda-malware-targets-crypto-wallets-and-users-discord-telegram-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3794d9ff4170c54700358ad607ab8b8b79f2f93d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386717,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeWT,1620683520,Chinese Crypto Traders Are Pouncing on SHIB Coin Known as ‘Doge Killer’,"Watch out, dogecoin: A new digital token trending (and price pumping) in Chinese cryptocurrency circles is billing itself as the “DOGE killer.”      The new SHIB token has unabashedly coopted the name of the Shiba Inu dog breed whose image has come to represent the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin. Perhaps as menacing, SHIB has just garnered fresh listings on the three most popular cryptocurrency exchanges among Chinese users, Binance, Huobi and OKEx.      And this puppy is all of a sudden garnering astonishing investment from Chinese traders, even though they seem well aware that the project appears to have no earnest technological promise. On Monday, when Binance launched trading in the SHIB token, the price nearly doubled on Huobi, where it was already trading.      That’s despite Chinese traders being as likely to call it “s**tcoin” in their local language, as SHIB coin.      The new obsession shows the extent to which the recent dogecoin phenomenon – where money seems as playful as a slobbery toy – has spread to denizens around the world. Traders seem happy enough to go along as dogecoin’s price pumps and dumps repeatedly, often timed to a fresh tweet from billionaire Elon Musk. Over the past weekend, Musk mentioned dogecoin multiple times when he hosted “Saturday Night Live.” The DOGE price has tumbled 29% in the past two days.      “SHIB's price performance over the weekend clearly shows that the crypto industry hasn't had its fill of canine-themed meme coins just yet,” Rick Delaney, senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said.    'Billions or even trillions'    OKEx listed the SHIB coin on May 8, just a few days ahead of Binance. Huobi has the most trading volume of SHIB, according to CoinGecko. A Huobi spokesperson didn’t respond to CoinDesk's request for comment by press time.      The Shiba Inu coin, as the SHIB token is formally known, has a price so low, at $0.00002766, that the project’s backers say it “allows users to hold billions or even trillions of them.”      The price “can remain well under a penny and still outpace dogecoin in a small amount of time,” according to the token's website.      “SHIB is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building,” the website continues. “BONE is our next token!” There’s a even link to a “woofpaper,” dated April 29.      The website goes on to recite some surprisingly sophisticated crypto-industry insider references:      “We locked the 50% of the total supply to Uniswap and threw away the keys,” the website added. “The remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don't own team tokens they can dump on the community.”    A market cap of... ?    It should be noted that the website offers no identifying information about any individuals associated with the project. And as cryptocurrency professionals know, the digital-asset industry is replete with scams. So investors should exercise caution.      On CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency pricing website, the total market capitalization of SHIB is given as a question mark, with a maximum token supply of 1 quadrillion.      No professional cryptocurrency analysts in China expressed confidence to CoinDesk about any fundamental reasons for SHIB’s bounding price.      Such admonishments appear to have done little to dissuade traders.    Binance temporarily suspended all withdrawals on its exchange after the listing, according to a tweet on its official Twitter account. The speculationhttps://www.wu-talk.com/kuaixun/5281.html was that the suspension was caused by the sudden traffic from SHIB trading.    The price pump “is made possible because this token is so cheap that even a single retail investor can buy a few tokens with no trouble,” Colin Wu, a popular Chinese crypto industry blogger, told CoinDesk. In China, “there is a mood that people believe its price would go up.”    A billionaire influencer    The sudden popularity of SHIB appears to be partly the handiwork of social-media influencers on popular Chinese platforms, including Weibo and WeChat.      Charles Xue Biqun or Xue Manzi, a billionaire venture capitalist and one of the most active investors in the Chinese internet industry, has mentioned SHIB in multiple posts on Weibo to his more than 11 million followers. He has also been actively talking about dogecoin, according to his Weibo feed.      “Doge No. 2 hits new all-time highs, almighty,” he wrote in a Weibo post dated May 8, with screenshots of SHIB/USDT and DOGE/USTD pairs on crypto exchange Huobi.      “Doge has already gone up a lot,” Alex Zuo, vice president of China-based crypto wallet Cobo, said. “It gives an example of the ‘wealth-making effect.’ Plus that Shiba inu coin may also benefit from the localization.... With all the promotions by influencers on Weibo.”      “We find it very inexplicable,” Zuo said. “I didn’t buy any SHIB and no one around me has bought any.”",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/10/chinese-crypto-traders-are-pouncing-on-shib-coin-known-as-doge-killer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50d04559541c3c1b5f1db39c0cc15e4befed7ec5-1200x693.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386718,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeaF,1620679177,"Market Wrap: Stellar, ICP Pop as Altcoin Season Takes Ether to Fresh High","Stellar jumps by double digits, Dfinity’s ICP debuts on the Coinbase Pro exchange and ether hits $4,200, albeit briefly. Despite bitcoin’s doldrums, data from the futures market shows traders are ready to take on more leverage on BTC.    Ether (ETH) trading around $4,016 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 4.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,884-$4,200 (CoinDesk 20)  Stellar (XLM) trading around $0.68 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 10.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $55,685 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $57,266-$59,442 (CoinDesk 20)  Stellar’s rally offers fresh reminder it’s altcoin season    The biggest CoinDesk 20 gainer Monday was stellar, the currency of the Stellar project started in 2014 by longtime crypto entrepreneur Jed McCaleb. XLM is worth $0.68 and gained 10.8% the past 24 hours as of press time. Over the course of 2021 XLM has been, well, stellar; as of press time, the price is up over 435% this year.      In October, Stellar added support for the stablecoin USDC, part of an effort to get into dollar-backed remittances.      “I think the fact Stellar added stablecoin on- [and] off-ramps helped a lot to boost the price,” said investment manager Constantin Kogan.      Analysts struggled Monday to find a reason why stellar is now making double-digit gains other than to say that it’s “alt season.” That’s crypto-industry speak for periods of time where traders rotate profits out of bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. Older tokens like XLM “are starting to get a lot of renewed attention,” said Zach Friedman, chief operating officer of quant trading firm Global Digital Assets.      Another example of this rush into altcoins came Monday from a years-in-the-making project that has now pushed forward to tap what appears to be ample market liquidity.      Dfinity, once positioned as a potential rival to Ethereum but now marketing itself as an “internet computer” with a much broader ambit, listed its ICP tokens on Coinbase Pro, which instantly vaulted it into the ranks of the largest cryptocurrencies.      As of press time, ICP was trading around $277 on the venue, according to CoinMarketCap.      “I think right now we are still in the altcoin season,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader.      Read More: Dfinity’s ICP Token Price Goes Live on Coinbase Pro    Ether’s price continues to sparkle    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $4,016 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 4.5% over the prior 24 hours.      Ether hit a new all-time high price on Monday ot $4,213 at around 08:45 UTC (12:45 p.m. ET).      “Ethereum has been pushing stable growth and hitting new all-time highs, albeit this is being eclipsed by the gains in the alt market,” Friedman said.      On Monday, ether’s dominance, or its share of the total crypto market capitalization, crossed 20% for the first time in three years.      Read More: Ether Price Past $4K for First Time, Approaches JPMorgan’s Market Value      “We are witnessing a prolonged ether and [decentralized finance] catchup phase after a long period when most institutional interest was clustered around bitcoin,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, partner at investment firm Tellurian Capital. “This shows in the growth in CME ether futures and also in the fact that the move up is relatively orderly.”      Aggregated open interest in ether futures hit $10.7 billion Sunday, continuing to sustain above $10 billion even through the weekend, according to data aggregator Skew.      So far this year, ether is up over 440% while bitcoin has appreciated 91% on spot exchange Bitstamp.      “Ether is currently outpacing bitcoin, in part because investor sentiments are charged in hopes of a more healthy network in the future,” said Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of exchange CEX.IO.      “There is a lot of forward-looking excitement for the Ethereum community with protocol upgrades incoming,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “ETH 2.0 is slated to arrive sooner than expected.”      “Ultimately, the potential and emergence of a decentralized future is a narrative that is attracting speculators, investors, users and developers across Ethereum and other crypto ecosystems,” he said.    Bitcoin swaps funding trends up    The price of bitcoin was down Monday at 3% as of press time and going as high as $59,442 around 04:00 UTC (12 a.m. ET).      “Things will keep on going like this until and if bitcoin makes another move,” said Alessandro Andreotti, over-the-counter crypto trader. “Then the altcoin frenzy will stop for some time.”      One bullish signal is occurring in the bitcoin derivatives market. On Monday perpetual swaps funding, which is the rate paid for leverage on BTC derivatives venues, is on an upswing, going as high as 0.0987% per eight-hour period on Binance.      At least one analyst thinks it is only a matter of time before the bitcoin spotlight begins to shine once again.      “Alt tokens will make new highs and significant gains before a final transition into bitcoin as these gains level out,” added Global Digital Asset’s Friedman. “This will result in a push upwards from bitcoin targeting the $70,000 levels.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are in the red on Monday. One notable winner as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    bitcoin cash (BCH) + 0.71%    Notable losers:    chainlink (LINK) - 13.3%  the graph (GRT) - 10.8%  tezos (XTZ) - 10.4%    Read More: Twitter Scammers Used Elon Musk’s ‘SNL’ Appearance to Reap $100K      Equities:    Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed in the green 0.55% as investors were bullish ahead of corporate earnings this week.

42386716,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeYz,1620678229,Ethereum Classic Demand Coming From Traders Covering Borrowed Positions: FundStrat,"Ethereum Classic (ETC), a sibling of the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, could see steady demand until the end of the third quarter, according to David Grider, a strategist at investment research firm FundStrat.      ETC has almost doubled during the past week alongside other altcoins and bitcoin lagged. Bitcoin rose just 0.65% during the same period.      “We think there are forced Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) sellers in the market who are also forced ETC buyers that need to cover borrowed positions in the spot market,” Grider wrote in a research note published on Friday.      ETCG, a trust product launched by Grayscale in April 2017, trades at a roughly 50% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      Roughly 2 million ETCG shares were issued between April and May 2020, according to FundStrat. Private placement shares take one year to vest and are likely being released to the market.      “ETCG volume has been spiking recently this month as those shares are coming unlocked to the market,” Grider wrote.      “Many of these same shareholders are now finding themselves in need of covering their ETC denominated loans,"" he wrote. ""This means that these same investors who borrowed ETC to contribute to the trust must now sell ETCG shares and buy back ETC in the spot market to repay these loans.”      Grider said that lower liquidity of ETCG has forced investors to push fund shares to a deep discount from the spot price. Therefore, the demand to cover borrowed positions has likely contributed to an increase in the ETC price.      ETC has traded sideways over the past few days after it reached an all-time high around $178 on Thursday.      “The stability of the price over the weekend is encouraging,” Grider wrote in an email to CoinDesk on Monday. “I think there’s still a bid to cover that could last until the end of Q3. It could provide some steady demand for ETC.”",POSITIVE,ETC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | RESEARCH,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/10/ethereum-classic-demand-coming-from-traders-covering-borrowed-positions-fundstrat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/071734ecd8362144442855fae67ef254a4611737-1828x1130.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411930,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhDdy,1620673560,Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know,"Between dogecoin’s cameos on U.S. television and bitcoin’s growing acceptance on Wall Street, cryptocurrency is reaching a wider audience than ever before. Skyrocketing prices are surely tempting to newcomers, but they should be aware of the risks before jumping in.  If you just started paying attention to cryptocurrency and are wondering whether to invest, here are 10 things you need to know before buying anything.  Even if you’re an old pro, you probably know someone who’s curious because they heard on TV or at the bar that the price of some coin is surging and they can get rich quickly trading it. Please share this post with him or her.  1. Don’t put in more than you can afford to lose  Crypto is riskier than many other investments. Nothing is guaranteed other than volatility. What’s more, it’s unregulated in most cases. There is no FDIC insurance for this stuff, nor is there a buyer of last resort. The prices of crypto coins swing wildly from minute to minute. While the market is basking in the glow of bull run, it has endured painful and protracted corrections and almost certainly will again.  Danger varies in degree. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has been around for more than a decade and it’s significantly less likely to disappear than most other coins. But it’s not free of risk either.  Hence, don't bet the proverbial farm, or your life savings, on any coin.  2. Research thoroughly  Before you invest a significant amount of money in any digital currency, spend hours upon hours researching the technology so you understand the value proposition and the risks. (“Someone else will buy it from you for a higher price” is not a value proposition.)  Read everything you can find on the topic. (CoinDesk’s Learn section is a fine place to start.) Lurk on community forums and developer mailing lists. Listen to podcasts. Borrow books from the library, not only about digital currency but related fields like cryptography, game theory and economics. Read CoinDesk and even some of our competitors.  Go to local meetups, if your area is no longer on COVID-19 lockdown. Ask lots of questions. If you don’t understand what you're hearing, don’t be afraid to ask someone to explain. If it is still not making sense, don’t assume that’s on you; people could just be talking gobbledygook. The sincere ones will take the time to help, but even then be wary of people “talking their book” (telling you to buy what they own so the price goes up).  And even if you’re convinced, seek out skeptics (there is no shortage of them) and consider their arguments as well. Remember John Stuart Mill: “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.”  Once you think you’ve researched everything there is to know, do even more work. You’re probably not done yet.  3. Resist 'fear of missing out'  If the only reason you’re investing in something is to avoid missing out, the only thing you won’t miss out on is losing everything.  Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a sure way to destroy whatever wealth you may have accumulated over the years. The problem is that it’s a gut reaction to something that should be researched first. Trading based on your gut will quickly lead to an upset stomach.  Know what you’re buying. Really know it. Going on a trading app and seeing a currency is up 30% or so over the past 24 hours isn’t research. It could be you’re the unlucky sap being sold a falling cryptocurrency.  Every coin has pumpers (shameless promoters), even bitcoin. Don’t succumb to peer pressure. This isn’t high school. Think for yourself and evaluate the case for an investment on the merits.  Research. Then research again.  4. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is  Much like Wall Street, the U.S. Congress or the American Bar Association, crypto is rife with charlatans. There are more than enough people promising their project will be the one to overtake bitcoin. But is it? There’s only one way to find out: Research.  Buyer beware, but also borrower beware. Some crypto exchanges offer more than 100x leverage, meaning you can borrow up to 99% of the cost of an investment. This will juice your profits if a coin goes up in value, but if it goes the other way you could quickly be wiped out.  5. Don’t trust, verify  Scammers abound in this market. Just this past weekend, some rascals on Twitter took advantage of Elon Musk’s appearance on television’s ""Saturday Night Live"" to defraud people out of $100,000 worth of various cryptos with a bogus “giveaway.” Impersonating the comedy show’s Twitter account, the miscreants instructed their victims to send small amounts of crypto to verify their addresses. If they did so they would get 10 times the amount back.  That too-good-to-be-true proposition was a red flag. Read this, this and this for more telltale signs.  6. Beware of 'unit bias'  Just because a coin is trading around $1 does not mean it’s “cheaper” than bitcoin at $58,000. Not all coins are created equal.  There are literally thousands of cryptocurrencies, some of which seek to emulate bitcoin and some of which try to solve other issues. They all have varying levels of developer support and decentralization.  Determining the value of a coin means asking how and why was the coin created. What is its supposed utility? Who is working on it? How big is the developer community? How active is the repository on GitHub, where updates to the open-source software are usually logged? Like a building, a codebase requires maintenance, and neglect can leave a structure unsound.  Crucially, what is the coin’s security model – proof-of-work, proof-of-stake or something else? If it’s the former, how does the hashrate compare to other PoW coins? If you don’t know what these terms mean, you’re not ready to invest.  7. Not your keys, not your coins  Cryptocurrency is a bearer asset like cash or jewelry, meaning the holder is presumed to be the rightful owner. Once it’s lost or stolen it’s gone.  That is why advanced users will advise you not to entrust the cryptographic keys to a digital currency wallet to a third party, such as an exchange, because these firms are largely unregulated in many places and may be subject to hacks or exit scams (absconding with clients’ money).  Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have fallen prey to numerous high-profile exploits, and centralized platforms like Binance have been subject to their fair share as well.  However, safeguarding keys yourself, on a hardware device or even a piece of paper with the string of numbers and letters written on it, can be a nerve-racking business, and it’s easy to mess up. This is why even some experienced investors prefer to use third-party custodians.  Crypto is all about trade-offs. Do you trust yourself not to lose that piece of paper or forget the “seed phrase” (a password for a key that unlocks your crypto)? If not, you have to be comfortable with someone else storing your digital valuables, and history gives you every reason not to.  (To mitigate the risks, there is something called a multi-signature wallet. These can be configured so that, for example, both Bob and Alice must sign off on a transaction to release funds from a wallet, or either Bob or Alice can do so, or three of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, and so on. But yes, it’s complicated.)  Aside from exploits, exchanges may block you from withdrawing your funds at any time for a variety of reasons ranging from solvency issues to legal trouble. Even beyond that, some exchanges just don't have the infrastructure necessary to remain up at all times – Coinbase and Robinhood, for example, often go down during periods of market volatility. If you aren't running your own wallet, you can't guarantee you have control over your coins.  That said, there are various reasons why you might want to use an exchange, so it's important to check the user agreements and make sure you're protected against different eventualities.  8. You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin (and most other cryptos)  You don’t need to buy a whole coin. Bitcoin, for example, is divisible to the eighth decimal. So if you’re curious about how this stuff works, you can purchase as little as $10 worth and just play around with it.  As billionaire Mark Cuban recently said on television of buying small amounts of dogecoin, “it’s a whole lot better than a lottery ticket.” Unfortunately, he also encouraged viewers to spend doge on merchandise without mentioning the tax implications (see below).  9. Understand the tax consequences  This is especially important in the U.S., for several reasons. First, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers crypto property, not currency, for tax purposes. The upshot is if you buy a coin for $1 and it doubles in value and you spend that extra dollar to buy so much as a pack of chewing gum, you are required to report that capital gain and pay tax on it. There is no “de minimis exemption,” despite the crypto industry’s lobbying efforts.  Also, centralized exchanges regularly send account information to the IRS. Sure, crypto isn’t as regulated as stocks or banks. However, the federal government is running a massive deficit and it won’t think twice about sending in folks with mirrored aviator glasses to visit you to ask about your crypto trades.  10. Buy using dollar cost averaging and don’t obsess about price  Go outside. Get some fresh air, exercise and sunshine. Spend time with your family. You can do all that AND invest in crypto.  The markets will fluctuate from day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute, but any crypto worth a damn, any investment of any kind worth a damn, is a long-term bet. If you want a dopamine hit, go for a run or watch an action movie.  What’s the best way to invest and not obsess? It’s using dollar cost averaging (DCA). Buy a set dollar amount of whatever crypto you like at regular intervals (Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Annually? You pick.) and don’t look at it.  If you have a long-term view, you’re not going to be pressured to sell or up your position based on short-term movements if you use DCA.

The San Francisco-based firm provides data analytics to monitor risk, detect financial crime and strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.  TRM Labs believes the integration of these tools with the Dogecoin blockchain will help market participants in the DOGE ecosystem interact with the network with greater confidence.  “By integrating with Dogecoin, we offer the ability to detect and investigate cryptocurrency fraud and financial crime, enabling our shared goal of building a safer financial system for billions of people,” said Esteban Castaño, CEO of TRM Labs.  Founded in 2018, TRM Labs raised $4.2 million in funding led by PayPal ventures in November 2019.  The company appointed former U.S. Treasury and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) senior adviser Ari Redbord as its head of legal and government affairs in October.  Increasingly large firms are embracing DOGE for payments – from Elon Musk's SpaceX to the Oakland A's Major League Baseball team.

42386706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeL9,1620666275,Spencer Dinwiddie: Why NBA Players Are Warming to Crypto,"NBA junkies know Spencer Dinwiddie as the promising point guard who averaged 20 points and 7 dimes for the Brooklyn Nets last season, before tearing his ACL and missing most of 2021. Crypto junkies know him as something else entirely: a longtime blockchain innovator who, back in 2019, suggested tokenizing his National Basketball Association contract. (He eventually held his token sale in 2020, even if it didn’t go exactly as planned.)      Dinwiddie later acknowledged that putting his NBA contract on the blockchain wasn’t entirely necessary, but that it served a longer-term and perhaps more ambitious purpose. “It was to future-proof,” he said in October. “It was about what was coming.”      And now we have a clearer idea of what’s coming: Calaxy, a mash-up of “Creator’s Galaxy.” Dinwiddie is the founder and CEO. (When healthy, Dinwiddie somehow has time to run the Nets’ fast breaks and also run a company. I can barely manage running the dishwasher.) Dinwiddie describes Calaxy, which is still in beta, as a “social media super app from the future, designed by Creators for Creators.”    Spencer Dinwiddie, of the Brooklyn Nets and Calaxy, will be speaking at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    Calaxy is essentially a cocktail of fan tokens, OnlyFans, Patreon, social media and a supercharged Cameo. Here’s how it works. For fans, you can buy tokens of entertainers and influencers (such as Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott) and then use those tokens for direct access and perks, without the usual middlemen.      For creators and entertainers, you can raise funds through those very tokens, and then use the tokens to monetize your direct engagements with fans. As for the blockchain? As Dinwiddie explained in his announcement, “When you scale to an ecosystem that revolves around every individual’s intellectual property and likeness and you want verifiable scarcity as well as lightweight trading and movement, blockchain is necessary.”      Dinwiddie has been in the space since 2017, he’s an investor in multiple projects (including Dapper Labs, which developed NBA Top Shot) and you almost get the sense that crypto is not just a side hustle but his true calling. He once described himself as “just a tech guy with a jumper.” Over a Zoom in April, Dinwiddie sat down with CoinDesk to dish on what we can expect from Calaxy, why NBA players are warming to crypto and why creators will flock to the new Calaxy ecosystem. (Hint: It partially involves nudity, or a lack thereof.)      What are some of the actual, real-world things that people can do with Calaxy?      Spencer Dinwiddie: So, at the onset you'll be able to get very simple things. Like, I'll pay you a dollar to follow me on Twitter. Or, I want a direct message conversation with you. Or, I want a FaceTime call, or 30 minutes of your time.    Read more: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT    We have a pretty prominent chef on the platform, and you can pay to get 30 minutes or an hour of his time, and he can walk you through his own private cooking class. These things can become customized. So in a 30-minute block of time I could walk somebody through a basketball workout.      Slick. Where does the blockchain angle come in?      As it scales, we’ll use social tokens as the transactional currency.      Can you walk me through how that works?      Yeah, so not to dive too much into that, because that’s phase 2 functionality. And right now, every token is pegged to a dollar to make this very seamless. You can pay for somebody to follow you on Twitter, or pay for somebody to send you a birthday message. And everything is pegged to $1. So if it’s $5 to do a FaceTime call with me, then it’s 5 Spencer Tokens. You know what I mean?      I think you’re selling yourself a little short, Spencer. I’d pay more than $5 for a FaceTime with you.      [Laughs.] Thank you, thank you. No, I haven’t officially set my prices yet. So you have this comprehensive list of features, and you have these social tokens that are pegged to the dollar because people are used to transacting in the dollar.      Sure, makes sense.      And in phase 2, you get to more live token modeling, with market caps on tokens – and people will be buying more, or buying less, as [the prices fluctuate.]      Got it. I imagine it’s tough to start something like this from scratch; how do you get other influencers on board? Is it tricky to explain the crypto concept?      First we started with friends and family, who have just kind of believed in us. We probably got 15 to 20 people off that. And this industry is very small, so they all talk to each other. What we’re pitching and talking about is the building of a community. And a lot of these creators can’t get on OnlyFans because of the reputation risks.      You mean X-rated content?      Right. But what if you had that same feature, which is basically a video drop box, or content drop box – all through Calaxy – and we call it your Fan Club, and you can’t post explicit content. So instead of it being explicit content from Person A, it’s Spencer Dinwiddie's Fan Club or Ezekiel Elliott's Fan Club or Matt James's Fan Club. And it’s all on the up and up. So that’s what we pitch [to the entertainers] – that it’s built by us, for us. And we charge half the fees that other platforms do. And we guard reputation risk as there’s no explicit content.      You’re at the intersection of the NBA world and the blockchain world. In the past year or so have you seen a change in the overall awareness of crypto from other players?      Yeah, a ton. Everybody’s got their attention and sights set on it right now. With the amount of investment capital that’s flying around right now, everybody wants in. They’re not even necessarily sure exactly to what degree or how they want in, but they just know they want in because they see what’s going on.    Read more: Golden State Warriors Become First NBA Team to Issue NFT Set    What do you think has catalyzed the players’ interests? Is it more the bitcoin price surge? NFTs? Top Shot?      Bitcoin probably made everybody pick their heads up and say, whoa. But [non-fungible tokens] are really what has everybody rushing in, because anybody with a name or a certain fan following is rushing into the NFT market.      And I think it’s going to be interesting to see what happens, because I do think NFTs are for real. But for people who kind of just throw out random NFTs as a cash grab … you’ve got to remember that these things also need an ecosystem to play in, you know?      I think so. What do you mean exactly?      You can’t go throw out a one-off NFT, and if somebody’s fan following isn’t big enough the purchaser is going to be stuck with that. I don’t think people always realize that. So it’s going to be very interesting to see where the market goes.      Any plans to incorporate NFTs into Calaxy?      I mean, obviously, NFTs are very immediately on our roadmap, because we know the demographic of people who are on our platform. We plan on having those in the next month or so. But remember, we’re creating an entire ecosystem where NFTs are on display in our platform, or they’re able to be acquired on our platform. There’s a certain utility around it. There’s a marketplace, there’s an ecosystem. So we’re trying to solve for that problem as well.    Read more: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’    How would that work? Can you give an example?      With the Fan Club, when you have these interactions [with fans] you might want to turn some of that stuff into an NFT, like make an NFT from a specific art class, for example. If there is a broader ecosystem attached to this type of thing, we can start to say, “Oh, this NFT is valuable because he did it in this time [or specific context],” versus kind of it being like, “Oh, Spencer wore this shirt on a Tuesday NFT.” You know what I mean?      Yeah, it’s a question of scarcity, right? If they say that this NFT is unique and scarce but then tomorrow they mint another one almost identical, then it kind of loses its value?      Exactly.      What else are you excited about in the crypto world, just in general?      I mean, I always shout out my partners. Our three main partners right now are Hedera Hashgraph, Flow and Chainlink. I’m really excited about those. Obviously, Hedera Hashgraph is the layer that we built the whole system on. I’m really bullish on them.      And other than that, the main thing I’m most excited about is when we do our own token selling, and when Calaxy Cash comes live and we start to decentralize our governance. I think it’s going to be huge because I don’t know of any other social media platform that’s built on blockchain. And it’ll be done in the most transparent fashion possible. It has all of these functionalities in terms of helping fan interaction and engagement, building an ecosystem. And it has that future focus and sits at that proper intersection.      Proper intersection?      I would say, you know, not in a bragging way, but to my knowledge I'm the only one [who] really sits in the middle of both industries, with an intimate knowledge of both. I know a lot of guys are getting into [blockchain], but they haven't spent four or five years actually researching and learning what blockchain is, and learning what a smart contract is. So I just think we’re positioned really well, and we have a chance to do something very special.      Last question for you. Do you see the NBA doing any other blockchain or crypto-related things?      It has to. They developed a council with a couple of the owners on it and stuff like that. I ain't gonna lie, I was kind of disappointed that I wasn’t chosen.      Yeah, why aren’t you on that council?! You could be the freaking chairperson.      I would have loved to. You know what I'm saying? That would have been a dream come true, to be able to sit on a council with some of the most prestigious people in the world. But, you know, it is what it is. And they’re definitely going to do more blockchain stuff. They have to. They have to. They don't have a choice, really.

42386713,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeTx,1620665688,Why Ethereum’s Miner Extractable Value Problem Is Way Worse Than You Think,"As I write this, ethereum is moon-bound. ETH holders are making a bundle, with the price up 370% this year alone. In all this fanfare, though, you may have heard some chatter about MEV (miner extractable value).      In a nutshell, the Ethereum blockchain is written by consensus, but the content of each block is chosen by just one miner. Miners can profit from users by front-running, back-running, sandwiching and generally exploiting transactions in their block however they choose. The Flash Boys 2.0 paper, written by researchers at Cornell Tech, coined the term MEV to describe such exploits.      But is it really that bad? Isn’t it inevitable? And who cares if there’s a little extra slippage on Uniswap if by the end of the day your coins are worth 5% more regardless. We’re all making hay here. Perhaps the whole MEV thing is overblown, FUD even.    Pmcgoohan (a pseudonym) discovered the MEV issue in Ethereum pre-genesis in 2014. He makes a living working with purely algorithmic trading, using his own money. An analyst/coder, he has worked with scientific bodies, corporations and financial firms.    As an algorithmic trader for 12 years, I was the first to predict pre-genesis in 2014 that MEV would become an issue. So let me wind the clock forwards once again.      It’s 2035 and the ETH price has risen to $100,000, except that dollar price doesn’t mean anything anymore because no-one uses dollars, they use ETH. Mission accomplished. We’re where we want to be.      But with Ethereum at full adoption the price is no longer moving up. You can’t grow wealth just from holding ETH anymore beyond 1.6% APR in staking rewards. It’s hard to imagine now, but by this time the currency is so ubiquitous that it’s invisible to most people. Boring even.      Today, around $1.4 billion dollars of MEV is being taken from Ethereum blockchain users annually from a total decentralized finance (DeFi) market of around $50 billion. Global financial markets are worth $100 trillion.    Read more: Juels et al.: Miners, Front-Running-as-a-Service Is Theft    So, in 2035, now that Ethereum is the global financial marketplace, how much MEV will that be? $20 billion extracted in MEV per year? $200 billion? No. It’s $2 trillion worth of wealth annually taken from ordinary people due to an unfixed network vulnerability (in 2021 money). That is just shy of the yearly national budget of the United States and more than China.      That’s before any other taxes, remember. So the population of the world will be charged the entire annual budget of China in a socially useless tax that goes directly to the new masters of the universe (hint: very likely the same old masters of the universe) who have no obligation to build a single hospital, school, road, wind farm, law court, library, food bank, etc., and then you still have to pay your actual taxes on top of that.    MEV is inevitable? Not unless we choose it to be.    Bad, right? Yes, but that’s just the start because Ethereum isn’t just distributed finance. To our kids ether is the dominant global currency and it’s used everywhere: when you buy insurance, when you buy a train ticket, pay a restaurant bill, go to a game, buy a pizza, pay for your tuition.      You order some groceries from an open marketplace smart contract. A small local firm sees your order and can offer you the best price, including biking it over to you. But Mega-Corp has paid the MEV auction winner to censor all grocery transactions except theirs from the block. They don’t even have to compete on price. You overpay for your shopping and the local store closes down.      You manage to find an NFT [non-fungible token] ticket for the Dua Lipa comeback tour for $50 (in 2021 money) on an auction dapp. When you try to buy it, a bot sees your transaction and front-runs it for the same price. But, don’t worry, in the same block they’ve sold it back to you for your maximum bid of $100.    Read more: Bad Sandwich: DeFi Trader ‘Poisons’ Front-Running Miners for $250K Profit    You want to convert your ETH into carecoins to fund your mother’s cancer treatment, but the MEV auction winner keeps moving the price away from you. This isn’t some exotic DeFi trade you’re executing here. These coins are vital for the well-being of a loved one. You can’t afford the complete course of treatment needed by your mother, your sister, your child.      Oh, but come on, we’d never let this happen, right? This is madness. We’ll have fixed all this by then.    Searching solutions    We’d better hope so. The outcomes I have just described are artifacts of a severe data integrity issue in the Ethereum network that must be resolved. Solutions are possible, but whether they are worked on or not is down to us as a community.      Dapp designers can use more MEV-resistant design patterns in their smart contracts. Timelock, SGX or threshold encryption may be used to hide transactions from attackers. I'm collaborating on my preferred solution of a decentralized content layer with fair ordering that engages root causes. It's promising, but I really don’t care if this or some other approach gets implemented as long as it truly addresses the issue. I started the project to galvanize the community away from fatalism and towards real solutions.      Decentralization takes work. It is expensive in development time and computing resources. The payoff is that such systems can be robust and equitable. But if a decentralized solution becomes more vulnerable and less fair than a traditional centralized competitor (as well as more expensive) then it is unlikely to succeed long term.    Read more: Valid Points: Yes, Front-Running Will Still Exist on Ethereum 2.0    I got involved in Ethereum in 2014 full of hope that it would offer an alternative to the corruption that was laid bare in the financial crash of 2008. I still hold that hope. I dearly want us to get there, but we're not going to while maximally exploitative MEV auctions are our primary response. These no more fix the problem of MEV than running a market selling stolen credit cards helps the victims who had their cards stolen. In fact, I have shown that MEV auctions worsen the situation by introducing exploits in which only the most wealthy can profit.      MEV is potentially more damaging in layer 2 (where transactions are made off the main chain) than in mainnet because the rollup sequencer is more powerful than any one miner. One leading scaling solution provider is openly discussing building this exploitation of users into their protocol, not by accident this time, but by design.      MEV is inevitable? Not unless we choose it to be. What needs to be inevitable is that MEV becomes history because if it doesn’t, we’d better start hoping Ethereum fails or we’re all in a lot of trouble.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Pmcgoohan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/10/why-ethereums-miner-extractable-value-problem-is-way-worse-than-you-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4cb771eb0f801eb924d2f8af21211a4a74115a5-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386702,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUeJt,1620659399,MakerDAO on Collision Course With Banking Regulators,"It's a shots-fired moment for decentralized finance, or DeFi. MakerDAO, a decentralized bank and one of the cornerstones of DeFi, made its first ""real world"" loan last month. It is lending to Americans who want to fix and flip residential real estate.      If old-school bankers weren't aware of decentralized banks before, Maker's new foray changes that. Maker is now treading the same hunting grounds as not only banking behemoths such as Wells Fargo, but also A+ Federal Credit Union of Austin and thousands of other credit unions.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    No business is more regulated than banking. As long as MakerDAO confined itself to the blockchain sector, bank regulators such as the Federal Reserve could stay unaware. They can't now.    Decentralized banking = centralized banking    Wells Fargo, A+ Federal Credit Union and MakerDAO are all engaged in the magical business of banking. That is, they each create deposits out of nothing and lend them out.      In Wells Fargo and A+'s case, dollar-denominated deposits are instantiated on centralized ledgers and then lent out to customers. MakerDAO does things a bit differently. It spins up dollar-denominated deposits, known as dai, on a decentralized ledger, the Ethereum blockchain, and then lends them using smart contracts.      But apart from the little details of how the deposits get stored and managed, all three institutions are in the exact same basic business – banking. Create a dollar, lend it, repeat.      Since its inception, Maker has provided banking services to a particular set of clients: pseudonymous cryptocurrency speculators. A typical MakerDAO borrower is a gung-ho crypto fan who, already heavily invested in ether, wants even more exposure. No credit checks or personal references required by Maker. The borrower need only submit their ether tokens to the Maker protocol as collateral, upon which a loan of fresh dai is automatically issued. The speculator uses borrowed dai to buy additional ether.      Like any bank, MakerDAO manages credit risk by controlling the amount of collateral that clients must submit. If a loan is about to go bad, Maker can protect itself by seizing the collateral, whether that be ether or wrapped bitcoin, or any other crypto asset on its permissible list.      Neither Wells Fargo nor A+FCU would ever dream of lending to pseudonymous coin speculators. And so Maker has never landed on those traditional banks’ competitive radar screens. U.S. banking regulators have been mostly oblivious, too. No need to supervise some strange blockchain-y thing that lends to an invisible and amorphous online client base.      But shots have been fired. And now traditional banking is going to have to devote some brain-power to figuring out what decentralized banks such as MakerDAO are up to. Here’s a quick explanation.    Anatomy of decentralized loan to meatspace    Last month, MakerDAO created and lent around $500,000 dai to fund “fix and flip” U.S. residential properties. A homeowner applies for a mortgage, uses the borrowed funds to improve the house, sells it and pays the loan back.      New Silver, an originator of real estate loans, set up a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, which holds title to the fix and flip loans. Technology from Centrifuge, a fintech, dices the loans into senior and junior tranches and encodes the securities as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum. New Silver keeps the junior, riskier tranche for itself and submits the senior tranche to Maker as collateral in return for fresh dai financing. (The fix and flip loans can be monitored here.)      Shorter story: We made some loans to house-flippers and our banker, MakerDAO, is financing them.    Read more: You’re a Lemon if You Buy a Tesla With Bitcoin    It's hard to miss the irony. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum emerged in response to the 2008 residential mortgage implosion. Mortgages had been sliced and diced into conduits, SPVs, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and CDO-squareds, graded by credit rating agencies, and sold to witless buyers. And now, 13 years later, MakerDAO is tinkering with the senior tranche of an SPV-securitized residential mortgage portfolio.      Wells Fargo, A+FCU and other traditional banks will be furious (when they find out). They have invested significant amounts of money into chartering and compliance. With no regulatory costs, MakerDAO can probably undercut them by offering fix-and-flip financing at a lower interest rate.      MakerDAO isn't standing still. It is targeting $300 million in real-world loans by the end of this year. There is talk of freight invoice lending, financing of U.S. farm properties and loans to solar facilities. Expect more blockchain-based banks to start copying Maker.      With all this growth, decentralized banks are destined to collide with real-world bank regulators. What will this collision look like?    DeFi, not-so-censorship resistant    The U.S. has a bewildering system of banking regulation. The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are all involved in regulating banks, as are more than 50 state financial departments. Credit unions are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration.      One of these, perhaps a state financial department like the New York State Department of Financial Services, is likely to send a notification to blockchain-based banks. If they want to provide banking services in U.S. meatspace, the notice will say, they must get bank charters and submit to regulatory supervision.      America's bank regulation probably won’t fit MakerDAO very well – it's designed for 20th-century banks with physical locations and loan officers, not banks that are built on a layer of automated smart contracts. Perhaps lawmakers will devise a special blockchain bank charter. But that will take time, engagement and patience.      DeFi enthusiasts often laugh at the talk of regulation. Any bank regulator that attempts to exercise authority over the collection of smart contracts and stakeholders that calls itself MakerDAO will inevitably fail, they say. The whole point of being on a decentralized protocol, after all, is to avoid being controlled.      And there is certainly some truth to that. But even if a bank is decentralized enough to ignore a government order to get a bank charter, there’s a good chance it would comply anyway. Refuse and MakerDAO would be operating illegally. No more fix and flips. It would have to retreat back to the censorship-resistant safety of the blockchain and its relatively small clientele of pseudonymous cryptocurrency speculators. Submitting to regulation means a ticket to the biggest market in the world: Main Street America.      Other big DeFi applications such as decentralized exchange Uniswap or lending market Compound may soon face the same sort of difficult choice as MakerDAO. They can either stay safely rooted in their rules-free financial zone or get more real-world relevance, but at the price of regulation.    Read more: In the CBDC Race, It’s Better to Be Last    Financial regulation is often criticized. It adds costs. It forces financial institutions to cut off unprofitable customers. It favors incumbents. It reduces innovation. Much of that is true.      On the other hand, regulation emerges through a democratic process. We impose onerous capital requirements and leverage ratios on banks, because burnt by the credit crisis, we are hoping to avoid another crisis. Banks that use decentralization as a means for evading rules are acting undemocratically.      Significant amounts of electricity are being used to secure the Ethereum blockchain. That ensures that Ethereum, and everything built on it, remains open and censorship resistant. But if DeFi tools like MakerDAO choose to become regulated, censorship-resistance is pretty much cancelled. Is there a point to being a regulated bank on an expensive and open blockchain?      For now, MakerDAO will keep on pushing into real-world loans. But expect many of these complicated issues to bubble up in the next few years.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MKR | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/10/makerdao-on-collision-course-with-banking-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8eb06cf0cd79f534afe2ffb7eecbe60473688589-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406343,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetmKn,1620655200,Sienna Network Raises $11.2M to Build Out DeFi Functionality on Secret Platform,"The Sienna Network, a privacy-focused, cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has raised $11.2 million in a private and public token sale. Of the total amount, $10 million came from long-term investors including NGC, Inclusion Capital, Lotus Capital, FBG, SkyVision Capital and others.      Sienna is built on the Secret Network, a Tendermint-based chain within the Cosmos ecosystem that uses privacy-preserving smart contracts. It allows the Sienna community to privately swap, lend and convert its tokens into their private equivalent.      The network functions like any DeFi system, but using Sienna Swap the transactions are private rather than public for anyone to see.      “It has been an extraordinary month and we have hit a super sweet spot between institutional investment and our community,” said Monty Munford, chief evangelist and core contributor to Sienna Network.    The tech    Users can swap any private SNIP-20 token on Sienna. SNIP-20 is a specification for private fungible tokens based on CosmWasm (a smart contract platform) on the Secret Network. If users don’t have private tokens, they can use the Secret Network’s bridge to exchange their tokens for the private equivalent and then convert them back again at any time.      The bridge currently supports Ethereum, and will soon support Polkadot, Monero, Cosmos and Binance Smart Chain.      “Sienna is on a long-term mission to protect users' privacy and to prevent personal information from being hijacked,” said Munford. “By using privacy-preserving blockchain in a user-friendly way, we save no login information, no wallet data, no transaction data or anything else. We do not even track the Sienna website or give any information to any third party.”    Read more: SecretSwap Is the Secret Network’s Answer to DeFi Privacy    On its website, Sienna breaks down the token conversion, which consists of turning regular tokens into secret tokens. In practice, this means ETH becomes sETH (secretETH), DAI becomes sDAI and so on. These can then be traded on Sienna Swap or converted back to their original form. ‍      Users can then trade through Sienna Swap, using a token pair of SIENNA plus the secret token (sDAI, sETH) of their choice.      Sienna is a pure SNIP-20 token while sDAI is a bridged token to the DAI stablecoin token.      Stakers of a pool earn 0.28% of their share of the daily volume by providing liquidity to a pair ETH-based tokens.    Addressing front-running    An issue in DeFi that the Sienna Network hopes to address is front-running. Front-running is the act of getting a transaction first in line in the execution queue, right before a known future transaction occurs. Bots executing such front-running operations by paying slightly higher gas, or transaction, fees have been a sticking point for DeFi. Multiple projects have been developing privacy solutions to address this issue.    Read more: New Research Sheds Light on the Front-Running Bots in Ethereum’s Dark Forest    “Execution priority on platforms such as Ethereum are driven by transaction fees,” said Munford in a statement. “A transaction can be preempted by simply introducing a transaction and paying a higher transaction fee and is illegal in regulated financial systems. Hence front-running.”      Indeed, a report from February suggested an Ethereum trading bot strategy extracted $107 million in only 30 days.      “Sienna’s success validates the vision we’ve long shared to bring data privacy to blockchains and decentralized applications,” said Tor Bair, the Secret Foundation’s executive director and chairman. “We believe Sienna will be a key pillar of Secret DeFi and help drive mass adoption of a more secure decentralized financial ecosystem.”      Munford said these initial funds will be used to expand the team and to roll out a very extensive roadmap being brought to market throughout 2021, not least of which is an automated market maker (a privacy-first decentralized exchange).      The network's name is a variant of the Italian city of Siena, which played a historical role in banking and cryptography as early as 1135 AD.",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | DAI | TOKEN SALE,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/10/sienna-network-raises-112m-to-build-out-defi-functionality-on-secret-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c11060b8ff33233ab04c580f80a6ee77d7e061bb-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the deal, Hive transferred all shares of the unit to the Narvik municipality along with a $200,000 payment.      The company cites the Norwegian government's scrapping of a tax subsidy on electricity that was granted to crypto miners as a reason for the move.      This meant that it was improbable that Hive would be able to meet the development conditions of “this greenfield project,” according to an announcement by the company Monday. The land development rights were therefore impaired and written down to a zero valuation from $15 million in March 2019.      Hive Executive Chairman Frank Holmes described the situation as “unfortunate,” adding that the deal was made before he and Darcy Daubaras, the company’s chief financial officer, assumed their roles.      The company now plans to focus its mining operations on data centers in Sweden and Iceland, which mine ethereum continuously on the cloud, according to the announcement.

Yusko told CNBC’s Trading Nation on Friday that's because bitcoin is more than just a store of value.      It’s “about network adoption and increased usage,” he said. “This is a network, and networks grow in an exponential way. This is the fastest network in history to $1 trillion, right on the heels of the FAANGs that took 15 to 20 years depending on which one you look at.”      FAANGs refers to the stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet. The bitcoin market hit $1 trillion in value earlier this year, 12 years after its creation.      Yusko based his bitcoin target on equivalence with gold, which has a market capitalization of $4 trillion. If BTC reaches that level, each coin would be worth $250,000.      Comparisons with gold are often used to illustrate bitcoin’s upside, but critics cite limits on the crypto's ability to scale such as the time it takes to settle transactions and the computing power required to mine bitcoin as reasons to be skeptical.      “What people miss is this is a technological evolution of computer power that isn’t going away,” Yusko said. “It is a powerful computing network that is going to become the base layer protocol for the internet of value.”      See also: Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt Expects Bitcoin to Reach $200K",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/10/morgan-creek-founder-predicts-250k-bitcoin-within-five-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/856df027e7dd58c3b8f45d4ca2aa0463d5d04a6e-1500x1031.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406347,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetmOj,1620646843,Ether's Active Addresses Pass 2018 Peak as Cryptocurrency Soars to New Price Highs,"Ether's bull run appears to be backed by fundamentals, with active user participation in Ethereum's network booming alongside the cryptocurrency's price.      The number of unique active ether addresses, either as sender or receiver, rose to a record high of 7.94 million on Sunday, topping the previous peak of 7.14 million reached on Jan. 16, 2018, according to data provider Glassnode.      The tally has increased by more than 100,000 in the past three days alone, taking the year-to-date growth to 86%.      ""Ethereum network fundamentals that include ... transactions, active address, fee collection and many other metrics are making ether fundamentally strong,"" Shivam Thakral, CEO of India-based crypto exchange BuyUcoin, said.      Active Ethereum addresses and daily transaction count bottomed out in early 2020 and have been rising ever since, signaling the potential for a bull run in ether. ""When there’s greater usage of a cryptocurrency, there’s more demand, and that drives the price up,” Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk last year.      Ether, the native token of Ethereum, has responded positively to the network growth, rising by a staggering 2,355% since early 2020. The cryptocurrency is trading at record highs above $4,100 at press time – up 450% so far this year. Prices have doubled in the past two weeks alone, per CoinDesk 20 data.      Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, is trading near $58,200, representing a 100% year-to-date gain.      Since the first quarter of this year, the network has been facing congestion and charging relatively higher transaction fees than rivals like the Binance Smart Chain.      So far, however, high fees have largely failed to deter users, as evidenced by the continued rise in the active addresses and transaction count (now also at record highs). That's a sign of real fundamental growth, according to analysts.      ""Low-fee chains can fake activity much more easily than chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin,"" said Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen. ""So when active addresses on Ethereum are at record highs, that's a true sign of organic growth.""      Arash Ghaemi, director of the strategy at Two Prime Digital Assets, foresees a further increase in active user participation, as web search data shows popular interest in Ethereum is rising.      ""Ethereum searches are going parabolic while Bitcoin searches drop/level off,"" Ghaemi said in a Twitter thread on Monday. ""As Google search interest rises, so will active ETH addresses, putting pressure on price upwards.""

For example, earlier this year, Goldman Sachs relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk after a three-year hiatus, with plans to once again support bitcoin futures trading.

Rari Capital said the attacker exploited its yield-generating integration with Alpha Finance Labs’ ibETH token.  Jai Bhavnani, Rari Capital CEO, explained in a blog post on May 9 that the exploit drained a total of 2,600 ETH (about $10.6 million at the time of writing).  The attacker took advantage of a function in the ibETH token to artificially inflate its value, allowing more to be withdrawn than had been deposited, according to a May 9 post-mortem by David Lucid, Rari Capital's lead developer.  In his update, Bhavnani said 2 million of the project's RGT governance token, intended to be used to scale the team, would now be offered to reimburse users that lost out to the exploit.  ""All of the protocol contributors have elected to give that 2M $RGT back to the DAO with the ask of using the newly acquired $RGT to reimburse lost funds and reward those that helped in the war room,"" he said.  In future, Rari Capital will request the protocols it integrates with to review the integrations for security, according to Lucid.  He also proposed that deposits and withdrawals are prevented in the same block, or have a timelock applied to prevent funds being drained at speed.  From trading at more than $17 prior to the exploit, the Rari governance token fell almost 50% to $9.07 before rebounding. At press time it is sitting at $12.09.

In an order signed late last month, Judge Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Florida granted a joint motion by Wright and plaintiff Ira Kleiman to move the date.  The judge also moved the calendar call to Sept. 14 and extended the due date for demonstrative and summary exhibits to Aug. 31, as the parties had requested.  The status of the case will be discussed in a conference on Tuesday, according to the order.  In September of last year, Wright attempted to prevent the case from going to a full trial by filing a motion seeking summary judgment. The motion was summarily denied by Judge Bloom.  Since then, the trial date has been moved several times.  Kleiman brought the case on behalf of the estate of his late brother David, who had worked with Wright during bitcoin's early days.  Wright is being sued for half of his alleged fortune of 1.1 million bitcoin (approximately $65.2 billion at today's prices) he claims the two mined together, as well as intellectual property.  NChain Chief Scientist Wright has controversially proclaimed himself as the inventor of the Bitcoin network, even going so far as to threaten developers with legal action on the basis of copyright infringement.

Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall by market cap, went as high as $4,070 shortly after 3:00 UTC (11 p.m. Sunday ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The year-to-date return is now around 435%, versus about 104% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.      This year's gains have been powered by speculation from new market entrants betting on decentralized finance (DeFi), which consists of blockchain-based trading and lending platforms that aim to automate many functions of banks and other traditional financial firms. The Ethereum blockchain serves as the foundation for much of DeFi, and it also is the basis for many non-fungible tokens (NFT), another hot trend in cryptocurrency markets.      Ether's market capitalization now stands at roughly $470 billion, approaching the $488 billion stock-market valuation for JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank.      Of course, it's no joke that cryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile in price, prompting warnings that investors should exercise caution.      Some investors are apparently paying up for ether, to the extent that a premium has appeared on the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange over prices quoted on other major exchanges, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto data firm CryptoQuant.      Ju told CoinDesk via Telegram that the premium was ""significant"" as ether climbed a staggering 72% over the two-week period from April 26.      The market for ether has become so ebullient that crypto derivatives exchange Deribit just listed an options contract expiring in March 2022 with a strike price of $50,000. The level is so far above the current price that the exchange later tweeted that there was ""nothing frothy about us listing this strike"" and that the decision fell within its ""strict listing policy.""      Additional excitement has come from the Ethereum blockchain's plan to shift toward a ""proof-of-stake"" consensus mechanism – how transactions across the network are confirmed – that theoretically will be less energy-hungry and more scalable than the current ""proof-of-work"" system, which is similar to what the Bitcoin blockchain uses.
