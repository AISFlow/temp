42397265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4ZQ,1380210035,"Who is right? Winklevosses for, Peter Thiel against bitcoin","It is quite evident that when influential people talk about bitcoin, the masses listen. Strike up a conversation about virtual currencies with an everyday person in your life, and they will recall information received from major news outlets. Mainstream media likes to put things in a neat package so they're easily understood.  The PRISM surveillance program, for example, will forever be linked to Edward Snowden because it is difficult to contemplate a secret monitoring program operated by secret people.  Snowden represents PRISM, and it could be argued that right now the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, are a representation of bitcoin to the public.  Hedge funds and bitcoin?  At the New York Value Investing Congress, the Winklevoss twins held court regarding the prospect of bitcoin.  It’s important to keep in mind that the Value Investing Congress is an annual meeting of hedge fund managers, a group of investors that err on the side of caution because they are investing other people’s money.  It’s intriguing why Tyler and Cameron chose such a conference to speak about bitcoin; it’s not something that could be considered a stable investment in the hedge fund world.  The fact that they are trying to bring a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) to market might bear some reasoning behind the move.  The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF is a notable attempt to bring access to bitcoin investing to the masses. It is still somewhat difficult to invest in bitcoins.  Sure, there are a number of exchanges available, but the fact that bitcoin operates outside of normal investment brokerages can make the majority of traditional investors wary.  Confidence  Are the Winklevoss twins really the best representatives for bitcoin? That’s up for debate.  Anyone familiar with their history could suggest perhaps the twins were very fortunate to obtain a $65 million portion of the Facebook pie because of their early association with founder Mark Zuckerberg.  As it turns out, the Winklevoss siblings believe that they are owed more money from Zuckerberg, and have filed an additional suit against him.  But with that being said, they are wealthy and have put their money where their mouth is by investing in bitcoin. That’s something virtual currency investors can get behind.  Recently, the twins have been in the news about bitcoin again with some interesting concepts. They seem optimistic and prepared for mass media consumption to get people interested in trading in their fiat for BTC.  One idea is that the logical evolution of bitcoin will involve a nation adopting it as its currency.  ""The next step for bitcoin is potentially becoming the currency of a country,"" Tyler told the audience. “With bitcoin there are no bail-ins like in Cyprus"".  Could it become the currency of a country?  It would be interesting to know just what country might feel comfortable switching from government-controlled currency to a digital one that is decentralized.  While there are countries that have a money supply that is less than that of the total value of bitcoin, those numbers don’t factor in the economic realities of a nation in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  How would a country with bitcoin-denominated banknotes conduct trade with other countries?  The idea is a good one to pronounce, but the reality is that bitcoin lacks the structure to conduct any sort of economic policy.  It sounds like a total loss of control for a country. Yet it is possible a nation-state that utilizes something like the euro to trade might be able to make it work as an experiment.  What might be a more agreeable statement is that bitcoin is a new version of gold, which was another comment the twins made. ""It's gold 2.0,"" said Tyler.  Someone can pay for a number of things with bitcoin at this point that you cannot do comparably with gold. So perhaps as a new store of value that could be more liquid, that makes a lot of sense.  Peter Thiel bearish on bitcoin  If you’re not familiar with Peter Thiel, it’s important to point out that the PayPal cofounder and BitPay investor is a contrarian.  That’s not to say he’s incorrect in what he says, but when he does say something it is because he believes in something different.  Take, for instance, his initiative to take smart young entrepreneurs and pay them not to go to college, but to build a company instead. The idea is that to Thiel, college is a drag on the economy; putting energy into building businesses and thus potential job creation is a better alternative.  Thiel told a German audience recently that he believes bitcoin has a “20% chance of success”.  Those who regularly read the news on CoinDesk might disagree. But the bigger picture is that despite the ultimate fate of bitcoin, digital currencies are here to stay.  While there may not ever be a bellwether virtual currency that we all transact in, there will always be digital payment systems that appeal to subsets of the population.  Take Ven, for example, which is a digital payment system that is built upon sustainable principals like carbon offsets. Does Thiel really think that people are going to stop creating these new concepts for money?  Belief and trust  It’s easy to take statements that are said by successful people at face value. Yet the fact of the matter is that it will always be the people who lift up decentralized currencies.  Think about it like this: If the people trust, then they will transact. Without that, any payment method will fail.  These new ideas for money are not backed by a financial system, and they are not guaranteed by a government. If an economy can be built upon them, then so be it.  Does it matter what Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss say? Does it matter what Peter Thiel thinks will happen?  Maybe, but if there is a way for people to trade in fiat for bitcoins, and there is a diverse set of ways to spend them, then there's value. That support is really what is important going forward.  What do you think about the comments from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss? How do you feel about Peter Thiel’s prediction about the chances of bitcoin’s success? Let us know in the comments.

42397261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4UV,1380196951,Australia gets new bitcoin exchange BTC Markets,"In Australia, things might be looking up for the bitcoin community. A group of local bitcoiners is working to form a local chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation, and there is a new trading platform for the community.    Around two weeks ago, a new exchange based in Sydney called BTC Markets went live. The exchange, which supports bitcoin and litecoin, was started by Martin Bajalan, a bitcoin enthusiast who is among a team of nine working to set up an Australian chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation.  The exchange provides trades in real time, and charges no fees for fund transfers, making its money instead from a trade commission that starts at 1%. His goal is to conduct a million trades per month by the end of next year.  “The challenge will be how quickly we can provide adequate liquidity with new financial products to attract traders, and also overcome the regulation issues over the next few months,” says Bajalan.    What regulatory issues might those be? Australia has several regulators governing financial markets. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulates financial markets overall, while specific KYC/AML practices are overseen by Austrac.    Financial services businesses in Australia are required to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) from ASIC, but Bajalan doesn’t believe he needs one.  Right now, the regulatory landscape looks relatively stable. “We have had confirmation from our lawyers that as long as we perform real-time settlements, there is no need for a license,” he says.  His lawyer advised him that bitcoin does not fall into category of a financial product (specifically a contract to exchange one currency for another which is settled immediately) under the Corporations Act s.765A(m).  “If trades did not settle immediately, then bitcoin trading would probably be either making foreign exchange contracts or trading in derivatives, both of which require an AFSL,” he adds.  Bajalan has contacted Austrac, and says that he has been told that bitcoin isn’t covered by the Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing Act that dictates AML rules. This is because bitcoin isn’t backed by precious metal, he says.  Regulators are tricky institutions, though. Rules are subject to change, and this can happen when a new trend hits the mainstream (or simply when regulators catch on, and finally understand it). There is always the chance that Austrac and ASIC may revise their stance on bitcoin. What then?  Bajalan has tried to be compliant with current KYC requirements, by working with Edentiti Ptyhttp://www.edentiti.com/edentitisite/index.html Ltd, a company that provides ID verification, to help verify users of the exchange. This firm has been government approved, he points out.  “I believe currently Australia is in a better situation to adapt bitcoin compared to US. This is mainly due to US having many states and different laws,” says Bajalan.  Still, there are some regulators in Australia who have taken an interest in bitcoin.  The Australian Taxation Office took an almost identical stance to the US IRS in June, warning that although no specific rules have been passed relating to bitcoin, it is aware of the cryptocurrency, and that people should be keeping detailed records of their transactions, in case it decided to levy taxes on bitcoin-based profits. The ATO said that it was able to track transactions in bitcoin.    BTC Markets doesn’t yet offer margin lending, although this could be on the cards as the site builds liquidity and volume. In the meantime, there are other options. BTC.sx, which CoinDesk covered in May, is still going strong, according to founder Joe Lee.    “Trading volume is growing healthily alongside our user base. The startup has moved into Fishburners, a startup space in Sydney and is going through seed funding capital raising now,” he says.  There are other promising signs of bitcoin activity in Australia. Bajalan and Lee both attend the same Sydney-based Meetup group, and at least one pub is now accepting bitcoin payments (and there are a few more companies mentioned here).  Coinjar.io  is also providing the ability to buy bitcoin using a web-based wallet, along with merchant accounts to take bitcoin payments. Hopefully services such as Coinjar will step in where others such as BitInnovate appear to have failed (that site, which also offered bitcoin buying and selling, has closed).  With the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) now publishing a bitcoin guide, and with a local group organizing a more formal bitcoin-related group with a constitution, things may be looking positive for the burgeoning bitcoin community down under, although as with many countries, there is still a long way to go until it could be considered mainstream.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/26/australia-gets-new-bitcoin-exchange-btc-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a5a5673e81dcfcb6a1ac790f8e8f023f8623c6e-940x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4Jg,1380153624,"SecondMarket launches Bitcoin Investment Trust, invests $2 Million","Article updated on October 1 at 11:44 BST.  Private investment vehicle the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) will today (26th September) begin raising capital on SecondMarket, the alternative trading system for private company stock.  BIT, an open-ended private trust, invests exclusively in bitcoin and enables people to gain exposure to the digital currency without having to directly buy and store it.  Shares of BIT, which is the first US-based private investment vehicle to invest exclusively in bitcoin, are being offered exclusively on SecondMarket.  Initially, each BIT share will represent 0.1 bitcoins, but the trust will not generate any income and will regularly sell/distribute bitcoins to pay for on-going expenses, so the amount of bitcoin represented by each share will gradually decline over time.  Registered broker-dealer SecondMarket has made a $2m seed investment in BIT, and its wholly owned subsidiary Alternative Currency Asset Management (ACAM) is sponsoring the trust.  ""We incubated the BIT to alleviate the problems of direct bitcoin ownership, including having to wire money to newly established and potentially unregulated entities around the world,” said SecondMarket founder and CEO Barry Silbert.  He went on to say he believes a bitcoin-related investment vehicle is a great fit for SecondMarket as his company's infrastructure ""enables streamlined capital raising, liquidity, and investor communications for funds and companies"".  Silbert said he thinks bitcoin has the potential to make an impact on a number of industries, but noted that digital currency could also encounter problems. He warned:  ""Bitcoin … faces regulatory uncertainty and widespread adoption issues that make investing in bitcoin a highly risky endeavour.""  Those who do choose to invest in BIT will have the opportunity to gain liquidity through auctions on SecondMarket, which will start next year. The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the BIT will be calculated daily.  Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation and member of ACAM's advisory board, said: ""The bitcoin offering from SecondMarket is a project that has been in development for over a year now. It will set the standard for best practices of bitcoin as an asset class in the US.""  SecondMarket has confirmed that Archibald Cox Jr, former chairman of Barclays America, has also joined the advisory board and invitations have been sent out to other individuals that are anticipated to accept and join over the coming weeks.  Mark Murphy, executive vice president of communications at SecondMarket, said the company had received a number of requests from financial professionals, technology entrepreneurs and even gold enthusiasts relating to investing in bitcoin, which cemented the company's decision to add BIT.  Murphy said BIT differs from the Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss' proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust as it is aimed exclusively at institutional and accredited individual investors:    ""We believe that the risk profile of bitcoin is not appropriate for retail investors.      We’re obviously excited about the potential upside of bitcoin, but there’s also the real possibility that the value of bitcoin will go down to zero.""    The price of bitcoin is currently sitting at around $122-$126, but it has fluctuated between around $250 and $68 over the past six months. Some of those involved in the space believe the price could reach four-digit numbers by the end of the year or into 2014, but others still protest that digital currency is a passing fad.  UPDATE:  Bitcoin Investment Trust is now being listed on the Bloomberg terminal with the trust's objective and strategy being noted as ""currency"", but the asset class as ""specialty"".  The minimum investment accepted is currently $25,000, with a front load of 0%, back load of 1.5% and management fee of 2%. The fund code is XBTFUND US, which adds weight to the argument that XBT should be adopted as the ISO currency code for bitcoin.  What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.
