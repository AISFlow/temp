42404559,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiuiT,1588111943,11 Lawmakers Urge US Treasury to Consider Blockchain for COVID-19 Relief,"Eleven members of Congress are calling on the U.S. Treasury Department to look at new technologies, including blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT), to help streamline how cash and supplies are distributed under a federal law trying to boost the economy during the COVID-19 crisis.      A letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin points to blockchain and DLT as secure “new mechanisms” for moving money quickly and transparently, which could in turn boost liquidity in distributing funds via the federal CARES Act.      U.S. Congressman Darren Soto (D-Fla.) spearheaded the letter, dated April 23 but released publicly on Tuesday.      Reps. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), Bill Posey (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D-U.S. Virgin Islands) joined Soto in signing the letter.      “We understand your primary mission is to deliver urgent and necessary assistance to America’s small businesses and working families,” the letter says. “As the pandemic continues to impact the economy, we look forward to supporting the Administration’s efforts to get American small businesses running while also prioritizing health, safety and proper oversight.”      However, the letter says, the Treasury Department can take “additional steps” to improve its efforts.      “We thus strongly encourage the Treasury Department to utilize private sector innovations such as blockchain and DLT to support the necessary functions of government to distribute and track relief programs and direct that all guidance support the use of technology to facilitate delivery of CARES Act benefits,” the letter says. “Such steps will ensure both that America retains its technological advantage and that relief is delivered quickly to the small businesses and individuals who need it most.”      The letter points to China’s rollout of its own blockchain system as an example of other nations pursuing the same technology.      Why blockchain?    Soto, who co-chairs the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, told CoinDesk he had spoken with developers, entrepreneurs and other members of the caucus in drafting the letter.      In his view, blockchain or DLT tools might be the most secure ones available to solve some logistical challenges the federal government is facing in distributing funds and other supplies.      Blockchain-based systems could be coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) to better manage the data being tracked or transmitted, he said.      “It works so well in hand with artificial intelligence and it's not subject to hacking or changes once you have that fixed ledger down,” he said.      Soto sees AI as a supplementary tool, rather than something to take charge of a distribution network. Policymakers would still need to set strict parameters and humans would still have to act as administrators for such a system, he said.      “We could see greater speed and efficiency right now,” he said of the proposed system.      Due to the COVID-19 crisis, there is a lot more demand for certain goods than there is supply, and having individuals manage their distribution is a difficult task.      “I believe it’s worth at least doing pilot programs,” Soto said. The results of these pilots can inform what a next step might look like, he said, though he’s not looking to immediately replace existing systems with blockchain-based versions just yet.      This is a good time to start the conversation, Soto said.      “During this terrible crisis there are certain opportunities to advance technologies,” he said. “This presents us with an opportunity to potentially get greater efficiency for a lot of these logistical issues.”      Read the full letter below:",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/28/11-lawmakers-urge-us-treasury-to-consider-blockchain-for-covid-19-relief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/489b3d66562a7a4944b8d9fd209775e9f300ef98-1150x767.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s oldest cryptocurrency is up 12% over the past five days, and less than a percent over the last 24 hours, trading in $7,600-$7,700 territory Tuesday.      The price for one BTC has been above the technical indicator 10-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating bullish sentiment.      Meanwhile, mining power is making a comeback from March lows. After a high of 121 exahashes, or millions of terahashes, per second (EH/s) in early March, the network dropped to 95 EH/s by March 19. The hashrate is now trending up again ahead of the halving.      Bitcoin’s March price bloodbath, with over $700 million in BitMEX liquidations triggered, likely contributed some to the March mining power dip as some machines became less profitable. However, bitcoin’s 19% gain over the past month certainly doesn’t hurt miners now.      Read More:Chinese City Known for Bitcoin Mining Needs to Burn Excess Hydropower      Despite the recent increase, network power will likely recede over time, according to John Lee Quigley, an analyst for MinerUpdate.      “Hashrate is expected to decline post-halving with industry professionals estimating decreases in the range of 13% to 60%,” Quigley wrote in an April report.

Yet, as bitcoin’s price continues its rebound from March lows below $4,000, the real pop may not come until summer or fall.      “The real climb around halvings occurs months later,” post-halving, according toHenrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader.“I see no reason that will not happen again.”      Read More:Two Weeks From Halving, Bitcoin Rally Brings $10K Into View      The rationale for bullishness, while hotly debated, is that once the amount of supply entering the system every 10 minutes or so drops from 12.5 BTC to 6.25, unchanged demand should drive the price up.      “Both previous halvings had a very positive impact on bitcoin's price, since they compress the supply and drive greater demand,” said Sebastian Serrano, CEO at Argentina-based crypto payments company Ripio.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board performed well Tuesday with nearly everything in the green.

Oil remains in turmoil, although only down 1.8% as of 20:25 UTC (4:25 p.m. EDT) However, the 30-day historical volatility of oil has been higher than bitcoin’s this month.      “The oil market implosion just reminds us that there are many skeletons in the traditional market closet, and a lot fewer in digital assets than many believe,” digital asset investment firm Arca wrote in its Monday letter this week.

42404563,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiumP,1588106959,Judge Approved Blockchain Association’s Brief in Kik Case Despite SEC Objections,"A U.S. District Judge allowed the Blockchain Association to file a brief in an ongoing lawsuit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Kik despite the regulator’s concerns the group was not a neutral observer.      Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York signed off on the advocacy group’s right to file the amicus – or “friend of the court” – brief last week, a day after the SEC filed an objection saying several members of the association had financial interests in the case, and it therefore was not an objective or neutral entity.      The Blockchain Association pushed back against the SEC’s description of its role in the case Tuesday, with Executive Director Kristin Smith saying the group was “proud to file” the brief.      “The SEC’s description of our brief was wrong, and we are pleased the court granted our motion to participate as a friend of the court,” she said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.      Graham Newhall, the association’s communications advisor, said the group wouldn’t comment on the specific claims the SEC made in its filing, but said that “it’s a little strange to treat the Blockchain Association different from other trade associations.”      Kik is not currently a member of the group, though the Blockchain Association does currently manage the “Defend Crypto” fund Kik originally launched last year.      “The Blockchain Association was proud to file its amicus brief in this matter, and we appreciate the opportunity to speak for the entire industry in supporting sensible regulation,” Smith said. “The court system benefits from amicus briefs like ours that place the parties’ evidence and arguments in their broader context, a role played every day by associations, non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups in courts across America.”      Kik and the SEC both filed their oppositions to motions for summary judgement by the parties late last Friday.      The SEC maintains the kin sales were a securities transaction, while Kik says its public sale was not. Kik originally sought a jury trial for the case, which began in June 2019, though it has since walked back from the stance.

42404565,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiukR,1588105880,Hut 8: The Struggles of One of Canada’s Largest Miners,"For an industry whose foundation was built on transparency, there is a still lot about the cryptocurrency space that remains opaque. Companies are hesitant to disclose revealing information unless required to do so. Thankfully, the filings of publicly listed companies provide an excellent, yet underutilized, resource for understanding crucial details that would otherwise be unknown to the community.      CoinDesk Research presents an in-depth look into one of the largest publicly listed mining companies, Hut 8. The halving will serve as a pivotal moment for the industry as a reduction in the block reward subsidy puts several miners’ operations in jeopardy. In this report, we get a more intimate look into the space as we delve into Hut 8’s financials and identify key risks & concerns.      Some takeaways:    As the network hashrate continues to grow, Hut 8’s revenue and margins have decreased considerably over the past couple quarters. With the halving reducing the block subsidies to miners, Hut 8’s existing mining rigs are likely to become unprofitable unless bitcoin prices receive a notable boost.  Management is interested in upgrading to more efficient ASIC miners. This will likely require additional funding which will be difficult under the current macro environment coupled with the departure of its CEO who was pivotal in the company’s previous funding rounds.  Given Hut 8’s large amounts of fixed interest rate debt collateralized by its bitcoin inventory, the company is essentially making a levered bet on bitcoin prices going higher. Any price fluctuations will have a serious impact on both revenue and the value of its assets.  A peculiar accounting change that involved previously recognized impairments on equipment drastically altered the financial results.

42404566,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiuqL,1588105026,"Stacking Sats? Small Bitcoin Holders on the Rise, Data Suggests","New data support the assertion that small bitcoin investors are multiplying rapidly. And anecdotal evidence suggests that much of the growth is taking place in the U.S.      The number of network addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC has continued to hit new all-time highs, climbing to 3,010,784 on Monday, according to data from Glassnode. At the time of publication, 0.1 BTC is worth $770.      These addresses began to increase exponentially around mid-February, coinciding with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s suggestion to lawmakers that the central bank lacked sufficient firepower to fight the next recession.      Inferring definite conclusions about market activity from on-chain metrics is difficult. A user can control multiple addresses, for example, so not every new address represents a new investor. Also, the number of bitcoin wallets with at least 0.1 BTC has grown gradually but consistently after dipping significantly during early 2018, according to Glassnode.      See also: Retail Investors Are Buying the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say      But several U.S.-based bitcoin investment services corroborate the idea that the number of small bitcoin investors is growing at an increased rate.    First-time buyers    Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin investment service based in Los Angeles that “launched in the middle of the COVID-19 panic” has seen “strong uptake” in customers who save “over $300 per month” in bitcoin on average, with some “measuring well into the thousands,” said Yan Pritzker, its co-founder and CTO.      Recently, “a number of Swan customers started raising their [bitcoin] purchase plans,” Pritzker said.      See also: Some US Citizens Look to Be Splashing Their Stimulus Cash on Cryptocurrency      In bitcoin parlance, these users are “stacking sats” – a sat, or satoshi, being the smallest unit of the currency recorded on the blockchain, 0.00000001 BTC.      River Financial, a bitcoin brokerage based in San Francisco, has seen significant growth in customers buying “hundreds to a couple thousand dollars worth of bitcoin,” said Alexander Leishman, its founder and CEO.      “The number of orders on our platform doubled in mid-March, and it has since sustained a significantly elevated rate.” he said. “Many of our clients have directly told me that they are buying bitcoin because the government is printing so much money. A lot of these people are buying bitcoin for the first time.”    Stimulus spending?    Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, shared a cryptic chart earlier in April indicating a spike in the number of Coinbase customers who deposit and execute buy orders for $1,200, the same amount in the stimulus checks sent by the Internal Revenue Service to middle- and lower-income adults. Coinbase is the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange by traded volume, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.      When Armstrong tweeted the Coinbase customer data, $1,200 was worth roughly 0.17 BTC.      “I’m not surprised at the increase in small purchases of bitcoin over the past few months,” said Anil Lulla, a former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of Delphi Digital, a digital asset research firm. “It’s important to note, some of these people wrote off bitcoin in the past and have started to be intrigued, given the macro backdrop.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/stacking-sats-small-bitcoin-holders-on-the-rise-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/965901404dcd080f5de35d6be2e07d4b72cd833e-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiusJ,1588102704,Kyber Network Activity Surges as DEX Plans Switch to Staking Model in Q2,"A planned upgrade that would allow token holders to earn staking income is bringing out users in droves to Kyber Network, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for cryptocurrency trading.      The number of addresses with a balance in Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) – an Ethereum token that fuels operations on the DEX – reached an all-time high of 61,980 on April 27, according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.      The number is up 14% from the tally of 54,210 addresses seen on Jan. 1.      “With more addresses, we are seeing more users and the community trusting and embracing the Kyber’s growth potential,” said John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Signum Capital, which is an investor in Kyber Network.      Kyber's active addresses, price and trading volume have also witnessed solid growth this year.      The number of active addresses using KNC on a given day has increased by over 100% over the last 12 months, as noted by IntoTheBlock’s report.       Meanwhile, the token’s U.S. dollar-denominated price recently rose to nine-month highs near 82 cents in March and was last seen at 67 cents – up 260% on a year-to-date basis, according to data provider Messari.      Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, has added just 8% so far this year, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Daily trading volume surged from $10 million in early January to $240 million in mid-March.      While first-time Kyber users have doubled since the beginning of the year, USD and ether (ETH) volumes on the DEX have more than tripled, according to the network’s official blog.      On March 12, bitcoin crashed by over 40% and extended the decline to levels under $4,000 on the following day, injecting extreme volatility into the broader crypto markets. On March 13, Kyber recorded its highest daily activity with $33.7 million traded over a single 24-hour period.    In search of yield    The surge in investor interest could be attributed to the upcoming protocol upgrade Katalyst, which will allow KNC holders to earn yield on their token and participate in determining and facilitating economic flow on the network. The upgrade is expected to take place at the end of the second quarter.      Backing up a bit, Kyber Network is an on-chain exchange that allows instant trading and conversion of cryptocurrencies and tokens with high liquidity.      It does so with the help of reserve entities – either internal or arranged by third parties – which bring liquidity to the platform; reserve managers who maintain the reserve, calculate exchange rates and feed the data into the network; and the Kyber Network operator, which adds and removes reserve entities.      The reserve managers are required to purchase KNC tokens to operate a reserve on the network, and pay a small KNC fee to Kyber each time a transaction or a token exchange occurs. The fee is then used to reward third parties who bring trading volume to the network and the rest of the tokens are taken out of circulating supply via coin burn.      Put simply, Kyber currently relies on coin burn to provide value to KNC holders.      However, following the impending protocol upgrade, KNC holders will receive a cut of transaction fees in the form of ETH relative to the number of tokens staked. “Also, reserves would get rebates for volume generated and wouldn't have to hold KNC to operate on the network,” said Shane Hong, marketing manager at Kyber Network.      Staking refers to the process of holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations on a blockchain in return for newly minted coins. In layman’s terms, it is similar to earning interest on a fixed income investment like bonds.      Essentially, the protocol upgrade will allow holders to earn yield by staking the tokens.      “These additional ways to generate yield via staking, coupled with token burning is a major incentive to purchase and hold KNC,” said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data. “This could be the reason why we have seen such a drastic rise in the number of addresses holding KNC.”    Pay for participating    Other decentralized exchanges have been turning to staking models that allow holders to generate higher returns as the network grows.      For instance, the Ox protocol implemented a staking system for ZRX token holders in December, when the Ox V3 upgrade went live on Ethereum mainnet.      However, KNC staking will earn rewards only if the holders vote on network issues under a new community platform for decentralized governance.      That platform, known as KyberDAO, is to launch simultaneously with the Katalyst upgrade.      “It will complement the new token model, where KNC holders, who stake KNC, will get to vote for proposals and earn voting rewards in ETH,"" Hong said.      Essentially, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will give more power to the wider community in determining key parameters of the network such as network fees, burning ratios and reserve incentives.      “The fact that holding KNC will allow investors to participate in developing the protocol could also be a prominent reason for the rise in addresses with KNC balances,” said Pangilinan.    DeFi demand    Kyber, being an on-chain liquidity protocol, is also benefiting from the growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, where there is an increased need to swap assets.      In February, bZx, a DeFi lending protocol that uses Kyber Network’s price feed, suffered an oracle attack, which saw a trader walk away with a profit of 2,388 ether ($468,000 as per the latest ETH/USD rate).      Some observers criticized Kyber for low liquidity back then. ""The attack came down to bad price data, specifically from DeFi network Kyber"", bZx co-founder Kyle Kistner told CoinDesk at the time.      That, however, did not have any negative impact on KNC’s price or reputation as a price oracle, or supplier of price information.      “As investors, we watched the fall out happen but KNC held its price and started to bounce back,” said Pangilinan.      KNC’s price rallied by 18% on Feb. 18 – the day the attack took place.      The network is now being used by over 100 decentralized applications, more than 45 reserves and is the most used DeFi project on Ethereum.      New projects including Rarible, Unstoppable Domains, Bullionix, Gelato, and Idle Finance integrated the protocol in March and April.",POSITIVE,KNC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | KNC | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/kyber-network-activity-surges-as-dex-plans-switch-to-staking-model-in-q2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a76bf9e4055c36b6279194ad72176a2a279c824e-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Keep, a project from blockchain venture studio Thesis, operates tBTC in a trustless manner by breaking bitcoin deposits across smart contracts held by various Keep users. Keep also chose staking providers Staked, Figment and Boar Network as partners for staking services.      “Infrastructure is important because if your node is being asked to sign a message or it’s holding onto BTC as one of the shards, you ideally don’t ever want to be offline,” Bison Trails protocol specialist Viktor Bunin told CoinDesk in an interview.

Read more: Why Bison Trails Is Staying the Course on Libra      Thesis launched its Keep protocol Monday with planned integration from 75% of the DeFi market, according to founder and CEO Matt Luongo. The startup raised $7.7 million earlier this month in a token agreement with Paradigm Capital, Fenbushi Capital, Collaborative Fund and others.      Stepping back, Keep allows users to deposit bitcoin on Keep, which can then be deployed onto DeFi protocols for uses such as lending at interest. This benefits users by allowing them to accrue interest; it benefits DeFi protocols by allowing them to lean on bitcoin’s liquidity. Most DeFi applications typically use ether (ETH) or the dai stablecoin as their asset of choice, though both have considerably smaller market caps than that of bitcoin.      Read more: Makers of Keep Protocol Raise $7.7M to Bring Trustless BTC to DeFi      The bitcoin deposits must be protected in order for users to lend, however. This is accomplished through a variety of methods including sharding bitcoin across wallets and putting ETH up as collateral in case a user misbehaves.      Additionally, users can withdraw their bitcoin holdings at any time. This feature reinforces the need for a non-custodial infrastructural provider such as Bison Trails, Luongo said.

42404554,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiudY,1588095939,Crypto Advocate Brian Quintenz Will Step Down From CFTC Role by October,"Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who sponsored the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) and advocated for self regulation in the crypto industry, will leave his post by late October.      Quintenz’s statutory five-year term ends this month. The longtime crypto advocate will not seek renomination and plans to stay on until his successor is appointed, he announced Tuesday in a statement. The departure was first reported by Bloomberg.      The commissioner’s departure comes after a period of technological adaptation at the U.S. government's commodity and futures regulator including the launch of the first bitcoin futures contracts, the evolution of LabCFTC and, more recently, clarification of what actual delivery means in crypto.      It was a period that ran parallel to the resurgence of the TAC.      One month after his confirmation in August 2017, Quintenez became sponsor of the CFTC’s mostly dormant Technology Advisory Committee that had, in his opinion, largely failed to keep pace with technological change in part by meeting just twice in the previous three years.      “Crucial and fascinating questions need to be explored and answered,” he said at the time about many tech initiatives including blockchain. “Distributed ledger technology is on the verge of creating a sea change in contract design, reporting and settlement.”      The Quintenz-sponsored TAC proceeded to form DLT and virtual currency subcommittees and began meeting regularly to consider stablecoins, virtual currencies, DLT market infrastructure, and crypto custody.      “I’ve been particularly honored to sponsor the CFTC’s Technology Advisory Committee, where we’ve had the opportunity to explore the extraordinary technological renaissance transforming our financial markets,” Quintenz said in a statement.      Quintenz also advocated for self-regulation in the crypto industry.      His term ends a few months before that of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.

42404556,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiugV,1588095784,"With Kik and Telegram Cases, the SEC Tries to Kill the SAFT","Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk's Opinion section, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      At the tail end of last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a motion for summary judgment in its litigation against Kik.      By way of background, Kik was a (failing) instant messenger product backed by a number of VCs including Union Square Ventures’ Fred Wilson, who at one point sat on the company’s board. To revive its fortunes, in 2017 the company decided to launch an $100 million Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, whereby the company offered tokens called “kin” to be used as payment tokens within a to-be-built “Kin Ecosystem” led by none other than Kik itself.      As to the sale of tokens, Kik wrote in its white paper:    In order to finance the Kin roadmap, Kik will conduct a token distribution event that will offer for sale one trillion units out of a 10 trillion unit total supply of Kin. The proceeds of the token distribution event will be used to fund operations and to deploy the Kin Foundation. A portion of the funds raised in the token distribution event will be used to execute upon the roadmap of additional feature development planned for the Kin integration into Kik.    Recalling briefly that the common-law Howey Test for determining whether a scheme is a security for the purposes of U.S. law (and therefore subject to securities regulation) is “[a] an investment, contract, or scheme involving [b] the investment of money [c] into a common enterprise with [d] the expectation of profits [e] arising from the efforts of a promoter or third party,” what Kik described in its white paper sounds like it ticks rather a lot of those boxes.      See also: Preston Byrne - How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      Suffice it to say, Kik disagrees with that assessment, arguing purchasers of kin neither (a) were investing in a common enterprise nor (b) were they done with the expectation of profits nor (c) were they made to the investing public, being conducted under a private placement exemption under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under a contract for the sale of tokens known as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, or a “SAFT” for short.      The SAFT, for those of you who have not seen one, is a contract that forms part of a two-step coin issuance structure pioneered by a number of white shoe law firms in New York back in the 2017-18 period.      The SAFT allowed token issuers to sell a promise of future token delivery to investors rather than selling the tokens themselves to investors. The logic behind this approach was selling tokens directly to investors ran the risk of turning those tokens into securities for the purposes of U.S. law, with attendant regulatory consequences. As the legal status of tokens sold directly for investment purposes was, at least among firms whose books of business swelled with token issuers, uncertain back in 2016-17, the SAFT promised certainty to investors by treating at least the initial transaction unambiguously as a securities offering.      On delivery of a functional network at a later date, when the note converted into tokens, the tokens would lose their character as securities and instead became “utility tokens.” At that point, they would function as, and be regulated as, any other licensed software product, save that these “utility tokens” would be run on decentralized networks rather than being used to purchase software from a central provider.    Once regarded as compliance best practice in the cryptocurrency industry, [the SAFT] will be greatly diminished in its usefulness in the U.S.    This approach should be contrasted to industry practices in the 2013-16 period, when coin issuers usually sold their tokens directly to the investing public. The SEC undertook little enforcement except in cases of egregious fraud such as, for example, the Josh Garza/Paycoin Ponzi scheme which collapsed in early 2014.      From mid-2017 onwards, following the SEC's “DAO Report of Investigation,” which was widely regarded as a warning shot towards coin issuers, industry best practice evolved so that virtually all tokens sold in the United States by reputable projects were issued by SAFT and not directly to the public.      See also: Preston Byrne - Post COVID-19, Companies Must Be Resilient, Not Just Efficient      Although there are some systems for which the “utility token” argument might make sense (systems which use on-chain tokens to regulate bandwidth or decentralized storage, for example), there are many others for which it does not. Personally, Telegram’s TON and Kik’s kin strike me as not serving any functionality other than being a money-substitute and investment vehicle, although whether this is legally the case will depend on the outcome of the litigation.      The SEC appears to be trying to look through the two-step SAFT issuance process that became so common in the 2017-19 period, arguing it was an intermediate step was an artificial attempt to skirt securities laws. In both Telegram and Kik the commission says distributing tokens to investors in a SAFT with a view to onward distribution in the U.S. by those investors is not, in fact, a private placement but a preparatory step for a public offering via cryptocurrency exchanges, with the SAFT holders being regulated not as investors, but as as statutory underwriters for onward distribution to the public. This conduct is, of course, prohibited under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, unless a registration statement has been approved by the SEC and the tokens are regulated as securities.      In a ruling granting the SEC a permanent injunction against Telegram last month, the court referred to the two-step SAFT-then-distribute-in-America as “a disguised public distribution.” In Kik, the SEC asks the court to do so once again. The commission alleges Kik failed to comply with the exemption from registration under rule 506(c) of Regulation D because Kik sold kin to both retail mom & pop investors and sophisticated accredited investors at the same time. Furthermore, citing Telegram, it argues “the portion of Kik’s offering to SAFT participants… was a public distribution of securities with the SAFT participants serving as statutory underwriters.”      See also: SEC Opposes Blockchain Association’s Brief Supporting Kik, Says Group Isn’t ‘Neutral’      For its part, Kik disputes this, arguing it was a separate offering of a software product that was meant to be used, rather than speculated upon: “Kik never advertised Kin as a passive investment… [it] repeatedly emphasized that Kin would be a medium of exchange in this new economy of digital services.”      The messages the government is sending are somewhat mixed. For example, Coinbase Pro lists a number of pre-sold tokens that differ very little from kin or TON in their manner of sale, but against which no enforcement has, at least publicly, yet taken place.      Prudence dictates that until further guidance is available, token protocol developers exercise extreme caution. If the SEC succeeds in this motion for summary judgment, the SAFT structure, which was once regarded as compliance best practice in the cryptocurrency industry, will be greatly diminished in its usefulness in the U.S.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Preston J.

CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk his firm plans to enforce its patents “for defensive purposes only,” a pledge that could allow independent developers, and even other organizations, to copy Blockstack’s patented designs.      “This pledge means that we’ll never use our patents to try to sue innovators who are helping to build a user-owned internet, and we’ll use the patents defensively only when someone is trying to stifle that innovation,” a document shared with CoinDesk reads.      Blockstack – whose anti-Google slogan is “Can’t Be Evil” – has effectively pledged to not initiate infringement lawsuits against open source developers. The legal goodwill does not appear to extend ad infinitum, though. Blockstack’s “defensive purposes” definition covers economic activities such as the selling, leasing and licensing of Blockstack intellectual property.      Read more: Blockstack Wins Patent for Its Dapp Single Sign-On Product      The legal vow applies to Blockstack’s two patents, both relatively new. Its first patent, covering a dapp single sign-in feature, was granted in late March and the second patent, for decentralized data migration, was issued Tuesday.    Balancing priorities    Ali said Blockstream’s patent strategy is a pragmatic adaptation to the realities of U.S. patent culture.      Pointing to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s first-to-file policy, Ali said tech giants such as IBM and Microsoft have staked their blockchain claims at a blistering clip.      “The large tech monopolies are a big problem already,” he said, “and if they potentially try to hurt the future roadmap of our open source project with patents that’s a very negative outcome for us.”      Read more: Blockstack Opens Testnet for New Bitcoin-Linked Consensus Mechanism      Blockstack decided to protect its roadmap with patents covering “core innovations.” It was an intellectual property imperative in an environment where others might have tried to exploit Blockstack’s designs, Ali said. “It was the best path forward for us,” he added.      Defensive patents aim to walk that fine legal line, Ali said. Blockstack will refrain from suing infringers that build on patents in an open source and innovative manner. It may nonetheless enforce patents against infringers who are “trying to stifle innovation,” according to the company’s pledge.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/blockstack-pledges-to-enforce-patents-for-defensive-purposes-only,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5054978e3dc14ef28832f48ca865b319a2016d0d-2047x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404539,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirrN,1588089657,OpenLaw Launches First 'Legal DAO' for Distributed VC Investments,"A new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on Ethereum has legal protections baked right into the cake.      OpenLaw’s LAO, or “Limited Liability Autonomous Organization,” opened Tuesday for investors looking to compliantly earn returns on the next wave of Ethereum-based projects.      By creating a distributed group of investors, initially capped at 100, the LAO seeks to legitimize new forms of venture capital investment, OpenLaw CEO Aaron Wright said in an interview.      “People can begin to explore what it’s like to band together online and collect capital and make investments and operate purely digital,” Wright said.      While the project is open to international participation, only accredited investors in the U.S. can join in.      See also: How This ‘Legal Wrapper’ for DAOs Could Democratize Venture Capital      First announced in September at ETHBerlin, the LAO starts with an LLC wrapper registered in the U.S. state of Delaware. Users can put ether (ETH) – at a minimum of 120 ETH (roughly $23,000 at current prices) – into the smart contract, vote and perhaps accrue payout based on those investments. For Wright and OpenLaw, the takeaway lies in how the market moves money out of investors’ hands and into promising cryptocurrency projects.      If Coinbase legitimized the model first put forth by Mt. Gox, Wright said, the LAO could do the same for DAOs, which have seen a relative comeback in the past year.      Read more: New Interest in DAOs Prompts Old Question: Are They Legal?      Technically speaking, the LAO will host multiple projects, which will sign over tokenized shares of stocks in exchange for investors’ ETH. Only accredited investors in the U.S. can take part in the LAO. The original DAO – which was drained 3.6 million ETH in an infamous 2016 hack – faced legal scrutiny due to concerns it constituted an unregulated securities offering.      Shares can be purchased in what Wright called “blocks” of 1 percent of 120 ETH. Up to 9 percent of shares can be purchased worth 1,080 ETH, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.      Wright said the firm will spin up many LAOs depending on demand with each one eyeing $2.5 million in funding.      Read more: Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin Back $700K Donation to Ethereum Project MolochDAO      Compliance with regulation is one way to fix perception issues with DAOs. The capital pooling method soured after the 2016 hack, which then spurred a major fork in the Ethereum ecosystem, leading to the creation of both ethereum and ethereum classic (ETC).      One interesting variation in these capital projects versus traditional finance is the ability to “Rage Quit,” or pull out funds whenever an investor chooses.

42404545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirwI,1588089306,Bitcoin’s Halving Is Irrelevant for Some Large Traders,"Bitcoin's third halving is less than two weeks away. Google searches indicate an all-time high level of interest in this event, the third in the life of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.      But some traders say the halving won't be the bullish catalyst many expect: They say it doesn’t matter. Rather, they are focused on other macroeconomic catalysts, including unprecedented central bank monetary policies, that may drive bitcoin’s price in the coming months and years.      Most people are just “spinning their wheels” debating the bullish halving thesis, Matthew Kaye, managing partner at Blockhead Capital, told CoinDesk. Some market data suggests traders “may see increased demand in the form of diverted mining resources in addition to the reduction in new supply” after the halving, he said.      Bitcoin halving events occur every four years when block rewards paid to bitcoin miners are cut by 50 percent. The current block reward of 12.5 BTC will fall to 6.25 BTC in May.      “The supply shock of the halving is negligible compared to the regular trading volumes of exchanges,” said Francis Pouliot, CEO of Canadian over-the-counter bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin. In the long term, however, a “loss of confidence in other assets” makes him “insanely bullish” on bitcoin, said Pouliot.      The “marketing impact” of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing efforts is “incomparably higher than the very predictable, thus boring, halving,” Pouliot said.      Queries about the May halving have already eclipsed searches for “bitcoin halving” that took place ahead of bitcoin’s second halving in 2016. Search interest is expected to acutely increase over the coming weeks, according to Google’s data.      Bitcoin options markets reflect a similar hesitation to view the halving as a bullish event. The put-call open interest ratio has climbed steadily through the month of April, according to data from Skew, which suggests the market is more focused on hedging against bitcoin’s downside risk as the halving approaches.      “There’s usually an unexpected pullback after the halving,” said Zoran Scekic, managing partner at Zorax Capital.      Call options give the holder the right, though not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a set price on or before a specific date. Put options give the right to sell.      “Most fundamental-based bull cases on the having have little merit, but the halving is a good marketing event,” said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari. “I’m not confident bitcoin will be able to decouple from other asset classes while macro uncertainty overhangs, at least in the short term and around the halving,” said Watkins.      Other recent halving events can help set expectations for bitcoin’s third halving, according to some investors. Litecoin and bitcoin cash already experienced similar halving events in August 2019 and April 2020, respectively.      “Bitcoin cash now trades lower against bitcoin, having gone down from 0.035 pre-halving to about 0.032 today,” said Max Boonen, founder of B2C2, a prominent over-the-counter liquidity provider. “To argue that bitcoin will rally where its cousin bitcoin cash didn't is similar to saying that the bitcoin market is less efficient. That seems hard to me,” said Boonen.      Bitcoin closed its sixth consecutive weekly gain on Sunday, according to Bitstamp. Bitcoin has not closed more than two consecutive weekly gains since May 2019 when the price rallied from $5,000 to $9,000.

Further, a U.S. District Judge allowed the Blockchain Association to file a brief a day after the SEC filed an objection. Read more here.      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved to oppose the Blockchain Association from providing evidence to the court.      Filed last week with the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the U.S. financial watchdog requested the court deny the Blockchain Association's motion for leave to file an amicus, or friend of the court, brief – a non-partisan filing intended to assist the court by providing information, expertise and insight – arguing many association members have a vested interest in Kik's success.      The SEC said seven companies in the 24-member association have a direct financial interest in the outcome of the case: four members, including Polychain Capital and eToro, have a direct investment in Kin tokens; USV holds equity in the company; CoinList performed due diligence for the Kin offering; and Cumberland handled the liquidation of some of the offering's proceeds.      Arguing the Blockchain Association – which includes Coinbase, Kraken and 0x among its members – ""is hardly ""objective, dispassionate [or] neutral,"" the regulator even alleged the brief could well be financed by the multi-million dollar ""DefendCrypto"" litigation fund, which is overseen by the Blockchain Association and received a $2 million donation from Kik, its original founder, last year.

In their role of providing information for the benefit of the court, friend of the court briefs are usually required to stick close to the facts. Many advocacy groups specialize in providing these types of filings and attorneys are able to focus on the facts and evidence that appear to be most favorable to their clients.

42421889,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwp7V,1588085598,Bitfinex,"Founded and operated by iFinex, Inc. in Hong Kong in 2012 and registered in the British Virgin Islands, Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange. The three core features that Bitfinex offers are exchange trading, margin trading and margin funding. Furthermore iFinex Inc. operates both Bitfinex and Tether Ltd., the company behind the tether stablecoin.  Bitfinex has been hacked multiple times since its launch. In 2015, roughly 1,500 bitcoin were stolen from the exchange, worth roughly $400,000 at the time. In 2016, more than $60 million worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen from customer’s accounts. Bitfinex found multiple ways to refund the accounts for the first hack, varying from offering company equity to reimbursing victims with more money per bitcoin than at the point of the hack. Bitfinex shared the loss across all customer accounts, where every user would see a 36 percent loss on their account. To account for this loss, the company issued debt tokens (BFX) to their clients that could be used towards company equity or could be redeemed by Bitfinex.  In 2019, two Israeli brothers, Eli and Assaf Gigi, were arrested for their participation in the 2016 hack and some of the funds retrieved by the U.S. government were returned to their owners.  In 2019, New York Attorney General Letitia James obtained a court order against iFinex Inc. alleging that they used Tether funds to cover up an $850 million loss to Crypto Capital Corp.  Later in 2019, Bitfinex issued its own token, LEO. LEO is intended to optimize the trading process within the ecosystem. According to the white paper, some of the benefits of LEO will be a reduction in fees for lenders and takers that use Bitfinex as well as withdrawal and deposit fee reduction within the exchange. At the time of the sale, some alleged that Bitfinex was selling its tokens to make up for the $850 million loss. Bitfinex started buying back and burning LEO tokens from investors in June 2019.

The company revealed Tuesday it would join the Libra Association in developing its series of stablecoins. Libra was announced last year as an effort to create a single global currency that could expand financial services to anyone who had a smartphone and an internet connection, though some of these ambitions have since been scaled back.      Backed by Insight Partners, DST Global, Singapore's sovereign Wealth Fund, Blossom Capital and Endeavor Catalyst in a fundraising round last year, the company focuses on cross border payments, one area Libra originally hoped to reduce friction when first announced last year, according to Forbes.      ""Everything we do is to improve our merchants’ businesses by helping to optimize their payments function and drive operational efficiencies,"" CEO Guillaume Pousaz wrote in a blog post. ""This allows them to serve more customers, in more geographies, gaining the most value out of their transactions.""      The group had already been interested in how blockchain tools could improve the way transactions are processed worldwide, he wrote. However, he said a strong regulatory framework is necessary to ensure a ""secure and stable payments infrastructure,"" one which would aid in adoption.      Read more: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      The Libra Association shares this view, he wrote.      Pousaz also pointed to financial inclusion, one of the stated goals of the Libra Association, as another area in which his company hopes to help.      ""It is obvious to me and the wider Checkout.com team that we want to be part of this effort and can contribute to this endeavor by bringing our unparalleled payments engineering expertise,"" Pousaz said.      In a statement, Libra Association head of policy and communications Dante Disparte welcomed the company to the organization.      The news comes a week after the global nonprofit Heifer International announced it had also joined, and makes Libra the 24th member of the organization.      Libra was originally announced with 28 starting members, although several withdrew before the organization was formally chartered due to regulatory concerns and pressure. Vodafone also withdrew earlier this year to focus on its own native digital payment system, M-Pesa.

42404541,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirtL,1588078800,CipherTrace’s New Crypto Tracing Tool Is Meant for Banks,"Crypto investigations firm CipherTrace has developed a bank transaction monitoring tool, CipherTrace Armada, that flags payments to high-risk virtual asset service providers (VASPs).      Announced Tuesday, Armada sifts through banking indicators such as routing and account numbers in search of transactions that may present institutional risk including payments to crypto ATMs, which have been tied to money laundering.      Armada differs from many investigations programs in its focus on payments across established financial infrastructure. Many other crypto analytics tools – including those from CipherTrace – trace payments between wallet addresses as they scout out potential troublespots, bypassing the banks. Such programs often appeal to exchanges and law enforcement investigators.      In contrast, Armada is a tool for the banks. It “plugs into” their existing transaction monitoring systems, said John Jefferies, chief financial analyst for CipherTrace. There, it monitors illicit activity via machine learning, clustering algorithms and CipherTrace’s database of high-risk entities.      This “enables Armada to catch money services businesses (MSB) that may be obscuring their true nature through different names or hidden accounts,” said Vice President of Product Management Catherine Woneis.      See Also: PayPal Joins $4.2M Round for Crypto Banking Compliance Startup      CipherTrace offered the case of unlicensed bitcoin seller Kunal Kalra as an example of how Armada could be used. Kalra pled guilty last August to running an unlicensed crypto MSB for darknet drug dealers, using fake names, bank transfers to a Gemini account and an anonymous bitcoin ATM to exchange up to $25 million in cash and crypto total.      Kalra’s three-year campaign was ultimately busted by federal investigators. Armada would have flagged Kalra’s activity with the banks, CipherTrace said.      Jefferies said Armada will also help improve ties between legitimate VASPs and their bankers,      “Armada helps VASPs open and keep bank accounts, which is critically important because they typically have problems maintaining banker relationships that can lead to risky behaviour,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/ciphertraces-new-crypto-tracing-tool-is-meant-for-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ad8c9ebdfdd30722951a0379408c164e7285a64-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404546,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdis0E,1588073431,"First Mover: Two Weeks From Halving, Bitcoin Rally Brings $10K Into View","Bitcoin has strung together seven consecutive daily gains, something that hasn't happened since the price shot up to last year's high around $13,000 in July.      The cryptocurrency's price now stands at over $7,750, up 8 percent so far in 2020.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      And with the Bitcoin blockchain's once-every-four-years rewards halving now just two weeks away, some analysts are starting to fix their sights on the next upside target: $10,000.      “Look for prices to attempt the $10,000 level on speculative buzz leading into the halving,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Keneti Capital, told CoinDesk.      ""A break above $10,000 would be significant from both a psychological and a technical standpoint,"" the research firm Delphi Digital wrote Monday in a note.      ""With everything going on right now, it could also just bust through the top and zoom toward the next point of resistance, possibly near $10,000,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, told clients.      The emerging price target represents a 29-percent increase from current levels, but bitcoin had traded as high as $10,500 in February prior to the coronavirus sell-off. According to Delphi Digital, any price rise could gather steam if bitcoin crosses above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, now around $8,000.      Bitcoin's third halving since its launch in 2009 is two weeks away: According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown clock, it's estimated to take place on May 12.      Investors continue to debate whether the halving will actually spur a big rally in bitcoin's price, or if the event is already baked into the market, merely an overhyped narrative pushed by bulls. One analysis published Monday on Medium by a poster under the name ""PlanB"" predicted that bitcoin's price could increase 37-fold to $288,000 by 2024, citing an increasingly cited metric known as the ""stock-to-flow model.""      Before the coronavirus hit, the halving was supposed to be bitcoin's biggest calendar item of 2020. Now, traders are scrambling to adjust their forecasts to square the deflationary impact of the global recession with the potentially inflationary impact of trillions of dollars of Federal Reserve money injections. Bitcoin is seen by many cryptocurrency investors as a hedge against inflation.      This week, the Fed's monetary policy committee will hold its first regularly scheduled two-day meeting since the pandemic sent global markets reeling, and Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday is expected to update investors on the outcome of the closed-door discussions. According to German lender Deutsche Bank, the U.S. central bank could start looking for ways to stimulate an economic recovery – pivoting past the emergency actions taken in recent months to keep markets from collapsing.      Joshua Frank, CEO of The Tie, a provider of data on digital assets, told CoinDesk this month that any price impact from the halving might look puny compared with the massive economic upheaval and government response.      The Congressional Budget Office projected Friday the U.S. federal budget deficit will reach $3.7 trillion in fiscal 2020 – nearly four times the $1 trillion gap estimated as recently as March. Such an imbalance would boost U.S. debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, to 101 percent.      Six years ago, the CBO predicted the ratio would reach 100 percent somewhere around 2039. In other words, the milestone is on track to arrive some two decades early.  ""At some point, investors would begin to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its debt obligations,"" the CBO wrote in a July 2014 post.  Better add that to bitcoin's 2020 calendar.  ""The perfect macro storm is now upon us, one about which many crypto investors have dreamt about since entering this asset class,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for cryptocurrency fund firm Arca, wrote Monday.  The halving is imminent, though, so it's taking center stage.  Kraken, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced Monday it would host an Ask Us Anything session about the halving, featuring Business Development Director Dan Held and Bitcoin Strategist Pierre Rochard, moderated by Pete Rizzo, the exchange's editor-at-large.  The session will offer ""tips for translating tough bitcoin concepts to friends and family,"" according to a post on Kraken's website.  Those might include a delicate explanation of how bitcoin might benefit from a global pandemic and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin's ascent looks to have paused amid mixed action in the global equity markets and a renewed sell-off in oil.      The top cryptocurrency is trading near $7,760 at press time, having failed twice in the last 24 hours to post sustainable gains above $7,800. Prices have risen by nearly $1,000 in the last seven days, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Most analysts expect bitcoin to rise well above $8,000 in the short term on the speculative buzz leading into the halving – the supply cutting event due on May 12. However, further gains may not be seen immediately if the latest oil price slide destabilizes the traditional markets.      The front-month June futures contract on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is down over 18 percent at $10.40 per barrel at press time. The sell-off gathered steam Monday after the United States Oil Fund LP, the biggest oil exchange-traded fund, said it is planning to take out all funds invested in the June WTI contract.      The oil price slide looks to have applied the brakes to the global equity market rally, which had picked up the pace on the Bank of Japan's unlimited stimulus plan. Asian stocks lacked consensus early on Monday, as indices in Japan, Australia and China suffered moderate losses, while shares in South Korea and Hong Kong eked out gains.      While major European indices are currently reporting moderate gains, futures tied to the S&P 500 indicate the index is likely to open on a flat note, having rallied by 1.4 percent on Monday.      If equities turn risk averse, tracking the decline in oil, buying interest around bitcoin could weaken, allowing a daily price drop for the first time in over a week. A bearish divergence of the four-hour chart relative strength index favors a price pullback to support at $7,500.      But any losses could be short-lived because dip demand is likely to be strong, courtesy of the bullish narrative surrounding the halving.      Notable long-duration indicators are also beginning to roll over in favor of the bulls. For instance, the weekly Chaikin money flow indicator, which takes into account both volumes and prices, has crossed above zero, indicating a bullish reversal.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/first-mover-two-weeks-from-halving-bitcoin-rally-brings-10k-into-view,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4fa0edbd18f76a27346aae9494a8977d64940d9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404543,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirxH,1588072820,Bitcoin Rally Pauses Near $7.8K After Longest Winning Run in 8 Months,"Bitcoin's bulls are taking a breather, having engineered the longest run of daily gains since last summer.      At press time, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading in a sideways manner around $7,730 on major exchanges, representing a 0.60 percent decline on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The lackluster trading comes a day after prices hit a 6.5-week high of $7,800. Notably, the cryptocurrency has eked out modest gains in each of the last seven days. Bitcoin last rallied for seven straight days in July 2019.      The seven-day winning trend (above right) from July 30 to Aug. 5, 2019, saw prices rise by over $2,600 to highs near $12,000. While the upward move was bigger than the latest $1,000 rise from $6,800 to $7,800, it was short-lived and reversed in the following 10 days.      Meanwhile, most analysts are anticipating an extension of the recent uptrend, possibly to $10,000, in the days leading up to the mining reward halving, due on May 12.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Some observers, however, think the cryptocurrency could witness a pullback before breaking above $8,000 in a convincing manner.      ""Feels like we have gone quite far over the last week and now there's every chance of a small pullback (perhaps as far as to $7,000) over the course of the next few days,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      To make $8,000 a tough task, bitcoin is also approaching a cluster of resistance levels lined up in the $7,800 to $8,000 range.    Daily chart    To start with, the $7,800-$7,900 area has offered strong support and resistance over the last year. ""Technically its quite a large resistance for bitcoin to break,"" said Jones.      Further, the 200- and 100-day averages are lined up at $7,978 and $7,973, respectively.      If these levels prove a tough nut to crack, the market may test dip demand, or buyers' resolve to keep the upward trend on track, by revisiting support at $7,469 (April 7 high) and $7,300 (April 18 high).      Alternatively, a high-volume move above $8,000 would shift the focus to the resistance of the trendline connecting Feb. 13 and Feb. 18 highs at $8,275.      The odds of bitcoin rising to $10,000 ahead of halving, as suggested by Jehan Chu, co-founder at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic on Monday, would strengthen if the descending trendline resistance is breached.    4-hour chart    The 4-hour chart is reporting conflicting signals.      While the bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) indicates scope for a price pullback, the symmetrical triangle breakout confirmed on Monday suggests the path of least resistance is to the higher side.      Price patterns usually take precedence over indicators. However, in this case the odds of a pullback, as suggested by the RSI, look strong as the cryptocurrency has already failed twice to chew through resistance at $7,800.

42404535,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiroQ,1588068000,World Economic Forum Shares Roadmap for Deploying Blockchains in Real World,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) is pitching blockchain as the savior of failing global supply chains and says its blockchain deployment toolkit, published Tuesday, is the roadmap to launch.      Responding to the economic stresses of COVID-19, which has frozen global consumer demand and also exposed life-and-death holes in existing supply chains, the Swiss NGO best known for its glitzy Davos summit published “Redesigning Trust: Blockchain Deployment Toolkit,” a guide to building more resilient supply chains on distributed ledgers.      The 244-page report includes checklists, guided questions, explainers and risk assessments addressing tax concerns and data privacy; forming a consortium, its ecosystem and governance; public vs. private chains; cybersecurity; interoperability; and digital identity, among other concerns. The toolkit is less a barometer for deciding if blockchain fits one’s scenario than it is a guide to implementing DLT within that scenario effectively.      For example, one section considers how zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, role-based access controls and off-chain hashing configurations may offer workarounds for the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping internet privacy law whose right to data erasure is at seemingly existential odds with blockchain’s distributed and immutable nature.      The toolkit frames blockchain as a natural technological evolution for companies and governments emerging from this public health crisis.      ""The case for blockchain is stronger as the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for more resilient global supply chains, trusted data and an economic recovery enabled through trade digitization,"" the report's authors wrote.    Blockchain and the coronavirus    Development of the toolkit predated the COVID-19 crisis by more than a year, but its release was fast-tracked in light of the virus, said Nadia Hewett, the forum’s blockchain and digital currency lead and one of the toolkit’s main authors. It is perhaps more timely in the shadow of the generational shock to public health and economies alike.      The virus that first froze China did the same nearly everywhere over vast swaths of the globe. Economies rolled into turmoil as governments grappled with a false choice – shutter the businesses or risk catastrophic infection rates – before ultimately siding with public health, a choice even Federal Reserve researchers called an economic no-brainer.      Consequently, the coronavirus reshaped global trade in ways that are still developing and whose long-term implications will not fully be known for months or more. Along with supply chains frozen by their economies' respective inactivity, there’s also questions of overall supply chain resiliency that the World Economic Forum has itself argued blockchain can fix.      Read More: Why the World Economic Forum Is Creating a Blockchain ‘Bill of Rights’      Blockchain “is not a silver bullet,” Hewett said. “It's not going to solve it all, but it absolutely has features that can help with issues that's typical in epidemics and pandemics.”      Hewett said blockchain could help overcome medical equipment provenance issues that opportunistic scammers have exploited, tricking small-scale orders and even medical centers into spending emergency funds on worthless fake masks. This is a problem blockchain’s peer-to-peer immutability can address, Hewett said.      On a broader scale, Hewett said the pandemic may make companies of all sizes reconsider their technological reliance networks and “push ahead” with improvements they began developing during past crises but fizzled as triggers event receded. COVID-19 appears to be a more resilient call to arms, she said.      “This time we really do see a big momentum behind making sure this time that they capture the momentum and that we bake into our solutions day-to-day elements but also that could help during a disruption,"" she said. “Post-COVID, that future state, let's work toward and shape the outcome in a way that promotes interoperability, integrity, and inclusivity.""    Public-private partnership    The WEF worked with both private companies and government entities to ensure the guide provided the most helpful advice.      “You can use it to navigate end-to-end for deployment guidance, you can choose the specific topic of interest for you or your team,” Hewett said.      Hewett also noted the lag some global regulators have had in coming to grips with this new technology class.      “These technologies are moving incredibly fast,” Hewett said. “Your traditional ways of regulation and waiting are not going to work.”      The guidebook tries to inject “agility” into that regulatory dance by compiling the experiences of 80 companies, 40 use cases and 20 governments that have faced blockchain-for-supply-chain questions before.      Read More: World Economic Forum Looks to Blockchain for Supply Chain Woes      Hewett said this public and private sector collaboration was critical. The toolkit “covers topics which aren’t always that obvious to technologists or business leaders,” she said, and offers guidance informed by others’ mistakes.      One startup’s late-stage realization that its upcoming blockchain deployment had tax implications led the guide to include an entire section on tax considerations, Hewett said.      “The toolkit as a minimum forces organizations to ask themselves those questions and make sure it is considered,” she said.      Collective deployment experiences, now compiled in a public document, will help small and medium sized enterprises (SME) cut past marketing storylines to reach the how-to of blockchain implementation, a previously costly proposition, she said.      “We can put this in the hands of those parts of the world, those parts of the supply chains, where they’re not empowered with information to negotiate good positions for themselves. We really hope to see this put power back in the hands of those SMEs,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/world-economic-forum-shares-roadmap-for-deploying-blockchains-in-real-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4da79d5d01f119d9408b8f81db8dc9b3402ddede-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirmS,1588060800,Why a Startup You've Never Heard of Is Now Sponsoring a Bitcoin Core Developer,"There are roughly 15 known entities sponsoring Bitcoin Core developers in 2020, and the Wyoming-based startup CardCoins just became one of the smallest industry players to join the pack.      CardCoins has helped “over 10,000 unique users” convert gift cards into bitcoin, according to a spokesperson, with ""millions of dollars of volume” last year. That healthy-yet-modest traction, which increased slightly since the recession hit, is dwarfed by incumbent crypto exchanges and custody providers.      Out of the most well-capitalized crypto companies, BitMEX, Bitfinex, OKCoin and Xapo are the few that help support developers working full time on bitcoin’s fundamental software. This is the trunk and roots of the crypto industry.      The nonprofit hub sponsoring the most Bitcoin Core contributors to date, Chaincode Labs, was forced to postpone its annual summer residency due to the coronavirus crisis. Adam Jonas, head of special projects at Chaincode Labs, said the nonprofit currently sponsors seven developers and intends to continue educational residency programs later this year.      Bitcoin advocates have historically criticized exchanges such as Coinbase for not contributing more to these independent, open source developers.      Sometimes it can be easy to lose sight of the fact this multibillion-dollar industry, with companies like Binance that employ hundreds of people, relies on software maintained by just a few dozen people and occasional volunteers. The CardCoins spokesperson said there “aren’t many people to pick from,” with regards to prolific contributors who aren’t already on the above-mentioned payrolls.      So in March, as the Great Lockdown derailed summer plans to train more developers, CardCoins partnered with the fintech company Payvant to split a one-year grant for the Ukrainian contributor Hennadii Stepanov, who goes by Hebasto.      “As business owners and bitcoiners ourselves, we’re grateful to the folks that work on the low-level, nitty-gritty stuff,” CardCoins said in a statement. “We don't see a world in which we work with a successful bitcoin company and that company doesn't also give back to the community.""    Focusing on bitcoin    Thanks to this grant, Stepanov said, he quit his job at a local university and can now focus on bitcoin full time. He quickly went from discovering bitcoin in 2017 to making a small contribution in 2018, an issue he found when setting up his own node. Now he’s among the world’s most prolific contributors.      “Decentralizing should be on all levels, including contributions,” Hebasto said. “I saw how the bitcoin developer community embraced me as a first-time contributor. They share knowledge. I like those people. I like to learn from them.”      Although CardCoins has seen a modest incline in the past few months, this move wasn’t inspired by extra cash to spend. Instead, the startup co-sponsored the grant because keeping bitcoin decentralized is fundamental to the firm’s business model.      “Peer review is the cornerstone of Bitcoin Core and keeping bitcoin safe, generally,” the spokesperson said. “He [Stepanov] is making sure that Bitcoin Core will run on many different platforms in a safe way.”      Most CardCoins users convert gift cards into bitcoin in under an hour using a phone number and a few pictures of the receipt and card details. This allows the startup to serve underbanked clients attracted to bitcoin’s censorship-resistant properties.      “We’ve made enormous investments in compliance and our programs and procedures have been overseen by a former federal prosecutor,” CardCoins said of the mission to serve this user group without regulatory arbitrage. “Those customers are vital to the lifeblood of bitcoin.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/28/why-a-startup-youve-never-heard-of-is-now-sponsoring-a-bitcoin-core-developer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae8e937b7bfbde27a342a77885e9e8452373d7c4-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiruK,1588053600,"Libra Has a Flawed Crisis Model, Says Ex-IMF Economist","A former senior policy adviser to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said libra's ill-defined relationship with the Federal Reserve has pushed those behind libra to adopt emergency protocols similar to the ones the U.S. ditched more than 100 years ago.      American economist Barry Eichengreen, who was an IMF policy adviser in the late 1990s, said in a blog post Saturday with fellow academic Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj that emergency protections found in the revised libra white paper were similar to the clearinghouse certificates the U.S. used to prevent bank runs prior to the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913.      It isn't obvious whether the Fed would step in to help the proposed currency in an emergency to act as a lender of last resort, write Eichengreen and Viswanath-Natraj. Libra's white paper instead proposes the network operators could issue ""redemption stays"" to prevent funds being taken out of the Libra Reserve – the reserve of real assets that underpin libra's value – or charge additional penalties to those still wanting early redemption.      ""Financial historians will recognize these devices for what they are. They resemble the clearinghouse certificates issued by bank groups in the U.S. in the 19th century in response to bank runs and financial crises,"" say Eichengreen and Viswanath-Natraj.      See also: Facebook’s ‘Scaled Back’ Libra Proposal Is More Dangerous Than You Think      Beginning in the 1850s, the U.S. relied on a network of privately owned clearinghouses to prevent bank runs through issuing loan certificates. The idea was these would act as a form of quasi-currency that could take over as a means of payment when market confidence in notes issued by a single bank hit rock bottom.      But as Eichengreen and Viswanath-Natraj argue, this private clearinghouse system ""created a situation where not every dollar was as good as every other dollar. It was this unsatisfactory state of affairs that led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.""      It appears Eichengreen and Viswanath-Natraj believe libra's emergency protocols could simply be a stopgap until such time as a clearer relationship with the Fed is defined. They cite parts of the libra white paper that say an unspecified ""third-party administrator"" could be brought in to provide emergency liquidity in a crisis.      But that all depends on whether the Fed chooses to support libra. Eichengreen and Viswanath-Natraj argue that ""the authors of the [white paper] have doubts about whether the Fed will be a compliant lender of last resort to the market in LibraUSD.""      See also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      Libra's revised white paper, released earlier this month, dropped the original plan to launch one digital asset that would be pegged to a basket of 30 fiat currencies in favor of issuing a handful of stablecoins each pegged 1:1 with a different fiat currency.      The change was a major concession to the politicians and central bankers who said libra could become a rival to the currencies issued by governments.      Eichengreen and Viswanath-Natraj argue there are still unanswered questions to how libra could affect monetary sovereignty. ""If residents of another country shift into LibraUSD, that country’s central bank will lose the ability to earn seigniorage. It will lose control of monetary conditions. It will lose the ability to backstop local financial markets,"" the blog post reads.

42404537,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirqO,1588047488,Chinese City Known for Bitcoin Mining Seeks Blockchain Firms to Burn Excess Hydropower,"A Chinese city in the world's bitcoin mining hub is publicly encouraging the blockchain industry to help consume excessive hydroelectricity ahead of the summer rainy season.      Ya'an, one of the many cities in China's mountainous Sichuan province, a region that's estimated to account for over 50 percent of the Bitcoin network's computing power, has recently issued a public guidance – likely in its first – to seize the ""strategic opportunity of the blockchain sector"" so that they can help consume the area's excessive hydropower electricity.      Although not specifically mentioned in the guidance, bitcoin mining is an activity in the blockchain industry that is notable for its reliance on the intensive usage of electricity.      According to a local daily's report on April 20, the government seeks to make the city a high-quality example for consuming excessive hydropower electricity and build itself into ""an impactful blockchain industry hub"" in the country.      The Ya'an city's guidance also emphasized that electricity to be used by blockchain firms should come from generated power that's being connected to the state grid.      ""On principle, blockchain companies should construct factories near power plants that have excessive power and are integrated with the State Grid,"" the guidance says. ""For blockchain companies that use electricity privately generated from power plants [without integration to the State Grid] should be rectified in due time.""      The notice also follows the change of attitude from China's central government regarding bitcoin mining activities last year.      China's National Development and Reformation Commission, one of the 26 ministries that make up the State Council, initially labeled bitcoin mining activities as an industry that should be eliminated in a draft guideline in April last year. However, the agency scrapped that plan in the guideline's final form in November.      In general, China's Sichuan region has the issue of excessive hydropower electricity being wasted every year during the rainy summer season.      For example, the Garze prefecture government, another mountainous area in Sichuan, has said hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kWh of electricity just in 2017, with a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh that went to waste.      As such, the spring and summer season are usually a welcome time of year for bitcoin mining businesses in China because there will be abundant and cheap electricity resulted from the hydropower excess.      But this year, bitcoin's stagnating price movements ahead of the network's halving event due in two weeks have cooled down bitcoin miners' expansion investment.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/28/chinese-city-known-for-bitcoin-mining-seeks-blockchain-firms-to-burn-excess-hydropower,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f51c81efbc148e8f428f9753c9f796cd259fc15-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
