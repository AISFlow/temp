42398307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTG53,1430336143,Spondoolies-Tech to Merge With Bitcoin Shop in Mining Market Shake-Up,"UPDATE 21st September 15:05 UTC: BTCS has indicated it has completed the merger with Spondoolies-Tech.  BTCS shareholders now own approximately 55.4% of the merged company, while Spondoolies-Tech shareholders own 44.6% of the new entity.  In a statement, BTCS CEO called the move a ""major milestone"" that would help reinvent the former bitcoin-specific retail website as a leading transaction processing firm.      Bitcoin Shop (BTCS) and Spondoolies-Tech have signed an agreement that would find the publicly traded bitcoin services firm and the Israeli mining hardware manufacturer merging and continuing under a united brand.  The result, according to BTCS CEO Charles Allen, amounts to a ""merger of equals"", one that he believes positions BTCS to become a mining operation that could compete against established industrial outlets such as BitFury and KnCMiner.  In interview, Allen elaborated on the merger as well as the company's recent movements in the mining space, which have included securing an 83,000-foot facility and the prior purchase of 550 Th/s of mining hardware from Spondoolies-Tech.  Evoking a classic Baron Rothschild quote, Allen said that in his estimation, the bitcoin mining sector offers the best profit-making opportunity, one compounded by the lack of interest among new investors in contributing to transaction processing on the bitcoin network.  Allen told CoinDesk:  ""If you want to change the world and develop software for the next five years, have fun, but we're a public company and we're focused on driving revenue and building a solid business. As a combined entity, we'll be well positioned to have the cash cow in the industry.""  Allen indicated his belief that Spondoolies was the best option among a limited number of mid-sized participants in the bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing space, noting the recent struggles experienced by US firms Butterfly Labs and Cointerra.  ""Spondoolies never had late issues with their customers,"" Allen said. ""In our minds, they have best product on the market. If you put it all together it really makes for a really solid offering.""  The news follows BTCS' 27th April announcement that it had raised $2.3m in new capital through a private placement involving hedge funds and investors.  Though both developments were potentially positive signs for the company, Bitcoin Shop shares declined on the news, tumbling to $0.20 per share from a high of $0.28 earlier in the week.

42398321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGHq,1430333435,Raj Date-Led VC Firm Backs Align Commerce Seed Round,"A diverse cast of investors has contributed to the most recent undisclosed seed funding round for blockchain-based, cross-border payments solution provider Align Commerce.  Participants included more familiar names such as entrepreneur Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, Adam Draper-led Boost VC and hedge fund Pantera Capital. The round also included traditionally payments-focused VC firms such as Bayhill Capital Management, NyCa Investment, Pivot Holding, Fenway Summer, R3 and the Whittemore Collection.  Unsurprisingly, not all participants are new to the ecosystem. Fenway Summer, for example, previously invested in bitcoin brokerage Circle's $17m Series B and boasts former deputy director of the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Raj Date as its managing partner.  Align Commerce  CEO Marwan Forzley framed its diverse set of backers as evidence of the increasing interest in using both bitcoin and its underlying payments rail, the blockchain, as a tool to lower the costs of cross-border payments.  Forzley told CoinDesk:  ""When you think of the seed funding, it's an illustration of a very interesting use case, which is payment processing on the blockchain.  Forzley indicated that the total raised was not disclosed due to ""internal purposes"", stating that future announcements regarding fundraising were ""coming up"".  ""I think the key thing is a lot of the investors are into the use case and attracted because this is a really interesting way to build up the ecosystem,"" he said.  A graduate of Boost VC's Tribe 4, Align Commerce entered beta at the beginning of this April and is now available in 34 countries. Forzley previously founded eBillme, an alternative bill payment startup that was sold to Western Union in 2011.  Enhancing processes  Forzley indicated that the funding would be used to built out the company's sales and logistical processes as it looks to market its solutions to international customers.  ""We've built all the plumbing that's necessary and now this is really money that's necessary to scale,"" Forzley said.  The CEO acknowledged the relative difficulty in marketing to a range of potential clients across the globe. For example, he noted one use case in which a wine shop in California might utilize Align Commerce to reduce the cost of ordering product from Europe.  In such an instance, the company's US and German clients would send fiat payments as accustomed. Align Commerce would subsequently transfer the funds to bitcoin, using the blockchain to transmit the payment abroad.  Getting the word out, he said, would be instrumental in the face of the many industries that could potentially benefit from its approach.  ""It's a new product and an elegant way to solve a really interesting problem,"" he continued. ""The challenge now is to find ways to explain to the business community that here's a way to pay and get paid in a better cost, time and experience than you do today.""  Bitcoin vs blockchain  Perhaps most interesting is Forzley's description of Align Commerce as a ""blockchain company"" given that, to transmit payments over the network, it must transact in bitcoin.  Commenting on this general industry trend, Forzley suggested that the term ""blockchain"" was simply better suited to explaining the capabilities of the bitcoin network Align Commerce is seeking to use.  ""The first is a concept of a global currency and that's very different than the concept of moving money from point A to point B, and that's why you're seeing two different words used,"" he said.  Still, Forzley said this use case would benefit the entire bitcoin ecosystem.  Should Align Commerce be successful, he suggested, the company would create liquidity and bring new business to existing exchanges.  However, he concluded by noting his belief that the means to promote the network in this way is already available.  ""We don't need to build, we can solve this problem today with technology that exists.""

42398314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGCv,1430317821,Sweden's Nasdaq Exchange Approves Bitcoin-based ETN,"Sweden's Nasdaq exchange has approved a bitcoin-based exchange traded note (ETN), opening up investment in the digital currency to those who do not want to directly purchase and hold bitcoins.  The Bitcoin Tracker One, launched by Stockholm-based XBT Provider AB, which is owned by the KnC Group and is expected to launch on 18th May.  In a statement, Alexander Marsh, chief executive officer of XBT Provider AB, said:  ""By enabling this easy and secure way to invest in bitcoin we hope to have eliminated the boundaries that earlier prevented individuals and companies from being able to actively invest in what we believe to be the future of money.""  A spokesperson for Nasdaq confirmed that XBT Provider AB had been approved as a certificate issuer and that its product was the first bitcoin-based item to be listed on the Swedish exchange.  How it works  According to XBT Provider AB's website, the bitcoin ETN is traded in the same way as all other listed instruments on the Nasdaq exchange.  In order to invest, users must have an account obtained through their bank, advisor or online broker.  XTB Provider AB will hedge all sales of the bitcoin traded note by buying an equal value in the bitcoin market.  Johan Wattenström, head of trading at KnCMiner and partner at XBT Provider AB, said:  ""We are aiming to do all hedging in the open market but have the option to access bitcoin liquidity from KnC Group in case of an emergency.""  When asked about its security procedures, Wattenström said the company had implemented a ""secure multi-layer process for handling and safekeeping bitcoins"".  He also referred to the company's safety policy, which states: ""A small part of the holdings can be kept on bitcoin exchanges, if deemed necessary additional coins can be held on a multi-signature hot wallet and all holdings over a threshold must be kept in safe storage.""  Community Reaction  Joakim Herlin-Ljunglof, marketing manager at Stockholm-based bitcoin exchange BTCX, commented on the approval, noting how it could impact the discussions between companies operating in the bitcoin space and traditional banks, regulators and investors. He added:  ""It is really cool that my country and city is, apparently, the first in the world to do this.""  The news also struck a chord with the international cryptocurrency ecosystem. Dr Timo Schlaefer, co-founder and CEO of Crypto Facillities, a London-based broker specialising in bitcoin derivatives, said:  ""I think that it would be very useful for investors as it removes the need to go out and buy and store bitcoin directly, which requires a good understanding of how to handle bitcoins. It also opens up the market to investors who require exchange traded products or may not be allowed to hold bitcoins for regulatory or compliance reasons.""  Wattenström said XBT Provider AB aimed to offer a range of additional investment products in the future.

42398312,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGBw,1430308784,Bitcoin Custodian Elliptic Makes Final of SWIFT Startup Competition,"Bitcoin custodian Elliptic has been selected to compete for a $50,000 prize in the Startup Challenge Finale at SWIFT’s Sibos conference.  Some 370 companies applied to take part in the challenge and Elliptic was one of 15 companies selected to compete in the Innotribe Startup Challenge showcase, which took place in London last week.  Elliptic was one of two finalists in the growth-stage startup category, the other being xWare42, which enables banks to give customers additional information on their bank statements about their purchases.  ""We're very pleased to have been selected as finalists. Strong interest in blockchain technology from established financial players has led to growing demand for Elliptic's services, and and this has been recognised by the judges,"" said James Smith, CEO at Elliptic, adding:  ""We took part in the Innotribe Challenge in order to engage more closely with organisations such as SWIFT, and look forward to doing so further at Sibos in Singapore.""  The three finalists selected in the early-stage startup category were Pariti Technologies, which offers tools, guidance and access to low-cost loans; Revolut, which allows customers to exchange currencies at interbank rates; and Sedicii, which eliminates the transmission, storage and exposure of private data during identity verification.  Final round  Elliptic, which uses blockchain technology to transfer and manage a range of financial assets, will travel to Singapore this October to take part in the final round of the challenge at the Sibos conference.  Sibos is an annual financial services event visited by around 7,000 attendees from financial institutions and technology companies across the globe. It focuses on the future of payments, securities, cash management and trade.  Fabian Vandenreydt, head of markets management at Innotribe and the SWIFT Institute, said the London showcase was a ""great kick-off to the Innotribe Startup Challenge"".  ""Fintech investments in Europe have been on the rise for the last couple of years, with London ranking at the top position. With many financial services companies and large banks having their headquarters in the city, London is definitely a unique innovation environment for the startup community,"" he added.  Further finalists will be selected at regional showcases to be held in Cape Town, Singapore and New York over the next two months.

42398317,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGFs,1430298245,Western Union 'Exploring' Pilot Program With Ripple Labs,"Global remittance giant Western Union is reportedly working on a pilot program with distributed payment protocol provider Ripple Labs.  The news was first revealed in a tweet by Ripple Labs promoting CEO Chris Larsen's appearance at Global Conference 2015, an annual event held by non-profit think tank the Milken Institute.  The pilot was further confirmed by Monica Long, VP of marketing and communications at Ripple Labs, who told CoinDesk that while Western Union is ""exploring a pilot project using Ripple"", no further details on the initiative were available.  Long did, however, suggest that Western Union was interested in Ripple due to its existing value propositions, stating:  ""In general, financial institutions and networks use Ripple as a technology that powers real-time settlement in any currency to lower the cost of liquidity and compliance.""  Representatives for Western Union did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Bears to bulls  Should such a project come to fruition, the partnership would seem to mark a transition for Western Union, which has traditionally been dismissive of the digital currency ecosystem.  First discussed in a 2013 conference, Western Union chief information officer (CIO) John ""David"" Thompson would later tell CoinDesk that the company didn't believe the technology was ready for today's market.  The comments came as part of an interview that sought to frame the technology as novel, but perhaps too fraught with regulatory challenges for the company's consideration.  Still, Thompson did admit to having mined bitcoin and to an interest in the technology's future implications for Western Union. ""That doesn't mean that we aren’t looking at it, how we enable [usage] legally, what licenses we need in addition to what we have,"" he said at the time.  It remains to be seen whether the announcement marks a change from what Thompson characterized as the company's ""watch and learn"" approach.
