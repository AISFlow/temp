30007444,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626500,1719444653,"Dogecoin Sees Rapid Accumulation Amid Price Crash, Whale Transactions Soar","Dogecoin (DOGE) whales look to have used this recent price crash as an opportunity to accumulate the foremost meme coin. This provides a positive development for Dogecoin, and the meme coin has already reacted positively, seeing how its price has recovered in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate More DOGE Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin witnessed $1 billion in large transactions these past few days. Large transactions refer to ones that involve $100,000 worth of Dogecoin or more being traded. An increase in the large transactions suggests that whales are either accumulating more Dogecoin or looking to offload their tokens. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Enters Accumulation Zone Amid 493% In Shibarium Transaction Fees Further data from IntoTheBlock suggests that these whales are indeed accumulating more Dogecoin following this recent market decline. The net flows to exchanges metric has been negative over the past seven days, which shows that these whales have been buying the dip rather than moving their holdings to exchanges to offload their tokens. This presents a bullish outlook for DOGE and again highlights these investors’ conviction in the foremost meme coin. This wave of accumulation by Dogecoin whales is also significant as it could help spark a price recovery for Dogecoin, which had dropped to as low as $0.11 following the recent market decline. Besides this wave of accumulation, Dogecoin already looked poised to rebound to the upside as the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio showed that the meme coin was greatly undervalued at its current price levels. Crypto analyst Kriss Pax also recently predicted that Dogecoin should enjoy a massive bounce from here and significantly move to the upside. The analyst alluded to DOGE’s relative strength index (RSI) which he noted painted a bullish picture for the meme coin. Interestingly, he suggested this was the right time to buy Dogecoin as he didn’t foresee the meme coin going lower than its current price level. Pax also alluded to the growing altcoin dominance, which could usher in the altcoin season when coins like Dogecoin are expected to enjoy a massive rally. DOGE Will Still Reach As High As $2 In This Market Cycle Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo recently provided a bullish narrative for Dogecoin, predicting that the foremost meme coin can rise to $1 and $2 in this bull run. He noted that the foremost meme coin has traded sideways for most of its existence, but when it pumps, it is always parabolic, alluding to how the meme coin had rallies where it enjoyed a 6,000% and 30,000% price gain in the past. Crypto Kaleo mentioned that these moves occurred 8 to 9 months after the previous halvings. Based on historical trends, it is fitting that DOGE doesn’t enjoy a real breakout until sometime between December this year and February next year. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See 7 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time Crypto Kaleo predicts that Dogecoin could drop to as low as $0.08, retracing its price levels before the massive rally it enjoyed this year. He claims that such a move would be similar to the -30% drawdown and retrace that occurred in August 2020, several months before Dogecoin wet mainstream and began to pump massively.

30004290,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626481,1719439223,Ethereum Price Tied To BitMEX Whales: Quant Uncovers Link,"A quant has pointed out how the trends in the BitMEX exchange reserve have affected the Ethereum price during the past few years. BitMEX Ethereum Whales Have Shown Smart Money Behavior In Recent Years In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed a pattern in the ETH exchange reserve of the BitMEX platform. The “exchange reserve” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum that’s sitting in the wallets of any given centralized exchange. When the value of this metric rises, investors will make net deposits to the platform right now. As one of the main reasons investors transfer to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have potential bearish implications for the asset’s price. On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests a net amount of the cryptocurrency’s supply is moving off the wallets associated with the exchange. Investors generally take their coins off into self-custody when they plan to hold for extended periods, so such a trend could be bullish for the coin. Related Reading: This Historical Ethereum Top Signal Is Yet To Appear This Cycle Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum exchange reserve for BitMEX over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum exchange reserve on the BitMEX platform observed a sharp increase back in mid-2022. This would suggest that the investors had made some hefty net deposits into the exchange. According to the quant, the platform houses a significant number of whales, so this large inflow activity would reflect the behavior of these humongous investors. Interestingly, the rapid growth in the indicator had come right before ETH had crashed towards its bear market lows. Thus, it would appear possible that these large holders had anticipated that things were about to get worse for the asset, so they had pulled the trigger on selling while they still had the chance. Another notable shift in the exchange reserve of BitMEX occurred in September 2023, when the whales took out a huge amount of Ethereum, almost completely retracing the earlier bear market increase. From the chart, it’s apparent that soon after these net outflows occurred, the cryptocurrency’s price started on a sharp rally that would eventually take it above the $4,000 level for the first time since December 2021. Related Reading: Shiba Inu, Solana, & Cardano Are All Seeing Buy Signal: Analyst It would appear that these smart money whales were again correct in their intuition about the market, as they could time their buys just in time for the rally. Since these net outflows in September, the indicator hasn’t displayed any significant shifts, as its value has been moving sideways. Given the historical trend, any new deviations that crop up could be worth watching out for, as they could potentially spell another shift for Ethereum. ETH Price Ethereum showed a recovery push from its lows yesterday, but the run has calmed down as ETH is still trading around $3,400 today.

To that end, crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto set up an online letter-writing campaign to convince hosts CNN to raise crypto as a talking point. A spokeswoman for the group said Wednesday that almost 2,300 people had signed and sent the notes ""calling for a crypto question.""  ""It would be a huge miss for CNN to punt this opportunity to let Americans know where the presidential candidates stand on this important economic issue,"" spokeswoman Sabrina Siddiqui told CoinDesk. She pointed out that the group's number of members in Georgia, where the 9 p.m. EDT (01:00 UTC) event will take place, far exceeds the gap between the candidates in their previous 2020 contest.  The form letter from Stand With Crypto concludes: ""Giving the major presidential candidates a chance to weigh in on this transformational technology in the first debate would go a long way towards educating the electorate and helping American crypto owners cast an informed ballot.""  Biden's record on digital assets is familiar to the industry, which need only review his executive orders, White House statements and the actions of the U.S. regulators he appointed, including at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump's administration didn't make significant moves in crypto, and his past position of skepticism has only recently turned toward glowing support of the technology.  “It’s remarkable that we are discussing crypto as a possible topic on the biggest stage in presidential politics – and a marker of how much headway the industry has made in communicating its value to the national political debate,"" said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, in an emailed statement. ""The crypto industry – and its growing base of users – are eager for a sustained debate between the candidates on their approach to digital assets, and feel energized that it has emerged as an important topic in this election.”  Trump has emerged as a vocal supporter of U.S. crypto mining and as an opponent of the U.S. issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), seeking to contrast himself with Biden's efforts to tax miners and his administration's interest in studying CBDCs.

However, the mechanisms and decentralized structure of Cardano effectively mitigated the attack, ensuring uninterrupted stability and operation. This display of resilience has garnered praise from bullish investors and renewed confidence in the price appreciation prospects of Cardano’s native token, ADA. DDoS Attack Propels Bullish Sentiment Jaromir Tesar, an industry expert, highlighted that most services, including SundaeSwap, which processed many orders, continued to operate effectively during the attack. The attacker incurred transaction fees, resulting in financial losses without causing significant disruption. According to Tesar, this incident demonstrates Cardano’s ability to withstand and thwart malicious activities, establishing it as a winner in terms of network resilience. Related Reading: Can Terra Classic Rise From The Ashes? Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase In an in-depth analysis of Cardano’s security, Tesar highlights the complexity of executing a DDoS attack on the network when compared to traditional client-server networks. Cardano’s distributed structure includes numerous nodes, each with its own memory pool, making simultaneous attacks on multiple nodes challenging. Unlike centralized systems, where attacks are directed at a limited number of servers, Cardano’s design distributes the network load across its nodes, making it much more resilient. Within Cardano’s ecosystem, each block-producing node maintains a mem-pool, which acts as a waiting room for transactions before they are included in a block. Transactions are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, passing through relay nodes and diffusing to other block-producing nodes. Lastly, Tesar noted in its analysis that the demand-driven protocol of Cardano allows nodes to manage their data rate, concurrency, and data volume, thereby preventing overwhelming resource consumption. This protocol protects both parties involved in transaction transfers, mitigating the risk of resource consumption attacks. Cardano Season Begins? Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, highlighted the top-tier security measures and decentralized design of Cardano as key reasons for his bullish sentiment. The ongoing attack showcased Cardano’s ability to handle such situations as intended. Interestingly, the attacker’s funds were exposed in the process and are now essentially being used to fund Cardano’s development, reinforcing the network’s resilience. As “Cardano season” begins, Gambardello said, with anticipation and excitement surrounding the network growing, the recent DDoS attack serves as a testament to the strength and reliability of the Cardano ecosystem. Its security measures, decentralized architecture, rapid response from developers and users, and the exposure of attackers’ funds have added to the bullish sentiment surrounding Cardano’s prospects, Gambardello concluded. ADA Price Analysis After experiencing a sharp correction that led to ADA’s price plummeting to a yearly low of $0.356 over the weekend, the cryptocurrency has regained the $0.392 level. Currently, it is setting its sights on overcoming the $0.400 resistance, expecting a potential price increase to bridge the gap between its current value and the yearly high of $0.811 achieved in March. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Expects $15 Billion To Flow Into Spot Ethereum ETFs, How Will ETH React? Adding to the positive outlook for ADA’s price, technical analyst Ali Martinez recently identified a buy signal on ADA’s daily chart, indicated by the TD Sequential indicator. This signal anticipates a price rebound for the altcoin. Nevertheless, it is crucial for ADA to successfully surpass its current resistance at $0.400 to continue recovering from the losses incurred in recent months. The next significant resistance level on the daily chart is at $0.439. It remains to be seen if network developments and a general market recovery can lift the price of ADA to previously lost levels and start a new uptrend to surpass the $1 milestone.

The miner has brought 30 petahash worth of machines online to mine Kaspa, while 30 more will be starting by the third quarter.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miner Marathon Digital (MARA) is now a multi-coincrypto miner, after it started mining layer 1 protocol Kaspa {{KAS}} to diversify its mining revenue.  Kaspa uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism called GHOSTDAG protocol, and unlike bitcoin, it allows multiple blocks to be produced simultaneously. This process helps make transactions faster and provides more block rewards for miners, according to a statement from Marathon.  “By mining Kaspa, we are able to create a stream of revenue that is diversified from Bitcoin, and that is directly tied to our core competencies in digital asset compute,” said Adam Swick, Marathon’s chief growth officer in the statement.  The Kaspa token's price has risennearly 50% this year, while bitcoin climbed 44%. The broader CoinDesk 20 index is up nearly 16% in the same time period.  Marathon started mining Kaspa in September of last year after bringing the first mining computer online. The miner has bought 60 petahash worth of mining machines that can generate profit margins of up to 95%, according to the statement. Marathon has 30 petahash worth of mining rigs operational in its Texas sites; the rest will be online by the third quarter. The company has mined 93 million KAS, which is valued at about $15 million.  Bitcoin miners have been looking to diversify their revenue after crypto winter, and recent halving has made the industry more competitive. Many miners have pivoted to using their current infrastructure to allow for artificial intelligence (AI) and other computing needs. Meanwhile, some miners, including Marathon, have opted to monetize other layers of bitcoin to earn extra revenue.  UPDATE (June 26, 20:53 UTC): Updates headline and sub-headline to clarify amount of tokens mined and 5th paragraph to say 30 petahash worth of machines.

Crypto investment platform Abra and its founder and CEO William ""Bill"" Barhydt have settled with 25 state financial regulators for operating its mobile application without the proper licenses, according to a Wednesday announcement from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Abra will return up to $82.1 million in crypto to U.S. customers in the settling states. Abra has also agreed to stop accepting crypto allocations from all U.S. Abra Trade customers, as well as to stop ""making, buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies"" to Abra Trade customers in the U.S.  Barhydt has also agreed not to participate ""in any capacity"" in the business of any money transmitting or money services business in any of the 25 settling states, other than as a passive investor, for five years.  ""State financial regulators take their role to protect consumers and prevent unlicensed activity seriously,"" said CSBS Chair and Washington State Department of Financial Institutions Director Charlie Clark in the press release. ""Companies that do not operate within the bounds of state laws will be held accountable.""  Washington, Arkansas and Connecticut are some of the states involved in the settlement.  Abra’s settlement with state financial regulators for unlicensed money transmitting activity comes in addition to the firm’s settlements with certain state securities regulators, including New Mexico and Texas, for selling unregistered securities.  ""Abra is pleased to enter into a Term Sheet negotiated with a working group from the Money Transmitters Regulators Association regarding the Abra App that Abra previously offered in the U.S.,"" said an Abra spokesperson in an emailed statement.

29997909,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626502,1719428457,Bitcoin Crash Not Done: CoinShares Analyst Predicts ‘True Correction’ Amid Outflows,"Bitcoin-based crypto investments have witnessed another week of outflow in what was an unpleasant week for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin investors, in particular, were disappointed as they watched the price of the world’s biggest asset decline during the week, temporarily falling below $60,000. According to recent inflow data from CoinShares, this correction also flowed into crypto investment products. Notably, crypto investment products registered $584 million outflows last week to extend outflows to $1.2 billion in two weeks. True Correction Is Underway For Bitcoin According to the CoinShares report, most of the outflows were concentrated toward Bitcoin, with the crypto’s investment products registering $630 million last week. As the report noted, this outflow sentiment can be largely attributed to a growing pessimism amongst crypto investors for interest rate cuts by the FED this year. Furthermore, the continued outflow suggests that a true correction might be underway for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Enters Accumulation Zone Amid 493% In Shibarium Transaction Fees However, while this correction might be going on, it might not necessarily translate to a completely negative sentiment for Bitcoin. Such an inference is made in light of a corresponding $1.2 million outflow in short Bitcoin products, which suggests that the majority of investors do not believe that Bitcoin will continue to decline over the long run. In terms of geographical location, the US saw the largest outflows, totaling $475 million. Interestingly, a majority of this recorded outflow originated from Spot Bitcoin ETFs trading in the US. According to data, Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed outflows every day last week, causing the lowest trading volume of $6.9 billion in investment products since their launch in January 2024. Outflows were also seen in Canada, Germany and Hong Kong at $109.3 million, $23.8 million and $19.3 million, respectively. Ethereum, which had also been coming from an unpleasant week of price action, wasn’t left out of the negative sentiment and registered $58 million in outflows, its biggest weekly outflow in 2024. Deviating from the outflow trend, many altcoin products witnessed surprising weekly inflows despite price declines on the spot market. This was headed by multi-asset products, which saw $98 million in inflows. Solana, Litecoin and Polygon also had inflows of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million, respectively. More Price Correction Ahead? This week will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to experience price corrections. Time will tell if the recent volatility is a sign of further declines or a temporary dip. However, the price action observed in the past 24 hours suggests that the correction might be nearing its conclusion.

29997721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626593,1719428241,"24 Hours In Crypto Render Surges, Raboo Spikes and Cardano Bounces Back","Surprisingly for some, two top altcoins – Render (RNDR) and Cardano (ADA) are currently experiencing a bullish market trend, even when the overall market conditions are mostly bearish. Raboo (RABT), the new presale coin has also made an entrance to the market, showing great potential. Raboo has continued to attract investors due to its many attractive features. Will Raboo maintain incredible momentum? Let’s look into the development of these projects. Render attempts to recover massive losses Render is also among the top altcoins that have faced market challenges and uncertainty. In the past day, Render’s price has increased by almost 8%, according to CoinMarketCap. Furthermore, Render has decreased by 21% in the past week. Given the size of this slide, some Render investors are less enthusiastic. The Render Token’s real-time price is Currently at $7.84, and over the past day, its trading volume has been $186,650,457. The price of RNDR has climbed by 8.81% over the past seven days. It’s significant to remember that the market capitalization of Render Token is currently $3,027,990,906; in terms of circulating supply, RNDR has 388,646,672 coins. Render Token is now ranked #33, according to the market. Render has experienced a significant price reduction and bulls are only now recovering. The decline can be traced to the news revealing the difficulty it will encounter to regain its ATH, and this in turn changed the opinions of investors and stakeholders over the coin’s future. A broad correction in the cryptocurrency market may potentially be the cause of Render’s drop. Regardless of the cause, Render’s standing in the cutthroat DeFi market may be impacted in the long run, and investor sentiment may be negatively impacted in the short term. Cardano recovers from a temporary drawback in price Right now, Cardano price is trading for $0.392, down 8.2% from the previous week. Due to recent price movements, Cardano’s market capitalization is now $13.56 billion. This month, Cardano has decreased by 23.98% thus far. Cardano is classified as a Smart Contract Platform. It is said to have what it takes to bounce back. Investors are concerned because of the coin’s performance over the past few months. It is their belief that it is to be overpriced given its current usage. Although Cardano’s low trading volume and lack of tangible use cases are to blame for the downturn, they also limit the cryptocurrency’s potential for growth. Analysts advise Cardano to enhance its platform, build strategic alliances, and promote the use of technology. Maybe this will help it recover. Raboo aims to become top 20 cryptocurrency by market cap Raboo is the newest meme coin in the market. It builds a robust community of meme enthusiasts by fusing artificial intelligence and social media. Token owners can participate in entertaining competitions to win prizes and receive incentives. Raboo, a brand-new AI meme coin is made with the best possible combination of state-of-the-art technology. At the beginning of the presale, a token was $0.003. Raboo is now in its Stage 4 presale, having raised over $1.6 million, and is offering its presale token for $0.0048. Raboo holders can earn $RABT tokens and win rewards prior to launch. Every obstacle presents an opportunity to succeed, and every accomplishment has real-world significance and benefits. The project’s goal is to create a lively and involved community. The Raboo movement’s success depends on this. Raboo’s price is predicted by analysts to increase by 233% during the presale and 100x on launch day. Conclusion While Render and Cardano are currently trading greens, they still occasionally get drawbacks. Raboo, a new presale currency, has experienced remarkable growth. Raboo makes every challenge into a chance to earn, and every victory counts and translates into real-world value and rewards. Anyone can be a part of this project by purchasing their presale token, which is very affordable. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

A 10-cent fee per token might not seem like too much to complain about, but it was.  ALSO:  The Winklevoss twins donated (too much) to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: BNB, Algorand, Solana Foundation, Matter Labs, ZKsync, Aleph Zero, Polkadot, Parity Technologies.  More than $100 million of blockchain project fundraisings: Ora, Allora Labs, Conduit, ZKX, Enso, Farworld Labs.  Blast, a layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum, went forward with its long-anticipated airdrop of BLAST tokens.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  FREE, FOR A FEE: Token airdrops are, after all, free money – one reason why project teams might be less sympathetic to users who complain that they didn't get what they thought they were owed. Now, the blockchain interoperability project LayerZero has introduced a new twist to the process – what some observers are calling ""pay to claim."" When LayerZero Foundation came out last week with the ZRO airdrop, it forced users to fork over a ""proof-of-donation"" before they could claim the new tokens. As detailed by CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa, users had to make a donation of 10 cents in USDC to Protocol Guild – a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum's layer-1 research and development maintainers – for each ZRO token they hoped to claim. In a video address posted on X, LayerZero Labs co-founder Bryan Pellegrino said that ""users need to do something in order to get something,"" adding that the amount was ""extremely small"" and that ""the easy path"" would have been to ""optimize for the least amount of criticism."" LayerZero Foundation said it would match all donations up to $10 million. The ostensible rationale? “By donating to Protocol Guild, eligible recipients show long-term alignment with the LayerZero protocol and a commitment to the future of crypto,” LayerZero said in an X post. It goes without saying that endorsement of the move was not universal: ""If I'm at McDonald's and they force me to donate to get my cheeseburger, do I really care about the kids or am I just hungry?"" one frustrated poster wrote on X.  MOUNT TOP? Mt. Gox, the once-dominant bitcoin exchange that's been tied up in bankruptcy court for years following a devastating 2014 hack, announced it would start distributing assets to clients, sending the BTC price tumbling. The leading cryptocurrency took a bigger hit than smaller tokens, pushing its share of the overall crypto market down by 1.8 percentage point to 54%. The fear is that, as the Mt. Gox investors and creditors get the bitcoin, some of them might rush to cash out, unleashing a wave of selling that would, at least in the short term, push the price lower. Technical market indicators suggest a price drop to $50,000 could be in the offing, though as of press time bitcoin appeared to stabilize just below $62,000. Some traders argued that the risk of mass selling might be overblown.  The Winklevoss Twins, founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, wrote on X that they each gave $1 million to Donald Trump's presidential campaign – but later they had to be refunded because the donations were over the legal limit.  Mexican cartels have been using the cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ether, monero and tether to buy the raw materials needed to make the drug fentanyl, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  The German government, which holds over 45,000 BTC, including bitcoins seized from a privacy website, transferred 750 BTC valued at over $46 million, with 250 BTC sent to the crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken, according to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain. The transfers added to speculation that the country might be preparing to sell some of its bitcoin holdings, adding to bearish pressures in crypto markets.  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Schematic illustrating the new allocation for priority block-producing rights under BEP-341 (BNB Forum)  1. BNB Chain announced a new BEP-341 proposal, ""Governance Enabled Continuous Block Production."" According to the team: ""This proposed enhancement aims to significantly improve the transaction processing capacity of BSC by enabling validators to produce consecutive blocks. To address any risks, BEP-341 introduces adjustable governance parameters aimed at balancing performance improvements with critical security measures.""  2. Algorand Foundation announced at its annual Decipher conference in Barcelona that it has created a new ""implementation for decentralized authentication and communication called LiquidAuth."" According to the team: ""LiquidAuth, a decentralized, free-to-use, open-source, and chain-agnostic authentication tool provides greater security and privacy to users than centralized solutions like WalletConnect.""  3. The Solana Foundation announced the launch of Solana Actions and blockchain links (""Blinks"") to its suite of developer tools. According to the team: ""These tools offer a way to integrate blockchain transactions into any platform, creating a seamless and intuitive Web3 experience for users. Multiple Solana ecosystem projects will be using Solana Actions and Blinks at launch, including Cubik, Sanctum, Tensor, Realms, Access, Jupiter, Helium, Truffle, Phantom and Backpack.""  4. Matter Labs, the main development firm behind the layer-2 network ZKsync, introduced a new roadmap called ZKsync 3.0, aimed at making the ecosystem more interconnected – including a new ""Elastic Chain"" that somewhat resembles rival Polygon's AggLayer, released earlier this year. At the core of ZKsync ""3.0"" is the v24 upgrade, released June 7, turning “ZKsync from a single ZK chain into an Elastic Chain,” the Matter Labs team wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk.  5. Aleph Zero, a privacy-enhanced public blockchain operating on a Substrate stack developed by Polkadot developer Parity Technologies, introduced zkOS, an EVM-compatible privacy layer that generates zero-knowledge proofs in under a second on consumer devices, according to the team: ""This allows for private transactions and dApp interactions without revealing underlying data. ZkOS uses Halo2 with KZG commitments for faster proof generation and provides a zkToolkit to simplify integration for developers. Based on benchmarks, zkOS can execute proofs in 600-800ms on MacBooks.""  Money Center  Fundraisings  Ora co-founder Kartin Wong (Ora)  Ora, a blockchain project to incorporate AI into decentralized applications (dapps), said it raised $20 million in funding from investors including Polychain, HF0 and Hashkey Capital. The fresh funds will allow the project ""to continue developing its technology and infrastructure for tokenizing AI models and bringing decentralized AI to the Ethereum ecosystem,"" according to a press release.  Allora Labs, contributors to the Allora Network – described as a ""decentralized, self-improving machine intelligence network that powers applications with an evolving system of machine learning models"" – closed a strategic funding round, bringing their total company funding to $35 million. Investors included Polychain, Framework Ventures, CoinFund, Blockchain Capital, Mechanism Capital and Delphi Digital.""  Conduit, a crypto-native platform that enables developers to launch their blockchain applications with one-click infrastructure (including a layer-2 network atop Ethereum in under 15 minutes), announced its $35 million Series A, led by Paradigm and Haun Ventures, with additional investments from Robot Ventures, Credibly Neutral, Coinbase Ventures and Bankless Ventures.  ZKX, describing itself as ""the first social perp trading DEX on Starknet and Ethereum,"" has raised $6.3 million in a seed round featuring key investors, such as Flowdesk, GCR and DeWhales, according to the team.  Enso, an intent engine for chain abstraction, has closed a $4.2 million funding round with Ideo Ventures, Hypersphere and more than 60 angel investors, according to the team – to support the launch of a layer-1 Cosmos-based blockchain this year.  Farworld Labs, the Farcaster-native gaming company, has closed its $1.75 million pre-seed funding round, co-led by Lemniscap and Variant.  Deals and grants  Colosseum, the recently launched startup accelerator that organizes hackathons for the Solana ecosystem, raised $60 million for a fund that will invest in early-stage projects, the company announced Tuesday. The fund, which was oversubscribed, will focus on pre-seed investments in selected startups from the winners of Solana Hackathons.  Crypto exchangeBitget announced a $20 million TON Ecosystem Fund in alliance with Singapore-based investment firm Foresight Ventures, ""aiming to support early-stage projects building on The Open Network (TON),"" according to the team.

""Recent surges in transaction volume and new user growth have further cemented NEAR’s position as a strong contender to the EVM-centric narrative that continues to dominate most DeFi discussions,"" the report reads. EVM stands for ""Ethereum Virtual Machine,"" which is essentially the blockchain operating system that Ethereum-based and Ethereum-compatible smart contracts rely on.  But a closer look shows that just three applications on NEAR account for some 72% of the TVL, according to Flipside – Burrow, a non-custodial lending and borrowing platform; Meta Pool, a multichain liquid staking platform; and LiNEAR, a protocol that enables users to create and trade synthetic assets.  ""To maintain and expand its current growth trajectory, NEAR will need to attract and foster a more diverse on-chain ecosystem and make more tangible steps towards achieving a more multichain future,"" according to Flipside. ""This includes supporting a wider array of apps and services beyond its current flagships and successfully driving more cross-chain bridging activity.""  Calendar  July 8-11: EthCC, Brussels.

29994703,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626525,1719423024,"Bitcoin In Red, Analyst Predicts A 40% Drop To $48,000 Before Recovery","Bitcoin is roughly 20% from all-time highs, and risks are trending lower, breaking from the current consolidation. After peaking in mid-March, bulls are yet to build enough momentum and overcome the roadblock at $72,000. Will Bitcoin Fall To $50,000 Or Worse? Analyst Thinks So While there were temporary gains in early June, the retracement in the last few trading days has seen BTC recoil, falling below $60,000 this week. Even though some traders are hopeful, one analyst took to X, saying holders should brace for more losses in the coming days. Citing the spending actions of long-term holders (LTHs) in previous cycles, the analyst said there is a high probability that their habits could see BTC drop by 40% from all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejection At $62,498 Signals Bearish Dominance, Here Are Possible Outcomes Interestingly, data shows LTHs began selling at around $45,000. This level can act as a support region, anchoring a leg up that may see BTC finally break $72,000 and all-time highs. The analyst added that the current formation mirrored the discouraging decline in 2019. Then, BTC fell sharply before pushing higher, triggering a bull run. As of late June, Bitcoin has been roughly 20% of spot rates. If the analyst is correct, the coin could drop below May 2024 lows and as low as $48,000, breaking the round and psychological number at $50,000. Looking at the structure of the Bitcoin candlestick formation in the daily chart, the zone between $56,500 and $60,000 is supported. If sellers of June 24 flow back, pushing prices lower, there is a high probability of BTC slipping even lower. Technically, the drop will be a bearish breakout formation, a move that could catalyze even more losses. Traders Are Bullish Despite Increased Outflows From Spot BTC ETFs Despite the bearish assessment, there are contrasting activities, especially when looking at the behavior of traders on Binance. One analyst shared data revealing that over 72% of all accounts with open BTC positions are long. This resilience in the face of recent drops and the willingness to hold on despite dips is a massive boost of sentiment. It comes when the BTC market expects payment from Mt. Gox to heap more pressure on prices. After roughly ten years, hack victims will be receiving their compensation. Related Reading: Can Terra Classic Rise From The Ashes?

42407977,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8UJw,1719422421,How to Mitigate the Unique Risks of Tokenized Assets,"The digital assets market is undergoing a significant transformation in 2024, with tokenization emerging as a powerful new force. This momentum is fueled by the market entrance of heavyweights like BlackRock, driving a surge in TVL (Total Value Locked) of these assets. This increase signals growing investor demand, confidence and interest, marking a new phase of adoption following the widespread acceptance of stablecoins in recent years.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Illustration 1: Industry Adoption Curve  Despite this positive trend, the tokenized assets market faces substantial challenges. Traditional financial investors (TradFi) remain cautious about product structuring and encounter liquidity issues in secondary markets. The complexity of trading and monitoring these digital assets post-issuance, along with the implementation of robust risk management processes, deters potential investors. To gain broader acceptance, tokenized assets must establish a robust infrastructure and provide a transparent product lifecycle.  Illustration 2: Key Stages in Creating High-Quality Tokenized Products  As the market supply advances along the adoption curve, it becomes increasingly clear that the lack of data availability, data analytics and data quality significantly complicates the implementation of structured due diligence and monitoring processes for investors. This leads to different risk exposures throughout the lifecycle of tokenized assets. These risks are evident in the creation of new assets, modifications to asset characteristics, the contractual terms of issuance, trading, custody and the valuation of underlying assets. Investors must familiarize themselves with the potential risks along the value chain and the intermediaries involved. By understanding the unique product structuring inherent in the origination, manufacturing, and distribution processes, as well as their implications for operational infrastructure, valuation mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, fiscal compliance, and execution, investors can mitigate risks and increase the trust of their respective share- and stakeholders to allocate liquidity into high-quality offerings.  Effective risk management involves continuous evaluation of technical infrastructure, compliance with evolving regulations and stringent security measures for smart contracts. Ensuring clear property rights, secure custody of private keys, and accurate valuation through high-quality oracle services are also essential. Integrating red-flag detection systems that leverage both on-chain and off-chain data, along with constant price discovery mechanisms, further enhances the integrity and trust. In addition, constantly monitoring data flows and changes in information at all three levels – issuer, token and underlying asset – ensures thorough risk assessment and informed decision-making.  The tokenized assets market is advancing rapidly, attracting increased interest from traditional financial investors due to innovative value propositions with new products and customer segments. But, significant challenges remain.  Due to its complexity, investors need to implement additional risk management processes, while specialized data providers and rating agencies are crucial for providing independent assessments. Through diligent oversight, monitoring and continuous evaluation, these stakeholders can ensure the market develops securely, transparently, and in an investor-friendly manner, ultimately leading to broader adoption and integration into the global financial system.

42407978,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8UNF,1719422357,Crypto Giants Notch Wins in Expensive Quest to Sway U.S. Politics – Without Mentioning Crypto,"The crypto industry has been deploying a $169 million fund that's so far supported more than 20 congressional primary wins in the 2024 elections – including helping knock off an incumbent congressman in New York this week.  The companies behind the Fairshake PAC and its affiliates have declined to answer questions about its origins or their ongoing relationship with the organization.  The crypto industry is buying millions of dollars in ads that generally don't mention cryptocurrency.  In politics, money talks, but the donors and organizers behind crypto's massive U.S. campaign fund don't.  The digital assets industry has amassed a juggernaut of campaign finance, a $169 million fund that's capable of steering many contests this year and could decide the makeup of next year's Congress. It's already scored more than 20 victories, including high-profile elections in California and, just this week, New York. Crypto's political operation has been using tactics it tested successfully in the congressional races two years ago, but this time, there's a lot more money – enough to rival the top politically active industries and even the major parties' own war chests. And those in charge of how it's spent don't want to discuss how they got here.  Representatives of the Fairshake political action committee that wields the bulk of the money have declined to answer questions about the PAC's management, coordination and decision-making, and its main backers – including Coinbase Inc., Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) – are similarly reticent, despite repeated attempts by CoinDesk over a months-long period to ask who is in charge and how choices are made with funds pooled by industry leaders.  CoinDesk analyzed the federal campaign-donor disclosures of more than two dozen prominent business leaders and leading companies to paint a picture of an operation that's rapidly (and cooperatively) amplifying its approach to political influence. The vast bulk of money is shepherded through a set of coordinated PACs under the umbrella of Fairshake. That PAC is affiliated with a matched set of underling committees: Protect Progress, for supporting Democrats, and Defend American Jobs, the Republican outlet. The industry has also used a dark-money group, the Cedar Innovation Foundation, which in one initiative pushed the crypto cause in the pivotal-but-delicate battleground of Ohio.  The PACs have flooded targeted primary elections with influxes of money that in some cases vastly outpaced the organic fundraising by the candidates, but so-called super PACs like Fairshake don't give directly to campaigns. That would be illegal. Instead, they buy ads for or against candidates, which they can do at an unlimited level. While one primary candidate in a race may be relying entirely on rounding up individual donations, which are capped at $3,300 per election, her opponent may get the boon of this super PAC that splashes out millions.  Crypto benefactors offer an explanation for the massive campaign spending: Tens of millions of U.S. voters who want the government to embrace and write tailored rules for digital assets haven't been heard, they say.  ""It became obvious to us that they had almost no voice in the political process and that there was this huge disconnect between policymakers and this gigantic cross-section of the American public,"" said Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at Coinbase, in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""We're trying to de-politicize crypto,"" said Faryar, who migrated to the industry from Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ""Our broader policy and political efforts are designed to allow us to have discussion on the merits.""  However, the ads the PACs are paying for typically don't even mention – let alone advocate for – crypto.  When contacted by CoinDesk, Coinbase invited further questions about its political involvement before declining to get into the nuts and bolts of how decisions are being made with the nearly $50 million the company donated. Ripple and a16z Crypto were asked similar questions that sought to understand how the PACs were set up, who is in charge of them and how the wishes of donors have been shared with those managing the giving, and they declined to answer.  Public company Coinbase did disclose in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that ""in December 2023, we together with a number of other crypto and blockchain market participants supported the launch of the Fairshake Political Action Committee to support political candidates in the 2024 U.S. presidential election who support crypto and blockchain innovation and responsible regulation."" However, a Fairshake spokesman told CoinDesk the PACs aren't planning to weigh in on presidential candidates, despite recent news from some of the individual leaders who have loudly thrown in with former President Donald Trump.  While the Coinbase statement suggests coordination among donors, it's unclear how the companies – sometimes rivals – came together, though most of the companies or businesses they've invested in have faced enforcement disputes with federal regulators. Their cooperation is seemingly continuing, with a recent follow-up round of matching contributions from the top three companies for $25 million each.  Stopping new Warrens  One of the emerging stars in U.S. progressive politics, Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), was setting a course to become another Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the former presidential candidate and outsized presence in Democratic politics. In Porter's California, the 50-year-old lawmaker had a reasonable shot at an open Senate seat this year.  But the cryptocurrency industry's political operation couldn't stomach another high-profile senator standing in the way in Washington, so it devoted more than $10 million to sour her base of young voters there during the California primary.  Her high-profile Senate campaign in California had raised a little more than $30 million from direct donors and about another $500,000 from outside PAC support, so, thanks to this single industry, about a third of that was directly countered.  The campaign to derail Porter flew banners over Hollywood and drove vans around featuring barbed commentary to support accusations that she was misleading voters about taking corporate support for her campaign – a claim her campaign refuted, countering that it was ""billionaires and corporate special interests using misinformation to rig our elections.""  Under the well-funded assault, Porter fell behind frontrunner Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) – who raised a similar amount but had no opposition spending – and top Republican candidate Steve Garvey, a former Major League Baseball star. She was eliminated in the primary, blocking her pathway to the Senate and bumping her entirely from Congress (since she isn't running to keep her House seat).  A consistent strategy of Fairshake is to focus on districts that lean strongly toward one party and to support crypto-friendly candidates in those primary elections, because the winners are also likely to take the general election. If that seems a familiar gambit to elevate crypto candidates, it may be because it was the same one used by GMI PAC Inc., a leading industry PAC in 2022, which counted convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO, as one of its top backers. GMI's strategist then, Michael Carcaise, is in a similar role now at Fairshake.  Latest foray  More recently, the crypto PACs set sights on a congressional district in Westchester County and part of the Bronx in New York. Its incumbent Democrat, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, opposed two recent congressional votes that became instant litmus tests for the crypto industry's view of sitting lawmakers: whether they supported the House's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) or Congress' effort to overturn the SEC's crypto account policy. (The Republican-backed bill got ""yes"" votes from one-third of House Democrats – a surprising show of bipartisanship.)  The industry aimed a $2.1 million blowtorch of negative ads opposing Bowman, opening with, ""What happened to decency? It's gone in Jamaal Bowman's New York.""  Progressive House firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called it ""disgusting and abnormal"" for so much outside money to be dumped into the race in an effort to unseat Bowman – spending which went well beyond Fairshake to include other PACs.  To put it in perspective, Bowman's own fundraising had brought in about $4.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. In other words, when it came to campaign advertising in that district, the vast majority of messaging was paid for by Fairshake and other outside super PACs, not any of the candidates. And on Tuesday, incumbent Bowman was soundly defeated.  Neither Bowman's campaign nor that of the Democratic primary winner, George Latimer, responded to earlier requests for comment on crypto's role.  In a less high-profile primary battle in Alabama earlier this year, Shomari Figures' campaign managed to outpace several other Democratic contenders, though he'd raised a similar amount to his closest rival – both taking in less than $500,000 in direct donations. One difference: Fairshake devoted $2.4 million to advertising on Figures' behalf and spent more than $200,000 to oppose one of his fellow Democrats, according to election records.  ""It's becoming increasingly common for super PACs to spend more than the candidates that they're supporting,"" said Sarah Bryner, director of research and strategy at OpenSecrets, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Figures, a veteran of several government roles in Washington, once worked for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has so far been an impediment to crypto legislation progress as the chair of the Senate Banking Committee. But Figures indicated on his campaign website that he'd ""embrace the new landscape around digital assets, like cryptocurrency, to stimulate innovation and technological advancement."" The PACs are making big-money bets on such statements by untested politicians.  ""It's really turning into one of the biggest forces of money in politics in this cycle,"" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president for communications at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who equated Fairshake's approach as a ""money-in-politics speed run.""  The amount of money still on hand – which was $109 million as of May 31, according to the PACs – keeps them ""on everyone's radar,"" Libowitz said.  Crypto's political arms clearly aren't shy about spending a lot, but this isn't the industry's first time under the campaign-finance spotlight. In the congressional races two years ago, the sector nearly reached $100 million, all said. Some $74 million, though, was tied to the now-imprisoned Bankman-Fried and his cohorts at the defunct FTX crypto exchange.  When the dust settled on those previous elections, one in three members of Congress had taken FTX-tied money. And in the end, that money became a target for clawback in the company's multi-billion-dollar bankruptcy.  From their own pockets  A handful of businesses and individuals stand out as crypto's leading donors this time, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the well-known digital assets investors behind a16z; Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase; and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins behind the Gemini platform. They've all given so much money that their names have begun appearing among top political donors nationally.  A ranking maintained at OpenSecrets.org had Andreessen and Horowitz breaking into the top 10 this year, with their most recent commitments likely moving them even higher on that list. That rarified air was visited in 2022 by Bankman-Fried, who was once ranked as the fourth most prolific donor in the country.  While the PACs have stayed out of the biggest political show of 2024, several crypto dignitaries have revealed their personal preferences in the race for the White House.  The Winklevoss brothers made news last week by saying they'd each commit $1 million to back Trump (though some of that was later refunded due to the pair exceeding campaign contribution limits). Before that, the Gemini executives – who have so far given matching sets of political donations in this cycle – had backed most of the serious contenders who tried to seize the Republican nomination away from Trump: Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. They each personally gave $2.5 million to Fairshake also, putting them among its top individual donors, but they declined to answer questions sent to a Gemini spokesperson.  Perianne Boring, the head of the Digital Chamber – a U.S. lobbying arm of the industry – had personally supported the campaign of Gov. DeSantis last year before backing crypto fan Robert Kennedy Jr. this year in his independent bid for the White House. Kristin Smith, who runs the Blockchain Association in Washington, had put her money behind Ramaswamy, who had – for a time – been the candidate with the most aggressive stance on the benefits of cryptocurrencies.  With Trump making a dramatic shift as a digital assets booster, Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis has been a very vocal supporter of the former president as the best bet for the industry, though Selkis has sent money to Trump, Ramaswamy and U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat who challenged President Joe Biden.  Others who cut some of the biggest personal checks for campaign support in this election are a trio of million-dollar donors to Fairshake, including Coinbase's Armstrong, who has also given more than $100,000 to individual lawmakers – a list of Republicans in the Senate and a more even mix of Democrats and Republicans in the House. The others are venture capitalist and Union Square Ventures co-founder Fred Wilson, and Phil Potter, a former Bitfinex and Tether executive.  Still, the bulk of the digital assets sector's political juice is coming from the biggest businesses. Coinbase, Ripple and a16z are leading the pack, though Jump Crypto (which is reportedly under CFTC investigation) recently chimed in with another $10 million (for $15 million total). USDC stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial and Payward Inc. (which is facing an SEC lawsuit) have also given significant amounts.  Bipartisan cash  Though many of the insiders leaned toward supporting Republicans, the crypto PACs have carefully distributed money across both parties.  ""At Ripple, we believe the future of the crypto industry is not really a partisan issue at all,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement to CoinDesk. ""Many Republicans and Democrats alike are already supporting a pro-innovation and pro-compliance posture that could allow the U.S. to regain a position of leadership in this critical segment of technology. That same leadership in the development of the internet allowed massive job creation and geo-political benefits – and our elected officials have an opportunity to do that again here.""  It's unusual for a super PAC to give to both parties, according to Bryner, so that bolsters the industry's non-partisan claim.  As for public engagement, Garlinghouse's and other companies have mostly limited themselves to press releases, curated blog posts and general public statements.  ""We will continue to make contributions to candidates who believe in productive uses of blockchain technology,"" a spokesman of a16z offered as one example.  None of the companies have raised their hands to disclose whether they're supporting the Cedar Innovation Foundation, the dark-money operation backed by crypto interests. Though one common denominator for all of the PACs and Cedar is a shared spokesman, Josh Vlasto.  Not about crypto  The latest ads going after Bowman in New York illustrate another noteworthy component of crypto's political engagement: The industry-funded messages don't usually mention digital assets.  As demonstrated with the generic names of PACs such as Protect Progress and Defend American Jobs, crypto's campaign operations make some effort to avoid being obviously connected to crypto. Most of the time, the ads like those targeting Bowman or supporting others don't even mention their positions on cryptocurrencies, even if that's the purpose behind the spending. The ads are instead attempts to wound or bolster their core political credentials.  One exception was an effort to get crypto enthusiasts in California to rise up against Porter, because their demographic tended to overlap with her base in the state.  Otherwise, the spending represents unfiltered political expediency, trying to get as many members of Congress as possible on the pro side of crypto votes by expending colossal amounts of money to pay for whatever messages will be most effective in getting wins.  Business interests have long tried to steer U.S. elections, especially after the Citizens United decision from the U.S. Supreme Court opened a highway of ""independent expenditures"" by super PACs.  ""Now they're doing it much more in the open,"" Libowitz said. ""A company is not writing a $25 million check out of the goodness of its heart,"" he said, but because that firm expects it to help business.  Industry insiders are already seeing the powerful campaign-finance potential heightening how seriously their issues are being taken on Capitol Hill in this current session, long before the general election. And this year's presidential contest has suddenly latched onto digital assets, too – literally. Trump pivoted recently from his past suspicion of cryptocurrency to a new embrace – echoing the crypto-friendly positions of some of the Republican candidates who had competed with him earlier in the race, and opening his campaign to cryptocurrency donations. While Fairshake has so far indicated it's staying out of the Biden-Trump clash, that contest has a heavy potential effect on crypto's U.S. destiny.  ""Our focus continues to be on supporting candidates on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers who will stop playing politics and pass clear and responsible rules of the road which will protect American consumers, spur American innovation and grow American jobs,"" Vlasto said in a statement.  As Ripple's Garlinghouse put it: ""Those that stand in the way of that will certainly be on the wrong side of history.""  The famously fast-tempo industry has slowly learned the lesson of the long game in Washington, and Vlasto said this campaign-finance effort is already preparing to influence races beyond November.  ""We are employing a sustainable strategy and have built an effective operation that is well-positioned for the long term,"" he said. ""We will have the resources to affect races in 2024 and beyond.”  Read More: Crypto Dollars Helped Lift U.S. Politicians to Victory in Congressional Primaries",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/26/crypto-giants-notch-wins-in-expensive-quest-to-sway-us-politics-without-mentioning-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c07fb5c12fda5a57bc1e8d6dff852957e6663e62-3594x2022.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407979,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8UGd,1719421200,NFTs Are Dead (But They’re Changing Everything),"Two years ago, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) captivated the world with skyrocketing prices and mainstream attention, but then the market snapped back and many said that NFTs were “dead.”  They spoke too soon. This technology continues to proliferate on a global scale, reshaping entire industries.  Even with the NFT market reaching sales volumes of nearly 200,000 NFTs worth over $191 million per day it’s easy to dismiss them as Internet culture toys due to headline grabbing projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Source: Nval.com  The NFT industry spent enormous energy and resources to make this possible; building, testing, and shipping some of the most game-changing technologies to date.  Even though some NFT markets are now down by over 90%, it’s a mistake to write NFTs off so quickly.  NFTs Are a How,Not a What  What does it take to trade assets in a digitally native environment? Ownership rights.  NFTs are merely how we record who holds rights to an asset. They can certify ownership and authenticity, and they come with many features of blockchains such as interoperability, secure transfer and verification.  The NFT industry created a revolutionary property rights system that is available 24/7/365 to anyone, anywhere at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems, and conveys uniqueness to any asset including digital files.  The what being bought, sold, or transferred are the rights to an underlying asset that is linked to the NFT. The assets and the rights that can be conveyed are virtually limitless.  Real World Assets (RWAs)  NFTs are a global ownership system that is changing what’s possible and reshaping existing industries.  Digital Art and Collectibles: NFTs provide artists and IP holders a means to create a verifiably unique or distinct digital item, unlocking new avenues for monetization. The holder of an NFT receives rights that can include ownership, usage, and resale of the digital work.  For example, NBA Top Shot created a wildly successful marketplace where fans can buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA video highlights enabled by NFTs that verify ownership and uniqueness.  Stocks and Bonds: The financial world is also embracing tokenization. NFTs offer more efficient and accessible markets for traditional financial instruments with transparent ownership and instant settlement.  Carbon Credits: NFTs representing a specific amount of carbon dioxide emissions offset can be easily traced from creation through to retirement, ensuring authenticity of carbon credits and helping combat climate change while adhering to regulatory standards.  NFT technology is also revolutionizing music, video, ticketing, gaming, trade finance, luxury goods, identity, private credit, AI, physical goods and even vehicle registries.  NFTs redefine what’s possible through verifiable global ownership and authenticity. In the early days of the Internet, we didn’t know how accessible, affordable communication would transform the world, and it profoundly impacted every industry.  NFT are reshaping the world with the same transformative power, creating unprecedented innovation and economic possibilities.

42407971,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Tms,1719418306,ZynCoin Meme Token Patches Things Up With Tobacco Giant Philip Morris,"The founder of ZynCoin, a meme token named after a hyper-popular nicotine pouch, has extinguished a legal threat from the Fortune 500 tobacco giant behind the cigarette substitute.  Philip Morris, the Fortune 500 company that owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, sent ZynCoin founder Colton Kirkpatrick a cease-and-desist letter in the first week of April. The letter, reviewed by CoinDesk, demanded he put the token in the proverbial ashtray.  ZynCoin was to immediately discontinue all use of ""ZYN Coin,"" ""ZynCoin,"" and any reference to ZYN products or any other images confusingly similar to the ZYN mark, the letter read.  Kirkpatrick said he pushed back and reached a compromise: the prefix ""zyn"" will stay in the token's name, but the team behind it will make minor changes in its marketing.  ""They wanted to cease and desist the entirety of Zyncoin, which was problematic because it's etched into the smart contract and the coin on-chain,"" Kirkpatrick told CoinDesk in an interview. ""There's no 'off' button.""  Nor is there any entity, centralized or otherwise, behind the Zyn token, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. So Kirkpatrick was limited in what he could do to satisfy Philip Morris' trademark fit.  Philip Morris eventually figured this out, and after speaking with Kirkpatrick and his counsel, the company backed down on its demands.  ""They went from wanting the whole project to cease and desist to, after researching, realizing they couldn't easily sue or stop the coin due to its decentralized nature,"" Kirkpatrick said.  ""For the avoidance of any doubt, Kirkpatrick may use '$ZYN,' 'ZynCoin,' 'Zyncoin,' and 'ZYNCoin,' (the 'Permitted Marks'),"" a final version of an agreement between the tobacco giant and Kirkpatrick reads.  Kirkpatrick's counsel pointed out to Phillip Morris that there are plenty of other companies with z-y-n in their names, and any infringement created by the Zyn token would be minimal because it's not a competing product to nicotine pouches.  The compromise: add a dollar sign in front of ""Zyn"" to clearly indicate Zyncoin is a cryptocurrency, and remove references to specific circular canisters on the project's website to avoid possible brand confusion.  An email to the U.S. general counsel for Swedish Match, the Philip Morris subsidiary responsible for Zyn, went unreturned.  The contretemps may be a sign of disputes to come as meme coins named after celebrities or consumer products without any formal ties proliferate. It also shows that brands or celebs can do only so much to stop crypto projects from piggybacking on their names.  ""The practicalities of enforcing compliance within a decentralized community present unique challenges,"" said Florida-based digital assets attorney John Montague, who was not involved in the case. ""Even if the founder can change the website to remove infringing materials, the decentralized decision-making process inherent to DAOs adds another layer of complexity.""  For example, ""token holders might refuse to approve proposals to alter on-chain details, making compliance with legal demands difficult,"" Montague said.  Hands Tied  There have been prior attempts to stamp out unofficial, fan-made crypto homages to real-world products. Nintendo's lawyers quickly doused NFTs and Metaverse games using the company's recognizable characters during the height of the last crypto bull market.  But these all relied on centralized entities as hosts. Entities that could be served.  Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taiwan's Titan Attorneys-at-Law, told CoinDesk that if enough effort were made, there could be means to serve entities on-chain through a non-fungible token, though this could be time-consuming and costly.  ""You might just consider the cost as being cost-prohibitive to start sending demand letters anyway,"" he said.  ""But I can imagine where there'd be some situations where you say, 'we're not really suffering any harm here,'"" Feingold continued, noting that there's not an obvious case of brand damage or confusion with the token and the Zyn pouch.  After all, Zyn token holders are buying the token out of admiration for the product, the coin is free advertising for a company that can't buy it. Philip Morris and other tobacco giants have been banned from advertising their products on TV in the U.S. since the 1980s. Then in 1998, the Clinton White House cut off transit, billboards, and product placements, virtually killing tobacco advertising entirely.  Montague said there might be a case for saying that the Zyn token is a parody.  ""For trademark purposes, a parody must convey the dual message that it is the original but also that it is not, and serves as a form of satire, ridicule, joking, or amusement,"" Montague explained.  He was quick to add that the satire argument has been tried before in the crypto world and ended up burning the defense.  ""It did not work out well for Ryder Ripps, and he got hit with approximately $1.6 million in damages, so parodies that involve big business brands need to be careful,"" Montague said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/26/zyncoin-meme-token-patches-things-up-with-tobacco-giant-philip-morris,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb4da3717f0f90c337125be76efa0b7cee16aa21-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29991442,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626491,1719417637,Bitcoin Selloff: German Gov’t Offloads Another $67 Million As Price Wobbles,"In a continued effort to liquidate its substantial Bitcoin holdings, the German government has once again engaged in significant transactions involving BTC, according to data from blockchain analytics platforms Arkham Intel. This morning, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) executed nine transactions involving a total of roughly 2,786 BTC. German Gov’t Continues Its Bitcoin Sell-Off Arkham Intel’s data shows that four of them are internal transfers while five transactions were direct transfers to crypto exchanges and market makers, suggesting an intent to sell. The five potential sales amount to 1,095.339 BTC worth approximately $67 million. Specifically, the BKA made two 125 BTC transfers, each worth approximately $7.7 million, to well-known crypt exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken. An additional transaction involved a minute test transfer of 0.001 BTC to Flow Traders, a leading market maker. This small transaction was soon followed by a much larger transfer of 345.338 BTC to the same entity, strongly suggesting preparation for a substantial sell order. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Bottom Is In, New Highs Imminent: Crypto Expert Another noteworthy transfer of 500 BTC was directed to an enigmatic address tagged as “139Po.” This address has seen previous activity linked to the German government but remains shrouded in mystery, speculated to be another sale point. These transactions form part of a broader trend observed since last week. Just a day prior, on June 25, the government had disposed of 400 Bitcoin worth $24 million on Kraken and Coinbase, as well as 500 BTC to address “139Po.” This is in addition to significant movements earlier last week: $130 million worth of BTC were transferred to exchanges on June 19 and $65 million on June 20. Counterbalancing these outflows, the government received $20.1 million back from Kraken and $5.5 million from wallets associated with Robinhood, Bitstamp, and Coinbase. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Have A ‘Red Monday, Green Week’? Analyst Sets $63,500 Target Currently, the German government’s holdings amount to 45,264 BTC, valued at around $2.8 billion. This makes Germany one of the top nation-state holders of Bitcoin, trailing only behind the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, which hold 213,246 BTC, 190,000 BTC, and 61,000 BTC respectively, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. BTC Price Hangs Above Critical Level The pattern of large-scale disposals by the German government has contributed to fluctuations in Bitcoin’s market price, which has experienced a decline of approximately 6% since the onset of these transactions. Bitcoin’s value briefly fell below the $60,000 threshold following the announcement from Mt. Gox about disbursing approximately $9 billion worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash starting in July. Market analysts and investors are also keenly observing these governmental actions as the sell-off seems to continue at a slow pace. This strategic liquidation by the German government arrives at a pivotal juncture for market sentiment, with Bitcoin prices teetering just above critical support levels. Should the daily trading price close below the $60,000 threshold, it could potentially trigger a more pronounced downturn in Bitcoin’s price, exacerbating market volatility and uncertainty. At press time, BTC traded at $61,451.

Ignatova disappeared in Athens in 2017 after her Ponzi scheme fell apart.  The U.S. State Department is offering a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest or conviction of OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova, the self-styled “Cryptoqueen,” who vanished in Athens in 2017.  The new reward, announced Wednesday, is offered under the State Department’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, and boosts the previous reward of $250,000 offered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Ignatova was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted list in 2022.  Authorities in Ignatova’s native Bulgaria also announced Wednesday that Ignatova would be indicted in absentia for her role in the crypto ponzi scheme, which stole an estimated $4 billion from investors around the world between 2014 and its collapse in early 2017.  OneCoin operated through a network of promoters, who solicited investments in return for purported tokens, but notably did not actually involve any cryptocurrencies – OneCoin did not exist on any blockchain, and Ignatova and her team manipulated its perceived value through the automatic generation of new coins.  The State Department has called OneCoin “one of the largest global fraud schemes in history.”  In addition to the charges in Bulgaria, Ignatova – a German national – faces criminal charges in the U.S., Germany and India.  Several of Ignatova’s former OneCoin associates have been sentenced to prison for their role in the scheme. Last year, OneCoin co-founder Karl Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his crimes, plus $300 million in forfeiture. Two of the scam project’s lawyers – Bulgarian national Irina Dilkinska and American Mark Scott – were sentenced to prison earlier this year, Dilkinska getting four years behind bars and Scott sentenced to 10.  Disappearing act  Ignatova went missing shortly after being indicted in the U.S. in the fall of 2017 and was last seen on a flight from Sofia, Bulgaria to Athens.  The FBI has suggested that Ignatova may have altered her appearance with plastic surgery or may be traveling on a German passport in the Middle East or Eastern Europe.  There are also rumors that Ignatova may have been killed. In 2023, a report from a Bulgarian media outlet suggested that, in 2018, Ignatova was murdered and dismembered on a yacht in the Ionian Sea at the command of a Bulgarian drug lord known as “Taki,"" though this report has never been verified.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/26/us-state-department-offers-new-5m-reward-for-missing-cryptoqueen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68bb20279d02ae36f35f8b86d507b320fd2de120-1753x1108.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) up only 14% in 2024, while spot bitcoin is up 45%. BKCH has grown to $165 million in assets under management, with high concentration in fintech sectors and high risk ratings. I outline key price levels to watch ahead of bearish bitcoin seasonal trends. AI seemed to steal the show from bitcoin during much of the first half of the year. Crypto was in the news in January when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Then, just recently, news unfolded that spot ether ETFs were on the horizon, though the approval process is taking a bit longer than some crypto experts expected. But crypto- and blockchain-related stocks continue to be among the more highly traded equities in terms of daily volume. Some critics point out, however, that with the convenience of spot bitcoin ETFs, the shine could come off highly volatile blockchain stocks. To wit, the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) is up just 14% in total return so far in 2024 while spot bitcoin is higher by 45%. I reiterate a hold rating on BKCH. Shares surged into the close of 2023, and my hold rating on December 7 was premature. As speculation grew around spot bitcoin ETFs, BKCH rose big, but has really just churned sideways since mid-February. Today, I see mixed risks, including bearish summer seasonality for bitcoin that could prevent BKCH from gaining much steam in the months to come. Blockchain Stocks Underperforming Bitcoin YTD Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , BKCH seeks to invest in companies positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of blockchain technology, including companies in digital asset mining, blockchain & digital asset transactions, blockchain applications, blockchain & digital asset hardware, and blockchain & digital asset integration, according to Global X. The issuer states that the theme is bigger than just cryptocurrency and that BKCH invests accordingly, with global exposure across multiple sectors and industries. BKCH has grown significantly since I last analyzed the fund. Total assets under management have swelled to $165 million, up from $104 million. With an annual expense ratio of 0.50%, it’s not all that expensive and the ETF yields 2.05% on a trailing 12-month basis. Share-price momentum shows a perfect A+ ETF Grade by Seeking Alpha, but I will make the case later in the article that the technicals are not that sanguine. BKCH is not for the risk-averse. Its risk rating is quite poor given a concentrated allocation and high annualized standard deviation trends. Prospective investors should also be mindful of the ETF’s liquidity situation – average daily volume is less than 50,000 shares and its 30-day median bid/ask spread is high at 0.5%, according to Global X. Looking closer at the current portfolio, BKCH is volatile due to its high weight to the small-cap-growth section of the style box. What’s encouraging, however, is that the fund’s price-to-earnings ratio has dropped a full 10 handles from above 30 in late December to under 20 today. I like that cheaper turn while long-term EPS growth is high (of course, the earnings path will likely be volatile). Still, I was concerned about the P/E last year, so this is a positive development. BKCH: Portfolio Metrics Morningstar BKCH is highly concentrated in just a pair of sectors. The portfolio is ‘fintech’ in nature, with 88% in Financials and 11% in the Information Technology sector. As mentioned before, more than 70% of the fund’s assets are invested in the top 10 securities, which is a key risk to consider. BKCH: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Provoking me to revisit BKCH was this seasonal chart from Jeffrey Hirsch . The famed technician notes that the July through September period has been soft for bitcoin in its history. With 14 years of trading history, this is a material seasonal risk as the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency fails to reach new highs, currently trading in the low $60,000s. Bitcoin: Bearish Seasonal Trends in Q3 Jeffrey Hirsch The Technical Take Up big on the year and with a lower valuation, BKCH’s price chart is encouraging in my view. Notice in the graph below that shares are currently consolidating in a bullish symmetrical triangle. This is considered a continuation pattern, and with the broader trend being higher off the $12 low from late 22, we can even make an upside price outlook. If we take the $30 range height that began in early 2024 and add that on top of a potential breakout point above $58, then that would trigger a bullish upside measured move price objective to $88. Of course, that is still well below BKCH’s all-time high of $165 from late 2021. I see downside support in the $27 to $30 range. We’ve also seen sellers come about in the $56 to $58 zone a few times, so that remains a possible trouble spot for the bulls. Overall, the chart is encouraging with rising momentum in the last few months. BKCH: Bullish Consolidation Amid Falling Volume Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I like the valuation and the technicals, but with bearish seasonality in the offing, I believe it will pay to be picky on when to enter BKCH.

29988310,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626501,1719412255,"Bitwise CIO Expects $15 Billion To Flow Into Spot Ethereum ETFs, How Will ETH React?","Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan recently discussed the inflows the US Spot Ethereum ETFs could attract. Specifically, he stated how much could flow into these funds in their first 18 months of trading. Spot Ethereum ETFs To Record $15 Billion In First 18 Months Of Trading Hougan mentioned in a note to investors that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could record $15 billion in net inflows in their first 18 months of trading. He elaborated on how he arrived at these figures to show that it wasn’t just a guess. First, Hougan highlighted the market capitalizations of Bitcoin and Ethereum and stated that he expects investors to allocate to their respective exchange-traded products (ETPs) in proportion to their market caps. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See 7 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time Hougan noted that US investors have, so far, invested $56 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETPs and expects that figure to reach $100 billion or more by the end of 2025, when these funds should have matured further and be approved on platforms like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Using this as a reference, Bitwise’s CIO stated that the Spot Ethereum ETFs would need to attract $35 billion in assets to stay on par with the Bitcoin ETFs, which he believes could take about 18 months to happen. Hougan also highlighted that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will already have $10 billion in assets upon launch, thanks to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which will convert to an ETF on launch day. Therefore, Hougan noted that the Spot Ethereum ETFs are now left with $25 billion in inflows to reach parity with the amount of inflows the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are expected to reach by 2025 year-end. Hougan then highlighted data from the international ETP markets to show that investors may be allocating to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs roughly in line with their market caps. Using The International Markets As A Point Of Reference According to Hougan, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs in Europe hold €4,601 and €1,305 in assets under management (AuM), which translates to 78% and 22% of the aggregate available funds in both markets. Similarly, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs in Canada have $4,942 CAD (77%) and $1,475 CAD (23%) respectively. Related Reading: Crypto Research Firm Says Bitcoin Crash Below $60,000 May Not Be The End, Here’s Why Working with Ethereum’s ETP market share in Canada, Hougan estimated that the US Spot Ethereum ETFs could also get 22% of the US market. Based on this, Hougan lowered the estimate of net inflows for the Spot Ethereum ETFs from $25 billion to $18 billion, excluding Grayscale’s assets. Hougan eventually lowered the estimated net inflows to $15 billion by factoring in the fact that a significant portion of the flows into the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are related to carry trades. He removed $10 billion of carry trade-related AuM from the Bitcoin market, lowering his estimates for Bitcoin from $100 billion to $90 billion and for the Spot Ethereum ETFs from $18 billion to $15 billion.

Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase","Terra Classic (LUNC), the phoenix attempting to rise from the ashes of the infamous TerraUSD crash, is once again capturing investor attention. Coincodex analysts predict a modest 10.7% price increase by July 25th, while renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks throws a much bolder 1,500% surge into the ring. So, is LUNC poised for a bullish breakout, or is this just another mirage in the volatile crypto desert? Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Price Prediction: Analyst Foresees Huge Jump To $380 A Token Reborn: LUNC Capitalizes On Market Volatility LUNC, once the backbone of the collapsed TerraUSD (USTC) stablecoin ecosystem, has defied expectations. While USTC lost its peg to the US dollar and spiraled into oblivion, LUNC has exhibited surprising resilience. The past 24 hours saw an 82% price jump, showcasing continued investor interest in the controversial token. This resilience coincides with a broader market trend where investors, wary of traditional assets, are seeking refuge in digital currencies perceived as having strong recovery potential. Analyst Divided: Measured Optimism Vs. Moon Shot Coincodex paints a picture of cautious optimism. Their prediction of a 10.7% rise suggests LUNC may experience a slow and steady climb. This aligns with the “Fear & Greed Index” which currently sits at a moderate “Fear” level, indicating a cautious market. We remain here $LUNC (Terra Classic)’s first target at $0.00058046, implying a more than +594% upside from here to reach it in response to a long-standing breakout.

Marks posits a potential 1,500% price surge, targeting a price of $0.00139122. This bullish outlook hinges on the idea that LUNC is nearing a breakout phase, fueled by a combination of its recent price gains and historical data. A Balancing Act Of Hype And Reality While Marks’ prediction is certainly enticing, historical trends in the cryptocurrency market are littered with failed “moon shot” predictions. The extreme volatility inherent in the crypto space makes long-term price forecasting notoriously unreliable. Additionally, technical indicators currently lean bearish, suggesting potential short-term price dips. Investors should also consider the ongoing legal battles surrounding the Terra ecosystem, which could cast a shadow on LUNC’s future. Terra Classic Rejects Validator Expansion Proposal Meanwhile, the Terra Luna Classic community has rejected Proposal 12116, which sought to increase the blockchain’s validator set from 100 to 130. This proposal emerged in the wake of a $4.5 billion settlement between Terraform Labs, founder Do Kwon, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The aim was to enhance the network’s decentralization by incorporating validators from Terra Luna v2, potentially signaling a move towards unification within the Terra ecosystem. Related Reading: Fact Or Fantasy? Decoding The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart’s $250,000 Prediction However, the proposal did not gain sufficient support in the community’s governance voting. Concerns about integrating Luna v2 validators, the potential impacts on network security and performance, and the desire to maintain a distinct identity for Terra Luna Classic were significant factors in the decision.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, after a brief surge above $62,000 in the early Asian session, retreated to $61,400. The price fell amid significant on-chain activity in the German government's BTC holdings. According to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain, the eurozone's largest economy transferred 750 BTC, valued at over $46 million, sending 250 BTC to crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken, an indication that the country may be preparing to sell the tokens. This action, part of a divestment of BTC seized from a privacy website, added to bearish pressures in the market. The government holds over 45,000 BTC. Ether followed bitcoin's lead, dropping from $3,425 to $3,375 and CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) also retreated, losing about 0.14%.  Alternative cryptocurrencies have recently experienced a bigger liquidity drain than bitcoin and ether. For instance, notional open interest – or dollar value locked in active futures contracts – tied to altcoins has declined by 34% to $12 billion since BTC peaked above $70,000 on June 7, according to data source Coinalyze. That compares with a 13% drop in cumulative open interest in bitcoin and ether futures to $29.3 billion. ""This one-way flow quickly turns reflexive to the downside and exacerbates underperformance relative to majors. Bid-side liquidity is less incentivized, and traders hesitate to catch a falling knife. Throw in fewer market makers and a huge increase in coin issuance and you've got a very sloppy altcoin market,"" Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer at Arca, wrote in the weekly note.  The Cardano blockchain demonstrated its resilience by successfully repelling a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack aimed at stealing staked tokens on Tuesday. The attack was thwarted without any disruptions to the network's operations. In a DDoS attack, a large number of compromised computers, known as ""bots"" or ""zombies,"" flood a target with excessive traffic, causing it to become overloaded and inaccessible. Philip Disarro, the founder of Cardano development firm Anastasia, said the attack could be stopped by deregistering the stake credentials used by the attacker. The attack was halted shortly after his post. Cardano's ADA token remained stable before falling slightly to under 39 cents in line with the broader market sentiment.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that the meme coin Doraemon (DORAE) experienced a boom-bust pattern early Wednesday, rising to over $2 million in market value only to crash to less than $200,000 in 30 minutes.  Lookonchain said someone sold 2.5 million DORAE for 10,538 SOL, causing the price crash.

42407976,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8UDK,1719402122,Many EU Crypto Entities May Not Know the Correct Deadline for Sustainability Disclosures Under MiCA: Risk Analyst,"Crypto entities may have misinterpreted MiCa's deadline to make sustainability disclosures, despite a clarification, according to Crypto Risk Metrics.  Crypto's environmental impact, particularly through mining operations, has been a major concern surrounding the industry.  Several crypto asset service providers (CASPS) in the European Union (EU) may not know the correct deadline to make sustainability disclosures reflecting their environmental footprint despite a clarification made by the bloc's securities regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).  In general “we have the feeling that more than 80% of crypto asset service providers are not yet aware they need to report ESG-data (environmental, social and governance-related data) from January 1st, 2025,"" said Tim Zölitz, chief risk officer at Crypto Risk Metrics.  On Wednesday, Zölitz's Crypto Risk Metrics inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on displaying ESG-related data with The Digital Token Identifier (DTI) Foundation, the EU's proposed crypto-asset identifier for transparency reporting.  The EU's crypto asset regulation, known as Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), became a law in 2023. MiCA set up licensing requirements for crypto issuers and service providers including exchange platforms. Stablecoin rules came into effect in June.  However, issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and electronic money tokens (EMTs) are required to make sustainability disclosures from June 30, 2024, and crypto asset service providers are required to start making disclosure requirements by the end of the year, explained Rowan Varrall, Associate Director at DTI Foundation.  Part of the rules are the reporting requirements for ESG-data. The confusion around the correct deadline may be a matter of interpretation, even though a specific clarification has been made by the regulator.  The adopted MiCa law said that any adverse impacts on the environment need to be adequately identified and disclosed. But it also said that ""That information may be obtained from the crypto-asset white papers.”  This may have been interpreted as requiring disclosures only when the white paper is published, the timeline for which is end-2027. ""This might stem from the wording in the adopted MiCA regulation text, which was later clarified in the consultation paper number two,"" Zölitz from Crypto Risk Metrics said.  MiCA's ""disclosure requirements"" related to ""environment-related adverse impacts of the consensus mechanism used to issue the crypto-asset, as part of the white papers....,"" said that ""These disclosure requirements apply to persons drawing up the crypto-asset white paper..."" and that ""operators of trading platforms shall ensure by 31 December 2027 that a crypto-asset white paper is drawn up, notified, and published....""  In the second of three consultation papers, which in effect refine the understanding of the MiCA law, ESMA added that crypto entities need to make such ""information available in a prominent place on their website for all the crypto-assets in relation to which they provide services, regardless of whether the information can be obtained from white-papers.""  ""Here, the wording does not leave any room for interpretation, as it reads that Crypto Asset Service Providers have to display ESG-data, regardless if they can be obtained from white-papers,"" Zölitz said.  Crypto's environmental impact, particularly through mining operations, has been a major concern surrounding the industry, potentially deterring general adoption and involvement of big institutional investors.

29982028,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626466,1719401453,"Bitcoin Rejection At $62,498 Signals Bearish Dominance, Here Are Possible Outcomes","Bitcoin recently faced a significant rejection at the $62,498 resistance level, underscoring the prevailing bearish dominance in the market. This failure to break through a critical threshold highlights the strength of selling pressure and raises concerns about potential downward trends. The rejection at this key level signals caution among traders and investors, prompting a reassessment of market strategies. As bearish momentum persists, this analysis explores the possible outcomes for Bitcoin’s price movement and the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. As of the time of writing, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is over $1.2 trillion, with a trading volume of over $27 billion. The cryptocurrency price is currently up by 1.2%, trading at roughly $61,582. Despite a 31.26% increase in market capitalization, there has been a 35.43% decrease in trading volume over the last day. Technical Indicators: Signs Of Continued Bearish Pressure BTC price on the 4-hour chart is still actively bearish and trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Currently, Bitcoin is attempting a downward move after a rejection at $62,498, which is represented by a blue line on the chart. The formation of the 4-hour William Alligator signals that the price of BTC may extend its bearish trend as there is no successful cross of both the alligator lip and tooth above the alligator jaw. On the 1-day chart, it can be observed that Bitcoin’s price is making a huge drop after being rejected for the second time at the $62,498 level, thereby signaling more bearishness even as it continues to trade below the 100-day SMA. Additionally, the 1-day William alligator also indicates more bearishness for BTC. After a successful cross of the alligator lip and teeth below the alligator jaw, they have been maintaining a good spread from each other. It should be noted that the crypto asset’s price, from an overall point of view, is actively bearish. Given the formation of the price action and indicators on both the 4-hour and the 1-day chart, it can seen that the bears are currently dominating the market. Potential Scenarios: What’s Next for Bitcoin? An analysis of potential future scenarios for BTC’s price movement following the rejection reveals that if Bitcoin continues to move downward and break below the $60,152 support level, it may move lower to test the $58,523 support level and probably move on to test other lower levels if the price breaches this level.

The two firms will initially develop tokenized funds within Investcorp's Strategic Capital Group (ISCG), which has $1.5 billion in assets under management and was launched in 2019.  ISCG specializes in acquiring minority interests in alternative asset managers (GPs) and has partnered with mid-sized GPs across buy out, secondaries, structured equity, private credit, and real asset strategies.  “This partnership with Securitize continues Investcorp’s strong legacy as an innovator in alternative investments,” said Anthony Maniscalco, Managing Partner, ISCG, in a release. “The use of tokenization technology has the potential to increase efficiencies for investors, and also provides for a new era of accessibility. Through this collaboration, Securitize is bringing access to the GP staking strategy for a wider range of investors.”  This partnership allows qualified investors to tap into GP staking strategies via Securitize's tokenization tech, boosting access to burgeoning private markets with the efficiency of blockchain.  “We believe that Investcorp, as a global alternative investment manager, represents some of the most innovative thinking in the market,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, in a press release. “By tokenizing alternative assets, we are breaking down barriers and allowing individual investors to participate in opportunities that were previously out of reach.""

42407965,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8TgG,1719397484,Ether Spot ETFs to Attract $15B of Net Inflows in First 18 Months: Bitwise,"Ether spot ETFs are likely to attract $15 billion of net inflows in the first 18 months, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan wrote.  Potential inflows can be estimated by comparing the relative market caps of bitcoin and ether, the report said.  Bitcoin benefits from first-mover advantage, which may reduce the inflows into spot ether ETFs.  Ether {{ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are expected to be approved for trading in the U.S. in coming months, are likely to attract $15 billion of net inflows in their first 18 months, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a report on Monday.  One way to estimate potential inflows is to consider the relative market caps of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether, the report said. Bitcoin is currently 74% of the combined market value, the report noted. Investors will probably allocate to bitcoin and ether ETFs in the same proportions.  U.S. investors have invested $56 billion in spot bitcoin ETFs since their introduction in January, a number that is expected to grow to $100 billion or more by the end of 2025 as large wirehouses approve the products for trading on their platforms, the asset manager said.  “Using this $100 billion figure as a reference, spot ether ETPs would need to attract $35 billion in assets to reach parity, a process I expect will take about 18 months,” Hougan wrote.  The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), with $10 billion in assets under management (AUM), is expected to convert to a spot ETF, leaving $25 billion of inflows to reach parity.  In Canada, however, ether ETPs account for only 22%-23% of total AUM “slightly underperforming their absolute market cap weight,” the report noted. The discrepancy can be linked to bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, Hougan wrote.  “Some investors may have bought a bitcoin ETP and stopped there, thinking their crypto exposure was covered,” the report said, adding that this dynamic may be true in the U.S. also. Assuming ether ETFs only capture 22% of the market, as in Canada, cuts the estimate of net new inflows to $18 billion, and other factors chop off another $3 billion.

29976259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626405,1719390616,"Here’s Why The Bitcoin Bottom Is In, New Highs Imminent: Crypto Expert","Crypto expert Duncan (@FloodCapital) recently expressed a strong conviction that Bitcoin has reached its market bottom and is poised for new all-time highs. His analysis, shared on X (formerly Twitter), provides a detailed examination of the current market dynamics and underlying fundamentals that signal a bullish turn for Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? In his in-depth analysis, Duncan pointed out that the crypto market has been underperforming relative to equities over the past few weeks. This trend was a concern until a pivotal development emerged concerning Mt. Gox. Duncan noted, “Yesterday’s Mt. Gox headline provided a reasonable explanation for the recent market behavior.” The expectation of billions of Bitcoin being distributed to creditors had been anticipated by insiders, leading to a temporary market dip. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See 7 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time The situation was analyzed in depth by Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s Head of Research, who suggested that the selling pressure from this event might be less severe than initially feared. As Duncan explained, “We’ve swept the range lows, leading to about $300M in long liquidations.” While these figures are significant, they are modest compared to the liquidation events in March and April, where more than $750M was liquidated in three different 24-hour periods. This suggests a cooling market, which is also evidenced by reduced altcoin open interest, lower funding rates, and a less bullish options skew. Duncan observed that the sentiment on Crypto Twitter is “literally the worst I’ve ever seen it,” despite Bitcoin being less than 20% off its all-time highs. This sentiment is rooted in the traumatic experiences of crypto natives who, having witnessed the altcoin boom outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2021, tried to anticipate a similar pattern this year but were met with a drastically different market structure. The influx of capital into Bitcoin has been significantly influenced by the ETF developments, with Blackrock applying for an ETF in June 2023 when Bitcoin was priced at $26,000. The approval and subsequent inflow of $14.3 billion into the ETF marked a stark contrast to previous years dominated by decentralized finance (DeFi) and high consumer interest in altcoins. “This year, the capital is heavily skewed towards Bitcoin, influenced by its perceived stability and the formal financial product structure of ETFs,” Duncan elaborated. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Here’s What 7 Experts Say On the fundamental side, Duncan highlighted Blackrock’s strategic movements within the crypto space. “With $17 billion in IBIT and at a 25bps fee, Blackrock is poised to generate approximately $45 million annually from this ETF, indefinitely,” he stated. This steady revenue stream could be a precursor to more institutional products and greater acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Duncan also discussed the potential normalization of a 1% Bitcoin allocation in major investment portfolios, which he believes could drive significant future inflows. “If 1% becomes the global standard allocation to Bitcoin, we have a lot of inflows to go,” he noted, suggesting that not having such an allocation might soon be viewed as a strategic oversight. He added, “A great selling point from these firms is if you don’t have 1% in BTC your essentially short / underweight BTC. This begins to flip the career risk from owning BTC to not owning BTC, a massive paradigm shift.” Ethereum And The Future Of Altcoins Turning to Ethereum, Duncan expressed optimism about the upcoming US spot Ethereum ETF, which he believes could outperform the Bitcoin ETF in profitability due to higher fees and potential revenue from staking. “Blackrock’s most successful product launch ever is likely to have a sequel with the Ethereum ETF, which could be even more profitable,” he predicted. He criticized the current low expectations surrounding the Ethereum ETF, which he attributes to widespread misinformation and underestimation of its potential impact. “The ETH ETF is likely a higher margin product for Blackrock, and adding staking could boost its profitability even further,” Duncan explained, suggesting that the integration of real-world assets (RWA) on-chain could enhance its appeal. At press time, BTC traded at $61,764.

Marks, a popular figure in the crypto space, believes INJ is poised for a “monstrous rally” towards a staggering $380 target. Related Reading: Solana Slides 13% – Can It Recover Despite Analyst’s $1,000 Prediction? This optimistic outlook comes amidst a generally volatile cryptocurrency market, leaving investors to wonder: is Injective really hurtling towards the moon, or is this a case of overzealous enthusiasm? Technical Twinkle: Hidden Bullish Divergence Fuels Optimism Marks’ prediction hinges on a technical indicator known as “hidden bullish divergence.” In layman’s terms, this suggests a potential disconnect between the asset’s price and a technical measure of its momentum. While the price might be dipping, the momentum indicator could be hinting at an underlying bullish trend waiting to erupt. Think of it like a coiled spring – the price may be compressing (going down slightly), but the indicator is suggesting the spring is building tension, and an upward surge could be imminent. This divergence between price and momentum is why it’s called “hidden” – the bullishness is there, but it’s not as clear-cut as a straight price increase. $INJ (Injective)’s price looks to still be retesting the $21.6541377 target while holding a major Hidden Bull Divergence that can be indicating a continuation!

This level has previously acted as support, and a successful retest could be the launchpad for a significant upswing. DeFi Darling: Injective’s Allure In A Volatile Market Injective’s bullish potential extends beyond just technical indicators. The project has carved a niche for itself in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape with its innovative cross-chain derivatives protocol. This allows users to trade derivatives – financial contracts derived from the value of underlying assets – across different blockchains. This functionality caters to a growing demand for sophisticated DeFi tools, potentially attracting a wider user base and driving up INJ’s value. Investor Insight: Soaring To $380 Or Crash Landing? While Marks’ analysis paints a rosy picture for INJ, it’s important to remember the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Reaching a price tag of $380 would represent a phenomenal increase from its current price point.

Over 25% of options are set to expire ""in the money.""  Traders anticipate a renewed bullish shift in bitcoin and ether next month.  It's that time again when discussions about activity in the crypto derivatives take precedence.  On Friday at 08:00 UTC, bitcoin {{BTC}} options worth $6.68 billion and ether {{ETH}} options worth $3.5 billion are set to expire on the leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit.  The impending expiry, which represents over 40% of the current cumulative open interest of over $23 billion, could trigger a surge in market volatility. Large quarterly expiries often lead to increased volatility, making prices more unpredictable due to higher trading volumes and the closing/rollover of positions.  ""As we approach Friday's large quarterly expiry, potentially influenced by 'quadruple witching' and related volatility in U.S. stock markets, over 25% of Deribit open interest is set to expire in-the-money, equating to over $2.7 billion. The total notional size of the expiry is over $10 billion,"" Luuk Strijers, chief executive officer at Deribit, told Coindesk in an interview.  Options are derivative contracts that give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call gives the right to buy, while a put offers the right to sell. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC or ETH.  Having more than 25% of open interest set to expire in the money means a significant number of derivative contracts are expected to be profitable for their holders at expirations.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped nearly 9% this month, testing bargain hunters below $60,000 at one point. As usual, the sell-off has weighed over the broader market, pulling ether down by almost 10%.  ""The recent price drop was caused by miner sales, some pressure from German-seized BTC, and, of course, the imminent transfer of Mt. Gox coins expected in early July,"" Strijers said.  Still, call-put skews show investors are willing to pay a higher premium for near-term and long-term calls offering asymmetric upside than puts, according to data tracked by Amberdata.

Illuminate founder Mark Beeston will join Crossover’s board of directors.  Crossover Markets, a superfast execution-only trading platform for cryptocurrencies, has raised a $12 million Series A led by Illuminate Financial and DRW Venture Capital.  Crypto trading is evolving such that it can cater to both those players who want the simplicity of a vertically integrated model, as well as those institutions further up the ladder who want to choose their custodian, or expect a choice of venues and counterparties that they're allowed to trade with.  Crossover Markets, which last month partnered with prime broker Hidden Road, is waving the flag as one of the only ultra-low-latency electronic communication networks (ECNs) in crypto, according to the firm’s CEO Brandon Mulvihill.  In contrast to an ECN model, crypto exchanges use a central limit order book execution model, which means it doesn't matter if the exchange has one client or a million clients, there's only ever one pool of liquidity and one market data session, Mulvihill said.  “If we onboard 50 takers of liquidity, we can have up to 50 independent market data sessions and 50 pools of liquidity,” Mulvihill said in an interview. “What our model does is provide value to both the maker and the taker and that’s reflected in our rate card. We charge one basis point to the maker and we charge one basis point to the taker.”  Crossover Markets handled over $3.15 billion in notional trading value in the first quarter of this year, the company said in a press release.

42407964,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Tcx,1719382673,Cardano Unfazed by Failed DDoS Attack Targeting Staked ADA,"The Cardano blockchain successfully mitigated a DDoS attack that attempted to steal staked tokens, with no significant impact on the network's operation.  The attack involved transactions executing numerous smart contracts and was halted after a Cardano developer's post revealed a vulnerability, leading to the attacker's funds being taken.  The Cardano blockchain was hit by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack late Tuesday. However, the attack was unsuccessful and mitigated before any damage was caused, and the network continued to operate as usual.  DDoS is a common attack vector in which the attacker floods a server (or a blockchain) with spam traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.  Fluid Token chief technology officer @ElRaulito_cnft said on X that the attack began on block 10,487,530, each transaction executing 194 smart contracts. The attacker spent 0.9 ADA per transaction and filled each block with several transactions – attempting to stress the network.  Philip Disarro, founder of Cardano development firm Anastasia, said the DDoS could be stopped immediately by deregistering the stake credential used by the attacker. The attack was stopped shortly after Disarro’s post.  “DDOSer halted his attack after reading my tweet in an effort to protect his funds. Alas, they were too late and the pillaging of their funds is already in progress,” he said.  A Cardano developer later clarified that the DDoS attack was aimed at disrupting the system and not to steal staked tokens.  ADA was up 0.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at 38 cents in Asian morning hours.

42407981,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8UTr,1719379800,Ron Wyden on FISA Reform and Crypto,"Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has been a long-standing member of the U.S. Senate, and was a sponsor or co-sponsor of several key pieces of legislation enabling broad adoption of the internet. More recently, he voted in favor of a House Resolution overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, and questioned threats to personal and financial privacy online.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Privacy hawk  The narrative  Last month, Sen. Ron Wyden spoke at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 conference. As with previous versions of this newsletter, my questions have been shortened but the Senator's responses. have only been edited lightly.  Why it matters  The Senator has been a key voice in both support of the internet and personal privacy online – two key issues for the crypto industry.  Breaking it down  So before we really get into the meat of things, I just want to start with you. How are you here? What are you looking at?  Well, it's great to get out and learn, and this really goes back to my roots in technology. I showed up in the Senate, when only [former Senator] Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) knew how to use a computer. And I got a chance to write some of the foundational rules of the internet since [Senator Spencer] Abraham (R-Mich.) and I wrote the digital signatures law. I wrote the internet tax non-discrimination law, the law that relates to platforms so that the individual is accountable. And that really kind of sparked my interest in technology policy, which is still the biggest challenge for the Senate – is getting its arms around new technology.  What's your interpretation of the atmosphere around [crypto] within the Senate? How are lawmakers looking at this?  We've made a lot of headway, but there's a long way to go. And apropos of how I got started on this, as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, at the last minute, a group of senators said, ""We're gonna fund this by taxing the software developers and the coders,"" and I said, ""hey, I don't know everything about crypto, but these are folks using their First Amendment rights. They're the creators.""  And by the way, at the top of my priority list is getting more of these creators in the United States of America, because we are losing in many instances to foreign countries. And so when they said, '""we're gonna tax coders to the tune of $50 billion,"" I said, ""I'd like to know a little bit more about it,"" because why are we saying that people who are creative software developers are basically going to do taxing for everybody. And we basically were able to waylay that. And it is kind of symptomatic of what our challenge is. New things come up, and people said, ""well, nobody in the Senate knows about it."" And when friends said, they forgot about Ron, and I said, ""hold on. I don't know everything about it. But I know that taxing the software developers without any hearings, without any discussion for $50 billion is a mistake."" And I'm still supporting software developers as a key part of blockchain in our challenge.  A few weeks ago, the Senate passed the Congressional Review Act bill to repeal or overturn the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. That's super controversial within the crypto circles, and you were one of the 11 Democrats who helped bring that through the Senate. And could you just speak to how you view this.  Yeah, just to make sure everybody knows what we're talking about. This is essentially about accounting. So you talk about root canal work, this is like the staff accounting bulletin is what It's called, it's not really enforceable. But it basically sets up a different standard for crypto than everybody else has in the financial sector with respect to custody. So this is a pretty complicated thing. And I remember being down on the Senate floor and a lot of senators are going, ""huh, what is this? Why didn't we have any hearings? Why didn't we have any discussion?"" And a lot of us said that before, you're going to say that crypto doesn't have the same kinds of custodial arrangements as other financial fields, we ought to have some real discussion about it. And a group of us said, ""let's just hold on here and take the time to make sense and not just establish a whole separate unique barrier to storing customers crypto.""  Do you have any thoughts on – without speaking to a specific bill – is there a need for a market structure bill, legislation addressing this market?  There certainly is and what you really need is a regulatory framework. And that's what Chairman [Patrick] McHenry is trying to do. And you need to be tough on the scamsters and the rip-off artists, and one of the reasons I wanted to come is I wanted to find out new ways in which particularly blockchain and others are trying to do this.  And I know you all are stepping up your game in terms of fighting terrorism and fraudsters and the cartels and the like, and I think that's really key. It's getting late in this session, so it's unclear how far that bill will move, but I think Chairman McHenry is right to establish a kind of regulatory framework and put a sharper focus on fighting fraud and rip-off artists.  You recently signed a letter alongside Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming kind of questioning the DOJ almost about how they're interpreting law, and the context of that was, of course, the DOJ is pursuing charges against a developer of Tornado Cash, Roman Storm. Can you speak a little bit to the letter and its contents?  I never talk about specific cases and companies and the facts. But Senator Lummis and I have partnered on a number of bipartisan efforts. And we wanted to make sure that you weren't painting an entire economic sector with one brush, because you felt that one firm and again, I'm not getting into the facts, was engaged in conduct you're concerned about. And so, again, we come back to the software developers. People always say, I'm getting repetitive about it, but if you walk out of here with two thoughts: I'm interested in software developers, I'm interested in stable coins. And I think that there's an opportunity for a lot of creativity. I very much want to see a portable medical record. You've had all these politicians and legislators talking about this for literally decades. I think blockchain is capable of doing it. And that's the kind of story we want to tell.  One of the things you're perhaps best known for, certainly, alongside the last few months has been your work on reforming FISA, basically a surveillance act. And I'd love to just hear your thoughts on what happened and then where we go from here.  I don't mind it when people say I'm one of the leading private hawks, privacy hawks in public life. Because, you know, I think people are entitled, law-abiding people are entitled to a zone of privacy. You know, surveillance is one of the most ominous aspects of American life. And what I want to do is make sure in areas like a public policy, like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, we recognize the trends and the trends are that global communications are more globally integrated, and we ought to protect the privacy rights of Americans swept up in those searches and that's been a big push of mine with respect to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Do you have any specific – obviously the bill went through, I believe it was just reauthorized without any changes, although–  We already are on our way to some improvements, there are going to be some guardrails in the intelligence authorization bill. But here's another concern. What we say in the intelligence field is sources and methods. As those patriotic individuals gathered the information about those who might be threats to the country, sources and methods always need to be secret. But the law always needs to be public.  It ought to be possible for Americans to sit at their Starbucks, have a coffee or soda or something, and read a public law, it's called public for a reason. It gives us a chance to hold elected officials accountable. And unfortunately, the reforms that are being discussed with respect to FISA, a big chunk of that is going to be secret, I call it secret law. And that's another thought you gotta walk out of here from this discussio, is the sources and methods and intelligence how they gather the information needs to be secret laws need to be public.  What other improvements would you make if you had your way with this bill?  What I have said is that when you're going to get the information of a law-abiding American, you should have a warrant. And my FISA approach would have established that with an exception, if the government thinks that there's an imminent threat.  So I see lots of good folks out in the audience. What this means is that the government has to have a warrant, if it is going to get information picked up in these FISA searches about law-abiding Americans. But if there is an imminent threat to folks, for example, here or somewhere else, then the government can go get the information and settle up later.  There's this question of balancing privacy and the right to do things online, transact, send money around–  Before we pit one of them against the other, let's make sure that some of us in public life feel that security and liberty aren't mutually exclusive. We can have both..  So speaking of things that are surveilling us, AI has been pretty in the news recently for everything that's been going on. I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on, should there be kind of a regulatory framework guiding the development, the data gathering, the building of these new tools? And what might that look like?  I've introduced the Algorithm Accountability Act, with Senator [Cory] Booker (D-N.J.), Congresswoman [Yvette] Clarke (D-N.Y.), and my Algorithmic Accountability Act very much resembles some of the things I started on decades ago. There is transparency, there's accountability, there's equity, and it's a smart touch.  I'm not prepared for the government to just create massive layers of government and expense right now, what I want us to do is target in on real problems. I mean, minorities, for example, have huge problems with housing and credit and access to education. That's what Senator Booker and Congresswoman Clarke and I are going after, we're going to find out how the algorithms are presented, who's holding the accountability side of the ledger, and I think that's a smart way to start.  And by the way, those are my roots, roots with the innovators, the First Amendment folks, and I'm applying it to a lot of fields, I think, I don't know if you're gonna get into it, but I'm a strong supporter of stablecoins. I love the name stablecoins, because right away that sends a message that if you peg it to the dollar or something like that you're serious about, you know, protecting an array of interests.  What's needed to either you know, either help stablecoins develop in a safe way or is there too much already going on around regulation?  I think we're just getting started. I mean, look, I heard a rumor that there was an election coming up, and I'm not here to electioneer for one person or another person, we can do that later. But I think I've always felt the best politics is good policy. And what we're talking about with a decentralized approach to finance and competition and strong consumer protection, so you could catch the fraudsters, that's a great issue for people to run on. And I'm certainly telling my colleagues, that's, I think, an approach where you do good and do well.  What are just kind of specifics of good policy that, in your view, are lacking right now, around stablecoin development?  Well, the biggest challenge for the Congress is to get its arms around new technology. And the Congress has some people who are sort of traditionalists, and they're a little bit concerned about competition and choice, they think it'll lead to disruption. And then there's a group that don't know too much about it. And what I think we need to do is find that kind of third path, I always tell my colleagues, if you can find a really good staff person who combines a willingness to learn and an interest in, in the subject, that's really the coin of the realm in the Senate.  I want to move to the elections a little bit, I have heard that there's something in November, possibly–  Possible!  We're seeing a, I would say almost a ""surge of momentum"" has been how it's been described by a lot of the companies and individuals following this, between the votes over the last few weeks, and just some of the other activities. We're seeing lawmakers and candidates for office really appealing to crypto specifically. Is this a surge of momentum? Will this interest from candidates and lawmakers last beyond November?  We have the potential to really build on the progress we made. Two years ago, I think it'd be fair to say, this was a field that people were not particularly supportive of. And I think now we're getting to the point where sometime soon, you can have your Thanksgiving dinner, and your grandparents or your parents might be around and they'd say, ""tell me about this crypto thing, I'm thinking about putting a little bit of money in it.""  Now, I'm not a financial adviser or anything like that. But I think we now have some opportunities in the kinds of areas that we're talking about. I mean, think about the software developers, these are the people that folks in politics say they want the most. They're young, they're creators, they're innovative, they're coming up with, with solutions, in terms of processing, you know, financial assistance to people, bills of lading on paper so outdated, we can use something different for competition and in choice in supply chain. These are great opportunities.  From the voter perspective, are you seeing a lot of voter interest in this issue or constituents reaching out and saying, ""this is something I care about?""  I'm getting more questions, I've had 1,085 town hall meetings, throw open the doors to my constituents and let them ask questions. Look, this is not getting the same interest as inflation because people feel that they're getting really hit in the supermarket or health care costs or something else. But there's no question that there is growing interest here. It's being driven by a lot of young, creative people.  The blockchain is especially interesting to people in terms of the federal government's role in money management. I think we've got an opportunity to really build interest here. And part of what I've told people is, what we need to do is talk about areas like the software developers, we need to make it clear we don't take a backseat to anybody in terms of fighting fraud. And based on what I've been hearing as I go around groups, there are a lot of people in blockchain and crypto who are already involved in working with the government on terrorism fights.  So for our audience viewing physically here and online watching, what would you say is a useful and productive way for them to engage with your office and with your colleagues?  Political change hardly ever starts in Washington, DC and then trickles down, it's almost always the opposite. It starts at the grass roots and builds upward. What you can do in terms of trying to create more opportunities, particularly for blockchain, is be in contact with your legislators, talk about areas that you think they'll be interested in, like jobs, jobs are still a big issue in every single meeting I go into. To be able to say these young software developers can do that work in the United States, make a good wage, rather than what we've seen where so many of them have gone overseas.  So the power is really in the hands of people here and the people, we're following this online, I think we're live streaming. And I'll just tell you, I look back at my involvement in technology. And I'm so glad that I had that opportunity. And I still believe it's based on knowing what you don't know. And that's really the heart of trying to create good policy, it's listening. That's what I did at my town hall meetings over the last week or so, and then going back to DC and talking to a cross section of people, and particularly issues like stable coins, software developers fighting fraud, trying to partner with the government wherever possible in terms of public services, that puts you on the right side of history.  As we begin to wrap up today, I'm just really curious, you know, I want to give you an opportunity, just, you know, what are you watching now? Are there any specific topics and issues, whether it's in Congress, whether it's in you know, in Oregon?  At home, the issue that I know, will present as the second word is bill, it might be medical bill, it might be housing bill, it might be gas bill. It's all about, you know, the challenge, post-COVID, of coming out and finding a way, with lots of industries no longer being here, a path ahead. And that's why I come back to people like the software developers, those were kind of my roots. That was my first experience with crypto when a bunch of Senators went to the floor and said, ""we're going to sock these developers for $50 billion worth of taxes."" And I said, ""wait a minute, how did the software developers suddenly acquire expertise in tax collection,"" and we waylaid. So the big challenge of our time is to listen. And I can tell you right now, the supreme supreme opportunity is to focus on these economic issues, and make better use of scarce resources.  I just really want to thank you again, for coming up here. And thank you all for sticking around for the last day [of Consensus].  You know, in DC when you wrap up, somebody always makes a big speech. And sometimes they're god awful. I'm just going to say thank you. Thank you. Because this is an opportunity to learn and to listen. That's what I think public policy is supposed to be all about. So we'll put today's discussion in the ""to be continued"" department. Thanks, everybody.

The price is now trading above $575 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $578 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $585 resistance. BNB Price Aims Higher In the past few days, BNB price saw a steady decline from the $592 resistance, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a drop below the $575 support and $560. Finally, the bulls appeared near $550. A low was formed at $550.8 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $565 and $575 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $593 swing high to the $550 low. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $578 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading above $575 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $583 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $593 swing high to the $550 low. The next resistance sits near the $585 level. A clear move above the $585 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $592. A close above the $592 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the coming days. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $585 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $578 level and the channel’s trend line. The next major support is near the $572 level. The main support sits at $565. If there is a downside break below the $565 support, the price could drop toward the $550 support.

The important issue for investors is how it’s valued, which depends on a variety of factors. The price of bitcoin may just boil down to what someone will pay for it given the circumstances. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price has surged in 2024, surpassing pandemic-era peaks. The climb has followed the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), which opened up the cryptocurrency for investors of all stripes. Easier access may not be the only reason for the rising price. What does it even mean to put a price on this asset? And how does such a volatile asset fit into a broader portfolio? Ashley Oerth, Associate Global Market Strategist at Invesco, and Ken Blay, Head of Research for Invesco’s Global Thought Leadership team, joined the Greater Possibilities podcast to talk about bitcoin and its potential place in a portfolio alongside stocks and bonds. Transcript Brian Levitt: Welcome to the Greater Possibilities Podcast from Invesco, where we put concerns into context and the opportunities into focus. I’m Brian Levitt. Jodi Phillips: And I’m Jodi Phillips. And on the show today are Ashley Oerth from Invesco’s Global Market Strategy Office, and Ken Blay, Head of Research for the Global Thought Leadership team. And Brian, we’ve brought them on today to talk about bitcoin. Brian Levitt: Good. I get a lot of questions about bitcoin, certainly with the moves that we’ve had again more recently. Jodi Phillips: All right. You get a lot of questions. Do you have any answers when you get those questions? Brian Levitt: Well, maybe some. I’m not sure people actually should be listening to me about bitcoin. Sadly, I’ve missed out on all of this, so I don’t know if you want to ask me any questions about it. Jodi Phillips: That’s why we have guests, but- Brian Levitt: That’s right. We have guests- Jodi Phillips: But it sounds like you have a little FOMO. Brian Levitt: Yeah. Who wouldn’t have FOMO over this, right? What a move in price. Jodi Phillips: Well, so you say you’ve missed out, but why? Why have you missed out? What’s behind that? Brian Levitt: Well, I guess I’m just still learning, waiting to learn more, and maybe I’ve waited too long, but to learn more about its purpose, how it fits into a portfolio. And Jodi, you co-host this with me. So, we once had a wise man on this podcast tell us, sometimes things just have to go up without you. Jodi Phillips: I remember that. Well, look, we need to learn, and we’ve got the right guests to help us learn. I would also like to hear more about just sort how to think about bitcoin. It’s the same questions. Is it a currency? Is it a commodity? Brian Levitt: Yeah. And what about the initial rationale for it, whether think back to ‘08, whether that was failing banks or concerns about unsustainable government debt, rampant inflation. Either those things haven’t come to pass or the market sort of ignored them otherwise. So, has the rationale for bitcoin evolved and to what? Jodi Phillips: Right. And for investors who own it or want to own it, how should they think about allocating it in their portfolio? How does it fit alongside the stocks and the bonds that they already have, and how can that all potentially fit together for them? So fortunately, Ashley and Ken are on the podcast today to answer those questions and more. Brian Levitt: Yeah. And they’ve both written extensively on the topic, so I couldn’t think of two better people to bring on to speak to. Jodi Phillips: Well now’s the time to bring them on. Welcome, Ashley and Ken. Ken Blay: Hey, thank you for having us. Ashley Oerth: Thanks so much, Brian and Jodi. Great to be here. Brian Levitt: Yeah, great to have you. Ashley, I’ll start with you. What’s the purpose of bitcoin? What’s it for? Ashley Oerth: Yeah, I think that’s a great place to start. I think also this is probably the question that has most frustrated people over the last decade plus because there’s a lot of questions still over what exactly it’s supposed to be. But it seems like that hasn’t really mattered. So, let’s go back to the start. So really bitcoin, it was intended to be a sort of digital means of transacting value really without the need for intermediaries. You referenced before the global financial crisis. This is when bitcoin was really born, and the idea was to be able to sort of evade the traditional financial system, to not really have to use banks or other institutions, but instead to be able to transact value in a way that was secure, but without the need for any kind of intermediaries. That said, most would really say it’s failed as a digital currency. Instead, it’s really evolved to be a sort of digital store of value, similar in many ways to gold, which is drawing these sorts of comparisons of bitcoin being “digital gold.” The problem with bitcoin really is that it doesn’t enjoy the same history that gold does. So, I think that this sort of comparison, it’s pretty difficult, at least at this stage. For the time being, bitcoin, it’s attracting a lot of eyeballs and investor dollars really because it’s both supply-limited and highly secure. And it has these really tempting price cycles, which we’ll get into, I’m sure. It’s in this sort of self-fulfilling cycle for the time being. Brian Levitt: If it has tempting price cycles, can it be a store of value? Ashley Oerth: That’s exactly the point I love to come back to, which is that if it is supposed to be the store of value, a store of value should be relatively stable. But it’s the opposite of that. We have seen volatility come down. Sure. And the sort of history of bitcoin shows it to be something that can go as low as 80% to 90% below its previous highs, but we still see this narrative be pervasive. So, I think that if the narrative lasts that it sort of becomes self-fulfilling in some ways. So, I guess it’s just a matter of time until we get there. But for the time being, there’s plenty of reason to be skeptical. Right? Ken Blay: Well, and when you say about volatility coming down, that’s a relative comment. So, the volatility was at 150% annually. Now it’s somewhere between 60% and 80% annually, which is still huge. And if I’m going to go buy eggs with my bitcoin, I need to know how much bitcoin I need to take. That’s part of the problem. Brian Levitt: It’s like being in one of those inflationary countries in the 1930s where you didn’t know what the price of a beer was going to be the next time it came around. Ken Blay: Yup. Jodi Phillips: So Ashley, we’re talking specifically about bitcoin here and we’re going to continue to do that, but I do want to ask just at the outset, obviously, the name recognition of bitcoin, but how else should we differentiate bitcoin versus so many of those other crypto coins that are out there? Ashley Oerth: Sure. So, I would say the sort of critical differentiator for bitcoin is the fact that it’s got this sort of supply limitation built into it. And as we’re discussing already, we’re focusing on bitcoin, but we could be discussing other cryptocurrencies as well. But bitcoin has got this incredible brand recognition, and I think that’s helped it stay at the top of the crypto charts. Bitcoin, it was really the first cryptocurrency, and it sort of stands as representative of the entirety of the crypto space. Pretty much everyone, I would argue, has at least heard of bitcoin, and media coverage tends to really paint bitcoin as sort of representative of this space. I also think that it’s relatively simple compared to other cryptos — its design, its language around it. Sure, it has a hurdle to it to really wrap your head around how it works. But compared to other cryptocurrencies, I would actually argue it’s quite simple and straightforward. And I think that it also requires less knowledge of the crypto ecosystem in general to really appreciate what it’s about. It’s a much more refined idea, I think, than a lot of other cryptos out there. So, in a space that’s very young, I think bitcoin is this sort of style work crypto. And this mixed with the fact again that there’s this limited supply that can only ever be 21 million bitcoins, I think it’s set up bitcoin for this relative success we’ve seen. Brian Levitt: Jodi, I had a friend of mine who was telling me that they were trading 82 cryptos or something, and I was trying to figure out how many I could name. I think I got to Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and I got stuck. Jodi Phillips: You got me beat already. Brian Levitt: I beat you already. Jodi Phillips: Oh yeah, for sure. Brian Levitt: Yeah, yeah. So, you’re not a big Dogecoin trader, Jodi? Jodi Phillips: No, no. I have to admit that I am not. I am not. At least not yet. We’ll see where I’m at the end of this podcast though. Brian Levitt: Ken, I love the research that you’ve done around how it fits into a portfolio. And what I wondered when you were thinking about that, did it even matter to you, these conversations around purpose, or were you just thinking about risk-return profile and how an investor may want to think about it in a portfolio? Ken Blay: Yeah, great. That’s a great question, Brian. We authored a piece and two of my other co-authors are these bitcoin fanatics. They love bitcoin. Everybody should own bitcoin. I tend to be the bitcoin skeptic. And so, it was a really nice balance because they pushed on one way and I pushed on the other way in terms of being skeptical about things. And really what it led us is to be very objective about how you look at this thing. And it’s interesting, we’ve submitted the paper for publication. We’ve got some comments back from the referee and one of the things that came back, was you guys didn’t mention whether it was a commodity, was a currency or it was a collectible or anything like that. Brian Levitt: Wait. Was I that referee? Ken Blay: No. I don’t know who it was. But it’s funny that I went back, and I said, “Let me look at this.” And so there’s this guy named Aswath Damodaran from New York University. In 2017, he said, “Well, you might consider one of the paths that bitcoin can take is that it can be viewed as gold for millennials.” More recently, he basically expressed that bitcoin is a currency that nobody uses and a collectible that doesn’t behave like a collectible. Alright, so we’ve got all the three words that we need to get in there, but we’ve got no more clarity as to what bitcoin actually is. And so, my point to the referee and my point in terms of how we approach the research was in fact to say, “Look, let’s not get into those things. Let’s look at the things that we can understand or what we do know about bitcoin, and that’s where we are.” The first part of our research was to really understand bitcoin prices. How has it moved historically? What’s changed? And in doing that research, what we found is that, say the period prior to 2014, was this real crazy period went from bitcoin inception to 2014. There was some just really weird returns, really high returns, but really weird risky returns. The period afterwards tends to be a lot more normal. So, from 2014 to 2023 where we did our research, that tends to be a lot more normal. And while it is normal, there were some huge price swings. So, when we look at the returns, we looked at rolling one-year periods, so how much money you would’ve made in one year. And we see several instances of returns of greater than a thousand percent and a non-trivial amount of one-year periods that exceeded a hundred percent return. This is amazing stuff for anybody that’s looking at this. But then we also saw - Jodi Phillips: It’s the beginning of Brian’s FOMO. That’s where Brian’s FOMO started for sure - a thousand percent. Brian Levitt: To be clear, my FOMO started in middle school. Jodi Phillips: Okay. Alright. Well beyond the scope of our experts here today. Sorry. Ken Blay: So when we look at the returns, there’s also four instances where returns like one-year periods fell before 30%. And then there’s three instances where you have one-year year returns below negative 70% or greater. And those things, the most recent one started in early 2021 and lasted to about the middle of 2022. Jodi Phillips: So Ken, I’m curious then when you think, I mean just all of those different numbers and price swings that you’re talking about, how do you even begin to think about allocating to bitcoin? Where do you start when you try to think about how could this potentially fit with my stock allocation, my bond allocation, and then, how do I even think about rebalancing to make sure all of these swings aren’t just throwing everything out of proportion all the time? Ken Blay: Well, my starting point was to treat bitcoin as a speculative asset. And if for no other reason is that a lot of things that we just discussed, that the characteristics of bitcoin are indeterminate. What that means is that people have a hard time explaining it. Correlations are incredibly weird over the time. So, there’s a very limited timeframe for us to analyze bitcoin. The problem with that timeframe is that there was a global pandemic, there was massive government fiscal and policy intervention across the globe. We saw the greatest increase in interest rates in over 20 years here in the US. The most significant increase in inflation in over 40 years. And we also had instances of stock bond correlations that were among the highest and the lowest, historically. So, you have this period, yeah, I’ve got 10 years of data, a lot of stuff is going on, so there’s a lot of noise. But then you couple this with the fact that bitcoin was maturing at that time and all the infrastructure behind bitcoin and that allowed the trading of bitcoin, that was all brand new as well. So, you have this thing that’s evolving around all of this noise. And so, it’s really hard to make any inferences about how bitcoin is going to act relative to stocks or to bonds or all of that, for me, has to go out the door. So, you have to really think about this as a speculative asset. And the two key things that you need to think about when you do that is first your initial allocation. That’s the first step in mitigating risk is, how much would I be willing to risk without impairing my ability to meet my financial objectives? That’s for the individual investor to determine. And then how do I manage risk on an ongoing basis? And that’s where your point about rebalancing is actually a prescient one because it’s really important to rebalance, especially for something that bitcoin that can go up a thousand percent or whatever. It could become a huge part of your portfolio. And so you need to mitigate that. You need to manage that part of the risk. So those are the starting points there. You treat it as a speculative asset, and you figure out your allocation size. And then you start looking at, alright, what are the benefits, and what are the risk implications? And our research is essentially that. We looked at what are the benefits from adding bitcoin to my portfolio. And we assume that you start off like any investor, like I’m a moderate investor, you have risk preferences as a moderate investor. As I add bitcoin, one of the things that happens, bitcoin, it doesn’t take a lot of bitcoin to add a lot of risk. That said, it doesn’t take a lot of bitcoin to add a lot of return either. Brian Levitt: It goes a long way. Ken Blay: And so, you have to, all right, well I know that there’s a good part of this, but there’s also the bad part, the risk part. And so, all we did with the research is just say, as I extend myself in terms of accepting more risk, at what point should I stop? At what point do I stop getting incremental good stuff? And that’s essentially what we did. We called it a benefit-to-risk metric. And we said, alright, at the point that I stop, that the incremental risks exceed the incremental benefits so at the point that I get more risk than I get good stuff, that’s where I should stop. That’s the maximum. I’m not saying that that’s the optimal point. That’s the maximum point because you still have risk all the way before that point. Brian Levitt: And I love that approach and I do want to hear more about, a little bit more on detail in terms of what your allocations were with regards to that. But I want to bring Ashley back into the conversation for a moment. Ashley, when you think about the moves in bitcoin over the last period that Ken was talking about that had a lot of tumult, a lot of strange things, we saw it go to $65,000 a coin, back down to $16,000 a coin, sat there for a while. Now it looks like it is getting close to $90,000 a coin. Is there anything that you could take away from those movements and identify this is why that happened? Is it about easy monetary policy? Is it about inflation? Is there anything that you could latch onto in looking at those price moves over the last few years? Ashley Oerth: I think the answer to that is yes. I think that there’s quite a lot to unpack for exactly what drives bitcoin prices. Since bitcoin has been around, there’s been this desire to try to model it or explain exactly what’s going on with its price and what it should be responding to. And the truth of it is that valuing bitcoin, it’s immensely difficult. It’s essentially this sort of commodity currency that benefits from network effects. So, for example, in some early models, this is when bitcoin was really first having its run back in 2014, people sought to really model it as something that would respond to network effects. And then we try to measure network growth and use that as a proxy for what should drive price momentum. But of course, as the ecosystem around bitcoin has grown, this approach, it really broke down. It doesn’t work anymore. And I think the critical takeaway here is that you cannot really value bitcoin. You can try to price it, you could try to build a framework around its likely drivers. And so, we do have some ideas, and you highlighted a few of them, of what can be a driver here. But I think what it comes back to is what are the supply and demand factors underlying bitcoin itself, and then broadening away from that, what is the sort of financial backdrop? What are financial conditions telling us, and how does that affect the opportunity cost that’s wrapped up in holding bitcoin? Brian Levitt: Can I take a quick stab at what I think we just said and how the markets performed? It seemed to me that a lot of the run-up was ahead of the inflationary environment that we had. Then a lot of the rundown was ahead of the policy tightening that we had. And then more recently, expectations for easing again. I think of gold, I look at it from a real yield perspective. What real yield can I get in treasuries? Is gold enticing or not? And as that widens and narrows, it tends to have some impact on whether gold is attractive or not. Is it similar with bitcoin? Ashley Oerth: It is a similar kind of idea. I think that what’s interesting about bitcoin is that it’s sort of framed as this, as I’ve heard it described, marginal user of excess liquidity. Or in other words, when you have, for example, large scale money supply growth, that bitcoin is something that can benefit from that. And so we saw that dynamic play out in the post-pandemic environment where bitcoin really surged several times over. And we’ve seen the reverse of that as well, that as money supply has come in, or money supply growth I should say has come in, that that’s sort of pulled down bitcoin prices. And as you mentioned, there’s this sort of opportunity cost angle as well that if real yields are climbing, if the Fed is hiking rates, if long rates are rising, that this should penalize bitcoin because it’s a zero-yielding asset. And we’ve seen that play out as well. Similar again to what you just described, this kind of gold equivalency. So there are those sorts of factors that we can point to as being, again, a framework for how bitcoin can be priced. But in terms of a long-term valuation, it’s quite difficult to really ascribe what is that long-term driver. That’s where I come back to demand. The price action we’ve seen since, I would argue, the fall of last year has been all about this spot bitcoin ETF news from the SEC. And we saw the ETFs launched in early January, and this has really been a very positive demand shock that’s helped send bitcoin prices to new highs, and we continue to see that play out. It’s, I would argue, not done yet. Jodi Phillips: It seems a little ironic, right? I mean, is there a certain amount of irony there that people said crypto was going to dis-intermediate the financial sector, but now we’ve got ETFs allowing you to track spot bitcoin prices. So, just that evolution and how people are thinking about it and how they’re able to access it. Definitely adds another dimension, doesn’t it? Ashley Oerth: It does, and I don’t think this irony is really lost on the crypto community. But I think that for the average investor, this sort of packaging, it’s important. Cryptos, otherwise, they’re quite challenging to access in a way that is secure, reliable, compliant, and to do this in a way that’s cost-effective. So, cryptos wrapped in an ETF, they really offer a meaningfully easier way for the average investor, the average client, who wants bitcoin exposure to be able to access this space. Whereas those sorts of previous offerings, they required more paperwork and oftentimes partnering with crypto-specialized firms and services that really offered a host of complications and added costs. So, I think that this wrapper, this packaging, of the ETF is attractive because it’s more familiar and it’s easier to work with at the end of the day. Jodi Phillips: Right. Brian has fear of missing out. I would have fear of misplacing my wallet password or whatever I need to even access it. Right? One more thing to remember. Brian Levitt: Fear of misplacing my wallet- Jodi Phillips: Yeah, it’s not- Brian Levitt: I’m going to try it. Jodi Phillips: No, don’t. Brian Levitt: Ken, you wanted to jump in? Ken Blay: Oh yeah, I was going to say with regard to bitcoin prices, I think the one thing that we do know about bitcoin prices is that the price of bitcoin is ultimately what somebody else is willing to pay for that. Now, ultimately, that’s going to depend on what’s happening to bitcoin and what people believe. And that’s where I think the speculative nature of bitcoin comes in because right now everybody believes that it should go up. There is demand driven by all of these ETFs. The other thing that I’ll add there is that there’s two ways of viewing the financial system or these asset managers getting involved with bitcoin. One is a fairly cynical view, and another one aligns much more closely with what Ashley was saying. The cynical view is that the asset managers weren’t getting paid when bitcoin was being traded outside of conventional pathways. Okay. That’s a very cynical view. But to Ashley’s point, one of the things that asset managers have done throughout history is provided access to difficult-to-access assets. So, the whole notion of pooling investments, that was asset managers actually started those things and it made life a lot easier for investors to get access to diversified pools of assets. Now, the bitcoin ETF is not that, but it does simplify access to getting the bitcoin, getting access to bitcoin. Brian Levitt: Absolutely. And Ken, as we come to the end of this, I’d love to hear some numbers around allocations, like what percentages you put around this. You had talked about that benefit to risk and it just... You got to a point where you kind of maxed out. What did those numbers look like? Give it to me if I’m a hundred percent in equities versus if I’m more of a moderate fifty-fifty portfolio investor. Ken Blay: Well, I’ll give you two sets of numbers. So, when the research that we’ve done, we looked at historical returns of bitcoin. So, one of the things that you do is [you say] bitcoin does what it did in the past. Because that’s the one side of it is the return benefit. Okay, what did it do? Generally, what you’re looking at, in more conservative portfolios, you’re looking at about 1% to 3% allocation, or actually 1% to 2% allocation. That’s for conservative portfolios. For more aggressive portfolios, you’re looking at somewhere from 3% to 6% allocation. So, that’s assuming that bitcoin does what it did in the past. If you look at and say, “Well, bitcoin isn’t going to do that. Maybe let’s just say that it does half of what it did in the past.” That’s just a rough... I mean, like I said, there’s no way of knowing what bitcoin is going to do, but let’s just say it did half just, still a pretty big number. There, you’re looking at about 1% allocations for conservative portfolios and somewhere between two and five. These higher numbers are obviously the 100% stock portfolios. Anytime you start adding the bonds, you tend to come down pretty quickly. So, those are kind of rough estimates of what the research has pointed to. That said, we pointed out what we’re saying here is the maximum. The maximum exposure is… after this point, you’re taking on more risk than the benefit you’re getting. I say that on the more aggressive points, you can go up to... The research points to 5% allocations. That’s all going to depend on the investor. The investor has to decide, am I willing to take on the additional risk of having that bitcoin in the portfolio? If you’re not, well bring it back a little bit. But if you are, okay, maybe 5% should be a maximum for the hundred percent stock portfolio. And so we are not suggesting that these are optimal allocations. We’re just saying this is the point where you take on more risk than benefit. Brian Levitt: So are we doing two or five, Jodi? Jodi Phillips: I don’t know. Are you more conservative or aggressive? Brian Levitt: I’m usually more aggressive. I’ve got time. Ashley, any final comments from you? Ashley Oerth: Look, I think that the bitcoin outlook from here, I think that we’re at this moment right now where everybody’s talking about this thing. That prices are high. And we’re doing this all in an environment in which rates are still elevated, that we’re supposed to be living through this period that I think that, from the financial backdrop, should be penalizing bitcoin prices, but we’re actually seeing quite the opposite. So, I think that the sort of peak in sentiment is something to watch. And I feel like what I’m left wondering going forward is what is the next big thing. What is the next big driver for crypto prices? Now that we’ve reached this point where we have spot bitcoin ETFs, what is the sort of next moment that we’re looking to on the horizon to really help send bitcoin on another one of these price cycles? So that’s really where I think it’s sort of a thoughtful note to leave this conversation because I think that there’s so much to unpack for what is happening in the crypto world, and I think that we’re sort of in the big leagues today. That crypto prices are elevated, that we’re talking about putting it in a portfolio. I think it’s an exciting time to be considering this space. So, I’m sort of thinking what comes next? Jodi Phillips: What comes next? Let’s leave it there. Right, Brian? Brian Levitt: Let’s leave it there. Jodi Phillips: Leave it on a cliffhanger. Brian Levitt: Well, thank you both so much for joining. Jodi Phillips: Yes. Ken Blay: You’re very welcome. Thank you for having us. Ashley Oerth: Thank you so much. It was great.

Shares in the Fund are not FDIC insured, may lose value and have no bank guarantee. This material must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. The Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind. Bitcoin has historically exhibited high price volatility relative to more traditional asset classes, which may be due to speculation regarding potential future appreciation in value. The value of the Trust’s investments in bitcoin could decline rapidly, including to zero. The further development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the network may adversely affect the price of bitcoin and therefore an investment in the Shares. Currently, there is relatively limited use of bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively extensive use as a store of value, contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in bitcoin or restrict the use of bitcoin or the operations of the Bitcoin network or venues on which bitcoin trades. For example, it may become difficult or illegal to acquire, hold, sell or use bitcoin in one or more countries, which could adversely impact the price of bitcoin. The Trust’s returns will not match the performance of bitcoin because the Trust incurs the Sponsor Fee and may incur other expenses. The Market Price of shares may reflect a discount or premium to NAV. The price of bitcoin may be impacted by the behaviour of a small number of influential individuals or companies. Bitcoin faces scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Miners could act in collusion to raise transaction fees, which may affect the usage of the Bitcoin network. Competition from central bank digital currencies (“CDBCs”) and other digital assets could adversely affect the value of bitcoin and other digital assets. Prices of bitcoin may be affected due to stablecoins, the activities of stablecoin users and their regulatory treatment. The open-source structure of the Bitcoin network protocol means that certain core developers and other contributors may not be directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the Bitcoin network protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the Bitcoin network protocol could damage the network. Lack of clarity in the corporate governance of bitcoin may lead to ineffective decision-making that slow development or prevents the Bitcoin network from overcoming important obstacles. If the award of new bitcoin for solving blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, miners may reduce or cease processing power to solve blocks which could lead to confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain being temporarily slowed. Significant delays in transaction confirmations could result in a loss of confidence in the Bitcoin network, which could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. A temporary or permanent “fork” in the blockchain network could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Flaws in the source code of Bitcoin, or flaws in the underlying cryptography, could leave the Bitcoin network vulnerable to a multitude of attack vectors. A disruption of the internet may affect the use of bitcoin and subsequently the value of the Shares. Risks of over or under regulation in the digital asset ecosystem could stifle innovation, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares. Shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of Shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) or the protections afforded by the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”). Future regulations may require the Trust and the Sponsor to become registered, which may cause the Trust to liquidate. The tax treatment of bitcoin and other digital assets is uncertain and may be adverse, which could adversely affect the value of an investment in the Shares. Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the Bitcoin network. The venues through which bitcoin trades are relatively new and may be more exposed to operations problems or failure than trading venues for other assets. Ownership of bitcoin is pseudonymous, and the supply of accessible bitcoin is unknown. Entities with substantial holdings in bitcoin may engage in large-scale sales or distributions, either on nonmarket terms or in the ordinary course, which could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin. The Trust is subject to the risks due to its concentration in a single asset. Bitcoin spot trading venues are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional equity exchanges. Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Trust.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4770 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might face rejections near $0.4780 and $0.480. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price extended losses below the $0.480 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price even spiked below $0.4650 and tested the $0.4620 zone.

These outflows have coincided with the decline in the Bitcoin price, suggesting that the sell-offs may be directly linked to institutional sell-offs, as well as miner sell-offs. The funds have now completed seven consecutive days of outflows, so this report takes a look at what happened the last time that the outflows were this high. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Lose Money For 7 Straight Days According to data from Coinglass, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now marked their 7th consecutive day of outflows. An interesting fact about the outflows is that they have averaged around $100 million daily, leading to around $1.2 billion pulled out from the funds so far. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Enters Accumulation Zone Amid 493% In Shibarium Transaction Fees While the current trend is alarming, it is not the first time that Spot Bitcoin ETFs will be bleeding for a full week. Back in April-May 2024, these funds bled for 7 consecutive days, to an even higher degree than what is being experienced now. Additionally, the largest single-day outflow was recorded in the same month, when the funds lost $563.7 million on May 1. This previous trend could lend some insight into what is currently happening and what might happen next. Back in May, after seven consecutive days of outflows, the funds were to see upside, recording inflows for two days before seeing outflows again. However, this was only the beginning of the recovery as institutional investors began to throw their hats in the ring once again. Starting from May 13, the inflows moved fast, recording 19 consecutive days of inflow, and setting a new record. If the previous trend is anything to go by, then the Spot Bitcoin ETFs could be seeing a turnaround soon, especially with the recovery in the Bitcoin price. A repeat of the May trend would trigger inflows of epic proportions, which will drive prices as the demand grows. BTC On The Charts The Bitcoin price, despite dropping to $60,000, is still trading well above its 200-day moving average of $50,613. This suggests that the price continues to be bullish in the long term, especially as investors opt to hold rather than sell.

It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,518 swing high to the $3,230 low. A close above the $3,450 level might send Ethereum toward the $3,520 resistance.

BTC must clear the $62,500 resistance zone to continue higher in the near term. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $61,500 and $62,000 levels. The price is trading below $63,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $62,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might struggle to rise above the $62,500 and $63,000 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance Bitcoin price extended losses below the $60,000 support zone. BTC even tested the $58,500 support zone, where the bulls emerged. A low was formed at $58,448 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a decent increase above the $60,000 level. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $64,460 swing high to the $58,448 low. It even moved above the $62,000 pivot level. However, Bitcoin price is still trading below $63,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The price seems to be facing a rejection zone near the $62,500 resistance, as discussed yesterday. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $62,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $64,460 swing high to the $58,448 low. The next key resistance could be $63,000. A clear move above the $63,000 resistance might start a steady increase and send the price higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $63,500 resistance. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $65,000 resistance in the near term. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $62,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $60,500 level. The first major support is $60,000. The next support is now forming near $59,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $58,500 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $60,500, followed by $60,000.

The decision by Judge John Dorsey marks a significant step forward in the two-year-long bankruptcy proceedings, as voting by creditors plays a pivotal role in restructuring efforts. While FTX’s plan has gained support from key customer committees, a vocal group remains opposed and demands substantial revisions. FTX Offers Customers 119% Asset Recovery According to Bloomberg, under the proposed plan, most FTX customers are expected to recover 119% of their assets as of the day the company filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022. Other creditors may receive up to 143% of their owed amounts. FTX’s legal team maintains that bankruptcy law necessitates valuing claims based on their value at the time of filing, despite subsequent increases in cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Bullish On Spot Ethereum ETFs: Envisions $15 Billion Inflows FTX’s decision to solicit votes from its customer base stems from the desire to obtain feedback from previously uninvolved parties regarding the repayment plan. Additionally, the company is still negotiating with federal authorities and exploring options to utilize government claims against FTX to compensate affected customers. Notably, FTX has already settled a $24 billion tax claim from the US Internal Revenue Service. Under the settlement terms, the firm will pay the IRS $200 million within 60 days of implementing the proposed restructuring plan. The settlement allows FTX to pay a fraction of the amount claimed by the IRS, clearing the way for the exchange to distribute significant customer recoveries. The IRS will also receive a lower priority claim of $685 million, which will be paid on a subordinated basis to customers and other creditors, depending on the availability of funds. These details were outlined in a filing made by FTX in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. SBF’s Fraud Conviction Shadows Bankruptcy Proceedings FTX is currently monetizing its assets, as the platform reportedly lacked segregated digital assets directly connected to claims against the exchange. Instead, FTX possesses a collection of assets acquired using stolen customer funds, representing a complex challenge in the compensation process. Customers have until August 16 to vote on the Chapter 11 plan. Judge Dorsey will then review and potentially approve the plan on October 7, considering the outcome of the customer vote.

29961071,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626315,1719361833,This Historical Ethereum Top Signal Is Yet To Appear This Cycle,"On-chain data suggests this signal that has historically occurred around Ethereum peaks has yet to appear in the current cycle. Ethereum Foundation Wallets Haven’t Made Large Outflows This Cycle So Far In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed a pattern that Ethereum has witnessed alongside its previous market peaks. The pattern in question is related to the netflows for the wallets associated with the Ethereum Foundation. The ETH Foundation is a non-profit entity supporting the cryptocurrency and its ecosystem. Related Reading: Shiba Inu, Solana, & Cardano Are All Seeing Buy Signal: Analyst Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the net amount of ETH (in USD) moving in or out of the wallets connected to this organization. As is visible in the above graph, the netflows for the Ethereum Foundation have generally taken negative values during the past bull markets. Negative netflows naturally correlate to a net amount of ETH movement away from the wallets connected to the company. Interestingly, the indicator has seen especially large red spikes around the tops of the cryptocurrency. As IntoTheBlock explains, Historically, during each bull market, the Foundation has strategically sold substantial amounts, often aligning these sales almost perfectly with market peaks. The chart shows that the indicator’s value has been more or less neutral during the past few months, even though the asset’s price has increased significantly. This suggests that the Ethereum Foundation hasn’t been making any major sales during this bull market. Given the historical pattern, this may be a sign that a top isn’t yet here for the cryptocurrency, or at least the organization doesn’t judge it to be so. Another explanation, however, could be that the non-profit entity has changed its strategy for this new cycle, meaning that the past trend would no longer hold the same weight. In some other news, the official email of the Ethereum Foundation was recently compromised, as Tim Beiko, one of the ETH developers, had revealed in an X post. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Bullish Signal That Led To At Least 60% Jump Last 3 Times The developer had noted that the organization was trying to reach out to SendPulse, an email automation service used by the firm, to resolve the problem. In a follow-up post, Beiko confirmed that the team sent out an update to subscribers of the Ethereum Foundation blog, warning them that the previous email, announcing a “staking platform” by the organization, resulted from the compromise. “We should have locked down all external access, but we are still confirming,” said the developer in the post. ETH Price Ethereum plunged under the $3,300 level yesterday, but the asset has since recovered above $3,400.
