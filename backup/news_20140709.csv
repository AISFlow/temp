42376239,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5bv,1404949616,Ross Ulbricht Loses Bid to Dismiss Federal Silk Road Suit,"Alleged Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht has suffered a setback in his efforts to fight federal narcotics and money laundering charges after a US court rejected his bid to dismiss the suit.  Ulbricht’s lawyer originally sought to dismiss the charges in late March, citing flaws in the legal definition of money laundering. As well, the dismissal filing challenged allegations that Ulbricht directly conspired with Silk Road users.  On 9th July, US District Judge Katherine Forrest rejected the defendant’s claims regarding the validity of the charges, saying that there are sufficient grounds for Ulbricht to be prosecuted based on the government's case. According to court documents, the court dismissed Ulbricht’s claims that bitcoin does not fall within money laundering laws.  Forrest noted:  “Bitcoins carry value - that is their purpose and function - and act as a medium of exchange. Bitcoins may be exchanged for legal tender, be it US dollars, euros, or some other currency. Accordingly, [the defense’s] argument fails.”  She also wrote in her decision that prosecutors have cause to prove Ulbricht acted as the ringleader of Silk Road, saying that “whether the government can prove the facts alleged is not a question at this stage.”  Judge rejects defense arguments  Ulbricht’s defense countered the suit’s money laundering and narcotics charges, outlining a number of questions that sought to cast doubt on the validity of the prosecution’s case.  Among the challenges, the defense argued in court documents that Ulbrich did not act in a managerial capacity within the Silk Road community and that the evidence does not support these claims. Forrest disagreed, saying that the allegations were appropriate as written.  When challenging the argument that bitcoin doesn’t fall under the definition of legal money, Forrest stated that the technological usage of bitcoins make them a medium of exchange, saying that the broad legal boundaries money laundering laws operate within can be interpreted to include digital currencies.  She wrote:  “There is no doubt that if a narcotics transaction was paid for in cash, which was later exchanged for gold, then converted back to cash, that would constitute a money laundering transaction. One can launder money using bitcoin.”  Trial set for November start  With the motion to dismiss all charges rejected, the case is now expected to move to trial with a 3rd November start date. Ulbricht, who has plead not guilty, faces life behind bars for charges that also include computer hacking and continued criminal enterprise, the latter of which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years alone.  His defense will focus on a series of points, including the argument that Silk Road, like other e-commerce sites, should not be held responsible for illegal activities perpetrated on the platform. Ulbricht's family told CoinDesk in an April interview that the government has overreached in its case by misusing legal language to attack the alleged Silk Road operator.  Since Ulbricht was first arrested and charged in connection with Silk Road, efforts began to fund his defense.  A recent Twitter post by bitcoin magnate Roger Ver netted nearly 17,000 retweets, with Ver promising to donate $10 for each one. Ulbricht's mother, Lyn, recently told CoinDesk that the family has had some success in raising funds in the past few months.

42425868,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgl3h,1404945305,Former US Mint Director: How to Save Bitcoin From the Regulators,"Edmund Moy, the former director of the United States Mint under the Bush administration, first learned about bitcoin in the form of a footnote embedded in a coin demand forecast report.  When he became director of the Mint in 2006, Moy commissioned annual reports that detailed the various market forces and characteristics that have an impact on coinage needs in the United States. These includes the role of digital payment systems such as credit cards and emerging means of moving money around the internet.  In 2009, the report included a footnote briefly describing Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper on bitcoin. At the time, bitcoin and the concept of digital currencies were seen from a curious but hands-off perspective.  During the last two years Moy received the report, the footnote grew slightly in size as the first bitcoins were mined and sold and the price of the digital currency rose. But the Mint – and the rest of the US government – stayed on the lookout for future developments but continued to pursue a largely ambivalent approach.  According to Moy:  “It was on the radar, there was interest in it but it was really from the objective observer's perspective.”  He added that in the early days of bitcoin, financial regulators largely shied away from the more robust, government-wide observation and initial rule-making that is now underway in respect to digital currencies. Since then, the digital currency has increased in prominence, prompting Moy to declare bitcoin ""a disruptor to the traditional notions of currency"" in May.  As Moy told CoinDesk in a new wide-ranging interview, the emergence of new regulations that establish boundaries for how bitcoin will operate within the broader global financial system is one of the key developments shaping digital currencies today.  Why US bitcoin regulation is failing  Despite the promise of bitcoin technology, an unclear regulatory landscape makes it difficult for businesses in the US market to develop. At the heart of the problem, says Moy, is a lack of cohesive regulatory language that defines digital currency.  He said:  “Bitcoin is not just one thing. It’s not just currency, it’s not just a payment system, it’s a protocol – there’s multiple things that cross over into many different turfs of government.”  Moy described the array of federal and state-level agencies as a broad cluster of interconnected agencies, all of whom must act within the framework established by law. Given the novelty of bitcoin and, in some cases, the archaic nature of regulatory language established in past acts of Congress, regulators are left to define digital currency as best they can.  There are many past examples of this, said Moy, including a hearing earlier this year during which Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said that the Federal Reserve lacks the legal authorization to regulate digital currencies. At the time, she noted that it would be “appropriate” for Congress to investigate bitcoin and potential legislation governing it.  Moy explained:  “Every agency has to look at bitcoin from the perspective of what their agency does. So the Commodities Futures Trading Commission looks at bitcoin as a commodity, because it complies with all the issues that commodities applies with. The Federal Trade Commission looks at this as a bartering issue, as a trading issue; the FEC looks at it from an investment perspective; the IRS looks at it as a taxable event.”  Moy said that each agency can “only look at bitcoin through the prism of what they understand”. Consequently, businesses in the bitcoin space find themselves stuck within the complex legal obstacles that arise from this fragmented regulatory environment and risk failing as a result.  The steps to resolving regulatory conflict  For Moy, the solution is simple: the establishment of clear and consistent language for federal and state-level agencies to regulate digital currencies in a pro-active but growth-enabling way.  He said that support for this legislation exists and would help reduce barriers to entry for businesses that want to work with bitcoin. In the past, regulators including former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke have argued for Congress to eventually move to define regulatory language for bitcoin.  On the other hand, Moy cautioned that the time isn’t quite right for the development of a digital currency bill. He said that more education is needed on the agency level, a process that the bitcoin community can – and should – play a role in shaping.  He said:  “I think it’s an important step, now, to educate the regulators, regulate the members of Congress, particularly on the panels that have oversight on this area. So education is one key component.”  Secondly, Moy emphasized the need for self-regulation within the bitcoin community. By moving aggressively to shore up concerns held by regulators, including potential risks to consumers, companies in the bitcoin market can “illustrate to the government how this could work”.  As for whether or not there is a need for targeted digital currency legislation in the near-term, Moy was apprehensive. He said that too many members of Congress simply don’t have a strong enough understanding of bitcoin and the underlying technology to effectively draft laws to govern them.  Moy added:  “It’s probably not a good time to ask Congress to get engaged. Because even when Congress is working well, what you end up getting out of Congress is less than what you wanted at the outset. There’s that old joke in Washington: that the definition of a camel is a race-horse designed by a Congressional committee.”  Bank integration of bitcoin possible  Moy explained that the broader financial and monetary frameworks could come to integrate bitcoin should the regulatory environment clear up. He said that major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Bank of America have established teams of experts focusing exclusively on digital currency.  More likely, he said, is that the bitcoin protocol will be integrated within existing banking or payments systems in order to tap the security benefits afforded by encryption. This is a sentiment expressed previously by bankers who have publicly noted the benefits of block chain technology in a payment-system context.  However, Moy said the presence of legacy systems – and a vested interest in maintaining and profiting from them – could pressure banks to stay away from bitcoin. Nonetheless, the technology itself may prove beneficial if adopted in targeted ways.  He said:  “They know that legacy systems cost more and more to maintain. It was built for one era but it won’t last another era. [Banks are looking at] ways to improve that, or come up with a replacement using some of this protocol to make things more secure and less costly.”  The evolution of money  Moy explained that ultimately, bitcoin represents a possible step forward in the debate surrounding the exact definition of money itself. What we’re seeing now, he said, is a broad decentralization of money that the technology underpinning bitcoin has made possible.  In its infancy, money was used as a medium of exchange to replace the action of bartering. Precious metals served in this capacity for hundreds of years until paper monies emerged that were backed by the value of gold. This was the framework until the mid-twentieth century, when between the 1930s and 1970s governments worldwide shifted to fiat currencies, which are backed by the legal establishment of the countries that issue them.  This evolution is a process by which our ideas of money – and the trust placed in a given currency – have changed. Moy explained that bitcoin is step away from currencies backed by trust in a government and toward a medium of exchange that is supported by whatever the market deems it to be.  He said:  “Does bitcoin have a value? Absolutely it does, because the market says it does. As long as there’s confidence in bitcoin, by the market, that is an evolutionary step from having confidence in a sovereign government.”  Moy said that it’s unlikely bitcoin will replace the US dollar or other fiat currencies directly in the near-term. He argued that digital currencies will co-exist with other currency systems, adding that history demonstrates how diverse mediums of exchange can and often do develop a purpose over time.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/09/former-us-mint-director-how-to-save-bitcoin-from-the-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c89dab18f4343b98b434f4e837300a73510a9e5d-859x527.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377448,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yp5,1404940516,"BitPay Releases Beta for Open-Source, Multi-Signature Bitcoin Wallet","Bitcoin payments processor BitPay has released the beta version of an open-source, multi-signature wallet service called Copay.  Copay  aims to provide a solution to a central security issue posed by the use of a private key – that bitcoins can become compromised and stolen if someone fraudulently gains access to it. The issue has brought a lot of attention to multisig technology, with several notable companies in the ecosystem developing and releasing multisig wallets in recent months.  BitPay chief executive and co-founder Stephen Pair told CoinDesk that the company expects multisig transactions to become the norm for routine, day-to-day usage, saying:  “Almost three years ago the ground work for multisig transactions was prepared with extensive design work by the core developers. The concerns back then, as now, was making bitcoin more secure against theft.”  How Copay works  Copay's origins trace back to an internal transaction security mechanism within BitPay. Over time, the company gradually worked toward making the tool a secure wallet for mainstream and enterprise usage. As Pair explained:  “We have always wanted to leverage this technology to not only increase the security of our bitcoin storage, but also to create a workflow for authorizing expenditures. We wanted to make sure any expenditures were signed by authorized people within the company.”  Copay establishes peer-to-peer connections with wallet users. To use the wallet, each user must create his or her own master key and share the public portion with other copayers. The wallet allows up to 12 copayers and four required signatures.  When a user wants to spend bitcoins from a shared wallet, the other copayers receive an alert prompting them to confirm or reject the transaction.  Once the minimum number of participants – determined by the wallet's creator – verifies the spending activity, the transaction is completed and broadcasted to the bitcoin network.  Previously dubbed Cosign  , Copay uses Insight, an open source block chain explorer and API, and is built on top of Bitcore, BitPay's native interface to the Bitcoin protocol. CoPay is currently in beta and available on Github.  BitPay indicated on its blog that it welcomes beta testers, but cautioned that the project remains under development.  The year of multisig  BitGo  , Xapo and BitWasp, among others, have begun implementing multisig technology into their services in recent months, resulting in new funding and product launches.  BitGo received $12m  during an investor funding round in June , while last week, the Boost VC-backed BlockCypher released a free API that allows developers to incorporate the security feature to their own apps.  Demand for multisig wallets is increasing considerably as block chain technology develops, consumer education becomes more widespread and questions of secure storage become more pertinent.  The need for such technology has long been argued by prominent members of the bitcoin community.  Addressing the audience at the Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen called 2014 ""the year of multisig"", saying:  “I think wallets will be nicer, I think user interfaces will be polished, I think it will be, you know, much more secure. I think multisignature will go a long way for that.”  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/09/bitpay-releases-beta-for-open-source-multi-signature-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2279b0b23709180ec8ee8d7a7a6196ee370632de-690x533.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yWD,1404935480,New Study: Low Bitcoin Transaction Fees Unsustainable,"Transaction fees have come to the fore again after core developer Gavin Andresen indicated that the next bitcoin core update would feature a new way to determine fees.  The issue of setting transaction fees has occupied core developers for some time. Andresen, for example, wrote about the issue last February, raising the possibility of a higher, fixed, fee for transactions.  Rising bitcoin transaction fees are the focus of a new paper that was published as part of the International Conference on Digital Security and Forensics held in the Czech Republic in June.  The paper's author, Kerem Kaskaloglu is an instructor in cryptography at Ozyegin University in Istanbul. He warned that a new system for fee-setting was required because transaction fees are currently too low and are set to rise over the years.  ""Right now, we have subsidies, so we don't really need any transaction fees,"" he said. ""Because of subsidies, miners are willing to mine. But later on, as the subsidy goes away, we definitely need to figure out a balance between miners and users of the network.""  Satisfied miners  Kaskaloglu's paper says that miners are currently satisfied with the value of block rewards, thus not requiring high transaction fees to motivate them to continue mining. Block rewards act as a form of subsidy for bitcoin transaction costs.  But the current model of transaction donations is unsustainable, the paper argues. As the supply of new bitcoins shrinks, this scarcity will outstrip even the accompanying price rise in bitcoin, thanks to the limited number of potential bitcoin users in the world, Kaskaloglu wrote.  As a result, the cost of mining will increase greatly while the rewards from each block will be insufficient to create enough profit after the increased costs are accounted for. Kaskaloglu noted this state of affairs is not imminent, but could take place anywhere between five and 20 years from now, explaining the difficulty in calculating this with certainty. He wrote:  ""It is a daunting task to come up with an estimation about when bitcoin transactions should be charged by fees rather than donations [...] the value of the block reward depends highly on the price of a bitcoin, which in turn is related with the adoption of bitcoin, which in turn is [...] hard to foresee.""  Difficulties setting a fee  Kaskaloglu's paper describes some of the difficulties in creating a new transaction fee system. One possible solution is to set a fixed fee for each transaction. In February, Andresen calculated that a miner should demand a fee of at least 0.0008 BTC, which at the time was worth $0.41, to include an average-sized transaction.  One problem with the fixed-fee system is that it severely hampers the utility of bitcoin for making micro-transactions, Kaskaloglu argued:  ""Even that amount [Andresen's $0.41 figure] is slightly frightening for small transactions, because bitcoin is highly promoted for little or no transaction fees for small transactions. But if you set a fixed fee, that wouldn't allow that kind of application of bitcoin – for example, tipping.""  Another approach would involve limiting the number of transactions per block. This approach would make the number of included transactions more scarce, so that senders who pay a fee above a certain threshold would be more sure of inclusion.  But the problem with the limited-transaction approach lies in determining the threshold at which a transaction would be included. Since the volume of transactions fluctuates, the threshold constantly shifts. As a result, senders will face difficulty in calculating the correct threshold when they initiate a transaction. As Kaskaloglu wrote:  ""This threshold will be a dynamic one depending on the instantaneous traffic of transactions so that the sender will not be able to figure out whether her transaction will be delayed or not in advance.""  New floating fees  Andresen's proposed update to transaction fees is a step toward a dynamic fee system. The updated core software will 'float' fees, calculating the required fee for a quick confirmation, for each transaction. In some cases, there may be no fee for a quick confirmation – like a high-value transaction that re-spends old bitcoins – which is designated as a high-priority transaction.  Under the new proposal, fees could be as high as nearly 0.02 BTC for a quick confirmation, based on Andresen's published test data. This is up from the current fee of 0.0001 BTC, Andresen noted in his blog post announcing the proposal.  Importance of a fee system  Kaskaloglu welcomed the planned improvements to the bitcoin core's transaction fee system. The academic believes that maintaining low transaction fees is essential to bitcoin's mass adoption.  ""I think [low fees] are absolutely crucial,"" he said."" There are two main charms of bitcoin: low transaction fees is the main one, and the other is that bitcoin reaches anywhere in the world with Internet.""  Members of Bitcoin Talk were distinctly nonplussed by Kaskaloglu's paper. One poster, who goes by QuestionAuthority, responded to the paper thusly:  ""OK, so what? Everything I read is already known.""  Kaskaloglu conceded that his paper makes no new technical contribution to the fee-setting system. But he was motivated to publish it as a way to underline the importance of improving on the way transaction fees are currently handled.  ""I knew the hardcore users already knew about this stuff,"" he said. ""It's not groundbreaking, but I wanted to alert people about the future of transaction fees. We need more studies about [this topic] and I would like to see more people be aware of the issue.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/09/new-study-low-bitcoin-transaction-fees-unsustainable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/131ecdf194b2ff18b60b4fcb7185eb9a3068cdee-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Lecpetex botnet managed to infect 250,000 computers. At its peak it compromised as many as 50,000 Facebook accounts.  Lecpetex propagated through the social media platform using spam messages with malicious code inserted into zipped attachments.  Each zip archive contained an embedded Java file that would download and install a litecoin miner. It would also steal cookies and gain access to the victim's friend list, using it to send out even more spam.  However, mining was not its only function. The botnet was also used to distribute more dangerous malware designed to steal banking details, passwords and bitcoins.  My big fat Greek botnet  Facebook detected the Lecpetex botnet months ago and it is believed that it first started spreading in December.  The social media giant says it tracked more than 20 distinct waves of spam sent out by the botnet between December 2013 and June 2014.  On 30th April, Facebook asked the Cybercrime Subdivision of the Greek Police for assistance. Greek investigators managed to catch up with the botnet's authors on 3rd July and they were detained on the same day.  Greek police told Facebook that the perpetrators were in the process of establishing a ‘bitcoin mixing’ service that would enable them to launder the stolen bitcoins.  As Greek police started closing in on the operators, they left notes for them to find on compromised command and control servers.  One such message read:  “Hello people.. :) <!-- Designed by the SkyNet Team --> but am not the f***ing zeus bot/skynet bot or whatever piece of sh*t.. no fraud here.. only a bit of mining. Stop breaking my ballz [sic].”  Facebook published its findings on the botnet in an extensive blog post.  No word on damage caused  Although Facebook says it learned a few lessons while it dismantled the botnet, there is still no official information on the damage Lecpetex caused.  “Our analysis revealed two distinct malware payloads delivered to infected machines: the DarkComet RAT, and several variations of litecoin mining software. Ultimately the botnet operators focused on litecoin mining to monetize their pool of infected systems,” the company said.  Although the number of affected PCs is relatively low compared to many other botnets, it's likely that Lecpetex generated some litecoins, though the number is unknown. The ‘bitcoin mixing’ effort cited by Facebook also indicates that bitcoins were likely to have been stolen by the botnet.  According to Greek media reports, the operators of the botnet claimed they were using the data for ""research purposes"", not monetary gain. The pair were released from custody earlier this week.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | LTC | MARKET | MINING | RESEARCH,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/09/facebook-breaks-up-cryptocurrency-mining-botnet-lecpetex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1fcfe99f5146faf1d26b8177c18d5fa49c52136-1000x706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The announcement from the Foundation represents perhaps the most high-profile bitcoin lobbying effort to date. In May, Falcon Global Capital hired a lobbying firm to work with Congress, joining Peck Madigan Jones and other companies who are pushing legislators on the topic of digital currency.  Thorsen French Advocacy  , founded in 2010, is led by Alec French and Carl Thorsen. The two long-time legislative officials have served in various legal capacities within the US government, as well as key positions in the private sector.  Jim Harper  , the Foundation’s global policy counsel, said in a press statement that some members of Congress are already familiar with both bitcoin and its underlying technology. However, Harper noted that more work needs to be done to educate government leaders about the opportunities offered by the digital currency.  He said:  “The lawmakers and regulators who have studied bitcoin take the sensible position that government should seek its benefits and mitigate its risks. We’re carrying this message to Capitol Hill so the bitcoin community can focus on building tools and services that enrich and improve people’s lives around the world.”  The announcement builds on previous efforts by the Foundation to lobby members of Congress, regulators and federal officials on digital currency.  Education leads to greater adoption  The primary goal, the Foundation said, is to create an environment conducive to broader bitcoin adoption. Its lobbying efforts in Congress will likely aim to harmonize federal-level regulations to make it simpler for bitcoin to enter mainstream usage.  This sentiment was echoed by Jon Matonis, the Foundation’s executive director, who said in a statement:  “When governments are properly informed about bitcoin’s promise, the technology’s social and economic benefits are recognized and its rapid innovation and adoption will increase.""  In a press conference organised by the Foundation, Harper stated that Thorsen French will act as conversation-starters and bridge-builders between the bitcoin ecosystem and Congressional leaders. He added that they can act as a voice for the bitcoin community, influencing public policy on bitcoin as it continues to take shape.  Working with regulators and legislators  Thorsen French will focus on a number of key policy areas, working with both regulators and members of Congress to address potential barriers for bitcoin while also building opportunities for its use.  Specifically, the lobbying efforts will seek to find a balance between privacy concerns and law enforcement as it relates to bitcoin; clarify the US government’s stance on digital currency taxation; and develop more inclusive, but effective, consumer protection rules.  Harper expressed the hope that Thorsen French will forge key relationships between the bitcoin ecosystem and Washington, stating:  “The goal is to clear the decks, clear the way, so that the bitcoin community, businesses and people can build the services, expand out to more and more people the world over, and really deliver on the benefits that bitcoin promises.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/09/bitcoin-foundation-hires-firm-to-lobby-congress-on-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e4030b43d713041c7c478720bfe6c172decb35f-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ylJ,1404907361,Brock Pierce Announces Dollar-backed Cryptocurrency 'Realcoin',"Bitcoin entrepreneur Brock Pierce has announced the launch of 'realcoin', a new cryptocurrency backed by the US dollar.  Realcoin aims to bring the advantages of the bitcoin protocol to the dollar, meaning it can utilise the bitcoin network for low-cost transactions without a third party, but it is backed on a one-to-one basis by the company's dollar reserves.  The approach is ultimately aimed to eliminate volatility, but will help prevent confusion over divisions of higher-value coins like bitcoin too – as one dollar will be worth one realcoin, rather than 0.001608 BTC at the current price.  This is not the first altcoin to use this particular name. However, the new cryptocurrency announced by Pierce, along with ad-industry entrepreneur Reeve Collins and Mastercoin’s Craig Sellars, is unrelated to previous 'realcoin' projects.  It is, however, based on the same concept as Coinaaa (AAA), a cryptocurrency backed by Norway's national currency, the krone (NOK).  'Digitizing the dollar'  Realcoin  uses the bitcoin protocol and can be described as a 'Bitcoin 2.0’ venture, that is, one that is built on top of the existing bitcoin infrastructure.  In chat with the Wall Street Journal, Collins explained the confusion that often arises over bitcoin's different aspects:  “Unfortunately, there has been confusion for people between the currency called bitcoin and the technology called bitcoin, when they are distinctly different things.”  Realcoin, he said, is basically “digitizing the dollar” by giving it access to the bitcoin block chain.  How it works  With each coin backed by USD, realcoin will have an additional layer on top of the block chain to make it work. This is made possible by the Mastercoin protocol, which is used to infuse each realcoin with the necessary digital signature.  Realcoin will maintain a real-time record of all USD reserves that will be held in “conservative investments” and the full record will be authenticated by the block chain.  The company explains:  “Realcoin will be completely transparent, safe, secure and insured. Every dollar that is held in our reserve will be represented by one coin in circulation and can be redeemed at any time.”  The one-to-one reserve will be fully auditable, too, according to realcoin.  Global plans  Collins says the company has already signed a deal with a major banking partner and plans is to make similar deals with other banks in order to utilise the ATM infrastructure to buy, trade or redeem realcoins anywhere in the world.  Realcoin says it is already trying to obtain a money transmitter licence in the US.  Eventually, the company also aims to introduce similar cryptocurrencies, backed by the euro and yen, to open up the advantages of the bitcoin protocol to users of other currencies.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/09/brock-pierce-announces-dollar-backed-cryptocurrency-realcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4a8e03d910211d050d5a69cfb384b871e3cd1d2-1271x654.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377433,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ycV,1404901296,Philippines Startups Aim to Fulfil Bitcoin's Remittance Promise,"Update (9th July, 22:15 GMT): with extra information about remittance fees.  One of bitcoin's promised 'killer apps,' and one regularly cited as a use case whose time has come, is overseas remittances – providing cheaper and improved services for foreign workers sending money back to their home country.  Now, several startup platforms in the Philippines are setting up the foundations of the infrastructure needed to allow people to send and receive bitcoin easily.  That bitcoin use has not already become widespread in the remittance industry comes as a surprise to some. Near-instant international payments, low or even free transaction fees, and a potential absence of currency conversion seemingly offer a competitive edge over 'legacy' systems like Western Union or MoneyGram, whose fees and processes are regarded by bitcoiners as dated and even exploitative of low-income populations.  Additionally, with bitcoin, there's no need for either party in a transaction to have a bank account. According to a column in The Economist, that's something over 80% of African adults lack. Adding all the developing world's other unbanked individuals, the potential for bitcoin to bring financial services to this ignored market is huge.  Where is bitcoin?  Bitcoin's lack of success in developing markets so far, however, is not so surprising when you consider the situation of people based in the countries where it could be most useful.  To be truly advantageous, an entire bitcoin economy would need to arise at each end first – that is, users would earn bitcoin, transmit bitcoin to relatives who would then spend bitcoin at the other end.  This chicken-and-egg scenario in which bitcoin co-exists with existing (and more commonly accepted) fiat currencies means that currency conversions must still occur at each end of the transmission, which then requires intermediaries in the form of bitcoin exchanges and the fees they will necessarily levy.  Liquidity and governments  Further complicating the situation are the lack of exchange liquidity (the ease with which bitcoin can be bought or sold) in the emerging markets where remittances are most often used and a lack of competition in the space.  Additionally, bitcoin exchanges may find themselves facing the same regulatory hurdles and costs as the entrenched money-transmission system, who must deal with anti-money laundering rules and unwieldy banking systems in certain countries.  Local governments with their own interests at stake may even throw up their own barriers to unregulated digital currencies and exchanges, no matter how economically advantageous they are to the population.  Hope ahead  The good news is that a number of companies have emerged to make serious attempts at solving these problems, setting up unified platforms with exchange functions at both ends and direct deposits into bank accounts. And some of those companies are based in and focusing on the Philippines.  The Southeast Asian country is hardly the poorest in the world, and its ranking of 114th on the 2012 UN Human Development Indexhttps://data.undp.org/dataset/Table-1-Human-Development-Index-and-its-components/wxub-qc5k is still higher than many Asian and African countries.  Yet, Philippines is a special case: over 12 million, or 10% of the entire population, live and work overseas, sending $23bn back home in 2013 – that's large enough to form a key sector of the country's economy.  Most of those workers are in low-paying service jobs, and currently pay up to 10% to money transmitters to send smaller amounts (for example, $100) home.  Update: It has been pointed out that several existing remittance services, such as Xoom and Remitly, offer lower flat fees on larger remittances ($200 or more) which actually make up the bulk of money sent from the US to the Philippines. Western Union and Moneygram have also lowered rates recently. The fees increase as dollar amounts drop and the necessity for prompt transfers increases.  The Philippine bitcoin community has grown fast and its Facebook group now has over 2,000 members from all sectors of the bitcoin economy. Startups like Bitmarket.ph are already trying to find bitcoin-related solutions to local problems in areas such as merchant payment solutions.  The country now has a full open-book exchange called Coinage.ph, and existing buy/sell services like BuyBitcoin.ph.  The current Philippine government, which is regarded as more business-friendly than previous administrations, does not currently regulate bitcoin and has not announced any intention to do so.  Rebit.ph  Co-founder of merchant/e-commerce service Bitmarket.ph Miguel Cuneta is a prominent member of the local bitcoin community. In the past month, he and his fellow entrepreneurs have also launched Rebit.ph, a service aimed specifically at remittances.  Rebit.ph  aims to solve the conversion problem as efficiently as possible, while highlighting its founders' status as established members of the business community to build trust in the bitcoin startup.  Bitmarket also operates at least one Skyhook bitcoin ATM and is currently talking to other companies about building a more thorough merchant and payment ecosystem.  This week it announced a new integration using the Coinbase API for US customers, a reduction from %3 to 1% in the transfer fee, and a 0% fee on exchange from BTC to the local national currency, the peso.  Rebit.ph is being marketed with a ""grassroots approach"" that even allows the remitter to purchase rice and other food directly instead of sending money (or a combination of both) – a service Rebit is calling 'Satoshi Rice'.  Otherwise, remitters can choose whether to send money to a home address, a bank account, or have the receiver come in person to collect it from Rebit's office.  Cuneta said:  ""We realized that profiteering on remittances is the problem, and decided to turn this into almost a pure cost recovery model and make revenues in the other channels we provide. Remittance is a big big thing for Filipinos and as Filipinos ourselves, we know first hand how hard these people work and sacrifice to send what little they earn back to their families.""  He describes Rebit and similar services as a ""temporary solution"", and maintains a long-term hope that some day recipients will not have to convert bitcoins back into local currency.  Until then, a comparison chart on Rebit's platform shows just how big the cost difference is between using bitcoin and existing transmission services like Western Union, Moneygram and Xoom.  Sendmoney.ph  CEO of Coins.ph Ron Hose, who was profiled on CoinDesk recently, has also founded a separate remittance-focused service called Sendmoney.ph.  This integrates with Coins.ph's exchange and merchant network, and works in a similar fashion to Rebit.ph – sending money either to a selection of bank accounts or other existing payment services.  Hose told CoinDesk about the practical side of the exchange and remittance business, including liquidity issues surrounding currency conversion at the Philippine end and regulation in different jurisdictions.  The advantage of having operated Coins.ph for six months already, he said, is being accustomed to dealing with biases in day-to-day trade by tapping into international liquidity providers and factoring the cost of doing so into Sendmoney's buy/sell spread.  Bitcoin in the remittance arena  ""The beauty of bitcoin is [that it is] an open network, so it promotes more competition, and hence better pricing and efficiency,"" Hose said, adding:  ""We are still very early in the game, but since many of the costs of running an exchange are fixed, we expect pay-in/pay-out percent fees will decrease as exchanges grow in volume, as well as [to] figure out additional ways to monetize other than transaction fees.""  There are still unknowns surrounding bitcoin remittances and existing regulation in different countries, Hose indicated. With that in mind, Coins.ph follows know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) practices despite not being required to under Philippine law.  Once everyone accepts bitcoin, he added, it would cause a ""disruption on the scale of what Skype did to long distance calling rates"".  In emerging markets, though, bitcoin already offered a compelling value proposition without even having to reach that scale – the existing banking infrastructure is sufficiently costly to be of no use to a majority of the population, who could never afford the initial deposit required to open an account.  ""You only need one or two exchanges per market to bootstrap the bitcoin economy,"" Hose concluded.
