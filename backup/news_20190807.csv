42382494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrFX,1565220606,South Korean Crypto Exchange Signs With Security Companies to Lock Down Tokens,"Coinone has signed deals with CertiK and Xangle to improve security and enhance disclosure, according to an announcement from the company.  The number three Korean crypto exchange says that it will be working with Xangle on investor protection and project transparency. With CertiK, it will be focused on the security of the code, technology verification, and project information security.  The moves come as crypto exchanges are the subject of heightened scrutiny in South Korea and globally. With concerns about money laundering and with FATF guidelines beginning to have an impact, banking relationships are being tested and financial institutions in Seoul are refining their KYC programs and processes.  Just today, it was reported that the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) is planning to directly supervise the exchanges.  With concerns about hacking on the rise, Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in June called for a change in the terms and conditions of use for crypto exchanges, requiring the exchanges themselves to accept liability for any losses from theft. Bithumb, the second largest exchange in South Korea, suffered two hacks in one year, losing more than $50 million in the process. Coinone itself was raided in early 2018, along with Bithumb, by the South Korean tax authorities.  A report in the local Korea press says that one of the concerns for Coinone is the possibility that the coins themselves could introduce viruses into the exchange and allow for the hacking of it.  New York-based CertiK, founded in 2017, led by two academics and with investment from Binance Labs and Consensus Labs, specializes in the 'verifying' of blockchains and smart contracts. It says that what it does is beyond a simple audit. It is a formal verification, whereby programs are mathematically tested and proven.  CertiK is already quite active in South Korea. In June, it signed a deal with FLETA, a local blockchain platform. The goal of the partnership is to strengthen the company's systems and help secure other elements of its ecosystem. CertiK also conducted an audit of Terra, publishing a report on the stablecoin on May 4.  Xangle is a Seoul-based crypto currency disclosure platform. It provides ""tear-sheet""-style summaries of a token's fundamentals and structure, including the formal name, registered address, key people, pricing and major milestones. It does so in both Korean and English.

42382499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rrKZ,1565217024,An Extortion Gone Bad: Inside Binance’s Negotiations With Its ‘KYC Leaker’,"The Takeaway  Prior to publishing details about real Binance customers online Wednesday, a hacker operating under the pseudonym “Bnatov Platon” had a month-long conversation with CoinDesk reporters.  In the talks, Platon revealed how he allegedly hacked individuals behind an earlier hack in which 7,000 bitcoin was stolen from the world’s largest exchange.  Platon claimed his aims were altruistic, and that he simply wanted to bring the hackers' identities to justice. However, it appears he also effectively asked for money in exchange for promises he would not release Binance’s customer data.  Platon and Binance would hold numerous talks, and reportedly struck a deal that was later aborted. CoinDesk has obtained full transcripts of these conversations.      In what appears to be an elaborate game of hackers hacking hackers, an individual operating under the pseudonym “Bnatov Platon” has provided CoinDesk with extensive information about their attempts to obtain millions of dollars in exchange for declining to release information about customers of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance.  Information about the hack, gathered over a month-long interaction with the hacker, was pushed into the public eye today when Platon began posting what he alleged were images and information about real Binance customers, first on an open website and then on Telegram.  The idea customer information might not be safe on the world’s largest exchange was enough to immediately spark the attention of the industry, with major news websites and Twitter influencers swiftly broadcasting the news.  Yet, the full story was – and remains – more complicated than it first appeared.  First, it has deep roots, extending back to an incident in May when an outside group broke into Binance user accounts and stole 7,000 bitcoin. At the time, Binance was, as always, public about its problems, describing it as part of a “large-scale security breach” in which “hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes and potentially other info.”  Unmentioned, however, was that identifying user information may have been leaked.  It’s during this event that Platon alleges the information they have obtained about Binance customers was produced, although in a twist, he says he was not the perpetrator of the hack, but that he hacked an exchange “insider” involved in the heist.  In another turn, Binance alleges the customer data was obtained from an unnamed third-party company it has contracted to conduct its know-your-customer (KYC) since February 2018.  Further, CoinDesk has confirmed at least two of the hundreds of profiles leaked belong to real customers who provided identifying information to the exchange. One of the images we analyzed seemed to have been doctored but the person whose identity appeared in the picture confirmed she had created a Binance account around the time of the leaks.  In conversations with CoinDesk, Platon has claimed they are a ""white hat hacker"" and, in a few comments, suggested they were asking Binance for a bug bounty for exposing the information. Negotiations broke down, however, and Platon and Binance representatives reported that he asked for 300 bitcoin in order to further expand on the data he held.  In a statement, Binance responded to the “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” cast by the news:  “We would like to inform you that an unidentified individual has threatened and harassed us, demanding 300 BTC in exchange for withholding 10,000 photos that bear similarity to Binance KYC data. We are still investigating this case for legitimacy and relevancy.”  We have contacted Binance for further comment.  Platon claims they have 60,000 pieces of KYC information in his collection.  What follows is what we know about the negotiations and their aftermath.  Moving Money  CoinDesk’s interaction with Platon first began in July, when we began reporting on the movement of bitcoins stolen in the May breach of Binance.  Binance responded to the hack at the time, saying malicious actors acquired customers’ APIs, two-factor codes, and “potentially other information.”  Platon’s take on the incident was different. They allege that an insider within the organization helped make a number of APIs public that allowed the hackers to directly access client accounts. Hackers stored lists of client API keys - the codes used to access their accounts remotely - in text files Platon claimed to be able to acquire. This allowed the hackers to access funds remotely.  The files also “contain extremely serious information” including customers' email addresses and account passwords, Platon said. The customers at risk had opened Binance accounts between 2018 and 2019.  Using this personal information, the hackers wrote a malicious script that allowed them to instantly withdraw .002 BTC (roughly $23) at a time. The code placed a buy order for an obscure token called the BlockMason Credit Protocol and converted it to bitcoin. The code, which we have examined, could also perform a number of functions using API calls that are no longer open or public. When we tested one API call, however, a simple request for the server time, it was still open. It is unclear if the closed API endpoints were removed or simply hidden.  Platon alleges the stolen coins were held in a wallet hosted by bitcoin software wallet provider Blockchain, the maker of the recently launched PIT exchange.  By following a trail leading from this wallet, Platon discovered that the hackers had laundered 2,000 bitcoins though Bitmex, Yobit, KuCoin, and Huobi and were looking to convert as much as $1 million in bitcoin per day.  How It Worked  Of the 60,000 customer accounts Platon alleges were breached, he shared 636 files with CoinDesk. He hoped the media attention would spur Binance to announce the true extent of the hack, and bring the attackers to justice.        For its part, Binance announced the stolen bitcoin came only from their corporate accounts and did not affect consumers. At the time, the exchange also suspended deposits and withdrawals to protect users. However, the extent of leaked user information was kept secret.  In addition to images of passports, drivers licenses and actual headshots of users holding up their IDs, Platon also supplied a few examples of metadata associated with the images.  For example, this code suggests a user went through KYC on 03/20/2018:    ""id"": 1573211,""userId"": ""25276308"",""front"": ""/IDS_IMG20180320/25276308_0_9416819.jpg"",""back"": ""/IDS_IMG20180320/25276308_1_7376587.jpg"",""hand"": ""/IDS_IMG20180320/25276308_2_4413070.jpg"",""auditor"": ""chenxiaozi"",""message"": """",""status"": 1,""createTime"": ""2018-03-20 08:12:33"",""updateTime"": ""2018-03-21 01:48:33"",""number"": ""s532557730580"",""firstName"": ""m[REDACTED]"",""lastName"": ""[REDACTED]"",""type"": 2,""sex"": 1,""country"": ""United States of America (USA)（美国）"",""email"": ""[REDACTED]@outlook.com"",""version"": 1    The KYC took place in China as suggested by the name of the auditor as well as the addition of the “美国” at the end of the country code. It is unclear what the other fields represent.  Further, Platon sent CoinDesk code that he described as accessing a back door placed in Binance servers by an “insider.” Analysis of the code suggests Platon is correct.  “This is highly likely to be an API key attack,” said Viktor Shpak, CTO at blockchain development firm VisibleMagic. “They harvested API keys from somewhere.”  API keys are used to authenticate services within exchanges and other applications and could allow a hacker to do anything from buy cryptocurrency on a victim’s behalf to actually moving cryptocurrency to an outside wallet.  Shpak said code in particular is suggestive of a back door within Binance although CoinDesk was not able to independently verify access via this function and the associated API key.    public static String getApiKey(String uri, String userId) {    String time = """";      time = get(""https://www.binance.com/api/v1/time"");    Map<String, String> param = new HashMap<String, String>();    param.put(""userId"", userId);    param.put(""desc"", ""api"" + JSON.parseObject(time).getString(""serverTime""));    return post(uri + ""/exchange/mgmt/account/getApiKey"", param);  }    “Most likely an insider created a handler to get access to user API keys then they harvested those API keys and got access to user data and have built nice toolkit to work through this,” he said.  Though, when confronted with this information at the time, a Binance representative said, “As of the latest from the team, there is currently no evidence that these are KYC images from Binance and they are not watermarked per our system process.”  Platon’s motivation  While speaking with CoinDesk, Platon also contacted Binance’s chief growth officer (CGO), Ted Lin, as part of a multi-front effort to bring the hackers to justice (or so he alleges).  “I personally wanted to make Binance world’s first exchange that capture hackers. It will be extremely positive for Binance’s reputation,” Planton said, who added:  “I informed [Lin] that I have got insider information such as insider's detail, insider's communication details with outsiders and even insider's photo. I informed him that I have details of hackers - server information, their identity, their phone numbers and etc.”  In a message from Lin that Platon shared with CoinDesk, the CGO was receptive to pay for information that could lead to the arrest of the hackers, insiders and recovery of funds.  However, in this same message, Lin rebuffed Platon for the “FUD campaign” he was running.  “As I said, we don't react to extortions,” Lin said. In earlier conversations with CoinDesk, Platon claimed to be independently wealthy, and the operator of a crypto exchange he says is one-third the size of Binance.  He also said he wasn’t interested in financial remuneration. “When I require money, I can just hack out one exchange account balance (hacker's). I could retrieve more than 600 or 700 coins easily by hacking hacker's wallet,” Platon said.  “But I didn't touch single penny while watching more and more coins are laundered out and moved around to remove track,” he said, claiming he didn’t want to tip the hackers off that he was on their trail.  Conversation breaks down  Despite Platon’s allegedly altruistic aims, CoinDesk later learned from Platon and Binance officials the supposed white hat hacker was requesting 300 bitcoin, about $3 million at July’s exchange rate, paid in 50 installments for his information.  Somewhere along the line, however, negotiations broke down. On July 22, just five days after they initially contacted CoinDesk, Platon said he had stopped negotiating with Binance.  “For about a month of negotiation, they didn't pay a single penny,” Platon said. “My deal with Binance is broken.”  It was then that Platon’s conversations with Binance degenerated into a hostage negotiation, with Platon threatening to dump whatever customer information he had acquired.  Platon supplied the following alleged exchange with Ted Lin where the negotiations broke down:    Ted Lin, [20.07.19 19:54]      i see you already fed the info you have to the media    Ted Lin, [20.07.19 19:59]    given the damage from your FUD campaign is already done, whatever bounty you were asking for the information would be significantly less. As i said, we don’t react to extortions. But we are willing to get more information relating to perpetrators if you have useful information that can enable us to put bad guys behind bars and recover funds.    Platon, [21.07.19 16:53]    as i said i don’t need your money    Platon, [21.07.19 16:53]    i am out of deal already    Platon, [21.07.19 16:54]    i am not expecting you to react either.    Platon, [21.07.19 16:59]    but i love to see insider’s and those hacker’s reaction when news is published. once again i am not interested in your reaction.    Ted Lin, [21.07.19 19:04]    I thought you want to see those hackers caught?    Platon, [21.07.19 19:11]    i wanted. but not now.    Platon, [21.07.19 19:12]    i rather step away and keep watching.    Ted Lin, [21.07.19 19:19]    We are still interested in paying for information that can lead to arrest of hackers, insiders, recovery of funds.    Ted Lin, [21.07.19 19:19]    Let us know if you have more info that can achieve those.    Ted Lin, [21.07.19 19:20]    We were going through verification of the type of info you have before you decided not to talk.    Ted Lin, [21.07.19 19:21]    Let me know if you change your mind and want to continue.    Ted Lin, [21.07.19 19:21]    Thanks for your help.    Platon, [21.07.19 19:28]    Then pay me.    “My decision for negotiation with Binance was wrong,” he said, “They are not the right people… so I will just publish all data to its customers.”  Indeed, speaking with a Binance representative on July 22 Platon said, a “current interest of mine is those hackers and insider in your company. Would love to see their reaction when the news is published.”  On August 5, Platon’s threats became a reality, as he uploaded a document dump containing a total of 500 photos for 166 people's KYC to an open file sharing site, under the pseudonym “Guardian M.”  This was followed up by a second dump containing hundreds of images of individuals holding their IDs, to a Telegram group on Wednesday morning.  Platon's explanation is simple: they think they are doing the right thing.  ""People keep asking, 'Why are you releasing those KYC photos?,' 'How did you get them?' The reason I am releasing those KYC is simple: To warn you people who are dealing on Binance,"" they wrote. ""If I needed money, I would sell it underground, not to publish it.""  Image via Twitter.

Today, Canadian and American regulators coordinated under the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and executed by New Jersey officials have issued emergency orders against Zoptax and UNOcall, two NJ-based ICOs.  Part of “Operation Cryptosweep,” the Bureau of Securities alleges both ICOs were offering fraudulent securities offerings. Zoptax was seeking between $500,000 and $3.4 million for its Zoptax Coins while UNOcall was issuing tokens and investments in its staking protocol which offered daily interest returns between 0.18% - 0.88%.  New Jersey's Attorney General's Office says the nature of issuance, the purpose of the investments, and misleading consumer information was behind the decision. A full stop on issuance was ordered.  In a statement, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said that market rules apply to all businesses, regardless of the medium they exist on:  “[The] Bureau of Securities stands ready to enforce our investor protection laws in cases involving initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency-related investment schemes. As innovation in the online cryptocurrency-related investment market continues, market players need to understand that the rules still apply to them.”  Since January 2019, Operation Cryptosweep has 85 pending or completed cases, 330 inquiries or investigations, and eight enforcement actions, including Zoptax and UNOcall.  Initial coin offerings have come into increased scrutiny following a 2017 breakout and subsequent 2018 collapse. Larger regulatory bodies like the CFTC and SEC have recently gone after ICOs as well.

42382462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roQf,1565201711,"Coinbase Must Face Negligence Suit Over Bitcoin Cash Listing, Judge Rules","Coinbase must face a negligence lawsuit from customers who bought bitcoin cash (BCH) following its allegedly botched listing on the exchange during the 2017 bull market, a judge has ruled.  U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabaria of the Northern District of California dismissed the plaintiffs' fraud and unfair competition claims against Coinbase, and the negligence claims brought by the ones who sold BCH. But he denied Coinbase's motions to move the case to arbitration and to dismiss the buyers' negligence claims, saying it is ""plausible"" that the company ""breached its duty to maintain a functional market.""  ""For starters, the fact that Coinbase halted trading within three minutes of the launch is indicative of dysfunction,"" Chhabria wrote in the ruling Tuesday.  The case was brought last year by Jeffrey Berk, a former Coinbase user, who accused the exchange of allowing insider trading on its GDAX trading platform from Dec. 19–21, 2017, because BCH prices spiked right before Coinbase announced trading options on Dec. 20. Berk, an Arizona resident, brought the case on behalf of other traders. Two earlier versions of his complaint were dismissed.  In dismissing the insider trading theory, Chhabria cited a lack of “causation” proved by the plaintiff’s price volatility arguments. (Last year, the exchange hired two law firms to investigate insider trading allegations; they reportedly found no wrongdoing.)  Standard of care  Nevertheless, Coinbase will need to prove it applied a standard of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to users.  Coinbase contested that it had a “duty” to strategize against market swings, citing a lack of responsibility to prevent the economic loss of others. The judge’s order replied, “the interpretation that the California Supreme Court would be most likely to adopt – is that Coinbase indeed had a duty to maintain a functional marketplace.”  Namely, because Coinbase “encouraged traders to enter the market,” by promoting the BCH launch, and held a “position of trust” when processing users’ transactions.  Because the sellers' motion was dismissed with prejudice, it cannot be amended. However, the discovery process will continue, and Chhabria left a door open for the sellers to re-file should new evidence to support their position turn up.

The Virtual Value Tax Fix Act, first legislators first proposed last Congressional session, has been reintroduced by North Carolina’s Rep. Ted Budd (R) on July 25. In what Budd calls a national security issue, the bill would effectively end the double taxation on cryptocurrency transactions by amending 1986’s Internal Revenue Code.  Under the 1986 Code, gains and losses in transactions of real property of like-kind remain unrecognized. As Rep. Budd stated before an introduction of the bill in June, the code places a 40 percent tax rate on transactions. Budd says tax concerns and transaction record-keeping act as a deterrent to adoption.  “The use of digital assets is already treated as a sale of the asset, even though the economic reality of the transaction is a purchase of a simple consumer good,” Budd said.  If passed, the act would free cryptocurrency transactions from double taxation and record-keeping immediately.  Budd’s newest bill adds to other cryptocurrency legislation before Congress. In early July, Rep. Tom Emmer (MN-R) reintroduced the “Safe Harbor for Tax Payers with Forked Assets Act of 2019.” Emmer says the bill will bring clarity on taxable events following cryptocurrency forks and airdrops.  Rep. Budd’s legislation joins fellow North Carolina Representative Patrick Henry’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin. ""I think there's no capacity to kill Bitcoin,"" Henry said speaking in preparation for Facebook’s Libra hearings prior to the U.S. House and Senate Committees,  “My point is: you can't kill Bitcoin,"" he said.

Srinivasan (@balajis) August 1, 2019      Balaji's backstory  Srinivasan led one of the best-funded early bitcoin companies, 21e6, which rebranded as 21 Inc and then again as Earn.com.  The original idea was to make home bitcoin miners for regular people. By March 2015, it had raised $116 million, but the idea met major headwinds as the realities of the bitcoin mining market became clearer. Later in 2015, 21 Inc was found looking for a way to pivot out of a straightforward mining hardware play.  Eventually, the company would take a major leap. In May 2017, it would open its bitcoin-powered email service to the public, allowing users to set up an account where correspondents would pay to get a reply in bitcoin. Later that year, it would change its name to Earn.com to better reflect the new mission.  Earn was then purchased by Coinbase in early 2018, a move many saw as an expensive acquisition of Srinivasan as much as it was an acquisition of the company itself. Nevertheless, Earn has evolved to take a prominent place in Coinbase's offerings, allowing assets listed by the exchange to make a bigger splash by allowing interested users to earn some crypto in exchange for going through educational modules about various tokens.  Srinivasan announced he was leaving Coinbase in May. An investigation by The Information found that Srinivasan's departure followed a tense year of internal debate inside the company. In short, now-former president and COO Asiff Hirji represented traditional finance aspirations; Srinivasan, in the CTO role, represented crypto's more rebellious ethos.  An old website  Now Srinivasan's next chapter may be Nakamoto.com.  While little is known of its future plans, the site's past is well documented. First registered in 1997, a quick scan of the Internet Archive shows the website belonged to a technologist who shares the last name of the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. (CoinDesk's requests for comment to the former owner were not returned.)  Records show  a transfer was made in July 2018, however. The information on the current owner is masked by a proxy, Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.  The new site is sparse, yet very crypto. It's not yet clear exactly what it's been repurposed to do.  CoinDesk will update this piece as more information becomes available.

42382470,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rodF,1565186432,The 'Vault' Is Back: Coder Revives Plan to Shield Bitcoin Wallets From Theft,"What if there were a mechanism that placed a time delay whenever someone spent bitcoin?  The idea has been around for a few years now, and for good reason, it's believed it could make it much harder for bad actors to steal funds from bitcoin users.  Basically, someone holding bitcoin primarily as a store of value could put it in cold storage, or hold it offline, with code that says it can be spent, but not immediately. The owner could set some pre-determined time delay on any attempt to move the coins. The fact that it has a built-in delay would give a true owner time to reverse a transaction if their private information had been compromised and someone tried to steal their crypto.  Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gün Sirer proposed this feature, known as ""vaults,"" as a way to better secure bitcoin in 2016, but their proposal required a fork of the protocol codebase. That fork never happened.  But on Wednesday, Bitcoin Core contributor and crypto consultant Bryan Bishop sent out a design to developers to accomplish the same thing using existing code.  In an email titled, ""Practical bitcoin vaults with theft-recovery/clawback mechanisms,"" Bishop writes:  ""Vaults are particularly interesting as a bitcoin cold storage security mechanism because they enable a publicly observable delay period during which time a user could be alerted by a ""watchtower"" that a thief might be in the process of stealing their coins.""  Kill switch key  Under Bishop's proposal, if an ""unlock period"" were initiated, an owner could choose to react or not react.  If the proper owner had initiated the transaction, he or she would do nothing because they actually did want to move the bitcoin to a less-secure ""hot"" wallet for use. But if it was a malicious transaction, the rightful owner could use another pre-determined transaction to force the bitcoin back into the cold wallet, under the same time delay.  In his email, Bishop writes:  ""The idea is to have a sequence of pre-generated pre-signed transactions that are generated in a certain way. The basic components are a vaulting transaction that locks coins into a vault, a delayed-spend transaction which is the only way to spend from a vault, and a re-vaulting transaction which can recover/clawback coins from the delayed-spend transaction.""  Bishop's proposal also has a number of options to address other scenarios, for more-sophisticated users.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The way I'm looking at this is there are a lot of people and a lot of exchanges that clearly cannot secure their keys. We've seen theft after theft. Having the ability to revoke or undo a transaction, even in this constrained environment, could be quite valuable.""  Indeed, this year has seen hacks at Bitpoint, Bitrue and Binance, among others.  ""I don't know if I'm willing to say it solves theft,"" Bishop added. ""That's a strong statement, but it's a very important tool in the toolbox.""  No fork required  Bishop said that his proposal would not require any kind of fork as the prior proposal did. It relies on existing time lock functions that are already built into bitcoin code.  That said, the software is not written yet. Before he makes this code available to the public, he needs to get feedback from fellow developers, write it and then test it thoroughly. So it will be a while before it's available.  During that give and take with fellow developers, questions about making security more complex are likely to be revisited. When the prior proposal came up in 2016, one developer noted that such a proposal gives a bitcoin user more pieces of data that they have to secure.  On the other hand, since the approach requires no changes at the protocol level, it will be entirely up to the user to take advantage of it or not.  And Bishop is aware that his strategy imposes new responsibilities on users. If it gets built, his concept will also need to be delivered, he said, with a certain amount of public education material, about protecting these new tools, security practices and so on.  Once it is ready, though, the developer said he will make it freely available to any bitcoin holder who wants to use it.  Bishop said he is likely to secure much of his own bitcoin this way, once the software is ready.

42382477,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rom3,1565182316,Binance Customer Data Has Leaked: What We Know and What We Don't,"Binance  , the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, said it's investigating the alleged leak of its customers' verification information. The leak could affect up to 60,000 individual users who sent KYC information to the company in 2018 and 2019.  This leak is said to be directly related to a hack that nabbed 7,000 bitcoin last May.  On Wednesday, a Telegram group created by an admin under the pseudonym ""Guardian M"" distributed hundreds of images of individuals holding their IDs and pieces of paper written with ""Binance, 02/24/18,"" alleging that the data presented was hacked from the exchange. The hacker supplied CoinDesk with hundreds of photographs and we have identified a number of users who recognize the photos of their faces and personal IDs that they sent into Binance for know-your-customer purposes.  The hacker told CoinDesk that he or she has at least 60,000 more and that he will release them over time. We have access to nearly 1,000.  Know-your-customer, or KYC, is a legal requirement by financial institutions to collect identifying information for all customers attempting to trade, withdraw and deposit.  In a response on Wednesday, Binance said the information circulated in the Telegram channel does not match data in Binance's own internal system, and as such said there's no evidence so far to show it's directly coming from the exchange itself.  ""These images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system,"" the company said. ""Our security team is hard at work pursuing all possible leads in an attempt to identify the source of these images, as it remains unclear where they were obtained.""  Binance added that the unidentified individual previously demanded 300 BTC from it for ""withholding 10,000 photos that bear similarity to Binance KYC data."" After Binance refused to continue the conversation, the individual started distributing the photos online and to media outlets.  In fact, since Monday this week, CoinDesk has already reached out to three people whose ID images, among hundreds of others, were first uploaded to a publicly available cloud drive and were later circulating in the Telegram group today.  Two individuals confirmed to CoinDesk the authenticity of the images and that they submitted such images to Binance.com on Feb. 24 2018.  One of the two individuals, who asked to remain anonymous, showed CoinDesk his Binance login history from January 2018 when he first registered the account, via email alerts he received every time he went onto the site.  The email alert history indicates he did log into Binance.com, on Feb. 24, 2018, around 5:00 UTC.  Further, this individual showed CoinDesk an ID image of his saved on his phone taken on Feb. 24 around 6:00 UTC, which appears identical to the one that's circulating inside the Telegram group.  The second individual told CoinDesk that he received an email from Binance's customer support on Feb. 24 as he was trying to make the size of his submitted image correct. He added the email was sent from an email address with a binance.zendesk.com domain. The exchange makes regular announcements on a site with such domain name.  A third user we contacted could have been a victim of identity theft. The photograph we analyzed contained a face similar to the victims but incorrect address information.  An error-level analysis of the photo suggests that the some of the image had been modified, especially the brighter edges in the photo above. ""Similar edges should have similar brightness in the ELA result,"" wrote the photo forensics site FotoForensics. ""All high-contrast edges should look similar to each other, and all low-contrast edges should look similar.

The exchange, MERJ, is licensed by the Indian Ocean nation's Financial Services Authority as a securities exchange, clearing agency and securities depository (CSD), and is launching the token to represent its own equity.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, MERJ said it will follow the listing by offering 16 percent of the tokenized shares in a public offering later in 2019. The exchange is also in discussion with ""several companies"" over potentially listing their tokenized shares on its platform.  Edmond Tuohy, CEO of MERJ, said:  “MERJ has fully leveraged its end-to-end ecosystem to deliver the world’s first publicly listed securities token. We are combining the best of the old world and the new to provide a key piece of missing infrastructure for the growth of digital assets.”  MERJ told CoinDesk it is using the ethereum blockchain to record the share register ownership, saying that, currently, ""it is the best supported protocol for these purposes.""  Now seen on MERJ's listings page, the tokenized security takes the ticker symbol ""MERJ-S"" and is currently trading at $2.42, with a stated market cap of $21,015,781.  More widely, MERJ also has plans to cut costs for investors and issuers by using blockchain technology to streamline a number of securities markets processes, including issuance, shareholder registers, compliance, distribution and voting.  ""The technology creates an access point to the capital markets, which is particularly suited to the 'mobile first' ecosystems in many emerging markets,"" the exchange said.  Founded in 2013, MERJ says that being licensed as an exchange, clearing house and CSD, it's well placed to ""deliver on the many benefits of tokenization.""  “Whether they’re issuing tokenized or traditional shares, companies are not going to want to go to a jurisdiction that doesn’t meet high international standards because it will attract greater scrutiny from global regulators,” said Tuohy.

Titled ""Understanding the crypto-asset phenomenon, its risks and measurement issues,"" the report reveals that the ECB has already built a system that uses ""high-quality"" aggregated data available online in its efforts to analyse ""the crypto-asset phenomenon"" to identify and monitor how the financial technology might affect monetary policy and the risks it potentially poses to market infrastructures, payments and financial stability.  However, using available data in this way has limits to its value. The report explains that this data leaves ""gaps and challenges,"" such as the exposure of financial institutions to crypto-assets and payment services that use layered protocols.  It lists, among others, derivatives and investment vehicles' exposure to digital assets, financial firms moving into custody and other services, and payments platforms using cryptos as potentially having implications for financial policy and stability.  While currently ""contained and/or manageable,"" such links with regulated financial firms ""may develop and increase over time.""  Going into more detail on these issues of collecting accurate data, the EU banking authority says:  ""Specifically, it is hard to retrieve public data on segments of the crypto-asset market that remain off the radar of public authorities; some relatively illiquid trading platforms may be affected by wash trading; and there is no consistency in the methodology and conventions used by institutionalised exchanges and commercial data providers. Moreover, new and unexpected data needs may well arise with further advancements in crypto-assets and related innovation.""  Going forward, the ECB plans to go into more granular detail for its analyses of crypto assets, and ""will continue to work on indicators and data by dealing with the complexity and growing challenges encountered in analysing on-chain and layered protocol transactions.""  It will further seek new data sources for information on links between crypto assets and regulated firms.  Regarding off-chain transactions – transactions conducted off the blockchain and later aggregated back on-chain in fewer transactions – the ECB said it will work on increasing the ""availability and transparency"" of reported data and the methods used to provide it, ""harmonising and enriching the metadata and developing best practices for indicators on crypto-assets.""

42382480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rooZ,1565175650,Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above Tough $12K Hurdle to Restart Price Rally,"View  Bitcoin's bull run from April lows near $4,100 seems to have stalled, with buyers repeatedly failing to keep gains above $12,000 in the last six weeks.  A high-volume weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to revive the bull market.  A bullish weekly close may remain elusive if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $11,200 in the next day or two. That could pave way for a drop to $10,500.      Bitcoin needs to break above stiff resistance at $12,000 to unleash the next phase of the bull market, which began from lows near $4,100 on April 1.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $11,527 on Bitstamp, having fallen back from a one-month high of $12,325 yesterday.  This isn't the first time BTC has failed to hold on to gains above $12,000. The cryptocurrency jumped to a high of $13,880 on June 26 only to fall back below $12,000 on the following day. Similar price action was seen in the following two weeks. Notably, prices rose to $13,200 on July 10, only to fall back below $10,000 the following day.  Currently, the bull market looks to have stalled, with $12,000 resistance acting as a ceiling to further gains, as seen below.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin broke into a bull market with a convincing move to $5,000 in April and rose to a high of $13,880 on June 26.  The cryptocurrency, however, did not find sustained acceptance above $12,000 in either the last week of June or the first two weeks of July.  The repeated failure to close above $12,000 indicates a weakening of bull momentum and has established the psychological level as the resistance to beat for the bulls.  So, a high-volume weekly close above $12,000 is needed to signal a continuation of the rally from April lows near $4,100 and open the doors to resistances at $15,000 and $17,235 (January 2018 high).  The odds of BTC closing this week (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 would drop if prices slip below key support at $11,200 in the next day or two.  Daily chart  BTC fell 2.8 percent yesterday, snapping its seven-day winning streak.  More importantly, the cryptocurrency failed to close above the upper edge of the falling channel on the daily chart and created a candle with a long upper shadow – another sign of buyer exhaustion above $12,000.  That candle would gain credence and the outlook would turn bearish if prices close below $11,200 (Tuesday's low).  3-day chart  A close above $12,060 today would confirm a bull flag breakout on the 3-day chart. A bull flag breakout is a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding rally.  If confirmed, a breakout would potentially open the doors to fresh record highs above $20,000 (target as per the measured move method).  That said, a weekly close above $12,000 would be a stronger confirmation of the revival of the bull market.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roWx,1565172034,Standard Chartered Completes First Transaction on Blockchain Trade Platform Voltron,"Standard Chartered Bank has announced the successful completion of its first international letter of credit (LC) transaction on the blockchain-based trade finance platform Voltron.  In an announcement Wednesday, the bank said it had conducted the pilot transaction for PTT Group, PTT International Trading Pte Ltd and IRPC Public Company Limited, which involved shipment of an oil product from Thailand to Singapore.  ""Standard Chartered was able to digitise and simplify the end to end exchange of information between all parties in the transaction on the Voltron platform, including the issuance, advising and negotiation of LC and presentation of documents,"" the bank said.  According to Samuel Mathew, global head of documentary trade product management at Standard Chartered:  “This pilot transaction marks the first of many that will follow from our participation with Voltron to digitise trade and enhance the client journey. As our clients increasingly look to technology to address the challenges of today’s global trade environment, we are extremely optimistic and excited about the potential opportunities that Voltron brings to the industry with its demonstrated benefits in improved speed and reduced risks of settlement, as well as its flexibility in connecting banks, businesses and other third-party providers in its network.”  Sending the documents electronically over the blockchain platform meant that all participants in the trade were able to view real-time data as the transaction progressed. This, Standard Chartered said, allowed a ""significant reduction"" in the time needed to complete the trade, which took less than 12 hours.  Oil companies often utilize letters of credit for short-term trade finance, but the process is largely manual and paper-based, taking up to five days for the documents to be delivered.  The use of blockchain also brings the oil industry participants of the Voltron platform greater transparency and cost efficiencies across the supply chain, the company added.  Voltron is an open-industry blockchain platform set up to ""digitally create, exchange, approve and issue Letters of Credits.""  Jordane Rollin, Standard Chartered's global head of digital transformation for trade product management added that as Voltron moves towards a commercial launch, ""we are continuously getting feedback from our clients via pilots to enhance Voltron with new features. We have also started to ramp up on our contribution to this initiative to expand its offering beyond Letters of Credit and become a new industry standard for digitised traditional trade.”  This week, the bank also completed its first joint supply chain financing transaction with Linklogis for Digital Guangdong – a joint venture between Tencent, China Unicom, China Telecom and China Mobile – aimed to bring digital government services to residents of China's Guangdong province.  Edit (08:48, July 8, 2019): Corrected earlier statements that said Voltron is an oil-focused platform. It is actually an open-industry trade platform. Also clarified that the transaction is Standard Chartered's first, not the overall first on Voltron.

42382464,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roUR,1565168509,South Korean Watchdog Plans Direct Supervision of Crypto Exchanges,"A South Korean financial watchdog under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is planning to more closely supervise cryptocurrency exchanges.  The agency in question, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), has said it will directly regulate crypto trading platforms, which currently are indirectly controlled via guidance given to banks, says a report in Business Korea on Wednesday.  For example, last year, the FSC amended the anti-money laundering rules applying to cryptocurrency exchanges, which was to be carried out by requiring domestic banks to tighten up monitoring of exchange-held accounts.  In today's report, Lee Tae-hoon, director of administration and planning at the FIU, was cited as saying Tuesday that the Korean government will set up a licensing system for crypto exchanges, as recently recommended in new international standards issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The move would boost the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, Lee said.  “If an amendment to the Act on Reporting and Use of Certain Financial Transaction Information, which reflects the FATF’s international standards for cryptocurrencies, passes the National Assembly, it will be possible to prevent money laundering through cryptocurrencies,” Lee explained at a public hearing on crypto transparency at the National Assembly.  Approval of the amendment would make regulations more effective ""by shifting from the current indirect regulation through commercial banks to direct regulation,” Lee added.  According to a Wednesday blog post from crypto compliance solution provider Argos, the amendment may also bring in the controversial ""travel rule,"" meaning that exchanges would have to share information on parties when making transactions. This would pose a major problem for exchanges as crypto transactions do not include identifying data, the post says.

42382497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roh1,1565164827,"Binance's CZ: Like It or Not, Facebook's Libra Coin Is Poised for Mass Adoption","The takeaway:  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) hopes to open a London office “very soon” as the crypto exchange turns its focus to Europe. Brexit won’t hurt and if anything will be good for crypto, he predicts.  On Facebook’s Libra project, CZ anticipates practical benefits from potentially listing the coin, and also hinted at further collaboration.  The forthcoming Binance.US is working with the usual suspects among crypto’s reliable banking partners.  CZ calls crypto insurance a “flawed concept.” Binance instead dedicates 10 percent of its $100 million in quarterly revenues to its internal ""SAFU fund.""      Binance, the world’s biggest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange, is embarking on a new European-focused strategy which will involve opening an office in London, according to CEO Changpeng Zhao.  The Malta-based company has been focused on Asia, but now plans are afoot to provide a deeper service within Europe, said Zhao, known throughout the crypto world as CZ.  In an interview that touched on everything from Facebook's Libra project to Binance's insurance strategy, the charismatic executive said the idea of a London office was given a further shot in the arm by “very positive” crypto regulations recently issued by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority.  CZ told CoinDesk:  “I hope we can open an office in London very soon. There is more regulatory certainty now which is good. I thought the U.K. regulation was very neutral and very positive; they were a little bit strict on the derivatives part which I hope they will be more flexible about.”  Binance is the latest blockchain company to make a commitment to the U.K. capital in the face of Britain’s imminent departure from the European Union, which some say will do long-lasting damage to the country’s economy.  During last week’s Binance meet-up in London, held at Canary Wharf’s Level 39 fintech accelerator, CZ said of Brexit: “I don’t think it will affect things here very much. The U.K. has a very old and very strong economy. And if anything, [Brexit] is likely to make people adopt crypto more, which is good for us.”  Indeed, by making foreign exchange harder, Brexit could theoretically enhance the appeal of borderless, frictionless value-transfer systems – and if the pound takes a beating, it conceivably could make some investors consider bitcoin as a store of value.  London calling  Ranked No. 1 in global 24-hour trade volume by CoinMarketCap, Binance has not by any means been slouching in Europe. The firm’s European headquarters in Malta has helped gather together a cluster of blockchain companies on the crypto-friendly island.  Meanwhile, Binance’s operation on the Isle of Jersey serves U.K. customers, allowing them to buy crypto with pounds and euros. However, CZ pointed out that “it still feels like the off-shore thing.”  Regarding the benefits of opening up in London, he added: “I think there's psychological stability factor; a psychological closeness factor in people's heads. It still matters a little bit.”  Asked if a London office might be on the cards by year-end, CZ said: “I can’t promise anything.”  Bear in mind CZ can be vague about the timing of events which are already well underway, such as Binance’s first U.S. exchange operation, soon to be launched in conjunction with San Francisco-based BAM Trading, and headed up by former Ripple executive Catherine Coley.  “I don't make a lot of centralized planning,” he said. “A lot of stuff I find out afterward. Binance's development is not like I plan everything, and we have a lot of different stuff going on at the same time.”  Binance on banking  The forthcoming Binance.US will offer fiat-to-crypto trading and so brings the company within the uneasy ambit of the highly regulated U.S. financial sector, since getting dollars to an exchange requires some sort of bank account.  Most banks are skittish about dealing with crypto companies, particularly in the U.S and Europe, leaving professional custodians of crypto to get banking where they can find it.  CZ pointed out that any exchange is a high-volume business which involves thousands of daily deposits and withdrawals. “Most banks don't like that, actually,” he said, “although you might have thought they would be happy on the fees, right?”  There’s a very short list of U.S. banks that are happy to work with crypto companies. They include San Francisco-based Silvergate Bank and New York’s Signature Bank.  Binance.US has not announced any banking partners, but asked if the new operation was likely to deviate from the usual suspects mentioned above, CZ said: “Not really, we are using the same guys. On the fiat side, we don't try to invent. We try to pick whatever is working.”  Libra liquidity  Binance has reportedly been in talks to get involved in Facebook’s Libra project, by listing the coin when it’s live or running a node on the blockchain. Speaking to CoinDesk, CZ said Binance has not officially joined and explained his interest first and foremost is listing coins with lots of users.  Assuming it actually launches, if Libra garners a large number of users, they will be able to trade it for other coins, and it then it could become “the de-facto denominator” said CZ, adding:  “As an exchange, we should stay neutral. So we don't really comment on coins; we don't like or dislike coins. We just provide liquidity. It's most likely Libra will get a large number of users, no matter how much people hate it.”  In addition to merely listing Libra’s native currency, CZ hinted there could be more in the way of actual participation further down the road.  “We are not against working together with them in deeper ways to promote collaborations,"" he said. ""As far as I know there are no concrete plans or agreements to do anything just yet. But we are not against it.”  His view on the regulatory bluster the project has created was that it clearly shows how much power and threat Libra poses; again taking a practical view, he added:  “Don't complain about adoption.”  SAFU  Like almost all other crypto exchanges, Binance insures itself against losses and hacks. The now iconic term ""SAFU"" refers to the firm’s Secure Asset Fund for Users, an emergency insurance fund.  There are outlying cases of course, where firms like Coinbase and BitGo have announced big figure forays into the ultra-conservative insurance markets. But on this topic CZ said:  “I think insurance for cryptocurrency is a flawed concept. The guys who claim to be working with Lloyd’s [of London], they can lose those relationships very quickly. Everybody in this industry that I know of is basically self-insuring.”  Big exchanges such as Kraken and Huobi are generally candid about their insurance provisions. CZ explained that Binance’s insurance fund receives 10 percent of the company’s $100 million in quarterly revenues.  “If a hack happens we will use that insurance fund first,” said CZ. “To be honest, if that’s not enough, we will put our profits out. So it's very simple.The trick is basically to not have a huge hack that you can't cover. You can suffer a number of small hacks, but you want to avoid a big one.”  In May, Binance suffered a hack which netted 7,000 bitcoin, worth about $40 million at that time. The hackers were patient and methodical using a number of techniques to eventually drain Binance’s BTC hot wallet, containing around 2 percent of Binance’s total bitcoin holdings.  CZ said losing the contents of the hot wallet was costly but luckily could be covered. He pointed out that most exchanges store the vast majority of funds in multiple and separate cold wallets, adding:  “I could talk for seven days about security measures you can do. But hopefully your cold wallets never get hacked all at the same time.”  CZ at Consensus: Singapore image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/07/binances-cz-like-it-or-not-facebooks-libra-coin-is-poised-for-mass-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87dd867064cd349246aa2f286092b52902152787-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roYD,1565150430,GitHub and Slack Bans Are Hurting Iranian Bitcoin Businesses,"Iranian bitcoiners are showing the world what censorship resistance really looks like.  Starting last weekend, Microsoft’s GitHub started identifying and banning Iranian accounts based on U.S. trade restrictions. As such, blockchain developers are hindered from participating in software projects that include private repositories or paid services for commercial ventures.  “The majority of serious crypto/blockchain projects that are being developed by companies around the world are hosted under the hood [in private repositories],” Behrad Khodayar, CTO of the Iranian blockchain startup Behkame and co-founder of a cryptocurrency exchange in stealth mode, told CoinDesk. “So, when it comes to developers from banned countries, this recent restriction by GitHub will have a major effect on their professional lives and whether they can join such world-class companies.”  Some of these restrictions are even mistakenly applied to Iranian expats who reside in Europe or North America. This was also the case with remote collaboration services like Slack, which started limiting Iranian developers’ ability to participate in global networks back in December 2018.  A GitHub spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “Certain GitHub services may be available for free individual and free organizational GitHub.com accounts in these countries or territories [but] for personal communications only, and not for commercial purposes.”  This restriction on some GitHub functionalities has already impacted crypto projects. For example, Khodayar said his team lost access to TradingView's code for drawing charts and technical indicators related to his team’s upcoming exchange.  “We also don't have access to new documentation created by [TradingView’s] team, so we try to work around the problem by directly reading the code and using a trial-and-error technique,” Khodayar said.  Khodayar previously used the peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins to buy and sell cryptocurrency. In May, that service started banning Iranians too. Sources in Tehran told CoinDesk some bitcoin traders still use the site by posting offers under other country’s pages, although they expect to completely lose access to the site any day. Still, Iranian sources tell CoinDesk that interest in bitcoin has grown, not faltered.  One such Iranian bitcoiner who asked to be identified only by his first name, Amirhossein, said he lost access to Slack months ago but hasn’t yet been flagged by GitHub. He uses the site to work on an Iranian bitcoin exchange, filling the gap left by LocalBitcoins, and to contribute bitcoin reward features to a video game, working as the gaming studio’s freelance developer. (He requested anonymity in order to protect these jobs.)  Speaking of political censorship for civilian use of public sites, Amirhossein told CoinDesk he’s not worried because he prepares in advance for such scenarios:  “I usually use nicknames and random handles so on occasions like this they can’t identify me. If [censorship] can happen, it will happen.”  Global lessons  Twitter is full of bitcoiners hypothesizing what would happen if governments restrict access to bitcoin and basic internet services. Iranians are facing these challenges today.  Several Iranian sources told CoinDesk they are still able to comment on and contribute to public Bitcoin Core projects on GitHub, however, since the restriction only impacts private repos and paid services.  Plus, Wladimir van der Laan, the lead maintainer of bitcoin's most widely used software, broadcasts bitcoin-related git repositories on a hidden Tor service so anyone can view them. Iranian developers are already showing how bitcoiners can participate in the global community despite censored access to some of the most popular portals for collaboration.  For starters, Khodayar said the recently secured regulatory approval for Iranian bitcoin mining enterprises could help boost access. This didn’t happen organically. Many members of the local bitcoin community engaged with regulators for months to achieve this, sources in Tehran told CoinDesk. Still, there is considerable work to be done with regards to lawful ways to use bitcoin for domestic payments, a use-case the Central Bank of Iran still appears inclined to forbid.  “We, developers in Iran who are interested in bitcoin, are doing our best to boost the adoption of this technology,” Amirhossein said.  Persian honeybadgers  Yet another Iranian developer, Jadi, who now has restricted access to GitHub pages related to feminist advocacy and Persian literary translations, told CoinDesk the recent series of bans highlights the trouble with relying on centralized systems.  “Even a welcoming, freedom-friendly community like GitHub might be forced to censor something,” Jadi told CoinDesk. “We won’t have this in a decentralized system.”  He added that regulatory pressures to restrict bitcoin usage have only made the Iranian public more interested in bitcoin for cross-border payments and also as a store of value. He said newcomers reason that if the government is spending so much time to regulate the fledgling bitcoin industry, then it must be valuable.  “The price of a miner in Iran is now twice the international price,” Jadi added. “Many people are still buying, even mining in their homes.”  Although relatively cheap access to electricity bolstered Iran’s bitcoin mining industry over the past few years, regulators are determining a new specialized price for bitcoin mining farms.  Meanwhile, there are several decentralized services that aim to offer platforms comparable to GitHub, from BlockStack’s DECS application to ConsenSys projects that allow for distributed pull requests, bounties and identity verification. But GitHub and Slack benefit from widespread network effects, which the new services lack.  Until any decentralized alternative provides censorship-resistant access to platforms with comparable social benefits, Jadi and Khodayar both said Iranians will still rely on a combination of VPN, Tor services and global networks of friends who post or send messages on their behalf.  Said Jadi:  “At the end of the day, this is the internet and packets will find their routes. So we will continue to contribute to and adopt new technologies.”  Iranian currency image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/08/07/github-and-slack-bans-are-hurting-iranian-bitcoin-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01379901d7538be3d514f19d700c9fbaaec3d750-1280x850.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This new team, based in Boulder, Colorado, will be focused on billing and reconciliation systems to provide transparency on trans-national financial data, says the job description, adding:  “This is an opportunity to define a technology architectural direction of a greenfield area for Amazon's advertising business using Blockchain technology.”  When asked for further details, a spokesperson for Amazon said the team ""doesn’t have anything to share at this time.""  It is not clear what kind of blockchain Amazon intends to use for advertising. Previously, the blockchain team at Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, built a proprietary blockchain known as the Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), and AWS' Managed Blockchain service connects with ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.  Follow the money  Amazon is joining a number of companies that have tried to use blockchain to simplify the opaque and convoluted value chain in adtech. The general idea is that a distributed ledger can get everyone on the same page about where advertising dollars are going and avoid discrepancies.  Just as a cryptocurrency blockchain shows which addresses sent or received money, how much, and when, an adtech ledger could track how much advertising is being placed and which middlemen are taking a cut, the thinking goes.  It remains to be seen whether Amazon will roll out its blockchain-based advertising reconciliation platform for wider industry use. However, the company has a track record of developing solutions internally which are then offered more broadly.  An example is AWS' QLDB, a centrally administered immutable data ledger now available in limited preview.  “We have a very long and healthy tradition of bringing forward internally developed projects at Amazon,"" Rahul Pathak, general manager of AWS Managed Blockchain, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 in May.

42382463,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roTB,1565140015,Kik Says SEC Lawsuit 'Twisted Facts' About Startup's $100 Million Token Sale,"The Takeaway:  Kik claims the SEC took executives' comments out of context in a suit alleging the startup's 2017 token sale violated securities laws.  In a new filing, Kik – which raised $100 million from the sale – also said it has been looking at cryptocurrency since 2012, and did not use it as a last-minute pivot, as the SEC alleged.  The Toronto-based company says Canadian regulators never made a final determination on whether the token was a security, contradicting their U.S. counterparts' claims.      Kik said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) manipulated facts and took comments out of context in the regulator's lawsuit against the startup over its 2017 token sale.  In a 130-page filing Wednesday, Kik laid out a paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal of the SEC's arguments and flatly denied its core allegation that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering.  CEO Ted Livingston told CoinDesk the SEC was ""playing dirty"" in its June complaint by trying to ""simply make [Kik] look bad,"" adding:  ""What really surprised us is just what lengths the SEC went to twist the facts. They cut quotes and [took them out of context] and that’s something we didn’t expect from the SEC.""  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Toronto-based Kik offered unregistered securities in the form of kin tokens to U.S. investors in an attempt to keep the messaging platform going when revenue failed to materialize.  Kik maintains that its public offering of kin was not a securities sale. In the response, Kik’s attorneys wrote that the SEC recognized its claim was weak and therefore created a ""highly selective and misleading"" picture of the circumstances of the sale.  The plaintiffs and defendants have met with a judge in the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York to work out a timeline for going to trial, Livingston said. Kik has asked for a May 2020 trial date, while the SEC has reportedly asked for a date later in the year.  “We wanted this to be resolved as fast as possible,” he said. The judge did not pick a trial date, but, apparently chose Kik’s timetable on discovery, which will conclude by November 2019. Livingston added:  ""We’re very confident in our case.""  Out of context  The SEC’s complaint included a number of quotes from Kik board members and executives purporting to show that the company needed to conduct a token sale as a potential securities offering.  The most seemingly damning comment was from an unidentified board member, who apparently referred to the token sale as a “hail Mary,” a term for acts of desperation. However, Kik says that while the board member did write this phrase in an email, its board and executive team did not see the project as ""a ... final attempt to save a dying company.""  Another board member, ""consistent with the Board and Executive Team's view at the time,"" went so far as to write:  ""The more I think about it, I think this is a great idea. People call it a hail Mary but to me that is a longshot and I really do not think it is a long shot.""  Livingston told CoinDesk that the quote came from a private email provided to the SEC as part of the discovery process.  In its complaint, the SEC also said a consultant warned Kik that ""the Kin offering was, potentially, an offering of securities that needed to be registered,"" but Kik’s response says that this, too, was taken out of context.  The consultant’s full remarks added that ""in the case of a community currency, there is a good basis to argue that this is not a security.""  A third example from the complaint indicated that Kik told its potential customers the company could ensure Kin’s success on its own, which would suggest that there was an expectation of profit from ""the efforts of others,"" one of the prongs of the so-called Howey test for determining whether something is a security.  Kik’s response says the next line emphasized that kin’s success would depend on ""how many other people can we get excited to compete with us, to join us, to work with us and to build this together.""  Two sales  Kik also emphasizes that it did not conduct a single sale for the Kin token, but rather two sales: a private SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) and a public token sale. The SEC conflated the two, undermining its case, the company said.  The SAFT was limited to accredited investors and conducted under an SEC Regulation D filing, meaning Kik believed it fell under certain exemptions to federal registration requirements. The second round was public and saw Kin tokens being sold for ether, according to the filing.  The company says it raised about $50 million in U.S. dollars during the pre-sale. Another $50 million was raised in ether from the general public, with 10,000 purchasers, roughly one-third of whom lived in the U.S., participating.  “The SEC seems to be grouping [the sales together],” Livingston said. ""I think what’s important in the response is to be very clear about what facts you agree with and what facts you disagree with.""  Elsewhere in the filing, Kik pushes back against the idea that the token sales were a last-ditch effort to generate revenue.  Kik acknowledged that it had hired an investment bank to look into potentially selling the company, but said it had already started looking into “pursuing a cryptocurrency project” before seven potential buyers declined to acquire or merge with it. Livingston had, according to the filing, been looking into a potential cryptocurrency project as far back as 2012.  Moreover, while the SEC complaint claims that the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) warned Kik that kin might be a securities offering, the response claims that, as far as Kik is aware, the Canadian regulator did not make a final determination.  The OSC told Kik that the Howey framework, which has been one way of assessing whether an asset is a security, might not be applicable to kin, which Kik, in turn, relayed to the SEC, according to the filing.  Broader impact  The SEC’s actions have taken some toll on Kik, Livingston said.  Among the “detrimental impacts” the lawsuit has had include the monetary cost ($6 million to date, according to Livingston), as well as the time Kik has spent compiling documents for discovery and testifying in Washington, which could instead be spent continuing to build the kin ecosystem.  Kik has provided the SEC with more than 50,000 emails and 200 hours of filmed testimony as part of discovery, he said.  Kin’s price has also suffered, with the token tanking the day the lawsuit was filed, falling from $0.000036 to $0.000025.  The cryptocurrency’s price has continued to decline in the months since, trading around $0.000017 as of press time.  Kik has long said that the outcome of its fight with the SEC – regardless of whether kin is deemed to be a security or not – will result in increased clarity over token sales and how securities laws might apply.  Livingston reiterated the hope to CoinDesk, concluding:  “I think this industry is less concerned about what the guidance is and more just that we have it.”    Kik Response to SEC by CoinDesk on Scribd    Kik CEO Ted Livingston, photo by Brady Dale for CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/07/kik-says-sec-lawsuit-twisted-facts-about-startups-100-million-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/013b1f1a8396248bcad385363c2819b8fb01528e-1500x1148.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Beginning 10:15 UTC and lasting until 22:15 UTC, BTC witnessed a large pullback, followed by a small bounce near $11,200, providing temporary support. Still, bitcoin's local daily high near $12,325 was the highest price point since July 10.  With a daily open on August 6 set at $11,800, BTC broke $12,000 at 06:45 UTC to cement a 24-hour high just under $12,300 at 10:15 UTC. From there, a 30-minute sell-off was induced, with its price falling to $11,671.  At the time of writing, BTC is currently changing hands at $11,471  The move down, however, failed to draw significant supporting volume with only 1.1 billion traded over a 24-hour period. This hints a deeper drawdown to levels near $11,200 could be possible.  Major names such as ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP (XRP) and EOS (EOS) also began to fall in value at around the same time as BTC, losing between 2-6 percent over 12 hours.
