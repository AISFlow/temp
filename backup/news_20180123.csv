As reported by local media including The Herald, Plymouth resident Ichim Bogdan Cezar was trying to buy a Bitmain AntMiner S9 at a cost of about $5,000. Yet rather than receiving his bitcoin mining hardware in the mail, he found a copy of the 2017 film The Boss Baby.  Cezar, who has reportedly since received a refund from Amazon, reached out to the hardware seller and ultimately Amazon customer support. And though he was eventually granted a refund, per a report from The Herald, that didn't come until January.  He told The Herald that the issue was both stressful and annoying, due to how much money he had spent on the miner.  ""Obviously it’s great that they will finally process a refund for me but it shouldn’t have taken that long, especially when there is such a big amount of money involved.""  Amazon finally refunded Cezar the full amount of the machine in late January, along with several other customers who reported similar occurrences.  Minifigures Direct Ltd’s page on Amazon  has multiple negative reviews noting the lack of Antminer deliveries, with several users complaining about receiving a Sharpie marker, Scotch tape or a pen instead of the machine customers ordered.

42400899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLNrG,1516743921,Payment Processor Stripe to End Support for Bitcoin,"Payment processor Stripe announced Tuesday that it will end support for bitcoin as a payment method in April.  Product manager Tom Karlo wrote in a blog post that Stripe would transition away from bitcoin over the next three months, fully ending support for the largest cryptocurrency on April 23, 2018.  Stripe first enabled bitcoin transactions in 2015, a move that came a year after first testing the technology. At the time, residents from more than 60 different countries could pay merchants on Stripe's network using bitcoin.  However, lengthy transaction times, an increasing transaction failure rate, and growing fees mean bitcoin is becoming less popular among Stripe's merchants and users, Karlo wrote.  He continued:  ""Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.""  While Stripe will no longer accept bitcoin payments, Stripe remains ""very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall,"" Karlo wrote, saying he believes support for other coins may be implemented at a future date.  The problematic fees were similarly cited by gaming services firm Steam, which announced in early December that it would stop offering support for bitcoin payments. At the time, a representative for the company said that the elevated fees ""cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically.""  In the Stripe post, Karlo left the door open to enabling payments in other cryptocurrencies, namely stellar lumens, the currency of the Stellar network.  ""We may add support for Stellar (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow,"" he wrote.

In remarks at a press conference for the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) on Tuesday, Valdis Dombrovskis, the Vice President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, said he plans to discuss the issue with a group of as-yet-to-be-named officials and representatives from the private sector. Dombrovskis was quoted as saying:  ""Cryptocurrencies may have ramifications for many other areas, including for central banks. That's why I intend to bring together key authorities and the private sector in a high level roundtable very shortly to assess the longer term situation beyond the current market trends.""  Several countries have or are conducting research on the idea of a central bank-issued digital currency, including central banks from U.K., India and Canada.  However, the potential involvement of central banks in cryptocurrencies has been received with mixed reactions. While some predict that central banks will buy cryptocurrencies to shore up their foreign reserves, others argue that the objectives of bankers and cryptocurrency buyers are too disparate for central banks to involve themselves beyond regulatory actions.  While it remains to be seen where such discussions would go, Dombrovskis' role in EU structural reform and financial market regulation signals that those talks could lead to further regulatory action.  During the presser, Dombrovskis reiterated the EU's interest in adopting blockchain technology, as well as its intention to take on a more aggressive regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies to curb ""unlawful behavior.""

42400907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLO07,1516734616,Virginia Lawmaker Calls for Crypto Impact Study,"A state senator in the U.S. state of Virginia has filed new legislation that would mandate an impact study on cryptocurrencies.  A new bill  introduced by Glen Sturtevant would launch a study, which, if approved, would seek to assess how the growth of cryptocurrencies and their use impacts everyday Virginians. The bill has been sent to the State Senate's Rules Committee for assessment, public records show.  At its heart, the measure queries whether lawmakers ""should establish a system to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth from any existing or potential adverse effects from engaging in transactions involving cryptocurrencies."" The study, according to Sturtevant's bill, would be the first step toward creating such a system.  As the bill's text explains:  “...if it determines that the establishment of such a system is appropriate, [the Commission will] identify legislation or regulations that would establish the system. The State Corporation Commission shall complete its study and shall report its findings to the members of the General Assembly by December 1, 2018.""  It's not entirely clear which rules or regulations Virginia might turn to should the study call for tighter controls. The State Corporation Commission is the body in Virginia responsible for approving and overseeing state-based money transmission businesses, indicating that it could ultimately move to modify or strengthen its statutes in that area.

The MFSA first sought feedback on its proposed rulebook last October as part of a bid to regulate professional investor funds (PIFs) that focus on cryptocurrencies. The proposal notably changed the structure from a standalone rulebook to a supplementary document for existing investor rules based on industry comments, according to the document.  The change came as a result of the ""ample feedback"" MFSA received requesting this change, according to the agency.  While the final set of rules has not yet been released, the MFSA did state that, based on industry feedback, it has updated its existing rules proposal to allow for investments in both cryptocurrencies and tokens released as part of an initial coin offering (ICO).  The agency also attempted to clear up when these investment funds would count as financial instruments – and when the funds may not qualify as such – writing:  ""Furthermore, in its Discussion Paper the Authority has proposed a Financial Instrument Test to determine under which circumstances a VC would be classified as a financial instrument, in accordance with the general principles of a policy statement issued by the European Securities and Market Authority (‘ESMA’).""  Despite feedback to the contrary, the MFSA has decided to only allow qualifying investors to invest in cryptocurrency-based funds, meaning only investors who meet specific minimum requirements, such as a net value of at least 750,000 euros, among other factors.

In announcing the results, the investment services firm said that it added $26.5 billion in new client assets, with net revenues of $1.3 billion during the period (driven primarily by assets, according to the post).  In statements, TD Ameritrade CEO Tim Hockey said that the company saw significant trading volumes during the quarter – an average of 726,000 per day – and that this state of affairs was driven in part by interest among investors in stocks tied to the nascent blockchain and cannabis services industries.  ""Trading was at record levels, and investor engagement has continued across all client segments as the market reached new highs. Enhanced consumer interest in blockchain and cannabis-related securities drove a further surge in engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, particularly among first-time investors,"" Hockey said.  The past few months have seen a range of companies purportedly shift their focus to blockchain – a move that has more often than not been followed by a rise in their public stock prices.  Yet whether this trend will continue remains to be seen. On Monday, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jay Clayton, revealed that the agency would look into whether companies announcing such moves are adhering to investor disclosure standards.  ""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering,"" Clayton said during an event in Washington, D.C. yesterday.

42400901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLNvC,1516721460,Goldman Sachs Report Warns Investors of Bitcoin 'Bubble',"Goldman Sachs has claimed that bitcoin is a bubble bigger than the dot-com era and the famous Dutch tulip mania.  In a research letter to investors, the banking firm's analysts warned about the increase in cryptocurrency values, highlighting the price moves in bitcoin and ether, as well as the stock price increases for companies which pivot to blockchain.  One example, The Crypto Company, saw its price jump more than 17,000 percent before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission halted trading, according to the report.  The mania is surprising, the authors say, because the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin, does not fulfill the role it set out for itself.  The report states:  ""We think the concept of a digital currency that leverages blockchain technology is viable given the benefits it could provide: ease of execution globally, lower transaction costs, reduction of corruption since all transactions could be traced, safety of ownership, and so on. But bitcoin does not provide any of these key advantages.""  A single bitcoin transaction can take up to 10 days to process, and the value of a single bitcoin varies depending on which exchange a user conducts their transaction through, according to the report. There was a greater than $4,000 difference in the price of a bitcoin between different exchanges at the same time late last year, it adds. This meant that one user could be paying 31 percent more for a bitcoin on one exchange than another.  High transaction costs are another issue, the report argues.  However, despite the inflation of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there is no risk that they will impact the U.S. or global economies, even in the event of a crash, according to the report.  While cryptocurrencies make up only a tiny fraction of U.S. and world GDPs (3.2 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively), the dot-com bubble was much more significant in the U.S. and globally (101 percent and 31 percent, respectively), according to the letter.  The authors add that they do not believe a collapse in bitcoin prices would have ""major contagion effects on the global economy or financial markets,"" concluding that ""we view the  unsteady cryptocurrencies as no match for the 'Steady as She Goes' dollar.""

On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, ether hit a one-week low of $905 at 11:50 UTC today. A sharp recovery from the last week's low of $757 ran out of steam at $1,164 over the weekend. The subsequent drop to sub-$1000 levels has left a lower high (bearish action) on the charts. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $930 levels on GDAX exchange.  ETH has depreciated by 8 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data from OnChainFX. Further, prices are down 20 percent from the weekend high of $1164. Still, the technical charts are now showing oversold conditions.  The price charts indicate that ether will mostly likely erase the 22 percent gains made since last week's low of $757 in a slow and steady manner over the next couple of days.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  ETH left a lower high at the key 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $1,166.71 over the weekend. The decline witnessed in the following 24 hours yielded a bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average (MA) and 100-day MA (short-term average cuts long-term average from above).  The rejection at 61.8 percent Fibonacci level indicates the corrective rally has ended and the bears have regained control.  50-day MA carries a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards), while the 100- and 200-day MAs are neutral.  The relative strength index (RSI) shows scope for further losses (being below 50.00) and well short of the oversold territory (below 30.00).  Ether chart  View  Ether looks set to close below $927.29 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July low to January high) and extend losses to $775 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the near-term. A violation there would expose trendline support of $752.  A close (as per UTC) below $752 may signal a longer-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

In a Jan. 22 blog post, the U.N. announced that it has helped launch a new group called the Climate Chain Coalition, which will aim to research the use cases for distributed ledger technology (DLT) in climate change-related initiatives, and potentially adopt them.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the U.N has been investigating since last May how to create transparent and efficient systems using blockchain that could be applied in situations such as, for example, monitoring carbon emissions, clean energy trading and fund allocation.  According to the blog post, the new coalition came about at a December 2017 meeting of 25 DLT-focused organizations, which agreed to establish the initiative based on the principles of Paris Climate Agreement.  The announcement states:  ""[The coalition] will cooperate to support the rapid advancement of DLT solutions to address climate change across mitigation and adaptation through enhanced climate actions, including but not limited to the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of the impact of all sorts of intervention, and the mobilization of climate finance from diversified sources.""  Now with 32 members signed up, the group is seeking participation from wide range of organizations that have technological expertise.  ""To fully and promptly mobilize this potential, broad collaboration among stakeholders is needed to direct resources to priority areas, avoid duplication of effort, and help avoid the pitfalls of working on a new technology with countless unknowns,"" said Massamba Thioye, who leads U.N.

42400880,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLWd,1516712453,Just Because It's Bad for Your Coin Doesn't Mean It's FUD,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk. The views expressed here are his own, so please don't blame his colleagues.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Did you hear the one about the crypto day trader who got struck by lightning? He'd read the weather forecast and heard the thunder, but scoffed and said ""It's all FUD.""  The term FUD (""fear, uncertainty and doubt"") refers to the spreading of false or misleading information by the foes of a movement or organization, with the aim of undermining confidence in a project. It's a close cousin to ""gaslighting"" and ""concern trolling."" And it is, as the kids say, a thing.  According to La Wik, the acronym dates back to the mid-70s and may have been coined by Gene Amdahl, a computer architect who quit IBM to start his own eponymous firm, only to have his former employer badmouth the new business.  ""FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products,"" Amdahl reportedly said. Not cool, Big Blue, not cool. (Yeah, I know, most of the people working at IBM now weren't born or were in diapers back then. But don't get any smart ideas.)  The term is popular in cryptocurrency circles, and for good reason. A lot of the critiques of bitcoin in the mainstream media over the years certainly smack of FUD. Setbacks such as a sharp price correction or a government writing burdensome regulations are often exaggerated as fatal blows.  Hey, pajama boy, it's a global, decentralized network. When the IRS issues a ruling that Americans have to pay capital gains taxes every time they buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin, that's a nuisance, a First World Problem – not ""the end for bitcoin."" The Venezuelans using bitcoin to survive aren't going to care.  I'd chalk it up to ignorance if these way-premature obituaries for bitcoin weren't so sneeringly gleeful in tone.  That said, setbacks do happen, and simply reporting incremental bad news or long-term challenges is not spreading FUD.  A fine line between paranoid and stupid  ""Thunderstorms expected today"" is the weatherman's way of helping us avoid getting drenched or electrocuted; it's not a fiendish plot to trick us into spending the rest of our lives indoors.  Yet if you read crypto Twitter, Reddit discussions or some of the comment threads on CoinDesk, you'll see there's a noisy contingent out there who view the world through a lens of bad faith and seldom bother to read an article past the headline.  You're reporting that the coin I invested in just dropped in price? FUD! You must be long a competing digital asset, and trying to tank the price of mine. That's the only possible explanation.  The government thinks crypto is being used by terrorists? FUD! Who cares what the government thinks? It's not like they have guns and can seize a business' servers or throw people in jail or anything. Oh, you're ""warning"" they could do something? Well, it's just obvious you think they should.  ""There's a car coming""? FUD! You just don't want me to cross to the other side of the road. That ""don't walk"" sign flashing red is FUD too. So are all those horns honking...  Eyes wide open  I will cop to being biased.  I've stuck my neck out many a time to argue that cryptocurrency is, all things considered, good for the world. I left one of the oldest publications in the U.S. after 17 years to join CoinDesk. And yes, I HODL a small amount of crypto, mainly bitcoin. I believe this space has a bright future.  But I also know there are going to be bumps along the way. Or, rather, New York-sized potholes, the kind that can wreck your front tire. Keeping a spare in the trunk is not falling for FUD, it's prudent risk management.  Volatility, scaling difficulties and hostile governments are all real. They can't destroy a truly decentralized network like bitcoin, but they can slow adoption, stymie innovation and make life miserable for individuals.  To simply note that these problems exist or that they are hard to solve does not imply they are insurmountable. And ignoring them won't make them go away. Ask an ostrich.  Bitcoin is often aptly compared to the red pill in ""The Matrix."" But it seems these days that a lot of people pinning their hopes on short-term price gains in their cryptocurrency of choice just want to take a new kind of blue pill. Good luck with that.

42400889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLfU,1516710011,Bear Grip Strengthens as Bitcoin Price Nears $10K,"Having closed below a key long-term moving average yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) prices look set to explore sub-$10,000 levels.  Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index fell to a low of $10,050.79 yesterday and dipped below $10,000 soon before publishing. At press time, BTC had bounced back to $10,150 levels. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 11.70 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX.  On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, BTC hit a five-day low of $10,025 yesterday. The sell-off gathered pace after prices breached strong support at $11,000 (confluence of 100-day moving average (MA) and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). Also, BTC closed (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA for the first time since July.  Looking ahead, the price chart analysis favors a break to further below $10,000 levels.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices per Coinbase) shows:  The decline from the weekend high of $13,000 has left another lower highs (bearish) pattern on the daily chart. Further, prices closed below 100-day MA. Both likely reinforcing the bears.  Prices closed (as per UTC) below $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $5,511.11 to $19,891.99), signaling potential for more losses ahead.  The 50-day MA has topped out (has shed bullish bias).  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards).  The bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and 100-day MA is likely to happen soon.  The accelerated trendline (drawn from Jul. 16 low and Sep. 15 low) is likely to offer support around $9,100 levels today.  It is worth noting that in 2017, dips to or below the 100-day MA were short-lived and followed by a sharp rally. For instance, prices closed (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA on Jul. 16 only to recover sharply on the following day. BTC then proceeded to set new record highs by mid-August.  However, things look different this time. To start with, BTC witnessed a sharp recovery from sub-100-day MA levels on Jan. 17, but the follow-through has been weak. BTC faced rejection at $13,000 (weekend high) and closed (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA yesterday. Clearly, the bears appear to be in control.  Also, as seen in the recent past (Jan, 22, Jan. 17, Jan. 16 and Dec. 22), dips below $10,391 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high) have been transient. Again, the level could be breached convincingly this time, courtesy of the bearish chart set up as listed above.  View  BTC looks set to test the rising trendline support of $9,100 over the next 48 hours. A violation there would expose $8,148.79 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high).  A corrective rally is likely to be capped around the $12,000 mark, as suggested by the downward sloping 5-day MA and 10-day MA.  Only a close (as per UTC) above $13,000 would abort the bearish outlook.

Announced during the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland yesterday, the alliance – which aid agency Mercy Corps and the U.N. International Computing Center have also just joined – aims to improve people's lives through provision of digital identities.  According to a press release, the group is developing solutions with a focus on user's direct ownership and control over their personal data using blockchain technology. At issue is the fact that over 1.1 billion people face not able to prove their identity, and thus struggle to access benefits and services. The situation also gives rise to more serious issues such as human trafficking, according to the World Bank.  The initiative has now received a $1 million donation from Microsoft, as well as contributions from entities including Accenture and the Rockefeller Foundation. Accenture, one of the founding member of the initiative, announced a $1 million investment during the ID2020 Alliance summit last summer at New York.  David Treat, MD of the global blockchain practice at Accenture said:  ""Decentralized, user-controlled digital identity holds the potential to unlock economic opportunity for refugees and others who are disadvantaged, while concurrently improving the lives of those simply trying to navigate cyberspace securely and privately.""  The release explained that digital identity that is user-owned would include government-issued forms of legal identification and allow a seamless authentication process for people and institutions.  ""We are building an ecosystem of partners committed to working across national and institutional borders to address this challenge at scale,"" Dakota Gruener, the Executive Director of the ID2020 Alliance, noted.  Last June, Microsoft and Accenture unveiled a blockchain prototype for ID2020, that is powered by a private version of the ethereum blockchain.

42400876,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLRi,1516703444,China's Banking Regulator Pushes Blockchain Adoption for Credit Market,"Blockchain technology should be adopted as part of a plan to boost development of China's secondary loan market, according to a paper by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).  Published on Jan. 19, the paper, drafted by a special committee, covers a variety of topics around developing and regulating financial technologies. In a section on the future development of China's credit market, it suggests the country should double down its adoption of blockchain technology.  The CBRC, a major financial regulator in China under the State Council, writes in the paper:  ""As the time goes on, blockchain technology will enhance the efficiency of sharing critical data such as balance sheets and foster a more liquid secondary loan market. Integrating this technology to our financial service platforms should be part of the future strategy.""  According to the paper, the new comments are the result of recent research and the committee's visit to counterparts in the U.K and France last year. As reported by CoinDesk, several European banks have already been taking part in initiatives that use a distributed ledger platform to issue syndicated loans.  The comments also come as another example of Chinese authorities taking different stances on cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology.  While speaking in favor of blockchain's potential in fostering the loan market, CBRC is also one of the seven Chinese state agencies that jointly issued the notable ban on initial coin offering activities in September of 2017.  Elsewhere in the paper, while airing concerns that regulatory moves in China still largely fall behind the development of emerging internet technologies, the CBRC considers blockchain's smart-contract feature as a possible solution for automating compliance reports.

42400883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLYb,1516698005,What's a Former CIA Lawyer Doing in Crypto?,"Russell Bruemmer is taking it upon himself to help token issuers construct compliant initial coin offerings (ICOs).  While that might sound challenging in a space where the regulatory framework has not been formalized, Bruemmer is as prepared as anyone could be in his new role advising blockchain startup Applied Philosophy Labs (APL).  A former top lawyer of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the former lead of the congressional affairs unit at the FBI, Bruemmer gained the relevant experience working for decades at for the law firm of WilmerHale, helping traditional companies structure their corporate governance.  In recent years, he said, he was approached by a number of blockchain entrepreneurs trying to figure out if the token they wanted to issue was a security or not.  As a result, by the time he retired from the firm in 2015, he had laid the foundation for his work advising startups more broadly.  ""[Bruemmer] seemed like exactly what I needed in the new venture,"" said APL founder David Levine.  In a climate where the Securities and Exchange Commission has been cracking down on crypto token fundraising schemes, Bruemmer knows he has his work cut out for him.  At APL specifically, he has helped the public benefit corporation draw up plans for a network of humanitarian companies that would sit underneath the parent entity and issue regulated cryptocurrency tokens.  To fund the humanitarian companies, he helped create a template to comply with the SEC's Reg CF and Reg A+. The hope is that, eventually, this compliant structure will define a path to public offerings via an S-1 filing and S-3 filing.  Bruemmer told CoinDesk:  ""We are using corporate and governance structures that will be familiar to, and thus comfortable for, our investors. This is another aspect of our intention to be transparent with our investors and regulators who have jurisdiction over our activities.""  And the first company that gets the treatment is solar power startup Indeco.  A power play  Indeco was one of the reasons Bruemmer was intrigued with APL in the first place, he told CoinDesk, since he already had an interest in how a compliant crypto token could incentivize the adoption of solar power.  And so the crew got started.  Speaking to Bruemmer's insight, Levine told CoinDesk:  ""Within a couple hours, we had mapped out the whole plan on how to build a regulatory compliant crypto.""  For Indeco's ICO, people can purchase an ethereum-based ERC-20 token pegged to a single watt of solar capacity. They are then being offered an ownership stake in assets installed with the funds, including solar panels, batteries and microgrids for decentralized energy distribution.  ""We've evolved from cryptocurrencies which are based solely on algorithms and trading values, etc. into something like Indeco, where the coin is actually going to equate to something that is more tangible,"" said Bruemmer, who now sits on Indeco's board.  Earlier this month the company completed a $100,000 presale, as part of a broader ICO governed by Reg A+ that could eventually see the firm raising $50 million.  ""If it works … you will expand the amount of solar energy being produced by bringing together groups of people who can invest small amounts, not huge amounts, and then aggregate those small amounts and build systems that can then sell energy either to a utility or to a customer,"" Bruemmer said.  Although APL was originally designed to house what are called ""series LLCs,"" each with its own token, due to tax considerations the final structure of the subsidiaries could end up shifting to C Corps, which can offer unlimited stocks.  Investor resistance  If all that structuring doesn't sound complicated enough, Indeco's backstory is equally, if not more, complex.  Prior to founding APL and Indeco, Levine founded Geostellar, a solar power startup like Indeco, except without the blockchain.  By 2016, Geostellar was generating $3.6 million in annual revenue and had raised $27 million in venture capital, but even still, Levine was having trouble keeping the company going.  To help put the company on more solid footing, Levine says he spent about $500,000 on legal fees, accounting fees and more last year, in an effort to raise $40 million in an ICO governed under Reg A+.  But the company's secured creditors pushed back, Levine said.  ""They could block us from doing almost anything,"" he said. ""And they were sending me cease-and-desist letters on the ICO, claiming they had to consent as our secured creditors.""  Levine was able to sidestep Geostellar's creditors' concerns by offering a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) on the equity crowdfunding site Republic (which recently began managing token sales).  As part of the crowdfunding campaign, the company offered to those investors cryptocurrency called ""zydeco,"" among other gifts including a ""shoutout"" on Facebook and a solar-powered happy hour.  Levine raised $325,000 during that promotion.  ""The secured creditors and investors were challenging my authority to even offer free tokens, and generally criticizing everything I did,"" Levine said, adding, ""Of course it turned out to be a huge success.""  Now Geostellar will be Indeco's first customer, Levine told CoinDesk. Which is one more client than most blockchain startups can boast.  Then again, a struggling company with the same founder is not exactly an ideal source of revenue. Bruemmer, who chairs the conflict and audit committees of APL's board of directors, would not comment on Geostellar's history of financial struggles.  But Levine said having the legal veteran on board will help Indeco navigate such complexities, telling CoinDesk:  ""Things were going to get weird, and we needed someone brilliant, unflappable, experienced and credible.""

42400874,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLQj,1516696240,South Korea Reveals Deadline for Anonymous Crypto Trading Halt,"South Korea's financial watchdog has set a deadline for the barring of anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts within the country.  According to a new announcement from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), starting from Jan. 30, cryptocurrency investors in South Korea will have to use real-name bank accounts in order to continue trading.  Once the rule comes into effect, investors can only deposit funds to trade cryptocurrencies if their name on the crypto exchange matches that on their bank account.  The move comes as part of the financial regulator's push through a strengthened ""know-your-customer"" (KYC) compliance to curb cryptocurrency speculation. The FSC said in the release that the new rule is resulted from an inspection of domestic anonymous crypto trading accounts – assisted by six domestic banks, as well as the Financial Intelligence Unit – from Jan. 8–16.  In addition, the official announcement also established an anti-money laundering guideline for cryptocurrency exchanges, which outlines situations where exchanges should stay alert to potential illegal activity.  The statement said:  ""Specifically, for users to make virtual currency transactions more than 10 million won per day or more than 20 million won for 7 days when depositing and withdrawing funds, this is the type of financial transaction you suspect for money laundering.""  The new rule also appears to have a wider affect on foreign nationals who had been using cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea through a virtual bank account. As the FSC's announcement pointed out, minors and non-citizens will be restricted from the new name verification service.  So far, three major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea have said they are in line with the new mandate.  In an email response to CoinDesk, a representative from Coinone confirmed that it will enforce the change starting from Jan. 30. ""Under the new requirement, six banks are preparing the real-name account linkage with exchanges. They are NongHyup, KookMin, Shinhan, KEBHana, IBK, and JB Bank. As for Coinone, our users have to be registered with NongHyup for the time being,"" the company said.  In addition, in its official blog post, Korbit also said on Jan. 19 that the existing fund deposit method will be terminated and replaced this month. It added that users ""must have a Shinhan Bank account registered under your legal name.""  According to a report from South Korean news agency Yonhap, the Bithumb exchange also said it will also enforce the new change as per the government's requirement.

42400879,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLLUf,1516684168,How to Save on Bitcoin's Soaring Fees,"Rising fees seem to be the only thing people talk about in the bitcoin world these days.  The crypto space is full of frustration and vitriol on the topic, as the average transaction fee has soared to $19, turning bitcoin's old claim to fame as a cheaper online payment method into a laughable assertion.  But despite these increasing costs, and the long-running debate they've caused, developers and users argue there are simple ways to decrease fees that aren't being fully taken advantage of.  This point was raised recently when new data came to light suggesting that one bitcoin startup, Coinbase, singlehandedly facilitates as many as half of all bitcoin transactions, based on the drop in overall network volume when the U.S.-based exchange went offline for a couple hours on Jan. 11.  The problem with that situation, according to critics, is the company could singlehandedly save users (not only its own but other companies' customers as well) a bundle on their transactions by implementing a couple technical features, namely Segregated Witness (SegWit).  And since the code change for SegWit was activated on bitcoin nearly six months ago, many are upset Coinbase hasn't yet implemented it.  Sergej Kotliar, the CEO of payment provider Bitrefill, called the new data a ""smoking gun"" in that it shows how much of bitcoin's limited transaction space Coinbase is using up. The pseudonymous blogger WhalePanda went so far as to blame bitcoin's transaction backlogs and high fees on the Silicon Valley startup's ""incompetence.""  Patience is running especially thin as it relates to Coinbase, since the startup was one of the more vocal during bitcoin's block size debate, complaining about high fees and arguing that an increase in the block size parameter would help alleviate those expenses.  Yet, critics argue, the company really shouldn't be complaining since it's not doing everything it can to push fees lower.  In response, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to stress that the company is working on rolling out technical features to reduce fees, but hinted that it's not easy. ""Thanks for bearing with us!"" he said. (Coinbase declined to comment for this story).  But should users not be interested in enduring the fees for transacting, there are several possible ways to reduce them today.  The fee halver  SegWit was lauded as the optimization that would help bitcoin scale without upping the block size during last year's scaling debates – yet only 12% of bitcoin transactions take advantage of the technology, even though SegWit transactions cost half as much as normal transactions.  Not all wallets currently have SegWit capability, but hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger support it and mobile wallets such as Edge (formerly Airbitz) and privacy-minded Samourai Wallet do as well.  But for users who don't want to go through the trouble of switching providers, SegWit capability is on its way at other companies too.  Coinbase and Blockchain.info are working on implementations, for example, but both have emphasized that SegWit is a new and complex change that they need to take their time with – they could lose user funds if a big enough mistake occurred.  Overall though, as the number of companies supporting the new feature grows, bitcoin fees will decrease – some even argue that transaction fees would disappear altogether if SegWit transactions replaced normal transactions.  But if fees aren't eliminated altogether, a more specific type of SegWit address is in the works, which could potentially save users more in the future.  Estimation game  But while users wait for mass SegWit adoption, they can reduce fees individually using fee estimators.  Although early bitcoin wallets didn't let users choose fees, this has changed, with many bitcoin wallets providing fee estimator tools to help users decide how much of a fee they should attach to their transaction to get it through the network in a timely manner.  In short, the higher the fee, the quicker the transaction will get added to a block, but on the other hand, users don't want to overpay. New fee estimator tools try to help users strike the right balance.  That said, some estimators are better than others.  Some users check with standalone tools that consider different factors, such as the estimator from University of Freiburg computer science researcher Jochen Hoenicke, which gives a good idea of what fee is required to get your transaction into the next block.  Another from Coinb.in considers transaction complexity – such as how much data is sent with the transaction. Fees also take this into account, meaning that even a transaction equal to $1 could have large fees based on a large amount of data attached to the transaction, whereas a transaction equal to $1,000 could have a smaller fee if the amount of data attached to it is limited.  Users have criticized some estimators as telling them to pay higher fees than necessary, but that's partly because fees are so difficult to predict. Fees can fluctuate for all sorts of reasons. The day of the week, for instance, can be a factor since people generally make fewer transactions on the weekend, meaning transaction backlogs would ease and fees wouldn't need to be so high during that time.  In this way, users who don't need to send money right away always have the option to wait for transaction backlogs to die down.  Beyond that, there are more roundabout ways to eliminate transaction fees completely, but these are highly dependent on what wallet or exchange provider is used.  For instance, it's possible to transfer bitcoin on Coinbase for free, using its off-chain way of transacting or by moving funds to the startup's cryptocurrency exchange, GDAX.  Longer-term tools  While the idea of batching a bunch of smaller transactions into one big transaction has been used in the traditional payments space for some time, it's becoming more popular for bitcoin businesses that facilitate payments.  If more companies use this feature effectively, bitcoin transaction fees could be reduced by as much as 80 percent, according to one estimate. However, it's worth mentioning that batching can erode privacy and is potentially slower, depending on how the company or user implements it.  Despite these tradeoffs, though, several companies, including Coinbase, have announced they intend to implement batching to tame fees.  In an effort to keep up with all the industry's progress on decreasing fees, Bitrefill's Kotliar launched a tool that allows users to see how optimized their bitcoin transactions are, displaying whether the transaction used batches, SegWit or a handful of other mechanisms shown to increase or decrease fees.  ""Just paste a transaction ID and see if you’re overpaying for your bitcoin transactions and withdrawals,"" Kotliar tweeted.  Plus, looking even further into the future, bitcoin developers are working on a handful of projects, such as the Lightning Network, that would be instrumental in reducing transaction fees, even as the number of people using the network continues to grow.  Summing up the work in the industry to reduce transaction fees in the short term, BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt tweeted:  ""There is a lot of throughput to be gained by making better use of the available capacity.""
