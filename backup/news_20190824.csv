42382567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBMH,1566663637,"In Berlin, A 'DAO Renaissance' Begins","“It feels like a DAO renaissance.”  That’s how Anastasia Andrianova, founder and CEO of blockchain-based financial protocol Akropolis, described her experience from both the Dappcon and ETHBerlin conferences this week.  Hosted as parallel conferences for three days at the Technical University of Berlin, roughly 800 ethereum developers from all over the world gathered to discuss, debate and demonstrate how to build on the world’s second most popular blockchain.  Decentralized autonomous organizations  , or DAOs, are infamously difficult to execute well. In 2016, roughly $60 million was stolen from an early DAO application, called The DAO, and the effects of this event seriously impacted ethereum's evolution.  This year, the main takeaway for attendees like Andrianova was the resurgence of interest in DAOs, and a slew of specialized tooling for making DAOs work.  The term “DAO,” as William Mougayar, venture capitalist and author of The Business Blockchain, told CoinDesk, is applied to all sorts of ethereum projects today.  “My observation [from the conferences] is that the term DAO is being used too loosely,” said Mougayar. “Some of these DAOs are really just smart contracts with some rules that say, 'If, then, that.'”  The distinction between big DAOs and little DAOs is important for conveying the complexity and degree of difficulty in a DAO application, Mougayar said.  At the most basic level, however, Jenna Zenk, former CTO of the blockchain startup Melonport who now sits as vice-chair of the DAO governing the Melon protocol, said:  “DAOs are a new way for people, groups, projects and companies to organize themselves in a decentralized fashion and also, very importantly, a transparent fashion.”  The timing to start building DAOs is now, said former Polychain partner Ryan Zurrer who himself announced a new DAO initiative earlier this month.  Zurrer was sure to stress that a lot has changed since 2016:  “There’s been a lot of lessons learned. This isn’t the return of the original DAO.""  Progress since The DAO  Since the original DAO, said Andrianova, Zenk and Zurrer, specialized tooling to help facilitate DAO creation on ethereum has advanced significantly.  For example, Andrianova highlighted the “rage quit” feature in the newly created MolochDAO as a key innovation to user sustainability within DAO structures.  The rage quit approach basically enables any participant in MolochDAO to “immediately disengage,” according to Adrianova, and withdraw funds without penalty.  “[MolochDAO’s] rage quit approach was so important,” said Andrianova. “Unless you can disengage in a given moment in time then you’re stuck on suboptimal terms, which leads to people creating factions inside the organization.”  For Zurrer, the cornerstone for his DAO initiative and DAO development more broadly has been the Aragon framework.  Aragon is an administrative platform whereby users can easily create and manage decentralized organizations built on ethereum. It provides modules to help DAOs fundraise, create bylaws, manage membership and voting rights, as well as a series of other actionable items to do with social governance.  “In our white paper, for example,"" said Zurrer, ""the [parent] pool at the top has the ability to cut off any mandates at any time should any of the ‘leagues’ be acting in a malicious fashion. This is enabled uniquely on Aragon.”  Calling this structure a “nested” DAO, Zurrer explained that granting various permissions on DAOs over and under other smaller DAOs was a key “cornerstone” to the security model of a complex big DAO.  Zurrer views Aragon Court, a decentralized dispute-resolution tool currently being developed by the Aragon One team, as an important enabler for increasingly functional and scalable DAOs.  DAO and DeFi  But it doesn’t stop there.  Zurrer noted that several decentralized financial (DeFi) applications on ethereum have also been key to enabling new functionality with DAOs, including portfolio management.  If a DAO is going to hold cryptocurrencies from participants and allocate this money to specific groups, it will likely need to leverage DeFi protocols such as the Kyber Network or Uniswap to exchange tokens and convert them into the desired asset.  What’s more, you could have DeFi applications that require governance from a DAO to execute.  Zenk said:  “There’s many interesting and creative ways to play around with [DeFi] and DAOs. For instance, a DAO can be the manager of a hedge fund. ... You could also have a DAO governing a DeFi protocol. That’s the case for Melon protocol today.”  It is this “composability” of differing applications, according to Zurrer, that makes building on the ethereum platform so interesting and attractive to developers.  “We look at the defining trends of 2019 and obviously one of them is DAOs,” said Zurrer. “But another one that is not discussed as much is this idea of compossibility. Maybe the great network effect that ethereum has established itself at this juncture in its trajectory is a threshold of tools that can be combined in order to make synergistic improvements on old ideas.”  Agreeing with Zurrer, Mougayar said:  “We need to see more of that. We need to see more of these [DAOs] talking to each other, connecting with each other. When the pieces are tied together, you see the magic. That’s when the magic happens.”  The entrance to Dappcon and ETHBerlin 2019, photo by Christine Kim for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | KNC,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/24/in-berlin-a-dao-renaissance-begins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0165a72cd53513c32281d84c0b7c358ee48d9811-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following a federal trial in a Florida court, the operators of the fraudulent investment schemes are ordered to pay restitution and have been barred from operating or participating in other such MLM schemes, according to a statement made by the FTC on August 22.  Under the corporate names Bitcoin Funding Team and My7Network, the fraudsters promoted their crypto investment schemes by misrepresenting potential earnings. They used social media, YouTube and conference calls to promote the scams.  In one instance, investors were promised $80,000 in monthly income from an initial investment of $100.  Thomas Dulca, Eric Pinkston, Louis Gatto and Scott Chandler sat at the top of a pyramid scheme. In order to stay in operation, investors were encouraged to recruit new participants. Though promised large rewards, most participants “failed to recoup their initial investment.”  In addition to his promotion of Bitcoin Funding Team, Chandler advertised for Jetcoin, “which promised participants a fixed rate of return, but failed to deliver on these claims,"" the FTC alleged.  Dulca and Pinkston are required to pay $453,932 and $461,035, respectively, though Pinkston’s, who is unable to pay the full amount, will be suspended upon payment of $29,491. Chandler is ordered to pay $31,000.  It is unconfirmed whether Gatto will pay a settlement for his involvement in the chain referral schemes.  In 2018, the FTC successfully petitioned the court to freeze the fraudster’s assets. The U.S. regulator also asked the court to order the defendants to stop working together or creating new business entities.  As part of the settlement, the men are barred from ever “operating, participating in, or assisting others in promoting or operating any multi-level marketing program, pyramid, Ponzi, or chain referral scheme.” They are also barred from misrepresenting investment opportunities.

42382578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sBYr,1566649802,Crypto Funds Are Outperforming – You Shouldn't Be Surprised,"Josh Gnaizda is the founder of Crypto Fund Research. The opinions expressed here are the author’s own. The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter for institutional investors focused on crypto assets. You can sign up here.      It’s one of the worst-kept secrets in the alternative investment industry: net of fees, hedge funds struggle to outperform broad equity markets.  In 2007, before bitcoin was even a glimmer in Satoshi Nakamoto’s eye, Warren Buffet famously bet a prominent fund of hedge fund manager $1 million that over the subsequent decade, an S&P 500 index fund would outperform any basket of hedge funds he could put together. Buffet won handily.  It’s not that Buffet didn’t think there were capable investment managers out there; Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway has often been described as a giant hedge fund. Instead, his confidence relied on his intuition that between fees and trading costs, even the best hedge fund managers would struggle to beat a low-cost index fund.  We might logically assume that crypto hedge funds, which generally have a 2 and 20 fee structure similar to that of their traditional counterparts, would suffer a similar fate.  But since the beginning of 2017, when reliable data became available, the result has been quite the opposite. An equal-weighted index of crypto funds significantly outperformed bitcoin and most other crypto assets.  The CFR Crypto Fund Index tracks more than 40 crypto funds, mostly hedge funds, across a variety of strategies. It shows that even as bitcoin climbed about 1,000 percent between January 2017 and June 2019, crypto funds gained more than 1,400 percent.  The outsized performance of crypto funds over this period might puzzle the Oracle of Omaha, a man who once described bitcoin as “rat poison squared.” Even without Buffet’s bias against crypto or hedge funds, there are a few reasons one might be surprised:  Performance fees are by nature punitive to returns during bullish periods  Creating a portfolio that can outperform skyrocketing single assets is no small feat  Crypto fund managers tend to be less experienced than their traditional counterparts  Despite these apparent headwinds, crypto funds did outperform. So let’s examine these perceptions a bit more.  Performance fees are too punitive in bull markets  Few investment assets have ever experienced a 12-month bull run like that of crypto assets in 2017.  That’s fantastic for fund managers taking home 20 percent of profits, but certainly eats away at returns. Several crypto funds returned more than 1,000 percent in 2017 – meaning by year-end a fund manager could have taken home more in fees than the fund had assets to start the year.  Still, most crypto funds have a 2 and 20 fee structure similar to traditional hedge funds and many have high water marks (essentially to ensure managers don’t get paid for performance when a fund is below all-time high).  So while crypto fund performance fees have been staggering in absolute terms, the fee structure is no more of a hindrance to crypto funds than to traditional hedge funds.  Diversified portfolios struggle to keep up with single assets  It’s hard to imagine any asset overshadowing bitcoin’s 12x performance in 2017. But that’s exactly what happened. Some other coins were up 100x or more. The Bitwise CCI 30 Index, which measures the performance of the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, was up 42x.  So how exactly did crypto funds outperform during 2017? They didn’t. Not even close.  Crypto funds collectively returned a relatively underwhelming 1,000 percent. Sure, these funds returned more in 2017 than traditional hedge funds have in the past 20 years. But everything is relative. And relative to top cryptocurrencies, crypto funds had a disappointing year.  The story of crypto funds’ outperformance truly began when crypto winter cast a chill over the entire industry in 2018. Philanthropist and investor Shelby Cullom Davis said: “You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don’t realize it at the time.”  It was one heck of a bear market.  In 2018, bitcoin lost nearly 75 percent of its value. The CCI 30 Index lost 85 percent. The CFR Crypto Fund Index, however, was down “only” 33 percent. Or put another way, while crypto funds preserved 4/6 of their value, the CCI 30 maintained less than 1/6 of its value. As the chart above shows, this ability to preserve capital during 2018 propelled the crypto fund index ahead of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  From Q1 2017 through Q2 2019, the CFR Crypto Fund Index has returned 1,430 percent. This easily bests bitcoin’s 1,022 percent return and narrowly surpasses the 1,413 percent of the CCI 30.  Crypto funds lack experience  After overcoming their fee structures and whipsawing crypto markets, crypto fund managers had a final hurdle to overcome: inexperience. It’s difficult to directly compare the total financial experience of managers across disciplines. However, we can look at the average age of funds.  A recent study published by Loyola Marymount University (LMU) found the median age of traditional hedge funds was 52 months. This is a lifetime in the crypto world. No crypto funds in the CFR index have been operational for 52 months and the median age is just 16 months.  This inexperience should hurt crypto fund returns, right? Not necessarily. Somewhat counterintuitively, the same LMU study found traditional hedge fund returns decrease with age. And not by a negligible margin. Hedge fund returns in year one were more than triple those in year five. After year five, the study found, “some funds become liquidated and the pattern is somewhat mixed.”  So inexperience, which would seem to be a significant headwind for crypto fund managers, may actually have been a tailwind propelling their performance past ahead of bitcoin and other benchmarks.  Reasons for caution  That crypto funds have outperformed various benchmarks is encouraging. But there’s also plenty of reason for institutions to remain cautious.  The index covers barely one market cycle. Buffet’s index fund didn’t take the lead over hedge funds until year four of the ten-year bet.  The index has less than 50 constituent funds. While the largest in the industry, it’s quite small compared to traditional hedge fund performance indices which can include thousands of funds.  There are potential biases. Since reporting is voluntary, and the index includes less than 20 percent of eligible funds, we can reasonably assume that poorly performing funds are less likely to report. Funds with particularly poor performance might have already closed, creating a potential survivorship bias. Though not unique to crypto fund indices, these biases shouldn’t be overlooked by investors.  Most crypto funds are quite small by traditional standards and it’s quite possible some strategies that perform well in illiquid markets will not support the same type of returns with more capital invested. Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund manages over $100 billion. Crypto funds manage less than $20 billion collectively.  Despite the potential issues, it’s encouraging that crypto hedge funds seem to have done more or less what they are supposed to, namely preserve capital in bear markets. And with the majority of crypto funds in the index now employing outside auditors, custodians and fund administrators, the industry is becoming less haphazard.  The crypto fund industry is still very much in a maturation phase, but with proper due diligence, crypto funds may present institutions, particularly those unwilling or unable to directly custody cryptoassets, an appealing way to get exposure to the sector.  Some decentralized architecture is said to have an “Oracle Problem”, but at least so far, crypto funds don’t seem to have an Oracle of Omaha problem.
