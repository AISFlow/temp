42380002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Lf1v,1509911408,MIT Media Lab Director: ICOs Are 'Attracting the Wrong People',"One of the people most responsible for the creation of a dedicated cryptocurrency research effort at a major U.S. university is speaking out against initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Addressing attendees on day two of the Scaling Bitcoin conference at Stanford University, Joi Ito, director of MIT's Media Lab, gave an impassioned talk about complex systems that sought to encourage thinking on the larger, societal impacts bitcoin could have, one that pushed back that these motivations should be purely economic.  Extending this criticism, Ito took aim at ICOs, or sales in which newly created cryptocurrencies are offered to buyers as a way to bootstrap open-source protocols, going so far as to state that those who engage in the practice are stealing money from an under-educated public.  Ito told the crowd:  ""The problem is we're creating a system where people can pump or dump and speculate. Anyone who has issued an ICO needs to sit down and meditate: are you making society better? Or are you making money unfairly?""  In contrast, Ito framed the ""whole point"" of cryptocurrency as being about using technology to prevent the societal ills he believes have resulted from economies defined by government-issued currencies and the financial institutions necessary for their use.  Ito framed the issues he sees in the sector as chronic – going so far as to draw comparisons to the dot-com bubble in terms of what the repercussions could be for cryptocurrency projects like bitcoin, whose community has largely frowned upon the practice.  ""I don't want to be involved in a company in an ICO, because we're in a period of history, it's attracting all the wrong people. Even if you were to execute a perfect ICO, I think it would still attract the wrong people,"" Ito said.  Still, he expressed his optimism the resulting fallout would force out bad actors, thereby allowing remaining bitcoin builders to better collaborate and build for the future.  In particular, Ito espoused the idea that cryptocurrencies should think more about their intent than their value, with one of his examples focusing positively on the insular economies of online role-playing games as an example of how restrictions can heighten an asset's worth.  ""Does making money make us happier? We have this really stupid one currency that causes us to be greedy and I think we want to think of ways to break that model,"" he continued.  Internet but bitcoin  Elsewhere, Ito discussed the history of the internet and the formation of its various protocols, as well as the conditions under which they were allowed to flourish.  Ito went on to frame large companies such as Cisco and AOL as ones that eventually developed by building on top of networks that were formed by communities that, in his view, weren't motivated by profit. However, at the same time, he was keen to point out that these networks developed substantial business value, eventually challenging even successful siloed business models.  Here, Ito compared San Francisco startup Coinbase to AOL and R3 to Minitel, drawing an example of how successful blockchain companies today have to provide a full stack of services that might one day be served by open networks.  Still, Ito framed bitcoin as perhaps the open blockchain network best positioned for success in eating away at these layers underneath, even as he called the market ""pre-TCP/IP"" in describing where he believes development is in relation to the internet.  Notably, his comments also gave a voice of support to the technical community around bitcoin, one that has often been attacked by businesses as short-sighted for its conservative design approach.  Ito said:  ""We haven't won the battle yet. [But] I think the thing that is interesting is that Bitcoin Core has substantially more brain fire power than any of the other networks.""

42380015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LfH1,1509901227,Hold the Fork: No 2x But Everything Else Goes at Scaling Bitcoin Event,"""Bitcoin is the currency of enemies.""  If adversarial thinking like Tadge Dryja's was on display, its target was relegated to theoretical targets on day one of Scaling Bitcoin Saturday. Held this year at Stanford University, the event's fourth edition, first started to bridge bitcoin's then-scaling crisis, saw noticeably less discussion of issues currently facing the open-source project's roadmap.  For example, despite its dominance in the media headlines, a scarce few panels addressed the concept of forks, or suggested at all that competing, bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies may be able to outpace bitcoin in terms of technology or user adoption.  Indeed the absence was noted by attendees, who framed the conversations as positive and optimistic on the future of the project as recent attempts at such efforts have largely failed.  ""To [developers], [a contentious fork] is not even a possibility,"" Wayne Vaughan, CEO of blockchain startup Tierion and conference attendee, said. ""Everyone is focused on what they're going to build on top of bitcoin.""  In fact, the most prominent reference to the controversial Segwit2x software, set to be introduced to the network in weeks, came from Bobby Lee, CEO of bitcoin startup BTCC and a proposal supporter, who told the audience he would not answer questions on the subject.  Rather, Lee focused his stage time on a crowd-pleasing talk heavy on typically safe subject matters – namely, bitcoin's advancement in the face of governments and the asset's rising price, both of which glossed over the widely differing views on the effort.  In this way, this year's edition of Scaling Bitcoin was perhaps distinguished by the lack of immediacy under which the talks were given – with the SegWit code change enacted in August, there appeared a silent consensus that short-term pressures have been relieved.  This indifference was present as the ways in which the more theoretical changes would or could be introduced to the network appeared secondary to results that simply hinted at the current state of science on the subject.  In one talk, John Hopkins University's Ian Miers presented BOLT, an anonymous payments channels design that aimed to speculate on how payments channels, or the top-level networks now possible with the introduction of SegWit's code, could have more discrete intermediaries.  Miers noted, however, that bitcoin's rules would need to change to accommodate the proposal, though he displayed a disdain for the more political specifics.  ""Whether this is a hard fork or soft fork, I've long since stopped paying attention to that discussion,"" he told the audience.  Private channels  As scheduled, payment channels were one of the more visible topics of the day, with three sessions focusing on how these proposed layers could become more private.  Leading off was Purdue University's Pedro Moreno-Sanchez, who gave an overview of current designs for the Lightning Network, the most mature version of payment channels for the bitcoin network, and one that while now possible faces implementation challenges.  Lightning Network payments by design only settle to the blockchain and therefore have a different proposed design structure than the network itself. And that's why researchers fear what might happen when the hub-and-spoke network is finally launched, with peers colluding to identify and defraud users who seek to engage in the new kinds of relationships afforded by the design.  ""It's not clear what this channel will look like. If all of the peers on the path collude, they can identify you. Even worse is you end up in this setting whether everything is centralized; you don't have to worry about collusion,"" Miers said explaining the current challenges.  He added:  ""The reality of the matter is that centralized Lightning might worse for bitcoin privacy-wise.""  To help deter these outcomes, Moreno-Sanchez and Miers' talks focused on zero-knowledge techniques, an older cryptographic concept that seeks to allow parties to verify information is accurate without exchanging sensitive data.  Moreno Sanchez's work, conducted with four other Purdue researchers, presented two implementations of payment channels based on a new type of smart contract, while Miers' was an iteration of work first introduced in 2016, now more relevant given that the Lightning Network is closer to launch.  Elsewhere, Lightning white paper author Tadge Dryja gave a talk on Discreet Log Contracts, work that hints at how so-called oracles, or third-party data providers, could operate within Lightning Networks, settling conditional payments between users such as might be wanted for insurance payments or casual betting.  All focused, however, on the exchange of information between parties, and the optimal conditions under which interactions would occur to maintain beneficial properties of bitcoin transactions conducted on the more transparent bitcoin blockchain.  On-chain on again  In contrast to past years, the event also proved open to the discussion of topics that may have proven taboo – a decision that appears to have led some conference organizers and former supporters to boycott the conference this year. (Notably not present were many developers from Bitcoin Core, the software's most widely used client).  For example, Peter Rizun and Andrew Stone, developers most known for their work on the alternative bitcoin software Bitcoin Unlimited presented research supportive of the idea that bitcoin could or should be reimagined to feature larger blocks to enable payments.  However, minus a terse question-and-answer session, Rizun and Stone's talk received a warmer welcome than it has in the past. In Milan, for instance, the developers went so far as to stage a local offshoot event to present their work.  And while the developers didn't step back from their assertion that the limitation of bitcoin's block size and transaction fees are negative, they did better fit their ideas to the format.  In this case, the developers presented data on the rate at which transactions can be accepted into bitcoin's mempool, in this way evolving their past work on block propagation, or how the network might pass larger blocks between peers.  Rizun and Stone's work appeared open-minded in light of past criticisms that have presented larger block proposals as ones that would perhaps weaken bitcoin's network of nodes, or the computer clients that store full copies of the bitcoin blockchain.  Rethinking attacks  Also of note was the inclusion of talks on bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus protocol, the aspect of the technology of most relevance to the cryptocurrency's mining industry.  However, here, too, the conference showed signs of past divisions, with relatively little participation from miners this year, including only one – BTCC – that plays a decision-making role in whether the protocol upgrades its software.  Elsewhere, Min Chen, CTO at bitcoin mining chip manufacturer Canaan, continued the company's more recent positive public relations push with a talk that positioned the company as open-minded to alternatives to proof-of-work, notably given the anger in the technical community over the actions of miners in the past.  Chen's talk came off as well-intentioned if light on specifics about how the company would push the network toward this goal.  Still, it's perhaps best to consider the talks as a showcase of a different perspective, as Chen pushed back on the idea that miners should be always thought of as attackers, as opposed to network participants that provide a useful resource.  For example, Chen discussed how blockchain protocols have often sought to limit the abilities of miners, rather than thinking about how they could assist in problems facing the network.  ""Protocols should be quantum-friendly not quantum resistant. If quantum computer can bring 1,000 times efficiency to your system it will reduce average costs,"" Chen said, at least appealing to the idea that in the nascent field of crypto-economics, the role of incentives is paramount.  She concluded:  ""It is important to make being a contributor more economic than being an attacker.""

42379994,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Let7,1509863428,Vatican Address to Highlight Bitcoin Use in Slave Trade,"The Vatican is soon to host an address on how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used in the modern-day slave trade.  To be held today at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences (PASS) in the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, the talk by Bank of Montreal senior manager Joseph Mari is to provide an overview of the role cryptocurrencies play in money laundering, while highlighting the potential of blockchain to help the unbanked.  The second of a three-day long event, itself part of an even larger effort led by Pope Francis to eradicate slavery entirely by 2020, the address is expected to be given to an audience including the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and other senior church leaders.  Since the Pope was named the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013, he has made slavery a top priority of the church, helping inspire the recent PASS efforts, according to an internal document provided to CoinDesk.  In addition to today’s address on blockchain, the group has held other workshops, seminars and plenary meetings culminating in the organization's ""core"" recommendation to resettle slaves where they are found, if they so choose, rather than repatriate them.  Speaking in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Mari detailed the purpose of his particular address, and the potential bigger picture role it could play in fighting against what the International Labour Organization estimates is a $150 billion forced labor industry.  Mari said of the audience:  ""Blockchain and cryptocurrency needs to be on their radar, it needs to be recognized as something that is current, is being utilized and the quicker the learning curve is surmounted, the quicker we can start working towards the risks that are presented.""  Mass education  The day's proceedings are scheduled to kick off with the celebration of mass by H.E. Msgr. Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who is also the bishop of Argentina and chancellor of PASS.  Following chancellor Sorondo's blessing at Casina Pio IV in Vatican City, Mari is scheduled to present the most recent results of Project Protect, founded two years ago to teach AML officers how to identify patterns in their own transactions that might be evidence of human trafficking.  Specifically, Mari plans to frame early results of Project Protect that identified an increase in the use of cryptocurrencies by slave traders in Canada and other regions in light of the broader concerns being addressed at the event.  Having early on identified an increased use of cryptocurrency by slave traders , the project — which Mari calls a ""zero-cost initiative"" designed to bring new efficiencies to existing AML procedures — has worked with blockchain data startup Chainalysis and other financial institutions to create new methods to identify patterns in cryptocurrency transactions that might indicate a slave has been purchased, or is being advertised.  By focusing on that work, projects elsewhere that use blockchain to bring new levels of transparency to the shipping of goods and to provide individuals at risk of becoming slaves a self-sovereign means to identify themselves, Mari aims to present to the church leaders a nuanced depiction of the technology's role in human trafficking.  ""For everyone in the room at that time in the Vatican, I’m just really stressing from an AML standpoint that this is something that has been going on for the better part of ten years,"" he said. ""And its uses are diversifying across the board, in terms of both positive and negative.""  Church and bank  Expanding on Mari’s mission to jumpstart the education process of the church leaders was event co-organizer and founder of the Global Alliance for Legal Aid (GALA), Jami Hubbard Solli, who added to the objectives her hope to win the support of the Vatican in recruiting banks in the fight against human trafficking.  Originally conceived as a separate event hosted by GALA to draw attention to the slave trade between Nigeria and Italy, Solli first contacted the Vatican through the president of the Pontifical Academy, Margaret Archer, whom she invited to participate as a speaker.  Instead, Solli said she was invited by Archer, to co-organize today’s joint event, formally called ""Assisting Victims of Human Trafficking: Best Practices in Legal Aid, Compensation and Resettlement.""  Through a diverse set of public-private partnerships scheduled to be discussed at the event, Solli believes existing anti-money laundering measures can be upgraded to more adequately account for the rapidly growing impact of cryptocurrencies on human trafficking.  ""We really need partnerships between banks and prosecutors,"" she said. ""As well as between financial institutions and civil society.""  As a result of Mari’s address on blockchain and other addresses at the gathering, further Vatican recommendations are expected to be forthcoming, according to Solli.
