42401562,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01UK,1526667611,Zcash Leaves Crypto Market Behind with 50 Percent Weekly Spike,"The cryptocurrency markets are flashing red as the third week of May comes to close.  The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has dropped by 14.48 percent to $366 billion in the last 7 days, taking the month-to-date losses close to 30 percent, according to CoinMarketcap.  Further, the probability that the cryptocurrency market will regain poise next week looks low, given that the bear grip around bitcoin seems to have strengthened, according to technical charts. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value fell below one-month lows under $8,000 today, showing losses of 3.6 percent on a weekly basis.  Other larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) and EOS are reporting at least a 14 percent decline, while ethereum's ether (ETH) has largely remained flat-lined on a weekly basis, while Ripple (XRP) has depreciated by 1.96 percent.  Amid the broad-based losses, however, lesser-known cryptocurrencies like zcash (ZEC), binance coin (BNB) and lisk (LSK) have managed to put on a good show and are ranking higher on the list of gainers among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  Weekly top gainers  Zcash  Weekly performance: +49.95 percent  All-time high: $953  Closing price on May 11: $238.83  Current market price: $358.12  Rank as per market capitalization: 20  Zcash (ZEC) picked up a bid earlier this week after Gemini Trust Co. which was founded by the Winklevoss twins, announced support for trading the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Notably, daily trading volume has jumped by 285 percent on a week-on-week basis, so the rally looks sustainable.  Daily chart  ZEC's rebound from the triangle support (former resistance) has reinforced the bull case and adds credence to the ascending (bullish) 10-day moving average (MA). Further, the 50-day MA has turned bullish (sloping upwards).  ZEC could find acceptance above the 200-day MA lined up at $360 next week. On the downside, only a close below the 10-day MA would abort the bullish view.  Binance Coin  Weekly performance: +15.93 percent  All-time high: $22.48  Closing price on May 11: $12.99  Current market price: $15.06  Rank as per market capitalization: 18  Binance coin (BNB) spent a better part of this week trading sideways before rising to a four-month high of $16.39 on Binance exchange Friday.  Daily chart  Stepping back a little, the relative strength index (RSI) had fallen below strong support at 49.00 on May 10, signaling a bearish breakdown. Accordingly, BNB prices followed suit and fell below the 50-day moving average on May 15, suggesting that the trendline support could be breached in a convincing manner,  However, BNB defended the trendline support earlier today and rallied to four-month highs. That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $16.00 (April 25 high) would confirm a bullish breakout and would open the doors to $20.00. Meanwhile, acceptance below the ascending trendline would indicate a short-term bearish reversal.  Lisk  Weekly performance: +3.88 percent  All-time high: $39.31  Closing price on May 11: $10.05  Current market price: $10.44  Rank as per market capitalization: 24  Lisk (LSK) is reporting a 3.8 percent week-on-week gain. While the CCID Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ranked LSK third on its global public chain technology index this week, the news failed to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency.  Daily chart  The above chart shows, LSK is struggling to scale the 50-day MA hurdle (currently located a $10.78) in a convincing manner. Further, the 10-day MA has crossed the 50-day MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover. As a result, the bulls have an uphill task ahead.

For the project, announced Thursday, Santander partnered with global fintech firm Broadridge and custodian banks JPMorgan and Northern Trust, describing it in a press release as the ""first practical use of blockchain"" for shareholder voting.  However, it should be noted that other entities such as Nasdaq, the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange and a group of central securities depositories, including Russia's National Settlement Depository, have all conducted pilots, are developing systems or have launched platforms around the use case.  The Broadridge-built solution – piloted previously in April of last year – aims to improve transparency in the global proxy voting system, while also increasing security, efficiency, security and analytics, the release says.  The pilot was concluded on March 23 for the Spanish banking giant's AGM and saw participation from Santander’s blockchain lab and Corporate Services, which acted as the issuer’s agent. The blockchain solution was used to produce a ""shadow"" digital register of the proxy voting system taking place in parallel using the conventional voting model.  Sergio Gamez, global head of shareholders and investor relations at Santander, said that, for a listed company like Santander, the AGM is one of the most important corporate governance events.  Gamez explained:  ""It is very important to ensure the participation by investors and shareholders, and this year using blockchain technology for the institutional vote has been a great help in terms of transparency and agility across the vote life cycle.""  As mentioned above, Broadridge executed a similar pilot focused on proxy voting in collaboration with the same partners last April. The project used a private version of the ethereum blockchain as a backup system to more traditional voting software. The trial was conducted at an annual meeting at Santander Investments.  ""The successful completion of a second pilot along with the next phase of our blockchain-based proxy voting solution demonstrates Broadridge’s continued commitment to developing innovative technology solutions in the re-imagination and improvement of global proxy,"" said Patricia Rosch, president of investor communications at Broadridge.

42401561,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01TL,1526649642,Bitcoin Hits One-Month Low As $10K Sell-Off Resumes,"Bitcoin's (BTC) drop to one-month lows below $8,000 has strengthened the bear grip on the markets, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency fell to $7,925 on Bitfinex earlier today - the lowest level since April 18 and has retraced 50 percent of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 to May 5 high of $9,990.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,120, representing a 2 percent drop in the last 24 hours. The recovery from the low of $7,925 could be associated with the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly chart.  However, the gains will likely be short-lived as the odds are stacked against the bulls, according to technical charts.  Daily chart  BTC closed well below the 50-day moving average (MA) yesterday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990. Further, BTC has also found acceptance below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement), a level which acted as a strong support since May 12.  The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).  And last but not the least, BTC's turn lower from $8,884 (May 14 high) and drop below $8,100 yesterday have established a lower highs and lows pattern (bearish setup).  So, it is quite clear that the drop to one-month lows in the last 24 hours has the put bears in the driver's seat.  View  BTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action.

42401543,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01Bd,1526630446,The Use Cases and Applications for Involving Women in Blockchain,"“Satoshi is female!”  That’s how New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney rallied the crowd on May 13 at the ""Women on the Block"" event in Brooklyn, New York, where more than 300 people came together to talk about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The event comes at time of tension within the crypto community, as blockchain stars like Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark are urging interviewers to stop asking what it’s like to be a woman in crypto.  “Stop marginalizing and write about the awesome work that women are doing,” Stark tweeted in February.  But to the ladies at the event, it's less about creating a divide and more about a welcome reprieve from the perennial challenge of being treated like a crypto unicorn, when they just want to discuss use cases and applications.  True to that, many of the day's discussions focused on the business opportunities within the space, from using the technology to shine a light on the opaque real estate industry to utilizing blockchain for supply chain management within the food sector.  Nonetheless, the fact is that women are still underrepresented in positions of privilege and power across the board – and the blockchain industry is no exception.  Based on findings from an international Quartz survey of 378 venture-backed crypto and blockchain companies founded between January 2012 and January 2018, roughly 8.5 percent had a woman on the founding team, compared to 17.7 percent in the broader tech industry.  And according to many women at the event, this lack of gender parity could hold the nascent industry back significantly.  “Women have a better understanding and different priorities with this technology,” European Parliament member Eva Kaili from Greece told the crowd, adding:  “We believe, with these tools, you can have a strong influence on the future.”  A true need  Sure enough, women at the event, including German entrepreneur Masha McConaghy, co-founder of both BigchainDB and the Ocean Protocol, told CoinDesk that women could benefit from blockchain technology, perhaps, even more than men.  That's because women still deal with issues surrounding financial access and empowerment – women make up the majority of the world's poor, according to the World Bank – and a pseudonymous and censorship-resistant system could provide a solution.  For instance, in Saudi Arabia, women are still legally barred from receiving a business loan or license until two men testify of her behalf. And according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, at least 94 percent of women who experienced domestic abuse were also victims of economic abuse, where the abuser controlled her access to income or financial services.  McConaghy told CoinDesk, “We still don’t have it [freedom] yet, but we are moving towards it.”  Echoing that, Nigerian engineer Ese Mentie, who works with ConsenSys on the blockchain identity project uPort, told CoinDesk:  “There are still women whose husbands and fathers are controlling and they can’t access their own money.”  For her, inclusive corporate practices are the key to building effective blockchain solutions that take these different problems women deal with into account.  “If there is diversity, those conversations will happen,” she said.  And that could happen sooner than some expect. Kaili celebrated the fact that women are rising into leadership roles very quickly within the space, not just in terms of entrepreneurship, but also as it relates to legal research, diplomacy and open-source projects.  That makes sense, she continued, considering the cryptocurrency boom is popularizing conversations women have been having for years about financial access and control.  Focus on education  For many women at the event – who on Mother's Day brought mothers, daughters and sisters – the key to getting more women in the space is education.  Education programs and data-sharing initiatives, like Women Who Code, were hot topics. And it was even proposed that the Women on the Block events should go on the road.  Speaking to this on a panel about investing in blockchain technology, Liz Rabban, vice president of business development at Celsius Network, a decentralized lending platform, said:  “The concept of decentralization and empowerment can only exist if we have education.”  And these statements about education generally garnered more applause than even Maloney's opening statement about Satoshi [Nakamoto], the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that originally spurred all this excitement.  Still, Kaili was quick to note that the blockchain industry will only “duplicate the problems we already have” if leaders don’t prioritize gender parity.  But in knowing the struggles that women in the industry, and even more broadly, face, the tone of the day wasn't discouraged. As a matter of fact, many of the women joked about the current perks of being a minority in the space – including the fact that there's hardly ever a line for the women's restroom.

42401547,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01FZ,1526605225,Tea Tokenizers Arrested in China for Alleged $47 Million Crypto Fraud,"Another cryptocurrency project has been busted by law enforcement in China for allegedly soliciting money from investors with fraudulent claims.  According to Guangdong Daily, a provincial government organ in China, police in Shenzhen arrested six individuals Monday who allegedly defrauded 3,000 Chinese investors out of $47 million by selling a cryptocurrency they claimed was backed by a commodity.  The six suspects formed a firm based in Shenzhen called PEB, which beginning in January 2017 issued a blockchain-powered token dubbed Pu'er Coin, according to the report.  The project's website says buyers of the token are entitled to hold a contract representing ownership of a certain amount of the Pu'er Tibetan tea the firm has in stock, which it claims to be worth billions of dollars.  While the token can be subsequently exchanged in a secondary market called Jubi.com, another website claims the contract can also bring a 12 percent annual return if investors choose to lock their funds for 12 months.  According to the police investigation, though the firm had only a ""very limited amount of the tea in stock,"" it promised high short-term returns to investors in social media promotions and roadshows at high-end hotels.  The police said the project succeeded in attracting a significant number of investors by manipulating the secondary market with its own funds to drive up the token price twentyfold over the course of 2017.  In fact, this week's crackdown may not be entirely surprising as the firm had received a warning and a fine late last month from China's State Administration for Market Regulation, whose mandate is to ensure fair and just market competition.  The authority fined the firm $20 million for disseminating false claims in an advertisement that touted its supposedly large stockpiles of the Tibetan tea to back the token.  The arrest marks another notable crackdown on alleged cryptocurrency fraud in China as law enforcement in the country have beefed up efforts to battle illegal fundraising.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, police from Xi'An have arrested the founders of an alleged nationwide cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that is said to have amassed $13 million from over 13,000 people.
