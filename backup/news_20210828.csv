Several factors have pushed the crypto market into a new rally, but most seem to gravitate around ETH and its ecosystem. After the implementation of EIP-1559, Ethereum&apos;s native token became a deflationary asset due to the change in its fee mechanism. To validate transactions on the network a portion of ETH is &apos;burn&apos;, meaning send to an address that no one can access. As a consequence, ETH has been gaining traction as a store of value asset, for some experts, even more, efficient than Bitcoin. Researcher Lucas Outumuro has recorded a dropped in ETH&apos;s daily issuance, lower than Bitcoin&apos;s for the first time since its inception. As the chart below shows, ETH net inflation stands at 3574 ETH (1.11% annualized), and BTC net inflation stands at 900 BTC (1.75% annualized), Outumuro claimed. The decline in ETH&apos;s daily issuance is attributed to the increase in on-chain activity. The research tracked this down to the surge in the non-fungible token (NFT) related activity. By 2021, NFTs have become a new mania in the crypto industry with a seemingly high level of adoption from the mainstream. A couple of days ago, payment giant VISA announced an NFT purchase from the popular collection CryptoPunks.

42424602,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2vahh,1630164616,Frothy NFT Market Remains ‘Healthy’ as Developers Hold ETH or Reinvest: Nansen,"As the non-fungible token (NFT) market continues to boil and new projects seem to sell out hourly, a report published this week from on-chain analytics firm Nansen sheds some light on the number of active NFT developers shipping projects on Ethereum – and, perhaps more importantly, what they’re doing with the ether they earn from “drops.”  The research might help to calm jitters concerning an impending bursting bubble. Most market observers agree the NFT segment has grown unsustainably frothy, and one worry among collectors is that many NFT drops are effectively leeching liquidity from the market as developers cash out.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Nansen analyst Ling Young Loon said that he set out to gauge the sustainability of the market – and that the results were surprising.  “I wanted to see if the NFT economy is self-sustaining. If you have a lot of money leaking out to CEXs or DEXs, it’s not very healthy. You want the money circulating in the NFT community,” he said.  7 drops a day, 7 days a week  Loon’s analysis focused on the 645 NFT projects that have been released since June – a remarkable average of over seven drops a day for the past three months. These drops have taken in roughly 84,000 ETH, or over $271 million.  While over a quarter billion dollars in under 90 days may initially seem like a staggering number, Loon notes that the majority of drops are relatively modest – the median NFT project rakes in 10.2 ETH, or $33,000.  “The main point that was surprising was that there were so many smaller ERC-721 that launch as a fun side project, but then don’t go anywhere,” he said.  He credits the relatively low barriers to entry as one reason behind the number of projects.  “I’d argue the technical requirement to launch these projects is much less than launching a farm or something, so I think there’s lots of people trying to make a little money.”  Reinvestment  Perhaps the most eye-popping data point in Loon’s research, however, is that the majority of successful drops are likely either holding their ETH proceeds or reinvesting them in other NFTs.  Looking at drops that brought in 20 ETH or more, Loon found that 52% of developers transferred funds to new wallets but kept the proceeds as ETH and 18% of developers used their proceeds to buy other NFTs.  The data may be somewhat messy in that Loon could not track if the developer ETH wallets were only spending ETH derived from sales, but “we can assume, however, that the percentage spending on each type of entity should be a representative measure of how they chose to spend their income,” he wrote.  The largest single entity receiving funds from developer addresses is NFT marketplace OpenSea at 22%, and the second is centralized exchange Binance at 14%. Only 24% of proceeds go to either centralized or decentralized exchanges, a sign of those funds potentially being “cashed out.”  Ultimately, Loon believes this data points to overall health in the NFT market.  “I think even though there is value outflow, what this chart doesn’t show is the amount of value inflow. For that you have to look at the number of daily active addresses on OpenSea, the daily active buyers, and that’s been on an uptrend, and that might be enough to offset the outflows.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | BNB,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/28/frothy-nft-market-remains-healthy-as-developers-hold-eth-or-reinvest-nansen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adcd8d1eb2604f638cdd88f450a90ddf2a3a9918-1300x831.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

They are often used for trading card games, video games, and collectibles. Essentially, they are the cryptocurrency equivalent of baseball cards. As we all know, NFTs are becoming more and more mainstream. The idea of owning a digital asset that cannot be destroyed or counterfeited is very appealing to people who value their privacy and security. Visa has just helped propel the mainstreaming of NFTs by buying a CryptoPunk - an early NFT series - for $165,000. The Context: One Purchase of Many While Visa spent 50 ETH on a Cryptopunk, this is just one NFT purchase of thousands, amounting to sales in the billions of dollars this year alone. Visa&apos;s purchase was part of a much larger trend this year where companies began buying into non-fungible tokens as a way to better understand and analyze new asset classes that were previously unavailable to them. Large firms and retail investors alike have all shown interest in purchasing non-fungible assets as a means of gaining insights into new market opportunities that are not currently reflected in traditional financial data sets or indices. This is reflected in the fact that NFT sales have surged from just a few million last year to several billion dollars this year.

Many altcoin projects are currently growing exponentially as they are exploring largely untouched use cases. As the tech continues to proliferate and expand, more and more &apos;problems&apos; are arising that require solutions. This obviously provides more space for viable contenders to occupy in a crowded market. This provides a robust growth argument for many altcoins, but there is a catch. The giant growth gains are fantastic, but we also must consider that large corporate banks do not tend to react positively to any challenges to their dominance of the financial industry. The Federal Reserve and other federal government bodies certainly have an eye open to the chaos as well. Ripple (XRP) is a prime example of this, as the project has been experiencing ongoing back-and-forth dialogue with the SEC for some time now, all while still sitting in the top 10 of token market caps. The Altcoin Evolution: The Lay Of The Land At this point, it&apos;s rather difficult to predict the trajectory of these contingencies. Regulation is always a few steps behind, but it is a certainty.
