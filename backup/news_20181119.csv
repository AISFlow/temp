42402228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3heQ,1542666175,"A Historically Strong Month for Crypto, November Is Off to a Brutal Start","The price of bitcoin, the world’s largest and most valuable cryptocurrency, now starts with the number four after falling to fresh 2018 lows on Monday.  Indeed, its price fell below $5,000 for the first time since October 2017 and its current price – hovering above $4,800 at time of writing – reflects a roughly 40 percent loss year-over-year. It's notable that this state of affairs came to fruition during what has historically proven to be a bullish month for bitcoin.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the month of November has concluded with a monthly gain for BTC seven times since pricing data was first collected in 2010, but its current monthly performance of -24 percent is heavily stacking the odds in favor of this November proving to be an exception to the 8-year trend.  BTC's recent plummet tells only half the story of a much larger cryptocurrency market sell-off, although its plunge below $6,200 on Nov. 14 was likely the spark to the powder keg that was the broader market.  From Nov. 14 to today, the cryptocurrency market has shed $50 billion and a whopping 23 percent from its total capitalization to where it stands now at $162 billion – a far cry from its all-time high north of $820 billion set this past January, according to CoinMarketCap.  What perhaps best depicts the extent of the market rout is the performance of the world's 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past seven days.  (BitcoinCash (BCH) was not included due to hard fork experienced on Nov. 15)  As can be seen in the above graph, all ten cryptocurrencies are reporting negative price developments against the US dollar while eight of the 10 are reporting seven-day losses above 24 percent.  XRP is notably outperforming BTC and the broader market, down only 5 percent in that last seven days, and just 2.3 percent today – and yet is up over 20 percent against BTC in the past seven days.  In the past 24 hours, the world's 10th largest cryptocurrency, monero (XMR), is the worst performer of the top 10, down over 17 percent in that span while Metaverse ETP (ETP) is the worst performer out of the top 100, down over 37 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  It's worth noting that significant drops like the one experienced today and for much of 2018 are not new to the cryptocurrency market. In 2013, the price of BTC rose to an all-time high of $1163 only to fall below $160 less than a year later. Also at that time, litecoin (LTC), the world's seventh largest cryptocurrency today, fell from $50 to just above $1.  Now-famously, they rose to the north of $19,000 and $320, respectively, only to quickly return much of the gains over the course of this past year.  Traders and investors alike are now likely waiting for the market to bottom out in what's known as capitulation, whereby market participants surrender completely and forfeit demand. At such a point in time when a bottom is formed, fear in the market is at its absolute peak, accompanied by falling sell volume that is slowly outpaced by rising buy volume.  Although its now certainly painful for market participants, it remains to be seen if a bottom will be reached any time soon.

The IBM Blockchain Accelerator and Columbia Blockchain Launch Accelerator, announced Monday, will support 10 startups each, according to a press release. The two are part of the Columbia-IBM Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency, a collaboration between the groups launched this past summer to incubate blockchain applications.  IBM Blockchain Accelerator managing director David Post believes that the collaboration with the Ivy League institution will help the company supplement early-stage companies with the required technologies and social networks to grow their businesses.  ""The possibilities presented by blockchain technology are seemingly endless, and we are seeing strong dedication by technical talent to build game-changing applications,"" he added in a statement.  The IBM accelerator will be looking for companies significantly further along in terms of product development, specifically for companies ""focused on building out an enterprise business network and client base for their blockchain application.""  In contrast, the Columbia Blockchain Launch Accelerator will be accepting applications from ""pre-seed"" or ""idea stage"" companies, which will receive support and training on how to build a blockchain startup. However the companies are required to have an affiliation with Columbia or a other recognized New York City-based University.  Both of the programs are scheduled to last about eight weeks on-site in New York City, though the later-stage companies will split their time between New York and San Francisco.

The challenges of regulating the use of cryptocurrencies demand a multinational response,"" he added, declaring:  ""We must work together to make clear that the rule of law can reach the entire blockchain.""  In particular, he called on attendees to develop policies regulating cryptocurrencies and ensuring they cannot be ""abused by criminals, terrorist financiers or sanctions evaders.""  The U.S. already regulates cryptocurrencies within its anti-money laundering laws, as one example.  ""And the Financial Action Task Force urges all nations to make clear that global anti-money laundering standards apply to virtual currency products and service providers. We must guard against abuses of digital currency,"" he said.  This is not the first time Rosenstein's addressed cryptocurrencies. Speaking at a conference this past February, he noted that the U.S. Department of Justice was working on ""a comprehensive strategy"" to oversee cryptocurrency-related crimes.

42402251,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hrD,1542643210,US Election Commission Says Crypto Mining For Political Campaigns Is 'Permissible',"The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) has released a new draft opinion that clears the way for people to mine cryptocurrencies as a way to support their preferred candidates.  In a memorandum dated Nov. 13, attorneys with the FEC responded to a proposal submitted in September by OsiaNetwork LLC, which at the time asked if individuals would be able to provide their computers' processing power to mine cryptocurrencies.  Funds raised through this method would be used to support political committees, though OsiaNetwork sought to designate such activities as a form of volunteering – something the FEC isn't signing off on at this time.  According to the letter, the FEC has concluded that while the proposal ""is permissible"" under both the campaign act and its own regulations, ""it does not fall within the volunteer internet activities exception, and would result in contributions from both the individuals and the OsiaNetwork to the participating political committees.""  In other words, while OsiaNetwork can set up a mining pool, any donations made to political campaigns with those proceeds would count as a contribution both from the miners participating as well as the startup itself.  The ruling – though preliminary – represents mixed bag for the startup: in its original request, OsiaNetwork stated in particular that ""the term 'contribution' does not include the value of services provided without compensation"" by volunteers.  As the advisory opinion explains, the Federal Election Campaign Act requires a communication element for contributions conducted online to be defined as a proper ""internet activity.""  It goes on to state:  ""Because participation in OsiaNetwork’s cryptocurrency mining pool does not constitute an 'internet activity' as defined in the regulation due to the lack of a communicative element, the use of an individual's computer and internet access to participate in the mining pool would not fall within the exemption regardless of the fact that computers and means of internet access are included in the definition of 'equipment and services.'""  Moreover, because the mining pool would be operated through OsiaNetwork, the fundraising activities would in effect be similar to if a political committee raised funds through volunteers by way of a third-party vendor. In other words, the vendor (in this case OsiaNetwork) would be contributing alongside the miners.  The opinion went on to note that any contributions OsiaNetwork makes to a political campaign in excess of what individuals contributed through providing computing power should be treated as donations through a partnership under existing law.  The FEC's commissioners will vote on the opinion on Dec. 19, 2018.  Legal counsel for OsiaNetwork LLC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company – which operates the Hong Kong-based exchange of the same name, currently third largest globally by adjusted trading volume – announced the news on its website on Nov. 16, saying it was ""necessary to implement"" Communist Party principles and policies into private companies.  The move, which is reportedly a first for the Chinese cryptocurrency and blockchain space, is also aimed to garner party support for the firm in its domestic businesses, it said.  Huobi founder and CEO Li Lin called the new committee ""a milestone"" for his firm at a launch ceremony that saw 50 staff in attendance.  After China's regulators cracked down on crypto trading last autumn, domestic exchanges were forced to move to more friendly jurisdictions. While Huobi's exchange business is now based in Singapore, it still has blockchain consulting and research operations on the Chinese mainland.  The Communist Party requires firms with at least three party members to set up such committees, although it is standard for public entities to do so, according to local sources. In recent years, however, making the more formal tie to the ruling party has become more common at private enterprises.  And while Chinese authorities have clamped down on many crypto activities, including token sales, they are actively promoting the adoption of blockchain technology. Indeed, the Communist Party moved to make blockchain literacy the norm across public offices with the publication of an explainer for officials and members in August.

According to a Bloomberg report Monday, the decision by OKEx resulted in significant losses for some investors, including Qiao Changhe, founder of a firm called Consensus Technologies, who said his fund was down $700,000 because the exchange closed the contracts at a level that did not reflect market prices at the time.  As a result, he suggested he is likely to reduce the $5 million fund's utilization of the exchange.  “OKEx is losing its credibility. The futures contract became something nonsense, not something we could use to hedge,” Changhe was quoted as saying.  Four other unnamed traders also reportedly said that they would reduce their exposure to OKEx or even stop dealing with the exchange entirely. One of the four has complained to the country’s financial watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, Bloomberg says.  On Nov. 14, the day before the hard fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain, OKEx posted an announcement on its blog, giving short notice that all BCH futures would stop trading “at 9:05am and be delivered at 10:00am Nov 14, 2018 CET (UTC +1) due to the upcoming hard fork. We will provide a detailed explanation shortly.”  In an announcement later the same day, it said it had opted to use the last traded prices as the delivery prices since there was no trading pair with bitcoin cash with ""enough market depth and trading volume to compose an index for delivery.""  Calling the pre-fork situation an ""extremely special case,"" OKEx continued:  ""It has come to our concern that an early announcement may make room for market manipulation and cause loss to our users. Therefore, we decided to give a short notice in order to maintain the fairness and stability of the market.""  It also explained why it had chosen a delivery time one hour after the halt of trading, saying that to have both at the same time could have caused a flood of ask orders that ""could have crushed the BCH spot market and caused huge volatility.""  This is not the first time OKEx has made such a decision. Back in August, OKEx froze one of its users’ account and initiated a forced liquidation after the client made an “enormous” long position of 4,168,515 bitcoin futures contracts and declined the exchange’s request to lower the position.

42402225,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ffR,1542625218,Bitcoin Price Hits 13-Month Low as Crypto Market Slumps,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its lowest level since October 2017 on Monday, amid a broader period declines for the world's top cryptocurrencies.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $5,165 earlier today – the lowest level since Oct. 18, 2017 – having breached the crucial support of $6,000 last week.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,283 – down 5 percent on a 24-hour basis and 16 percent week-on-week – according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Further, the year-on-year loss now stands at 32 percent, as prices were trading well above $7,600 on Nov. 19, 2017.  Elsewhere, ethereum's ETH token, cardano and Tron are also flashing double-digit losses on a 24- hour basis. Notably, ETH fell to $155 earlier today, the lowest level since July 16, 2017, as per CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, XRP, the second-largest cryptocurrency as per market capitalization, is reporting a 6.5 percent drop. Only nine out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are trading in the green and three out of the nine are stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies.  The sharp losses in the major cryptocurrencies have pushed the total market capitalization down to a 13-month low of $172 billion. In the last five days, the total value has dropped by more than $30 billion.  The risk aversion could worsen in the near-term, as bitcoin is looking increasingly weak on the technical charts.  Weekly chart        As seen above, BTC closed last week (UTC) at $5,560, confirming a downside break of the nine-month-long descending channel – a bearish continuation pattern.  The cryptocurrency also closed below the 100-week exponential moving average (EMA), which had been acting as support since June. More importantly, both 50- and 100-week EMAs have shed bullish bias.  The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) of 37.00 is signaling scope for a deeper sell-off.  Therefore, BTC risks falling below the psychological support $5,000 in the near term. Major support below that level is seen around $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the RSI of 15 is indicating that the sell-off is overdone. Hence, a sustained break below the psychological support of $5,000 looks unlikely in the short-term.  4-hour chart  The RSI on the 4-hour chart is creating a higher low, despite the lower low on the price chart, marking the development of a bullish divergence. The divergence would be confirmed if the RSI continues to post higher lows and the 4-hour candle closes in the green. That would open the doors to a corrective rally.  View  The bearish weekly close has likely set the tone for a drop below $5,000. In the short-run, however, BTC may defend that psychological support level, courtesy of the oversold conditions on the daily chart.  A minor corrective rally to $5,800 may be in the offing, but that could reinvigorate the bears and bring a sustained drop towards the long-term rising trendline support, currently seen at $4,100.  A move above the former support-turned-resistance of $6,000 would invalidate the bearish setup.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Kraken said in a blog post on Sunday that, while it has credited BCH SV tokens to its clients since the fork and has also launched trading in SV, the new crypto ""does not meet Kraken's usual listing requirements"" and ""should be seen as an extremely high risk investment.""  The exchange highlighted a number of ""red flags"" for traders, including that there are no wallets yet supporting replay protection – a way to prevent a transaction occurring on both BCH blockchains simultaneously.  Additionally, it said, supply is “temporarily constrained” due to limited wallet support, while miners appear to be operating at a loss. Further, BCH SV’s future existence may be “mutually exclusive” with other blockchains as its representatives are ""threatening"" and “openly hostile” toward other blockchains.  Kraken also said that some major holders of the token have already suggested that they would be “dumping"" the token as soon as they could  The split of the bitcoin cash blockchain took place on Nov. 15, when two of various versions of the code pushing different technical roadmaps found sufficient support from miners. Two new tokens were formed as a result: Bitcoin ABC (BCH ABC) and BCH SV.  Before the split, Kraken had announced that it would only support BCH ABC, but in the latest post, the exchange said that it is, after all, supporting BCH SV following the publication of a protocol and roadmap by nChain, the firm that leads development of the SV implementation.  Kraken further indicated that it could claw back any of its own losses arising from certain issues with the new token from SV-holding users, saying:  “Custodial losses taken on due to attacks originating from nChain or its affiliates will be socialized among all BSV holders on Kraken. Given the volatile state of the network and threats that have been made, Kraken cannot guarantee perfect custody of BSV.""  The exchange is currently monitoring both both networks and will not open deposits or withdrawals for either token until it believes ""it is safe to do so.""  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the BCH SV token has been trading in the $70–$138 range since the fork, and is currently at around $88. BCH ABC has been largely trading between $250 and $300 since the split and is currently trading at around $233.

42402220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fbV,1542618043,Beyond Price: Why We Need a Better Way to Value Crypto Assets,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The most commonly cited number for comparing the worth of different crypto projects is market capitalization. It is an extremely flawed metric.  Critics note, for example, that poor liquidity, combined with lax rules at many exchanges, let founders and large holders easily manipulate market cap quotes at sites such as CoinMarketCap. This made for all sorts of abuses during the ICO mania of last year.  But there’s a deeper, philosophical problem with market capitalization. Because it’s benchmarked in dollars, this measure (which simply reflects a token’s price multiplied by the number of issued tokens) implicitly judges the success of each crypto project in terms of some expected future fiat currency “exit.”  For an industry rooted in efforts to reinvent money and create alternative, non-fiat forms of value exchange, that’s a contradiction. And it encourages bad behavior.  Prioritizing the dollar-based return on investment fosters communities of coin-pumping fanatics, rather than those of passionate software and business developers focused on building successful decentralized crypto-economic projects.  Yet the day traders and YouTube advisors, ubiquitous as they are, do not hold a monopoly over crypto culture. There are still plenty of people drawn to this technology for reasons other than making a quick buck flipping coins.  More than any other type of asset, crypto tokens are defined by the communities they attract: ad hoc collectives of individuals motivated by a freely formed belief in an idea, a unique proposition for decentralizing an economic ecosystem. Not every token’s core idea is a good one, of course, but the point is that the enthusiasm in the idea is a key determinant of a project’s value.  That passion also varies greatly, especially in the degrees to which it manifests as a real commitment to developing the technology and the community. If we are to truly measure the value of these assets, we must also find ways to quantify those qualities, which are, by definition, independent of each token’s dollar-based price.  Enter the Crypto-Economics Explorer  This is why I’m excited by the CoinDesk data team’s launch of its Crypto-Economics Explorer. Not only does it use a more relevant crypto benchmark than the dollar – bitcoin – it also downplays the significance of price itself as a measure of value.  The Explorer offers a weighted, multi-dimensional representation of value incorporating a variety of objective measures of engagement and interest in each crypto project. Price/market cap is just one of five chosen dimensions. The others are developer activity, on-exchange transactions, on-blockchain transactions and social media activity.  If you compare each coin through this lens – give it a shot; this easy-to-use tool includes a useful zoom function – you’ll find that it opens a whole new way of understanding the particular drivers of community engagement and communal interest in each project.  Zcash, for example, is heavily skewed toward developer engagement, presumably reflecting the passion that many cryptographers have for the pro-privacy zero-knowledge-proof technology that underpins the coin. But it has very few transactions and very little social media engagement.  The profile for XRP, by contrast, is dominated by social media engagement, perhaps reflecting the “XRP Army’s” vocal presence on Twitter and other sites, as well as the fact that much development is done in-house by Ripple.  Ripple critics might be tempted to see this as proof that XRP is all show and no substance. But by the bitcoin benchmark-based terms of the Crypto Explorer itself, community development is an important factor in any crypto project’s value, and social media is a relevant proxy for that.  Why bitcoin?  Already, critics have attacked the choice of bitcoin as the benchmark, presumably viewing that status as supporting the biases of so-called “bitcoin maximalists.”  A benchmark that’s built on some kind of weighted average of all coins might have assuaged such concerns, but that would be unnecessarily complicated. It’s important to note that the 100 percent score for bitcoin on all five dimensions doesn’t reflect an absolute; it is simply a basis for comparison. As explained in backing documents, it is perfectly possible for a competing coin to outscore bitcoin on any or all of those metrics – in other words, to get more than 100 percent.  The model is, in this sense, no different from that of world foreign exchange markets, which use the U.S. dollar as their benchmark. On a purely numerical basis, one could say the British pound and the euro – currently at $1.28 and $1.14, respectively – are both “worth more” than the dollar. Of course, that would be meaningless. The point is to have some basis for comparison in time.  In choosing a benchmark, CoinDesk had to start somewhere. And, by the measures chosen, bitcoin is without a doubt the granddaddy of crypto coins. In the future, perhaps some other composite could be used in its case. But for now, this is a perfectly good starting point for a model of comparative value.  Work in progress  Still, it’s important to note that, as with any standard of value, the choices made in the Crypto-Economics Explorer’s methodology are, by definition, arbitrary. They are not based on some absolute truth.  The good news is that CoinDesk regards this project as a work in progress and, in the words of Editor-in-Chief Pete Rizzo, is inviting the community leaders to “beat our tool up. Kick it to death.” Collaborative iteration will lead to an ever-improving model.  So dive into the methodology. Perhaps you can think of an alternative benchmark to bitcoin. Perhaps there are good arguments for changing the weightings within each category. Should mining revenue account for more or less of the 20 percent at which it is currently weighted within the Explorer’s “Network” measure? Are there other metrics that are relevant to measure developer activity beyond the eight GitHub-derived numbers?  This is a starting point, not an end point. But it’s a great place to start reframing the conversation around what we should be valuing in the cryptocurrency universe.  And the timing couldn’t be better.  No. Not because the dollar prices of crypto assets tanked last week and we need some other, non-price distraction, but because institutional investors are on the verge of entering the market and it’s vital that they set aside their dollar-centric valuation models and recognize that value is a different concept in the crypto world.  These new big players talk about crypto as “a new asset class” – as if crypto tokens are just an alternative store of value, not too dissimilar to a stock, bond or commodity, that will one day bring them dollar returns when they cash out back into fiat. Yet what they’re really “buying” by investing in a crypto token is exposure to the whims of a community who’ve formed around a core idea. And quite often that idea has as its objective the disintermediation of the very institutions from which this new breed of investors comes. There’s some confused, contradictory logic in investing in something that’s designed to kill you.  Regardless, the deep pockets of these investors have the potential to add significantly more volatility to the single metric of price for many token projects. So, as even more attention goes to the traders, it’s great that we have a model with which to point out that there are other ways of looking at this industry other than with dollars.

42402218,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fYY,1542605549,"7 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google Staffers That Went Full Crypto","""Follow the talent.""  It's a maxim investor Chris Burniske tweeted recently to underscore another tweet from AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant when he wrote back in March: ""Blockchains are now sucking in top-tier Silicon Valley tech talent faster than any boom since the Internet.""  Yet, as the first flurries of crypto winter blow, this narrative has hardly cooled.  We heard it echoed again most recently in October when we spoke to Tinder exec and venture investor, Jeff Morris, Jr., who started Chapter One Ventures to back crypto projects he finds exciting. But, who are these professionals leaving good companies to take a chance on the world of crypto?  CoinDesk found seven examples of people who left jobs not just at notable tech companies but at the most notable ones. We found examples of staff from five giants of Web 2.0, the so-called FANGs: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.  Each of the people on this list turned their back on the secure life at a tech giant, the most powerful companies in today's economy, to take a chance on a new sector built on money native to the internet and decentralized data structures.  Facebook        Kahina van Dyke – Ripple  Kahina van Dyke is Ripple's senior vice president for business and corporate development, and most of her business experience has focused on payments at major companies – not just Facebook. Not only did she spend two-and-a-half years working on payments systems in Menlo Park, but she has prior experience at MasterCard and Citibank.  Van Dyke made the transition in June. On the Ripple bloghttps://ripple.com/insights/welcomes-kahina-van-dyke/, she described her reasons for entering the distributed ledger industry. She said:  ""There is a reason you have only a handful of major money transfer operators in the world today. Without question, cross-border transactions is one of the most complex and multifaceted problem in payments.""  She said she believes Ripple has the combination of technology and business strategy to eliminate that friction faced by people around the world attempting to move money internationally.  Evgeny Kuzyakov – Near Protocol  With Kuzyakov we actually get a double-dose of FANGs. Prior to his current job he worked at Facebook, and a little before that he worked at Google. He's now one of the software engineers at Near Protocol, which aims to bring blockchain to low-end devices by taking advantage of sharding.  When he left Facebook, he had been working on video compression for 360-degree videos and virtual reality. Spending time at two different major tech companies, he says, will help secure what Near hopes will be a wide reaching protocol.  He told us:  ""I've worked on backend infrastructure at Google, so I know how to build distributed systems. I understand security and privacy of large scale projects to make sure users are in the best interest of the overall system.""  Ethereum is still just too complicated and easy to mess up. EOS hasn't earned people's trust and everything else is just too immature.  ""My industry experience helps understand such issues and hopefully would help avoid them when we design our system,"" he said.  Amazon        Leo Chen – Harmony  Chen just left Amazon Web Services (AWS), the Seattle-giant's cloud service, to start at Harmony, an upcoming consensus platform designed for very high throughput.  After almost four years at the company, Chen told CoinDesk he might have made the move sooner but he had deleted Facebook's app from his phone. If not for that, he might not have missed an overture from Harmony founder Stephen Tse (himself an Apple and Google alum).  In 2012, Chen bought some bitcoin and turned a good profit on them, but family got ahead of him and he lost track of crypto for a while. Then ethereum piqued his interest again and when he finally did sit down with Tse, it felt right.  ""I, myself, am also pretty interested in building the infrastructure and distributed systems. I felt blockchain is the technology I am interested and I can contribute to,"" he told CoinDesk.  Basically everyone using the internet is using AWS indirectly. ""We provided service to hundreds of thousands of customers on hundreds of thousands of machines. The architecture I learned and the experience I gained can help us build a high-performance and secure blockchain,"" he wrote.  Apple        Alok Kothari – Harmony  Harmony gets two spots on this list, with Kothari as one of its engineers and a co-founder. Its team is actually rich in folks with FANG backgrounds, which is something that seems to be true in general: teams with one FANG veteran have several more.  Kothari is a co-founder of Harmony. He left Apple in June after working there nearly three years. A machine learning specialist, he had been working on Apple's voice assistant, Siri, but he'd long considered starting something on his own.  ""It was a perfect storm of a lot of factors. I had been waiting to start my entrepreneurial journey for a while,"" he wrote CoinDesk. He met the people who would become his co-founders at a meetup for ex-Googlers (xooglers, as they call themselves).  ""I had become convinced that blockchain would transform the world,"" he added. ""To unleash all the usefulness of the data being created in the world, access to data should be democratized and decentralized.""  If that can be accomplished, he said, ""Everyone would benefit, and everyone would win.""  Netflix        Ryan Lechner – Consensys Labs  Now at Consensys Labs, managing nearly 50 investments the Brooklyn-based ethereum shop has made, Lechner came over from Netflix, where he did sort of the same thing in TV terms. He worked to expand Netflix's non-fiction content strategy.  ""I always considered Netflix the 'innocent FAANG.' We took people's money and created joy,"" he told CoinDesk.  Still, his doubts had been forming about the larger business model of Silicon Valley, building moats with carefully guarded data. ""There is nothing structurally sustainable about putting virtual walls around data,"" he said.  He can remember the moment that it started to come clear that blockchains could build bridges over Silicon Valley's moats. ""I was walking Lake Merritt in Oakland, listening to a podcast in which Nick Szabo and Naval Ravikant talked about the transformative power of blockchain and cryptocurrencies,"" he wrote.  He joined Consensys near the end of 2017, relocating to Brooklyn. ""I hope that my role at ConsenSys can catalyze a radical shift to decentralized networks and business models,"" he wrote.  Google        Alex Feinberg – OKCoin  Feinberg serves as Director of Business Development at the exchange, OKCoin, though he first left Google to join a security startup aimed at blockchain startups called Petram Security. So OKCoin is actually his second crypto role since Google.  Feinberg started at Google in 2011, serving in a number of roles on the business side before leaving in March, working at the time on Google Search and Google Assistant. He worked with major brands (such as the NBA, Bloomberg, NPR) to integrate their content with major search and assistant platforms.  He joined Google because he had a thesis that as long as central banks kept printing money it would have outsize benefits in the more speculative parts of the economy, such as tech. ""The move into the crypto space was just a logical extension of this original decision,"" he said.  He settled on his decision to move early this year. He was having dinner with a friend in January. His friend had made some major contrarian bets and been wildly successful. Feinberg wrote:  ""I thought to myself, 'The people with whom I share a similar world view outside of Google are doing much better financially than the people with whom I do not at Google, so let's see where this takes me.'""  Chandan Lodha - CoinTracker  Lodha is co-founder of CoinTracker, an application that can calculate tax obligations on crypto portfolios.  He left Google (or Alphabet's) X division in mid-2017, where he had been working as a product manager on Project Loon, which aims to connect remote areas to the internet with balloons.  ""To be honest, I was initially pretty skeptical of cryptocurrency,"" he told us, this despite the fact that he did some work on a bitcoin startup in 2012 and held cryptocurrency for years. As those holdings became more meaningful, they felt less like a hobby.  He had already been working on putting together an idea with a fellow Googler who became his co-founder. Though they started looking at traditional fintech, his own experience in crypto pointed their business in that direction.  He acknowledges that their app isn't the first to take on tax obligations, but he believes the space still has a ways to go in terms of user experience. He said, ""One lesson we have brought from Google that has been really helpful in building CoinTracker is focusing on users to build very simple and intuitive products.""  It's hard to see whether or not trends like the one shown above will accelerate, because staff could increasingly make similar transitions within companies. For example, Instagram's head of product recently moved over to a similar role on Facebook's blockchain efforts, according to LinkedIn.  Similarly, former Coinbase board member and head of Facebook's messaging products, David Marcus, is also all blockchain all the time in Menlo Park, as well.  ""You're taking your all-stars and moving them to the blockchain initiatives in your company,"" Morris observed to CoinDesk in an interview. ""A lot of that has to be employee-driven.""
