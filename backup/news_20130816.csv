42416887,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhUu,1376673661,"Coinbase enables users to buy, sell and send bitcoins via text message","Bitcoin wallet service Coinbase has created an SMS interface, which enables users to send and receive bitcoins via text message.  Any Coinbase customer, regardless of the network they are on and whether or not they have a smartphone, can use the new service. First, users have to head online and visit their Coinbase account page, verify their phone number, select a six-digit pin and click the 'enable SMS' button.  After sending 'hi' to 1 (650) 316-5555, the service is activated and the user can complete any of a number of actions, for example sending bitcoins to a friend's Coinbase wallet, checking the current price of bitcoin and selling bitcoins.  Complete list of Coinbase SMS commands:  balance (b or bal) – you'll receive your bitcoin balance via text message  transactions (t or txns) – you'll receive a text message detailing your last three transactions  address (a or addr) – you'll receive a text message showing your bitcoin address for receiving bitcoins  qr (q) – you'll receive a QR code image link for your bitcoin address (only available on certain handsets)  request (r or req) – a request for bitcoins will be sent to the email address or phone number you choose  send (s) – you'll send bitcoins to an email address, a bitcoin address, or a phone number of your choice  price (p) – you'll be sent the current Coinbase buy/sell price  buy – buy bitcoins and debit your primary bank account  sell – sell bitcoins and credit your primary bank account  For the actions that involve buying, selling and sending bitcoins, the user will receive an automated phone call and will be prompted to enter their pin.    ""We decided to add an SMS interface because we feel that bitcoin should be accessible to anyone,"" said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase. ""There are many in the world that don't have access to a smartphone, and there's large overlap between that group and the underbanked. As a result, adding an SMS interface helps us begin to reach some of the people in the world that stand to gain from bitcoin the most.""    The SMS interface was built by Coinbase's new recruit Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin. It is one of many developments the company has made since it received a $5 million investment led by Union Square Ventures in May.  Coinbase was involved in the 2012 summer programme of elite startup incubator Y Combinator, which has nurtured a number of successful companies, including reddit, Airbnb and Dropbox.  Y-Combinator’s co-founder Paul Graham labelled Coinbase's rapid growth as ""very, very rare.""  “Hackers are the animals that can detect a storm coming or an earthquake. They just know, even though they don’t know why, and there are two big things hackers are excited about now and can’t articulate why – Bitcoin and 3D printing,"" he added.  Kipochi  offers a similar product to those based in numerous regions across the world, including the Middle East, Africa and South America.  Kipochi, which means purse or wallet in Swahili, is like Coinbase's new system in that users' mobile phone numbers act as their account numbers, enabling them to buy, sell, send and receive bitcoins via their handsets. It works on all web-enabled mobile phones and operates with very low transaction fees.  What do you think of the new Coinbase SMS service?

42416889,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhYy,1376667058,The staring match between The Man and bitcoin: nobody’s blinked yet,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 16th August 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law  Keeping your secrets in plain sight  If you only feel good about one thing this week, it should be this. By being interested in bitcoin, you’re at the epicentre of one of the biggest experiments in personal technology, law, money and human rights this century.  Overblown? Hardly. As part of the fall-out from revelations about the extent of state surveillance of citizens, two US-based secure email services Lavabit and Silent Circle, closed down last week.  The owners are legally forbidden from saying why, but it’s known that certain government agencies can demand user data from service providers while forbidding any disclosure that such demands have been made. If you’ve promised your users privacy, where does that leave you?  It’s fair to think that if such powers over its citizens exist in the US, with its very strong constitutional rules about due process and freedom of speech, the rest of us can expect our security services to open our emails along with their morning papers.  Some good news: if you use strong encryption like PGP, the spooks have a much harder time of it. The bad news is that most intelligence gathering comes from traffic analysis - spotting who’s talking to whom and when - rather than what’s actually being said, and by no coincidence whatsoever that’s the sort of data with the least - read no - protection under law from state surveillance.  Enter bitcoin. Or, rather, the Bitcoin protocols. As you already know, Professor, bitcoin doesn’t use servers. It has no owner to subpoena or premises to be raided. It has no lists of users or passwords. Everything it does is entirely open, relying on mathematics to keep its secrets. What if someone built an email system like that?  They have, and it’s called Bitmessage. Still experimental and far from pretty, it uses bitcoin ideas for messages, both email-like and chat-like. Everybody on the system sees all the messages - but you can only decode the ones you have the right key for.  The spooks can see all the messages and if they install snooping software at your ISP, they can tell you see all the messages too. But they can’t tell which, if any, are for or from you, nor where they’re going, nor what’s in them. No servers, no archives, no central infrastructure.  This has a couple of implications. First, it renders the entire legal and practical framework of the spooks irrelevant. That all stops mattering. Second, if it works - and it should - the obvious question is ‘why can’t more Internet services work this way?’.  A big question with big answers, and you’re already part of it.  Lawyer up  It has been said, and with good reason, that the easiest way to break the law is to buy a car. However, the next easiest way seems to be to start a bitcoin company in America.  With the New York state regulator calling in 22 companies for a nice chat and the US government rattling the cages of just about every federal agency involved in stopping naughtiness, the chances of a start-up in America being left alone long enough to get any work done seem to diminish by the day.  And the dragnet does seem particularly wide. Among the 22 companies getting the tap on the shoulder are Google, who one might expect to give a feisty reply, and Butterfly Labs, who make chips and had no reason to think they’d interest a financial regulator.  If the sole qualifying attribute for inclusion is ‘might make money from bitcoin’ then John Law himself is mildly nervous. After all, these columns have been topping up his own 2013 Beer Fund: time to drink the evidence.  One company that has so far been exempt is Bloomberg, which confirmed this week that it was testing a bitcoin ticker on its internal systems. While this is another sign that the currency is establishing itself, the challenge of working out the exchange rate may be harder than it looks.  Bitcoin lends itself far more than any other currency or commodity to independent, highly flexible trades. John Law is reminded of the dual market that exists in every environment that has highly regulated official trading systems for stuff that’s easy to move about: even totalitarian states that keep an iron grip on their currencies are unable - and indeed unwilling - to shut down the black markets that more accurately reflect the true nature of things.  And while, despite the sabre-rattling from the feds, there’s no real sign that Soviet levels of regulation are going to be applied, the sheer ease of making your own arrangements for buying and selling cryptocurrencies over the Internet is going to make tracking the true state of affairs difficult indeed.  Coming up with a decent system for this may be a worthwhile project for some inventive geek - provided, of course, you fancy a trip into town to explain yourself to some highly paid government official.  The flip side of the coin  Bitcoin’s affinity for the digital world has a counterpoint - it’s not very happy being physical. This was demonstrated at the Defcon hackers conference, where the fundamental security of the Casascius metal-plus-hologram coin was broken. And not by some high-powered mathematical method neither: it took a syringe filled with a ‘non-polar solvent’ (read: nail varnish remover) that unstuck the hologram sticker and revealed the private key underneath.  That’s slightly less clever than the old trick of squirting graphite powder - normally used to lubricate locks - into the coin mechanisms of slot machines to get free plays.  As security expert Vladimir Marchenko told CoinDesk, attacks on physical secrets are always going to be a problem. It doesn’t matter how smart you are, the hackers will get through.  Chip makers know this; they’ve spent decades trying to hide keys and authentication secrets on slivers of silicon with all sorts of anti-tamper cleverness. To no avail: clever people equipped to take the tops off the chip packages, listen to the minute radio signals coming off the circuits, or analyse tiny clues in how the chips react to attacks, have a very good track record in breaking in.  Which is where we came in, this week - it’s the maths that keeps you safe, not the hiding. It’s a bit of a shame, as John Law suspects this might prevent BTC-style currency from ever completely replacing good old-fashioned metal coins and paper notes.  This by itself puts back his own secret project, which he hoped would kick in if the Scots voted for independence next year and the English, in a fit of pique, decided not to let them carry on using the pound sterling.  In that case, John Law wanted to be ready with Britcoin, a new cybercurrency more suited to the modern world. It would be mined by intensively playing video games or watching reality TV on your mobile, automatically peel off a small amount of its value on every transaction to make it impossible to avoid taxation, and let its owners pay on-the-spot fines just by being waved in front of CCTV cameras.  Needs more work. Its time will come.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Law,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/16/the-staring-match-between-the-man-and-bitcoin-nobodys-blinked-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76db6fa0ddef395e96439fefa7b40d513ed92997-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416871,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcwQ,1376661245,Living on bitcoin is a real challenge for newlywed couple,"Call Austin and Beccy Bingham Craig's 90-day bitcoin challenge a publicity stunt, or call it an earnest effort to bring the cryptocurrency to a mainstream audience. It's hard to pull off either one without a phone.  When CoinDesk tried to connect with the Craigs for an interview about their documentary-in-progress, Life on Bitcoinhttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/, telecommunications were a challenge. The Provo, Utah, couple's goal of spending nothing but bitcoins during the first 90 days of their marriage (they tied the knot July 12) led Austin to drop the voice and data service for his iPhone.  So we tried communicating via the Internet connection at their co-working space (which they pay to use with bitcoins). After a Facetime connection failed, we talked on Skype until it dropped our call. Finally we resorted to a minor cheat, and completed the interview on the phone Beccy keeps for her job as a data center marketing manager.  Beccy pays this phone's bill in bitcoins, but she pays those bitcoins to her brother, with whom she shares a family plan.  “While doing business with family is against our rules, we let this one go because she's always paid her brother, and she is paying in bitcoin, and she can't lose her phone without losing her job,” Austin said.  Such are the challenges of defining what it really means to pay for something in bitcoins. Ideally, the couple wants to get all the goods and services they need by paying bitcoins directly to local businesses. Realistically, they frequently have had to turn to a third party, whether that's a travel agent, a helpful brother, or a stranger met online.  Austin eventually managed to get a new phone activated using the stranger method: he met a bitcoiner at the AT&T store, who paid dollars to AT&T and got reimbursed by Austin in bitcoins. Getting phone service was a major win, since using a smartphone with a bitcoin wallet is the easiest way to pay with bitcoins in the bricks-and-mortar world. And in order to convince local businesses to accept their bitcoins for everything from gas to granola, the Craigs really need to be able to demonstrate how bitcoin works. Like on a smartphone.  The challenge of approaching businesses one by one, and lining up intermediaries when necessary, is so time consuming that Austin has gone ""very part-time"" in his job as the goggles-wearing pitchman in goofy-but-effective YouTube videos for tongue cleaner Orabrush. That's OK, though, since Orabrush co-founder Jeffrey Harmon is also a partner on the project. A camera crew from production company The Good Line follows Austin as he pitches to unsuspecting merchants not on the benefits of tongue scrubbing, but on those of accepting a cryptocurrency.  Neither the Craigs nor Harmon and other partners, who include two of Harmon's brothers, are bitcoin investors with a lot to gain by promoting the cryptocurrency. In fact, before changing dollars into bitcoins to begin this project, Austin had made just one bitcoin transaction, and Beccy none.  Austin says his main goal is to help people understand bitcoin – and get to know it better himself.  “My hope with this project is we can take this technical, often confusing subject that people are unfamiliar with and uncomfortable with because of its novelty and because it relates to their wallet ... and make it relatable.”  Theron Harmon, brother of the Orabrush co-founder, originally came up with the documentary idea. He says he got interested in bitcoin when the exchange rate was under $1 but never bought in. He dreamed up the project as a way to participate in what could be a currency revolution, using his skills for marketing and promotion. Theron Harmon is the founder of promotional products vendor American Promotions.  He shared the idea with his brother Jeffrey, who besides Orabrush also co-founded the Ron Paul-backing Endorse Liberty group. Jeffrey recruited Austin Craig and his soon-to-be bride.  The documentary, scheduled to be finished next spring, could make some money for the partners, but they're not expecting to hit major bank.  ""Documentaries are probably even more speculative than bitcoin,"" Theron said. ""None of us are doing this as our only job.""  Although the team is generally enthusiastic about the potential of bitcoin, they have asked the filmmakers to give bitcoin a critical, fair look.  ""We do not want it to be a polemic. We want it to look at both sides,"" Theron Harmon said.  Austin Craig had also cultivated an interest in bitcoin over the years, so he was amenable to the project. But Theron Harmon was amazed and grateful that Beccy Craig agreed to participate. She's even convinced her employer to pay her in bitcoins, although she's still working with the finance department to make that a reality.  The couple is quick to point out that they are not using funds raised on Kickstarter to pay their living expenses. The $72,995 from Kickstarter goes to pay the documentary crew, which not only follows Austin and Beccy around Provo, but will travel to other locations to interview other people involved in the bitcoin story. The project has raised some funds from sponsors outside Kickstarter that may be used to pay some of the Craigs' expenses, for instance while they are traveling for the film. In all, the project has raised just over $100,000, some of it in bitcoins.  In interviews, the couple sound chipper, ticking off their successes one by one: They're eating well, they've managed to gas up their cars, and they're working on convincing their landlord to accept their rent in bitcoins. But the couple's blog posts reveal that the little victories sometimes feel hard won.  “Life on Bitcoin is, for the time being, hard work and a lot of hassle,” Austin wrote on Day 16, explaining that when he contacts businesses, it takes a lot of work just to get to the person empowered to make the decision about bitcoin.  “Evangelizing bitcoin turns out to feel a lot like a sales job. And I’m remembering how bad I am at direct sales.”  Convincing landlords, insurance companies, restaurants, gas stations and movie theaters to accept a currency they probably have never heard of would be challenging anywhere. But the Craigs have taken on this task in Provo, Utah, far from world bitcoin centers like San Francisco or Berlin. However, their relatively isolated location is not as big a factor as you might think, Beccy said:  “In Berlin there are something like 24 stores [that accept bitcoins], so we have a 24-store disadvantage.”  What Provo lacks in bitcoin awareness, it makes up for with community, Austin said: “We've been here a long time and have a lot of friends in the area. That's an advantage you might not have in a more densely populated area.”  Having a friend who owns a restaurant or a taco truck is an opportunity for an easy sell. Having a friend who trusts you enough to pay a bill in exchange for bitcoins can get you out of a jam. But sometimes, friends and family can be too helpful.  “A friend borrowed my truck for one quick thing she needed to move, and she brought it back mostly full. You can't do that!” Austin said. Beccy's parents were also thanked for filling their refrigerator with food while they were on their honeymoon, but politely asked not to repeat the gesture. “The point of the project is not life on the generosity of friends and family.”  Sometimes, life on bitcoin means relying on the kindness of strangers. Take the newlyweds' journey home from the airport after their wedding and honeymoon in Costa Rica. They met the film crew and turned over their credit cards and cash (save for one card kept in case of medical emergency), then had to find a way to get themselves home.  “We asked a couple of cab drivers if they would take bitcoin, and unsurprisingly they were mostly puzzled,” Austin said. They tried the train to downtown Provo, where they live, and found the platform empty except for one guy.  “I walked up and said, 'Hi, have you ever heard of bitcoin?'” Austin said.  The stranger hadn't, but he agreed to accept a 0.5 BTC Casascius Coin, worth at the time three to four times the cost of two tickets downtown.  In October, the couple will have to rely even more on strangers – met by chance or lined up through bitcoin meetup groups and forums online – when they travel to Atlanta to speak at the Crypto-Currency Conference.  Groceries at home have not been too much of a problem, since one of the first merchants they convinced to accept bitcoins was a local community-supported agriculture operation, La Nay Ferme. They've even ordered fertilized chicken eggs using bitcoins, in the hopes of producing some of their own food. And they just announcedhttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/lifeonbitcoin-day-22-progress-report-breakthrough/ a special trial run of bitcoin payment with a large grocery store. But on the road, they may have to resort to brown-bagging it between bitcoin-friendly restaurants.  Buying gas will probably be the biggest challenge on the road, since it has been tough at home. At first, the only place they could buy gas was 50 miles away, where an employee on the graveyard shift at a gas station had agreed to accept their bitcoins and pay for their gas in dollars for them. The journey used up a lot of gas, and they could only go on days their new friend was working.  ""If [it] gets down to a quarter tank left, I stop driving,"" Austin said.  Unless they make a breakthrough with a gas station chain before they leave, filling up on the road is going to require some serious planning.  “We're going to have to plot a route between Salt Lake City and Atlanta, and know every stop,” Austin said.

42416870,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcuO,1376643147,Google patches Android flaw that led to bitcoin heist,"Google has released an advisory to developers on how to deal with the recently discovered flaw in Android that led to the theft of thousands of dollars in bitcoin from mobile app wallets.  The [then] potential flaw was first reported on the Bitcoin forum, where it was reported that over 55 BTC had been stolen from multiple users to the same bitcoin address. The forum user also reported that the (software) clients that had been stolen from had signed the transaction messages with the same random number. This in turn led some to believe that Android's pseudo random number generator (PRNG) was not being properly initialised.  When transaction messages are signed, they are signed with a combination of one's private key and a random number. The random number's purpose is to conceal the value of the private key. If the same random number is used more than once, the private key can be deduced.  Bitcoin developers issued an alert about this within 24 hours of the forum post. In which it named some of the affected apps: Bitcoin Wallet, Blockchain.info wallet, BitcoinSpinner and Mycelium Wallet. Furthermore, it confirmed that updates had been prepared for the named applications. Indeed, we can independently verify that at least the Blockchain.info app had been updated prior to the time of writing.  The Bitcoin developers went on to advise that users make sure they update their apps as soon as possible, and in the meantime to move coins away to an alternative wallet.  More recently, Google come forward to make a statement on its Android Developer blog. It confirmed that applications using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) were not receiving cryptographically strong values due to improper initialization (i.e. a ""seed value""). It also confirmed that the PRNG of Android's SSL and TLS signing was not affected by this flaw.  Fortunately there is something that developers can (and have) done now to deal with the problem, as the underlying PRNG of the JCA can be explicitly initialised with a better-than-default seed value.  Furthermore, the Android developer team has issued a fix to the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) so that OEMs can implement the fix into their Android distributions. However, any Android update has to pass through OEM testing, and then go through operator approval. Therefore, the patch will likely take a long time to trickle down to end users.  Bitcoin expert and information security professional Vladimir Marchenko reminded users that flaws in software do happen, and that they should always be mindful of applying security patches and software updates in a timely manner. He also spoke to the strength of the Bitcoin team:  ""This incident has also demonstrated how professionally, quickly and efficiently the bitcoin community has reacted and resolved the issue. Bravo!""  Marchenko went on to give the following cautionary note: ""As a general note it might be unwise to use mobile phones to store large amounts of bitcoins. The mobile devices are, however, extremely convenient in day-to-day use of bitcoin and having small amounts stored there while larger amounts are stored more securely elsewhere makes sense.  ""Just like people have savings accounts and current accounts in banks, users should separate long-term storage of larger amounts of bitcoins and more convenient storage of smaller amounts for day-to-day use. This reduces the amount of assets at risk and therefore overall risk, while providing a reasonable level of convenience.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/16/google-patches-android-flaw-that-led-to-bitcoin-heist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5e23f0f39ce40b55e70a0e68bd02f539ebda7a7-1024x577.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
