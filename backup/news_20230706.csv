42419949,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjDZ,1688686232,"Is Justin Bieber’s Ape Really Worth $59,000? The Nuances of Valuing NFTs","Last week, the floor price of popular non-fungible token (NFT) collection Bored Ape Yacht Club fell below 30 ETH, sinking to a 20-month low. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why the collection’s floor price has dropped so dramatically, though it’s likely due to a combination of factors – there’s been a broader cooldown in the NFT market that has impacted many of the top NFT collections and an extended crypto winter has affected the price of Ethereum, which powers most NFT collections.  The fact that BAYC – long ranked as one of the top collections across NFT marketplaces – has experienced such a steep decline in floor price has some critics knocking it as a fall from grace.  One popular tweet circulating on Twitter singled out a Bored Ape NFT acquired by Justin Beiber in January 2022 for $1.3 million. According to the tweet, the Ape is now only worth about $59,000. Media quickly picked it up and labeled it a loss for Bieber, who has not yet sold the NFT.  As it turns out, determining the value of an NFT is slightly more nuanced than that. While floor price is a helpful metric that indicates the lowest price a seller wants for an NFT in a given collection, it often does not reflect every NFT in a 10,000-edition collection.  There are many factors that go into determining how valuable an NFT is, according to industry experts. There’s the floor price, which best reflects the perceived value of the most basic NFTs in a collection. And then there’s the price of Ethereum, which can fluctuate greatly on a given day. But there are also individual factors that make one NFT more valuable than its neighbor, including its cultural significance, its rarity ranking and a collector’s personal affiliation to the asset.  The rare factor  Many generative art NFT collections have embedded rarity traits. This is why collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks have become so popular as profile pictures (PFPs) on social networks like Twitter – showing off a rare PFP carries the same social significance as owning an expensive handbag.  “Rarity traits refer to unique characteristics of an NFT, such as limited edition releases, exclusive features or special attributes,” Oliver Cohen, president of NFT analytics tool Inspect, told CoinDesk. “These traits contribute to the perceived scarcity and desirability of an NFT, which can affect its value.”  Deep NFT Value is a tool that uses machine learning to analyze high-value NFT collections based on previous sales, current market conditions and rarity traits. Founder and CEO Nikolai Yakovenko told CoinDesk that in the case of Bored Ape Yacht Club, NFTs with “gold fur,” “trippy fur” and “blue beams” have historically sold for the most money and continue to be the most valuable. In addition, Apes with a combination of traits are sometimes considered to be rare and are therefore more valuable.  “Generally speaking, these traits keep their ""premium"" on the floor, as that moves,” he explained, noting that as the floor price of a collection moves up or down, Apes with rare traits typically remain proportionately priced.  “If the floor price – or common Apes – goes up by 20%, then the premiums also go up by 20%,” said Yakovenko. “That changes over time, but day to day you look at the historical premium and the floor price movement, since rare pieces don't trade that often but the floor price trades all day long.”  Deep NFT Value’s algorithm “scores” an NFT in a collection based on its proportion to the floor price – for example, this Ape is estimated to be worth 4.4 times the floor price, according to its traits.  Still, Yakovenko noted that these can numbers can change due to supply and demand and depending on the market’s appetite for common versus rare Apes.  “Of course when the model sees market signals – sales, bids and listings – that contradict our estimates, then the model adjusts,” he said.  Despite dips, collectors who purchase rarer NFTs may fare better in the long term, according to Sara Gherghelas, an analyst at analytics platform DappRadar.  ""NFTs with certain rarity traits or cultural significance may retain or even increase their value despite the collection’s overall decrease,"" she told CoinDesk.  ‘For the culture’  The cultural significance of a particular NFT can also factor into its price. For example, in Jack Butcher’s Checks VV, NFTs with notable edition numbers like #1 or #420 can sell for more than the floor price.  “NFTs associated with influential artists, iconic moments or significant cultural events may carry higher value due to their historical or artistic importance,” said Cohen, noting that a collection’s cultural significance can fluctuate over time. “If a collection has gained significant popularity and recognition, individual tokens within that collection may see an increase in value due to the overall reputation and demand.”  NFT collection Pudgy Penguins is an example of an NFT collection that recently experienced a major upswing thanks to a change in leadership.  Another example of a culturally significant NFT that sold well above its collection’s floor price was Dmitri Cherniak's Ringers #879, affectionately known as “The Goose” because of how closely the generative artwork resembles the bird.  The NFT, which was previously owned by liquidated hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, sold for $6.2 million at auction last month – far higher than the collection’s floor price of 44.5 ETH, or about $75,000 at the time, according to data from OpenSea.  The fact that the NFT was previously owned by a major hedge fund may have also boosted the hype around its sale, though Yakovenko said that prior ownership does not factor into Deep NFT Value's algorithm.  “We do not factor in the ownership history of an Ape – unless it's been stolen,” he said. “There's no evidence that users pay a premium for that, unlike, say, jewelry worn by celebrities.”  Sweeping the floor  When looking at an NFT collection as a whole, floor price is helpful in conveying how popular a project is at a given point in time. OpenSea defines the floor price as “the lowest price for collection items, rather than the average item price,” meaning that if you just wanted to own any NFT from a particular collection, the floor price would be your best deal. Analyzing changes to a collection’s floor price over time can reflect public sentiment.  “When the floor price drops, it can indicate a decrease in demand or saturation of supply for the collection,” Cohen said. “This decrease in demand and lower perceived value of the collection as a whole can influence the value of individual tokens within the collection. Buyers may be less willing to pay a higher price for an individual token when the overall collection's value is declining.”  For Bored Ape Yacht Club, this correlation rings especially true. “Over time, as the floor price has gone down, so has the value of the top Apes,” said Yakovenko.  Knowing this information allows us to look back at Bieber’s NFT purchase with a new perspective. Deep NFT Value estimates that based on its rarity traits, cultural significance and public sentiment, Ape #3001 is most likely worth roughly what the collection’s floor price is.  “Our model sees him as a floor Ape – pretty clean – no bad features, but nothing extra valuable either,” Yakovenko said, positing that the Ape sold for four to five times more than it was worth in 2022.  Other celebrities that “aped” into the collection during the NFT bull run may have also overvalued their NFTs. After all, BAYC once reached a floor price of 153.7 ETH in April 2022 – when public sentiment toward NFTs was sky-high.  Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady paid 133 ETH – worth about $453,000 at the time – for BAYC #3667 in April 2022. Deep NFT Value estimates that today, the NFT is worth 30.7 ETH, or about $58,000. Rapper Eminem reportedly purchased BAYC #9055 in December 2021 for 123.45 ETH, worth about $453,000 at the time. The token is currently valued at 37.97 ETH, a little over $71,000, by Deep NFT Value.  “It's important to note that the impact on individual token value can vary depending on factors such as the uniqueness of the token, its rarity traits and the overall perception of the collection's long-term potential,” said Cohen.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Cam Thompson, Rosie Perper",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/06/is-justin-biebers-ape-really-worth-59000-the-nuances-of-valuing-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6addb7094c9d47959777112394dd7afd21d6dab-2190x1460.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14595529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541549,1688684404,"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, So What’s The Digital Silver?","On Wednesday, an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink went viral in which the CEO called Bitcoin an international asset. Not only that, Fink also pointed toward digital assets such as Bitcoin as being a way to digitize gold on the blockchain. This statement from the CEO has since been interpreted in various ways to mean that Fink referred to BTC as digital gold. So the question now remains, if Bitcoin is digital gold, which cryptocurrency is digital silver? ETH Is Digital Silver? The digital gold argument for Bitcoin continues but with Ethereum being the second-largest and most popular cryptocurrency in the market, it has often been dubbed the ‘Digital Silver’. Over the last seven years, its performance has also solidified claims that Ethereum is silver to Bitcoin’s gold. Related Reading: Rapid Rise In Cardano’s TVL Points Toward Bullish Sentiment Around ADA There have previously been claims that Litecoin qualifies to be referred to as the digital silver. Most of these claims were rooted in the fact that Litecoin’s mechanism is basically identical to that of BTC. However, performance-wise, it has fallen short compared to ETH, which is now BTC’s largest rival. One area where Litecoin tends to outshine Ethereum though is when it comes to supply. While Litecoin undergoes halving events every four years like BTC to reduce its block rewards and has a maximum supply, Ethereum has none of these things. ETH’s unlimited supply has usually been a concern as this means the digital asset could be a perpetually inflationary asset. That is, until the implementation of the ETH burn, aimed at reducing the rate at which new coins are being brought into circulation. Data from Ultrasound Money, a website that tracks the ETH burn and issuance rate, shows that instead of increasing, the ETH supply is now decreasing at a rate of 0.33% per year. This development eliminates the concerns about inflation for ETH, further giving credence to the fact that Ethereum is the digital silver. ETH price resting above $1,900 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Vs Ethereum, Which Is Better? The argument about the better option between Bitcoin and Ethereum continues to wax strong, especially on social media platforms. However, both of these digital assets are unique in their own way and serve different functions in the market. While Bitcoin continues to hold the torch as the pioneer cryptocurrency, garnering massive support over the last decade, Ethereum, in its own right, has propelled the concept of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Binance General Counsel Han Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President for Compliance Steven Christie are among those that have resigned, a source familiar with the matter told Fortune. In addition, Binance’s Global Vice President of Marketing and Communications Steve Milton left the company in June, according to his LinkedIn profile. Their departure follows Senior Director of Investigations Matthew Price's recent decision to part ways with the exchange.  A Binance spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.  The decisions by Ng, Hillmann and Christie to leave had to do with Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s response to an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to Fortune, citing a source familiar with the situation. The investigation reportedly relates to Binance's attempts to fool U.S. regulators and alleged money laundering and violations of sanctions.  Hillman tweeted on Thursday, however, that he was leaving on good terms and that he “continues to respect and support” Zhao.  Binance is already under investigation from multiple regulators around the world, and the exodus of executives from the company's legal and compliance units is likely to complicate its efforts to defend itself.  In June, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, alleging the exchange had committed 13 counts of securities law violations. Two months earlier, the company faced a lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It also faces several investigations led by regulators in Europe and Australia.  The investigations have stymied the operations of the exchange's stateside business, as well as that of its international trading arm, which U.S. regulators have speculated are deeply enmeshed.

42419958,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjNt,1688680534,He Got Arrested in Russia for a Bitcoin Bribe. Now the Coins Are Moving to Exchanges,"A criminal case involving a whopping amount of bitcoin is being investigated in Russia, but some of the evidence of the crime seems to be moving to crypto exchanges by unknown parties, blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Blockchain found.  The long and convoluted story concerns a disgraced law enforcement officer in Moscow, who is under investigation for allegedly extorting bitcoin from hackers, Russian media reported in June.  Marat Tambiev, age 35, a mid-ranking officer on Russia’s Investigative Committee, in January 2022 arrested several members of the Infraud Organization, the notorious Russian cybercriminal group. (Two members of Infraud were sentenced to five to 10 years in federal prison in the U.S. in 2021 for trading stolen personal data, credit card information, malware and other illegal goods.)  The hackers Tambiev arrested in Moscow, Mark and Konstantin Bergman and Denis Samokutyayevsky, allegedly paid a bribe of 1,032 BTC so that Tambiev would not confiscate all of their crypto, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant. In June, an anonymous Russian-language Telegram channel leaked a fragment of a court document showing that 1,032 BTC were confiscated, with partially redacted blockchain addresses.  The hackers testified, however, that they sent Tambiev more than twice as much crypto – 2,718 BTC – the newspaper Arguments and Facts reported. The funds were transferred via the hackers’ attorney Roman Meyer, according to the publication. The larger bribe amount appears to have been confirmed by a lawyer, Vadim Bagaturya, who works at the same law firm as Tambiev’s attorney. Bagaturya posted court documents in his Telegram channel showing the initial bribe amount of 2,718 BTC.  And while the officially confiscated 1,032 BTC were put in storage by the Investigative Committee for material evidence, it’s unclear what happened to the rest of the bribe, or the 1,686 BTC that the hackers said they gave Tambiev.  Just three months after the hackers’ arrests, Tambiev himself was arrested for bribery, and his laptop with bitcoin was confiscated.  “Retirement” fund in a MacBook  The story from the hackers’ perspective is more detailed. Two days after the hackers were arrested, according to the transcript from Konstantin Bergman’s interrogation, their attorney passed along an offer from Tambiev that if they agreed to give him half of the bitcoins they possessed, he would return the rest to them. The hackers agreed to the offer, and on the same day, a Moscow district court released the three men on bail.  At 9 p.m. that same evening, the three hackers met Tambiev at the Investigative Committee office and spent hours going through their crypto wallets. By 7 a.m., they found that they together had 5,212.9 BTC in total. They paid Tambiev 2,718.66 BTC and kept the rest.  In March 2022, Tambiev was arrested, and his apartment in Moscow was searched. On his MacBook, Tambiev’s colleagues found a file titled “Retirement,” with photos of hand-written notes that contained seed phrases for two wallets.  In those wallets, investigators found 931.1 BTC and 100 BTC. After that, the bitcoins were confiscated, sent to another address using the Ledger Nano X hardware wallet and stored in a safe vault for evidence, Kommersant wrote.  During his 11-year tenure at the Investigative Committee, Tambiev earned a total salary of about $134,300, according to the charging documents by the Prosecutor General’s Office, which was leaked online. His earnings represent less than 1% of the value of the bitcoins in his wallets.  The investigation is continuing and Tambiev’s guilt hasn’t been established in court. In the meantime, he was fired from his job and is currently fighting his dismissal in court.  Following the money  Crystal Blockchain located the wallets that contained the bribe based on fragments of addresses listed in the leaked court documents, the blockchain data research firm told CoinDesk. The wallets that received 100 BTC and 932 BTC in July 2022 are both empty now, their contents sent to the wallet in the custody of law enforcement in Nov. 2022.  “We reviewed the transactions associated with the 1,032 BTC address and identified an additional payment of 1,032 [BTC], as well as the remaining 654 [BTC]. We assess that these payments were probably made to other officials who have not been held accountable but have some connections to Russia-based cybercrime groups,” Nick Smart, director of blockchain intelligence at Crystal Blockchain, told CoinDesk.  He added that Crystal located additional, previously unreported wallets belonging to the Infraud Organization, and those appeared to be closely connected with the darknet marketplaces UniCC and LuxSocks.  The story gets even more interesting when following the disputed remainder of the bribe money. The initial bribe amount, connected to the known Infraud wallets, was distributed among several wallets and then moved between a bunch of intermediary addresses, according to the data provided to CoinDesk by Crystal. On March 7, 1,032 BTC landed in the two wallets seized by the law enforcement. On November 17, 2022, the day Tambiev was arrested and his bitcoins seized, those two wallets sent all of their bitcoins to a new one and the bitcoins haven’t moved from there since. This is presumably the official money confiscated by authorities and held for evidence.  Another bitcoin wallet, which received 1,032 BTC at the same time as the arrested wallets, remained inactive until Dec. 6, 2022. The remainder of the bribe money that the hackers said they gave Tambiev may have been stored in a third wallet with 654.1 BTC in it, according to Crystal. During 2022, most of those funds moved to centralized crypto exchanges, namely, Huobi, WhiteBit and a little-known Estonia-registered exchange Bitexbit, Crystal’s data show.  WhiteBit CEO Vladimir Nosov told CoinDesk that the holders of the bitcoins traced by Crystal used an over-the-counter (OTC) service to cash out, and that service, in turn, used WhiteBit. The transactions did not look suspicious and had a low risk score, Nosov added.  Transaction-tracking services like Crystal label wallets as risky or criminally connected based on data from law enforcement agencies or public reports. However, wallet owners often cash out their crypto from exchanges before the criminal connection becomes known, or use small OTC services that pay much less attention to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks than bigger exchanges.  Huobi and Bitexbit have not returned comment as of press time.

Large Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Divergent Paths","FOMC officials appear cautiously optimistic about inflation and the economy but also remain concerned about a potential recession  Meanwhile bitcoin whales increase in number but display different behavior based on size.  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes released Wednesday from the June meeting suggest that central bankers are uncertain about the economy’s fate in the months ahead.  How their thinking figures in rate hike decisions could profoundly affect crypto markets. Meanwhile the number of bitcoin “whales” has increased, although their distribution has shifted.  June FOMC caution  FOMC minutes show Fed officials cautiously forecasting the possibility of economic recession within the next six months, “followed by a moderately paced recovery”  They also voiced expectations that such a recession would be “neither deep, nor prolonged.”  Still, they appear to be walking a tightrope, with the recent decision to pause rate hikes coming across as a first-do-no-harm approach to monetary policy. The U.S. economy has been more resilient than the FOMC expected. Conflicting economic data has created uncertainty.  For example, at 8:15 a.m. (ET), ADP employment data showed that private business created more than 497,000 jobs in June, the most since February 2022, and well above expectations of 228,000. A mere hour and 45 minutes later, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed an unexpectedly large contraction of job openings during the same period.  Whales differing paths  While the larger investing community wrestles with macroeconomic data, some bitcoin whales have grown in size, even while displaying some of the same uncertainty as the FOMC.  Bitcoin whales are investors holding more than 1,000 BTC. Since June 14, a day before asset management giant BlackRock’s filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, the number of BTC whales has increased 1.6%, reversing a short-term downtrend that began on May 20.  The distribution of supply among whales implies differing levels of confidence.  Investors holding 1,000-10,000 BTC have risen 90,396 BTC (2% higher), since June 14. A similar gain occurred among investors holding more than 100,000 BTC. Their supply grew by 3% (107,883 BTC).  But since June 14, the supply of BTC for investors holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC has fallen 10% (184,153 BTC). This group views risk differently and has less confidence in bitcoin than the other two whale cohorts.  As the macroeconomic environment comes into focus, investors should monitor which cohort made the more profitable decision.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/06/fomc-minutes-show-uncertainty-cautious-optimism-large-bitcoin-investors-are-taking-divergent-paths,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/315872bf58d6f92840362266b5666a1aa1f77cdf-2992x3992.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419951,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjHh,1688679743,Lightning Labs Unveils Bitcoin Tools for AI,"Add this to the list of tasks that artificial intelligence (AI) is now capable of: Sending bitcoin.  AI applications like OpenAI’s GPT series can now hold, send and receive bitcoin (BTC) using a suite of new tools that Lightning infrastructure firm Lightning Labs unveiled on Thursday.  The AI industry exploded in popularity after the viral debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT last November. Open AI is an artificial intelligence research company and ChatGPT is one of its advanced chatbots that garnered more than 100 million users a mere two months after launching. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) – a piece of software that gets trained on large data sets and can then generate human-like text in response to user prompts.  Read more: MicroStrategy’s Saylor Integrates Bitcoin Lightning Address Into Corporate Email  Lightning Labs says one glaring problem with current LLMs is the lack of a native Internet-based payment mechanism for them to use. This forces AI platforms to rely on outdated payment methods like credit cards and pass on the costs of using such methods to end users, limiting use cases and reducing general access to AI software.  Enter Lightning – a second-layer payment network for cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions.  Lightning Labs says bitcoin is the Internet’s native currency, and the company has built tools that integrate high-volume bitcoin micropayments via Lightning with popular AI software libraries like LangChain. Incorporating Lightning into popular LLMs will not only make software deployment cheaper, it will also increase the depth of possible use cases for AI, according to the company.  “We are in the realm of enabling use cases that weren't previously possible,” Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk.  One interesting use case floated by the firm is the ability to create software that can charge for application programming interface (API) access. APIs allow different pieces of software to communicate.  In a post by Lightning Labs, the authors give an example of a piece of AI software or agent that queries another agent on a paid basis. The querying agent would be designed to pay for API access to the agent being queried, but additional payments would only go through after a satisfactory response was provided.  “A user can sell a prompt by gating access to an API capable of responding to queries,” the post states. “Potential buyers can then ask their own local agent to evaluate the response given a set of criteria. If the agent approves of the response, then further responses can be purchased.”  Despite ChatGPT’s phenomenal success, Michael Levin, who leads product growth at Lightning Labs, predicted in a tweet that chatbots and their user interfaces (UIs) are only the beginning. He says the lion’s share of use cases will be in yet-to-be-discovered enterprise and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.  “Chat UIs are just the tip of the iceberg for LLM usage,” Levin tweeted. “Ninety percent of use cases lie beyond this initial foray. The most useful products won’t be chat UIs, but SaaS/Enterprise/API products built on LLMs to uniquely solve user problems.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/06/lightning-labs-unveils-bitcoin-tools-for-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c6fc34f5543680647c42ac124fe258257cc1ecf-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14591173,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541623,1688675400,"UAE Share In Global Mining Activity Grows, Accounts For 3.7% Of Mined Bitcoin","According to the latest report by Hashrate Index, a website for Bitcoin mining data and metrics, the UAE is now becoming a growing destination for Bitcoin miners, especially in the Middle East. Bitcoin Miners Look For Greener Pastures Bitcoin miners have faced issues in popular Bitcoin mining countries like China and Kazakhstan in recent years. As a result, many of these miners have been forced to look for new operational hubs. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why Mining Bitcoin is a difficult process, both financially and in terms of the amount of electricity required. It involves using powerful computers to solve complex math problems in order to get rewarded with BTC. This energy requirement is part of the reason why miners have run into problems in various jurisdictions over the years. However, the Middle East is now emerging as a prime destination for Bitcoin miners, and the UAE is leading the charge among these energy-rich countries. The United Arab Emirates is helping to pave the path for the future of Bitcoin mining with its increased availability of affordable electricity, favorable access to funding, and politically stable and business-friendly climate. During the past year-and-a-half, some major mining companies signed agreements and entered partnerships with the digital asset arm of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund (Zero Two) to create two giga projects that put the UAE on the global bitcoin mining map. As a result, the biggest amount was spent on a single Bitcoin mining site, with an investment totaling $2 billion. Now, it seems these large-scale projects are starting to cement the UAE as a serious player in the Bitcoin mining niche. According to the data provided by the Hashrate Index, bitcoin miners in the UAE should produce approximately 13 EH/s, which is equivalent to 3.7% of the total Bitcoin hash rate at an assumed average energy efficiency of 30 J/TH. BTC price recovers from Thursday crash | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com UAE Aims To Become A Global Crypto Hub The UAE government aims to establish the country as a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Several recent initiatives show the country is serious about becoming a leader in this emerging industry. With government backing, relaxed rules, and major companies setting up offices, the building blocks are in place. Earlier this year, the country announced that it is launching a ‘free zone’ for crypto firms called the RAK Digital Assets Oasis (RAK DAO), allowing them to own 100% of their companies. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transactions Jump Over 50% As ETH Eyes $2,000 The future looks bright for Bitcoin mining in the UAE. The country’s share in the global Bitcoin mining metric should continue to grow as more mining firms are drawn to the region. However, considering the hot climate of the region when compared to big Bitcoin mining regions like Texas and Russia, the temperature could be challenging for mining. Also, the report shows that the only way to mine Bitcoin in a scalable and legally sustainable way in the country is by partnering with a government entity.

Whale Alert reported a sum of 25,264 ETH, roughly valued at around $48 million, was moved from an unidentified wallet to the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. 🚨 🚨 25,264 #ETH (48,302,924 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/ViF7z23ixe — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 6, 2023 Analyzing The Potential Impact While these large transfers can, on occasion, herald an upcoming uptrend, they can also imply a short-term surge in volatility. Particularly, such movements can be used to discern possible price sentiment changes. Related Reading: Ethereum Continues Uptrend As Staked ETH Soars To New High In addition to the 25,264 ETH transferred, another substantial transaction of 30,000 ETH was also noted. This amount was relocated from an anonymous wallet to OKEX, another prominent crypto exchange. 🚨 🚨 🚨 30,000 #ETH (57,687,950 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #OKExhttps://t.co/ENxRwsJMLh — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 6, 2023 Notably, as with any financial market, the crypto industry is impacted by many factors, with ‘whale’ movements being just one of them. While they can potentially influence price sentiment, other elements, such as broader market trends, global economic indicators, and investor sentiment, should also be considered for a holistic market understanding. Ethereum Latest Price Action Thiese Ethereum transactions come at a time when ETH has been trading between an intra-day high of $1,957.35 and an intra-day low of $1,872.94. At the time of writing, Ethereum has only seen a slight decline of 1.4% in the past day, with a market price of $1,884. This modest plunge indicates whales might not have moved or sold just a small amount of the ETH deposited. Notably, a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity holding a large amount of a cryptocurrency. This individual or entity has the potential to influence the market due to the sizeable volume of its holdings. When such transfers occur, they can create waves in the market and often signal potential price shifts.

42419956,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjLp,1688671161,Welcome to the NEW Crypto for Advisors Newsletter,"Crypto for Advisors is changing. I'm Sarah Morton, the new editor of this newsletter. Think of me as your tour guide on an ongoing journey through the evolving crypto ecosystem. I'm here to curate timely, relevant and thought-provoking content as well as answer pressing questions that clients ask. But first: Why me?  My learning journey into the world of crypto started more than six years ago. I was drawn to blockchain technologies and the new opportunities driven by what we now call the new digital money (aka ""crypto"") for the finance industry. This journey led me to co-found MeetAmi Innovations, where we work daily with advisors, financial professionals and various digital asset community players to understand their challenges in answering client questions related to investing in crypto and digital assets.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  There is no question that current and next-generation investors are interested in digital assets (cryptocurrencies, tokens, smart contracts, and other digital representations of value). Just yesterday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested: ""Bitcoin could revolutionize finance."" If he’s right, it would amplify demand from investors (recently surveyed by BCG) and their financial advisors for guidance on how to think about investing in this emerging asset class. And it's not a simple answer.  Recent news adds to the complexity. In just the past couple of months  The SEC has sued high-profile crypto Exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  A bevy of financial companies applied for bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S.  Globally, the U.K. and Hong Kong made bold moves toward becoming digital asset financial hubs.  A recent Coinbase study showed that over 50% of Fortune 100 companies have started crypto, blockchain and Web3 projects. Such studies raise bigger questions like: How will these advancements affect digital assets? How will advisors navigate the complexities and rapidly changing nature of digital assets?  Advisors have a significant opportunity to support today's clients and meet the needs of the next generation of investors – as long as they have a roadmap to navigate the digital-asset landscape.  This newsletter is here to help point the way. Each week Crypto for Advisors will share thought leadership from the industry, answer common and pressing questions from clients, and point to resources to better understand this rapidly evolving asset class.  If you have questions for our advisor network – or have topics you'd like to see covered – simply reply to this email, and we’ll try to answer them in future newsletters.  Thanks for subscribing – your readership means a lot to us.  Ask an Advisor  I educate financial advisors about digital assets. Here are the three most common questions they ask about digital asset investing.  – Adam Blumberg  Q: Is investing in digital assets secure? I’ve heard of people losing all their money.  A: It can be secure if you know how to hold the assets and do your homework regarding custody.  Digital assets and crypto are based on self-custody, meaning I hold my own assets in my own wallet(s).  However, we often use centralized custodians – such as an exchange – to hold assets for ourselves and clients, as they take on much of the technology's heavy lifting. For both you and your clients, it’s important that you research the custodian to ensure they don’t commingle assets and are solvent.  Q: Do digital assets have real value?  A: Each crypto asset has its own value proposition and investment thesis. For example, bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, government and banks. Ether is used to run applications on the Ethereum network. Other tokens derive their value from cash flows.  Advisors should understand some of the investment theses and value drivers of various crypto assets to properly evaluate them for client portfolios.  Q: What are the risks of investing in digital assets?  A: We’ve already talked a bit about custodial risk. Cryptocurrencies are also volatile, which poses allocation risks in client portfolios, especially with clients who may need liquidity. Many of the projects and protocols the tokens represent carry their own risks, which can be deeply technical and complicated to understand.  We don’t expect advisors to evaluate all the risks on their own, and we’re seeing more models and services which help determine crypto-asset risks as they relate to client portfolios.

14587743,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541605,1688668255,Glassnode Co-Founder Predicts Bull Run For Bitcoin Amidst Sideways Trading,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a narrow range for the past 12 days. Nonetheless, the fact that bulls have held the crucial $30,000 support level is seen as a short-term win for them. Even though BTC has been experiencing sideways trading, there is a growing sense of optimism that it has the potential to break through upper resistance zones and reach new highs. BTC’s Sideways Trading Sets Stage For Bullish Momentum? According to Yan Alleman, the co-founder of blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s recent sideways trading has paved the way for potential bullish momentum shortly. BTC’s current range-bound trading between $31,200 and $29,600 is seen as a consolidation period allowing for a re-establishment of bullish momentum in the market. To assess market sentiment and potential price movements in the Bitcoin market, Glassnode has developed a proprietary metric called the Swissblock Risk Signal. This metric considers various factors, including volatility, on-chain activity, social sentiment, and more. Related Reading: CFTC Investigators Conclude Celsius And Former CEO Violated Rules, Potential Case Looms In the context of Alleman’s analysis, the Swissblock Risk Signal has remained stable at 0, as seen in the chart below, which suggests that the current market sentiment is neutral, with no clear dominance from either buyers or sellers. This could indicate that the market is in a consolidation phase, as buyers and sellers are cautious before making any significant moves. Additionally, Alleman predicts that BTC will likely break above $31,200, providing a strong foundation for buyers to target resistance levels at $33,000 and $34,800. However, even if the support at $29,600 were to break, Alleman believes that remaining bullish until the 50% retracement level near $28,200 seems viable. This pullback could represent an opportunity for investors to accumulate BTC for the next leap as the market shows signs of potential growth. As such, Alleman’s analysis suggests that the current market conditions present a favorable opportunity for those looking to invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Faces Critical Moment Bitcoin is facing a critical moment as its price fluctuates within a narrow range, warns market analyst Michael Van de Poppe. With Bitcoin’s lows being taken again, Van de Poppe believes that if it fails to recover soon, it could test support at $28,500. Adding to Bitcoin’s challenges is the expectation of a rate hike due to positive unemployment data. This leads to increased speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than expected. This could create a more challenging economic environment for cryptocurrencies. If both major resistance lines of $29,600 and $28,500 give in to pressure, a potential bull run in the short term could be in danger, potentially resulting in a retracement down to the $27,500 resistance level. This would represent a 9% pullback from the current level of $30,200. Related Reading: Marathon Digital Reports 21% Decline In Bitcoin Production In June If such a scenario were to occur, it could take time for Bitcoin bulls to regain their current levels. In the past, a period of consolidation has typically followed a pullback before any further continuation to regain lost levels. However, despite Bitcoin’s challenges, as long as it can hold the $30,000 line, BTC bulls have the upper hand. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $30,200, down a slight 0.3% in the last 24 hours.

But the excitement was short-lived, as most new memecoins that emerged in that timeframe have gone back to oblivion, but there’s Pepe (PEPE) with some exciting narratives working in its favor. While the memecoin hype dies down, Uwerx also has taken center stage in the market with impressive presale rounds. Read on to learn the potential it has to grow massive and how you can take advantage of the presale for profit: Pepe (PEPE) Hype Train is Down Pepe (PEPE) is impressive as a new memecoin considering the rallying strength it exhibited in just some weeks after emerging. PEPE moved to become a $1.8 billion market cap project in just two weeks, but the hype train is dying. There’s only so much a project can do in a bear market, and PEPE holders can now wait for the bull market to launch another full-blown rally. The Pepe (PEPE) community is growing, and in the past few weeks, the memecoin craze has been shipped to other blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is fairly new to memecoins. Pepe as a meme had existed way before it got a derived cryptocurrency, but now crypto enthusiasts are confident that it can flip Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the biggest memecoin in the market. Pepe (PEPE) has fallen to around $600 million market cap, and with the prospects of passing Dogecoin ($10 million market cap) and Shiba Inu ($5 billion market cap), that’s some 10x - 20x potential to look forward to. We could see such happen in a bull market considering Shiba Inu(SHIB) once pulled it off against Dogecoin (DOGE). However, memecoins always remain a risky play, and if you want to get a crypto asset with less risk, then you should be learning more about Uwerx. Uwerx (WERX) Gaining Momentum on Presale Uwerx is a decentralized freelance platform looking to help democratize the freelance economy and create more value for active participants, including freelancers, clients, and other businesses worldwide that find the global gig market valuable. A report from Forbes has shown top companies like Google, Meta, and Unilever were able to create workforce synergy between full-time employees and freelancers, and the results were impressive. With this level of attention coming to the gig market, Uwerx might just be the most valuable solution the landscape has seen. For a start, Uwerx charges only 1% on contracts established on the platform. Uwerx also enables a host of blockchain-enabled features like incentivization, community governance, transparent pricing, personalized matching, and some special collaboration tools. Uwerx is a Web3 platform but will be as intuitive as any existing freelance platform. WERX will be the native token of the platform and will power utility and governance. WERX is selling for cheap on presale at $0.047725, and this opportunity only lasts for a short while. This week, a presale is launching a fully interactive prototype, which will include registration pages for freelancers and clients. Moreover, the much-anticipated feature, the Uwerx Vault, is set to be revealed next week. To decide the date for the test airdrop, a poll will be carried out. Take the opportunity to join the WERX presale with the links below and enjoy a 15% bonus on your purchase.

Both have gained traction during the recent banking crisis, in which several high-profile banks collapsed. However, their reliance on the U.S. dollar could potentially cause issues in the future. If inflation continues to rise throughout financial markets, both Gemini Dollar and Tether could struggle in the DeFi space. At the same time, new projects like Tradecurve are making waves in the DeFi space. Tradecurve has raised $3 million during its presale, and following an 80% surge in value, analysts now believe that an additional 40% price rise could be on the table. Tether Makes A Huge Investment In Bitcoin Mining As the world's number one most traded cryptocurrency, Tether is considered an extremely safe crypto investment. The project recently invested $1 billion into a new Bitcoin mining farm in El Salvador. This investment is designed to help create an eco-friendly mining solution, with Tether offering expertise in green energy alternatives. This particular farm will utilize Volcano energy to produce 241 MW of power and will also install photovoltaic cells to produce solar energy. This investment is a huge development in the Tether ecosystem, and has helped to solidify the project's reputation. As Tether continues to invest in DeFi, its popularity is only going to grow, which has made Tether the number one option for investors looking to buy stablecoins, Gemini Dollar Trading Volume Surges Gemini Dollar is an alternative to Tether with a number of benefits. It’s been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, which makes it a safe investment despite the recent SEC lawsuits. Furthermore, Gemini Dollar has been audited by Trail of Bits Inc. Gemini Dollar is also a stable investment due to being pegged to the U.S. Dollar. As of July 2023, Gemini Dollar has a daily trading volume of $1.8 million, a significant increase from June. This increase suggests that more investors are looking for stable investments, with Gemini Dollar becoming a top option in the process. Tradecurve Attracts Thousands Of New Investors Although Tradecurve may not be as stable as Gemini Dollar or Tether, the project offers significantly higher returns. Since its presale started, Tradecurve has raised over $3 million and offered investors returns of 80%. This ROI is expected to increase again soon, with stage four of the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale already 60% sold out. Tradecurve offers an exciting new alternative to traditional investing. Its hybrid exchange lets investors buy the widest range of assets of any platform, including traditional and DeFi options. Assets such as commodities, forex, and CFDs can be traded by investors who can use cryptocurrency as collateral. Furthermore, as a decentralized platform, all of these assets can be traded anonymously. Tradecurve lets investors trade assets without needing to pass KYC or intrusive background checks. This is expected to be a big selling point for the project, as thousands of investors left centralized platforms following lawsuits from the SEC in June. Tradecurve Is Predicted To 100x Post Presale Tradecurve is now ranked among the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the DeFi market. Its value has continuously increased in June, and now experts believe its value could 50x before its presale ends. Post presale, price predictions are going as high as 100x once TCRV tokens are listed on major exchanges. With such high price predictions, Tradecurve’s current price of $0.018 is believed to be a huge bargain, though, with hundreds of investors buying tokens daily, TCRV is expected to increase in value again before mid-July.

14586061,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541590,1688664639,Dormant Bitcoin Supply Peaks As Institutional Investors Show Increased Involvement,"According to recent hedge fund Ark Invest data, a historical amount of the Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for at least a year, with roughly 70% of the circulating supply unmoved in June 2023. Despite looming economic uncertainty, this dynamic occurs alongside a surge in institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. In June, several factors contributed to the increased robustness of the Bitcoin price action. Ark Invest, a renowned asset management firm, highlighted this trend in its recent Bitcoin report. Their data sheds light on the risen support from steadfast holders and a noticeable shift in institutional sentiment towards Bitcoin. Bitcoin Holder Base Strength According to Ark Invest’s analysis, around 70% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply has not changed hands for at least one year. This statistic signifies an increase in the confidence of long-term Bitcoin investors, contributing to a sturdier holder base. As seen in the chart below, there has been a spike in Over-the-Counter Transactions (OTC) that hint at growing institutional demand. A one-year high was seen in the balance of BTC held on over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, typically used as a gauge for institutional activity. The 60% increase in the OTC Bitcoin balance by quarter-end insinuates that institutions and capital allocators are concentrating more on Bitcoin as an investment avenue. The report stated the following: In our view, increased balances on OTC desks suggest that institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on bitcoin. Meanwhile, diverging trends were noted between USDC and Tether, two prominent stablecoins. While USDC’s supply shrunk by 37% year-to-date, Tether’s supply increased by 25%, hitting a record high in June. Ark Invest attributes this divergence to the uncertain U.S. regulatory climate, which might drive some crypto activity overseas. Rising Institutional Activity Amid Market Dynamics An interesting development in June was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount reduction went from 42% to 30% following BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) filing. According to Ark Invest’s report, this lower discount implies market anticipation for a Bitcoin spot ETF approval, subsequently enhancing the possibility of GBTC transitioning into an ETF. Ark Invest’s report cautioned about potential economic challenges despite these positive indications. According to the Purchasing Managers ‘ Index, manufacturing sector data suggests a plunge in new orders. Concurrently, the U.S. Gross Domestic Income (GDI) shows signs of contraction, indicating the possibility of an impending recession. BTC is trading above $30,000, following its recovery from last month when its value dipped below that. The asset’s downturn was largely spurred by a legal challenge launched by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase, the two foremost crypto exchanges. Related Reading: Analyst’s Forecast: Bitcoin (BTC) To Hit $310,000 If This Happens Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s recent rally comes on the heels of endorsement from heavyweight financial institutions such as BlackRock.

42419952,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjIj,1688664021,Thank BlackRock’s Clients for Larry Fink’s Change of Heart,"On the same day the The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released minutes from its June meeting, the CEO of the largest asset management firm in the world went on television to talk about how bitcoin could “revolutionize finance.”  Somehow not a typo.  Yes. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), went to the Fox Business studio for an interview yesterday and sang bitcoin’s praises. This is the same Larry Fink who said in 2017 that Bitcoin was an “index of money laundering.” Fink went further and said that bitcoin is an “international asset not based on any one currency … that people can play as an alternative” in the context of discussion around inflation hedges and geopolitical risk hedges.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s minutes released yesterday afternoon have been interpreted as hawkish, meaning that although job gains were robust and GDP was growing (albeit modestly) there were still too many jobs and too much inflation. Most markets didn’t like that, with more restrictive monetary policy on the horizon, and spent most of Thursday on a down trend.  What’s the big deal?  We’ve all been inundated with headline after headline after headline about BlackRock and its Bitcoin ETF and its competitors’ ETFs and the like. It’s exhausting but there’s a big reason for this. This is a dramatic shift in the narrative.  Read more: A Straightforward Explanation for Why Financial Giants Want to Issue a Spot Bitcoin ETF | Opinion  Bitcoin believers have been calling bitcoin “digital gold” or “gold 2.0” for a while. To hear it mentioned as such by one of the most authoritative voices in finance is meaningful. Inflation hedges are treated as inflation hedges mostly because we, collectively, say it is an inflation hedge and the supply of that asset cannot be artificially increased or decreased on a whim.  But there’s more. Here’s the full interview quote from Fink:  Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.  Now that is crazy.  Fink went full “bitcoin bro.”  This adds on yet another narrative to the “digital gold” narrative. Bitcoin is money without a nation. It’s neutral money that can be used to hedge against things like the currency devaluation we’re seeing in countries like Lebanon. Again, these aren’t new narratives or talking points. But it is for BlackRock. And, like mentioned above, it's a complete reversal of a position.  Naturally, we all want to know why the firm flip-flopped and there’s a simple explanation (aside from BlackRock simply wanting to make money by issuing its Bitcoin ETF).  BlackRock’s clients are getting skittish about the economy. Inflation has run amok, interest rates have increased twenty-fold, entire banks have failed and there are worries of impending recession. Those clients, which include big money players like insurance companies, pension funds and high-net worth individuals, are interested in protecting their money as we enter a period where the perpetual equities bull market might finally come to an abrupt halt as the macro environment deteriorates.  And as conversations about protecting money have come up, surely gold has been discussed given its history. Evidently, so has bitcoin. This idea that bitcoin could act as an inflation hedge with absolute, provable scarcity has been pounded into the heads of people as a possibility by bitcoin acolytes.  And so too has the need to protect against geopolitical risk come to the forefront with war raging in Ukraine. Neutral bitcoin could potentially help there as well. As such, enough clients have mentioned bitcoin to get BlackRock to take it seriously.  The client is always right, and since clients seemingly want bitcoin, who is BlackRock or Larry Fink to deny the client? It didn’t become a $10 trillion asset manager by not listening to them.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/06/thank-blackrocks-clients-for-larry-finks-change-of-heart,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b479c7b3d9756b9dbef0a39c290674fbdab95593-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This type of instrument is index-based and used for providing retrocessional reinsurance protection to property reinsurers. In this program, Nayms provides coverage for US named windstorm, attaching above a loss trigger of $60 billion. The basic structure aligns with other ILWs, but Nayms innovates on the traditional approach by using USD Coin (USDC) as the collateral within the segregated account on its independently audited Ethereum smart contract, and by securing that collateral through new mechanisms and concepts, including a digital multi-signature process, for enhanced transparency and efficiency. “This deal demonstrates so nicely the benefits of our business model and technology for a broad range of parties and opportunities. Notably, insureds gain access to alternative capital and investors can earn a return on their crypto that is fully regulated yet not correlated to most other financial instruments,” observed Dr. David Verbeeten, Chief Commercial Officer at Nayms. The purchaser is Prospero Re, a Bermuda insurer, wholly owned by Resolute Global Partners, with a strong commitment to innovation.

The firm's revenue sank in 2022 amid the wider downturn in the digital asset market, according to the report, citing a person familiar with its finances. Autograph has laid off more than 50 employees, Insider reported in May and the Times confirmed in its report.  Brady co-founded Autograph in 2021 with the aim of helping celebrities sell NFTs to their fans. The firm raised $170 million in Series B funding at the start of last year. The company is now, however, shifting to a broader focus on helping celebs foster loyalty with their fans and has removed some crypto language from its marketing, according to the Times.  Tom Brady's crypto reputation has taken a hit from his endorsement of FTX, from whom he had accepted around $30 million worth of shares as part of his role as a brand ambassador for the now-bankrupt exchange. Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX such as his ex-wife Gisele Bundchen and basketball star Stephen Curry are also now being sued by FTX investors for allegedly misleading them.

The investigation, conducted by attorneys in the CFTC’s enforcement unit, revealed that Celsius misled investors and failed to register with the regulatory body. If the majority of the CFTC’s commissioners agree with these findings, the agency could file a case in federal court as early as this month. Celsius Reportedly Misled Investors, Lack Of Registration Surfaces The findings of the investigation shed light on the actions of Celsius and its former CEO, raising questions about their compliance with regulatory requirements. It is alleged that Celsius engaged in deceptive practices and failed to provide accurate information to investors. Related Reading: Valkyrie Follows In BlackRock’s Footsteps, Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF By misleading investors, the lending platform potentially put their funds at risk and undermined market transparency. Furthermore, the failure to register with the CFTC raises concerns about the company’s adherence to regulatory oversight. The independent examiner appointed during Celsius’ bankruptcy case further shed light on the company’s operations. The examiner found that Celsius had operated in a manner similar to a Ponzi scheme, which raised concerns about the company’s business practices and its impact on investors. This finding adds weight to the allegations against Celsius and strengthens the case for regulatory action. CEL token struggles at $0.15 | Source: CELUSD on TradingView.com The potential case against Celsius and its ex-CEO has significant implications for the crypto industry and regulatory enforcement. If the CFTC proceeds with the lawsuit, it would signal a strong stance on holding companies accountable for their actions and ensuring investor protection in the cryptocurrency market. When Celsius filed for voluntary bankruptcy in July 2022, the lending company reportedly owed between $1 billion and $10 billion to creditors. The case is currently ongoing at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Implications For The Crypto Industry And Regulatory Enforcement The allegations against Celsius and its former CEO highlight the need for increased regulatory scrutiny and oversight in the crypto sector. As the market continues to grow and attract more participants, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines and enforce compliance to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why Nevertheless, the potential case against Celsius demonstrates the commitment of regulatory authorities to uphold these standards and address violations that occur within the industry.

Fitting somewhere in the middle of the debate between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s New York Innovation Center (NYIC), which has collaborated on the project since last year, concluded that “the network has the potential to deliver improvements in the processing of wholesale payments due to its ability to synchronize U.S. dollar-denominated payments and facilitate settlement on a near-real time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis.”  “From a central banking perspective, the proof of concept was conducive to exploring tokenized regulated deposits and understanding the potential functional benefits of central bank and commercial bank digital money operating together on a shared ledger,” said Per von Zelowitz, director of the NYIC, in a statement. The center added that it's not endorsing the approach, and its work doesn't reflect any position of the Federal Reserve.  The theoretical payment network experimented with transactions in commercial bank deposit tokens, settling with hypothetical wholesale CBDCs on the same platform and using a shared ledger. It also looked at wholesale movement of U.S. dollars across borders. The network cut some of the friction over ""speed, cost, off-hours availability, and the settlement process"" for payments, according to the group's proof-of-concept released Thursday.  The participants – also including Mastercard, PNC Bank, Swift, TD Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo – haven't committed to any next steps with the experiment, they said.  Raj Dhamodharan, an executive vice president at Mastercard, posted a Tweet that called the effort ""an important exploration into how shared ledger technology and the regulated financial system can come together to deliver dynamic, safe and efficient payments solutions.""  The Federal Reserve is on the verge of starting its long-awaited FedNow real-time payments system in the U.S., which is meant to allow banking customers' transactions to clear right away rather than over the course of a couple of days.

In the spring of 2022, the pop star discussed a deal with FTX worth as much as $100 million that potentially included sponsorship of a tour.  Swift signed the sponsorship agreement with FTX following more than six months of discussions but in the end, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pulled out of the deal, according to the New York Times, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. The decision left Swift's team frustrated and disappointed, according to two of the people.  A lawyer suing celebrities who had endorsed FTX had previously said on a podcast that Swift had done due diligence the crypto exchange, asking it to prove that its cryptocurrencies were not unregistered securities, which led her to reject the deal. This led to multiple stories praising Swift’s business intelligence.  Taylor Swift's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.

Dubbed the 8020 Initiative, the proposal aims to address the lack of liquidity in DeFi by creating a two-asset pool comprising a governance token and a chain's base token or a liquid stablecoin. According to Balancer, such a structure will allow holders to participate in protocol governance while also providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges.  Arbitrum-based DeFi lender Radiant Capital has joined the 8020 Initiative alongside Alchemix, Paraswap, Y2K Finance and Oath Finance, according to a series of tweets from each of the protocols on Thursday. They join lending protocol Aave, which elected to implement the initiative in 2021.  In a Medium post, Balancer said the current ""single asset staking model is outdated,"" adding that it ""incentivizes mercenary capital"" and ""increases token volatility and slippage."" Slippage refers to the difference between a trade’s expected price and the price at which the trade is executed.  In order to participate in protocol governance at the moment, token holders must stake the protocol's native token, which reduces the circulating supply and capital on decentralized exchanges. Under the new model, holders can stake Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs), allowing them to take part in governance proposals while the underlying protocol's token remains in the pool to provide liquidity to swaps.

In the report released yesterday, Marathon revealed that its Bitcoin production decreased by 21% from May due to weather-related issues in Texas and a decline in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. “We produced 979 bitcoin in June, down 21% from last month and up 599% from June 2022,” said the Company’s CEO, Fried Theil. “The decreased production relative to last month was due to weather-related curtailment in Texas and a significant decrease in transaction fees, which fell to approximately 5.1% of the total bitcoin we earned in June compared to 11.8% in May,” Theil added. The Marathon boss noted that the rise of the Bitcoin ordinals contributed to an increase in network fees back in May, and although network congestion decreased in June, he stated that the mining company is quite optimistic about the future of mining economics. Marathon’s Operational Hash Rate Boosts By 16% Marathon’s monthly report revealed that the mining company’s operational hash rate gained by 16% in June, rising to 17.2 exahashes/second (EH/s). Its installed hash rate also increased to 21.8 EH/a, representing an 8% gain in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Continues To Slip, Holders Not Interested In Selling? According to its CEO, Marathon remains committed to its goal of attaining 23 EH/s by boosting its operations in North Dakota and Texas, as emphasized by its CEO. Theil said: The final steps to achieving our 23 EH/s goal are in Ellendale, ND and Garden City, TX. The final building in Ellendale is expected to come online this month, and final Garden City tie in is also expected within that same period. Theil also announced that the company’s joint venture with Zero Two in Abu Dhabi began operations last week and is expected to achieve a hash rate of 7 EH/s before the end of the year. However, this JV operation does not contribute to the reported operational hash rate of 17.2 EH/s and the mining target of 23 EH/s.

42419966,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjXB,1688657400,Will 2023 Be the Year of the Bitcoin ETF?,"Excitement over the hoped-for approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is back again. This time, financial giant BlackRock’s entrance to the race for an ETF has spurred hope that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the long-awaited product, a decade after the crypto industry first sought to launch a bitcoin ETF.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Spot ETF hopes  The narrative  In July 2013, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Eleven years later, the industry is still waiting for a spot bitcoin product.  Why it matters  A bitcoin ETF would, if approved, allow a broad swath of retail investors in the U.S. gain exposure to bitcoin as an asset without having to go through the trouble of setting up a wallet or dealing with sometimes finicky crypto exchanges. Furthermore, sophisticated investors like multimillion-dollar family offices would be able to invest in a regulated (and therefore “safe”) bitcoin product. Those are some of the reasons advocates want to see an ETF okayed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Breaking it down  Well over two years ago, the Ontario Securities Commission approved the first North American bitcoin exchange-traded fund, sparking hope that an American product might soon be approved as well. Later in 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first bitcoin futures ETF, opening the door to several other similar products.  As of right now, there's still no spot bitcoin ETF trading in the U.S., but BlackRock’s filing a few weeks ago signaled to the industry that the time may be coming when that changes. Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen half a dozen new applications for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Has the market evolved enough to support an ETF, and can companies provide the SEC with enough assurances that an ETF would be safe?  The major difference we’re seeing now is these applicants are spending more time talking about their surveillance-sharing agreements (with some prompting from the SEC). Coinbase will be the marketplace for all of the major would-be ETF issuers that have identified a partner so far – namely, Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, on behalf of BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck and others.  The SEC has brought up surveillance-sharing agreements in the past. In 2019, the regulator published a 112-page order explaining its rejection of a bitcoin ETF application from Bitwise, saying the bitcoin market had too much potential for manipulation and there needed to be a “surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size relating to the underlying assets” to deter any potential manipulation.  One problem is there's no clear definition for what a regulated market of significant size is, said James Seyffart, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence who’s followed bitcoin ETF applications for years.  “Usually, every time they delay all the way through and then they deny them. In that process, they sometimes give comments,” Seyffart said. “Some of it is going to be behind closed doors ... some of that is undoubtedly going to happen.”  Coinbase is undoubtedly the largest U.S. crypto exchange. According to CoinGecko, it has more than twice the 24-hour trading volume (when normalized) overall when compared to its closest competitor, Kraken. The bulk of that appears to come from its bitcoin market.  The SEC has even acknowledged Coinbase’s role in the U.S., saying it is “one of the largest crypto asset trading platforms in the world and the largest in the United States” in its lawsuit against the exchange.  The SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase has nothing to do with its bitcoin market, which I’m guessing is also one of the reasons these companies are looking to the exchange as their surveillance-sharing agreement partner.  The open question is whether the SEC will agree that Coinbase operates a regulated bitcoin market of significant size – and whether that’s necessary for an approval.  Last year, the regulator didn’t seem to think that there was any regulated market for bitcoin. Specifically, when it approved Teucrium’s bitcoin futures ETF in April 2022, the SEC wrote that “spot bitcoin markets are not currently ‘regulated,’” in a footnote explaining why surveillance-sharing agreements for bitcoin futures market wouldn’t work for spot ETFs.  Meanwhile, the BlackRock/Nasdaq filing argues that there doesn’t need to be a significant, regulated market in the first place, pointing to past ETF rejections.  “The regulated market of significant size test does not require that the spot bitcoin market be regulated in order for the Commission to approve this proposal, and precedent makes clear that an underlying market for a spot commodity or currency being a regulated market would actually be an exception to the norm,” the filing said. “These largely unregulated currency and commodity markets do not provide the same protections as the markets that are subject to the Commission’s oversight, but the Commission has consistently looked to surveillance sharing agreements with the underlying futures market in order to determine whether such products were consistent with the Act.”  The bitcoin futures market should be enough for the SEC’s “significant size” test, the filing said.

42419967,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGjV7,1688657258,Towards a More Responsible AI,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is experiencing an unprecedented wave of interest and adoption. This has been driven in no small part by ChatGPT’s release, along with a subsequent tide of similar, AI-powered applications. Businesses and consumers are using (and talking about) AI on an unprecedented scale. Formerly the domain of futurists and sci-fi writers, AI has firmly planted itself in the mainstream consciousness.  AI has long raised fears of a “Skynet” scenario, the “automated defense network” dreamed up by James Cameron for the Terminator franchise. Initially hailed as a new order of intelligence, Skynet’s AI-powered algorithm quickly went rogue, determined that all humans were a threat, launched a nuclear war that eliminated most of the population and subsequently enslaved the rest. Were it not for a series of ex-machina-inspired heroics from a small-but-fierce band of rebels (and Arnold, of course) that would’ve been it for the fate of humanity.  Mrinal Manohar is CEO and co-founder at Casper Labs, providing professional services to organizations building on the Casper Blockchain.  While this remains an unlikely reality, it’s far more plausible today than when the film was released nearly 40 years ago – and it’s a topic we can no longer afford to ignore. Over the past decade, generative AI systems have made remarkable progress around image recognition, reading comprehension and language understanding, to the point where they can credibly mimic, and eventually surpass, human capabilities. While most AI development to date has focused on training large language models to generate text, the rapid pace of innovation with no real oversight poses a viable concern.  AI’s potential applications, from realizing elusive medical breakthroughs to plugging acute labor shortages to more effectively combating climate change, is incredibly exciting. Reaching it, though, is contingent on providing the appropriate guardrails for a largely untested and powerful technology – a role that blockchain technology is uniquely suited to play.  Debunking a common myth around AI and blockchain  While AI currently consumes our collective hive mind, it’s worth remembering that this was the conversation happening around blockchain just several years ago. Like any breakthrough technology, this marked blockchain’s “peak of inflated expectations,” as outlined in Gartner’s Hype Cycle model. While the ensuing period has seen a cooling of public enthusiasm, the technological principles that guided the initial wave of hype remain – and blockchain is realizing historically high adoption rates among businesses. The foundation for collaborative opportunities between blockchain and AI are myriad, with exciting and transformational potential.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - AI Crypto Trading Bots Are the New ‘Edge’ – For Now  As early and promising applications in fields including human resources, robotics and customer service take hold, it’s worth remembering that we’re still wrapping our heads around what AI’s ultimate potential can look like. Already, there are important lessons for its future adoption curve. Blockchain and AI are not orthogonal technologies; they’re actually complementary. Together, they can drive massive new efficiencies for organizations in a transparent and ethical manner that would make even the stoic John Connor crack a smile.  Breaking through AI’s black box  Let’s first define what AI ultimately is: a data model that receives continual inputs and keeps training (and re-training) itself. It does so in a black box: we can’t see what data it’s ingesting, nor how it’s adapting. Sometimes it will start doing completely unexpected things, often termed as “hallucinations,” that baffle even its creators. New York Times columnist Kevin Roose provided a compelling example of this when a seemingly innocuous feature on Bing’s new search engine devolved into a creepy exchange with a bot that was seemingly trying to sabotage his marriage.  There are many other examples of this playing out at increasingly frequent cadence.  Blockchain and AI are not orthogonal technologies; they’re actually complementary  In March, many of the world’s leading AI researchers published a letter encouraging companies to at least temporarily pause their work on AI, citing the need to better understand the ramifications of empowering models that will soon exceed our own collective intelligence. The letter called out the need to “...[step] back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities.”  It’s a vitally important consideration at this stage of AI’s adoption cycle – and an area in which blockchain technology is uniquely suited to play a key role. A blockchain’s inherent strength lies in its ability to provide a transparent system for storing data and executing contracts, underpinned by a distributed network of computers that has no single point of failure.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse)  This is a critically-needed feature set as it relates to developing a more ethical and transparent brand of AI. Among other key functions, blockchains can record every time a parameter that governs AI behavior is adjusted, whether that’s by a human researcher or the AI itself. This will provide an important breakthrough in making AI more transparent: it unlocks a tamper-proof view of an AI’s “weight system” history, or how it logs training set data and its outcomes.  While this is theoretically possible with non-blockchain databases, it quickly becomes a far more complex and prohibitively expensive proposition in practice. Timestamps will need to be entered manually (an incredibly time- and labor-intensive process), data sets require constant monitoring to ensure their continued integrity and the entire, centralized system relies on a single (likely opaque) point of failure that makes it far vulnerable to manipulation and difficult to rein in. With a blockchain, that entire process can be automated via a single smart contract, and secured by a decentralized network that consists of hundreds or even thousands of independent servers.  Taking a hybrid approach  Hybrid blockchains are one potential AI governance model. Hybrid chains allow an organization to utilize private infrastructure that they control while simultaneously accessing public infrastructure that is fully decentralized. It’s up to them which data lives where.  Organizations will understandably want to store the most relevant and important data on the most secure option: the public blockchain. This ensures that the system will behave as intended if or when any shutdown mechanism is triggered by an AI, and it represents a critical boundary for an emerging and still largely unknown technology – and one which the Skynet creators surely wished they had in James Cameron’s fictional universe. Why rely on a single party and its oft-opaque motives and biases, when you can instead distribute (and subsequently audit and verify) that risk across a large number of independent and disparate parties in a transparent and trustless manner?  Due to the massive and complex data sets that feed AI systems, they tend to produce terabytes worth of metadata that’s less germane to the issue at hand – and thus more efficient to share in an off-chain, private environment. This approach considerably reduces transaction costs, while also minimizing the signal to noise ratio in data sets. Put simply, it makes more economic sense for businesses seeking to realize a competitive advantage with an emerging technology. If this equation sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the same playbook that saw cloud computing evolve from niche curiosity to mainstream best practice for almost every organization around the world.  It’s become clear that AI, like blockchain, is here to stay. And in the case of both technologies, we’ve barely scratched the surface when it comes to realizing its ultimate potential. We’re at a crossroads, and the decisions that we collectively make in the coming months and years will have significant and long-term implications. The individuals and organizations that will make an exponential impact on our future would be remiss to overlook the incredible potential that AI and blockchain offer for ushering in a more equitable and promising future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Mrinal Manohar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/06/towards-a-more-responsible-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff66395834910e183c6c02cba212366f8d33dda-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These violations allegedly occurred prior to Bittrex Inc. filing for Chapter 11 in May. Related Reading: Solana Registers 20% Rise In Past Week, But Can SOL Keep This Up? Bittrex had made a request for an Automatic Stay, which would impede certain creditors from pursuing or continuing legal actions against a bankrupt estate. In response, Brandon Greenberg, Assistant General Counsel to the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR), filed a statement opposing the request. The purpose of Greenberg’s filing is to challenge the implementation of the Automatic Stay. This would allow creditors to proceed with their actions against Bittrex Inc. as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. Greenberg highlighted in his statement that the financial regulator, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR), had already provided guidance and advice to Bittrex, regarding potential avenues for resolving the charges brought against them. Accusations Against Bittrex: What Led To The Regulatory Uproar? Bittrex Inc. faces several accusations which included the failure to separate customer assets from the company’s own capital. Not only that, the exchange, was also accused of inconsistent maintenance of an adequate surety bond. According to the filing, from October 2022 to March 2023, the OFR collaborated with financial regulators in Texas, Maryland, and Michigan to conduct a “multistate examination” of Bittrex Inc. This suggests that the regulators from multiple states worked together to assess and investigate the operations of Bittrex Inc. during that period before coming to their present conclusion. After conducting its investigation, the OFR filed a three-count complaint against the exchange platform on April 17, as stated by Greenberg in the filing on Wednesday. On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused the company of violating federal laws by operating as a securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The OFR previously advised the company to engage in administrative procedures. It was suggested in order to help Bittrex to pursue a more substantive discussion and potentially explore options for a settlement. In his filing, Greenberg asserted that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation holds the authority to exercise administrative discretion. It can determine which violations to charge in their Administrative Complaint against the platform. Bittrex Ceased Operations Amidst “Uncertain Regulatory and Economic Environment” On March 31, Bittrex Inc. made an announcement stating its intention to wind down its operations in the United States. It cited concerns over the uncertain regulatory and economic environment. According to Greenberg, the company expressed disappointment with the enforcement action taken by the OFR back in April as they had hoped to surrender their license and exit Florida without such action. At that time, Bittrex Inc. did not disclose any plans to file for bankruptcy. However, on April 30, the company surrendered its money transmitter license. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Registers 28% Gain – How Long Will It Last? Legal representatives for the exchange have combated the allegations.

14580838,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541575,1688653186,Crypto Arbitrage: What Is It and How to Do It,"What is arbitrage? Arbitrage, in its simplest form, is the process of buying a stock on one market and selling it on another to take advantage of price listing differences across various markets. For example, a car manufacturer is priced at $45 on the NYSE but is trading at $45.30 on the SSE. A trader purchases these shares on the NYSE and sells them on the SSE to make a 30-cent profit on each share. This is a basic example of arbitrage trading. What is arbitrage trading in crypto? Arbitrage crypto trading works in a similar way to conventional stock market arbitrage trading. In the same way arbitrage traders seek to make gains by buying and selling across markets, crypto arbitrage traders look to profit from the varying list prices on different exchanges. For example, an investor buys 100 Solana coins on the Coinbase crypto exchange at $14 per coin and sells them on the eToro exchange for $14.10 — meaning the investor made 10 cents profit per share by trading them on a new platform. Types of crypto arbitrage The only significant difference between crypto arbitrage trading and stock market arbitration is that there’s more than one way to do it. Some of the common types of crypto arbitrage trading include: Spatial arbitrage — Also known as geographical arbitrage, spatial arbitrage is when an investor simply buys cryptocurrency on one exchange, sells in another, and collects the profit. Investors can trade crypto between centralized exchanges (CEXs) or Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and take advantage of an exchange’s technical inefficiencies — like pricing delays — and listing differences to profit. Spatial arbitrage without transferring — The most common and simple form of arbitrage trading. An investor takes a long position on a cryptocurrency on one exchange and a short position with the same cryptocurrency on another exchange. This means investors can hedge against substantial losses and make small profits on price fluctuations across different exchanges. Triangular arbitrage — The triangle aspect refers to three types of currency involved in a triangular transaction — the two coins and the fiat currency used. Triangular arbitrage works like this: The investor logs on to their crypto exchange or trading account and buys one Bitcoin on their account using their fiat currency — for example, pound sterling or US dollars. The investor transfers that Bitcoin to a different exchange or wallet and purchases 10 Ethereum using that Bitcoin. The investor then sells their current holding of Ethereum — for a higher price than the cost of the original Bitcoin — and buys back the original Bitcoin for the starting price to complete the triangle. Although profitable when done correctly, these opportunities rarely arise, and this isn’t a method commonly used by traders. How to find crypto arbitrage opportunities It’s all well and good knowing how to put an arbitrage trading plan into action. However, prospective arbitrageurs must know how to spot these opportunities to act on them. To spot a lucrative crypto arbitrage opportunity, investors must: Browse the market for price changes — Whether manually or using a tracking tool to do the heavy lifting, comparing the prices of cryptocurrencies on a range of platforms is essential to know where to buy and sell. Specialist software can help investors scrape this data from various exchanges to highlight potential opportunities. Use trading pairs — Trading helps gauge the comparative value of two cryptocurrencies or between a coin and a fiat currency. For example, an exchange might show that one Bitcoin token is worth X amount of Ethereum on the interface and vice versa. This value can be used to calculate how much a coin is worth when you trade, making it easier to identify if the exchange rate works in your favor. Keep up-to-date with currency exchange rates — Another crucial aspect of arbitraging crypto is tracking the exchange rates of fiat currencies. For investors buying and selling cryptocurrencies across global CEXs and DEXs, understanding how the fiat currencies have moved can affect how much profit they’ll make when all the assets are sold. Advantages of crypto arbitrage Despite being an uncommon tactic, there are many potential advantages to arbitraging cryptocurrencies. The main advantages of cryptocurrency arbitrage trading include: Low risk — Because crypto arbitrage trading often involves buying and selling simultaneously or on different markets, traders hedge their losses with a counter investment, meaning there is minimal risk for the trade. Potential for quick returns — Arbitrage trading has a quick turnaround — once investors spot an opportunity, they jump at it. The nature of rapid arbitrage trading and currency conversions at a desirable rate means that profits can be realized in a matter of minutes. Industry Volatility — Volatility is usually not associated with positive financial investing, however, it’s a vital part of arbitrage. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Because the supply and demand of a coin are largely based on speculation, markets are constantly moving — exposing daily pricing errors and inefficiencies across many crypto exchanges daily. It’s these inefficiencies that open the door for traders to profit. Works during bull and bear markets — Whether the market is rising or falling, the number of arbitrage opportunities remains the same. Although bull markets are more desirable, traders can hold both long and short positions and make money whether the markets bull or bear. Disadvantages of crypto arbitrage All investment strategies come with a level of risk – cryptocurrency arbitrage is no different. Some of the drawbacks of crypto arbitrage include: Withdrawal limits — Some cryptocurrencies limit the amount you can withdraw at any given time. Investors must understand these limits and select exchanges that offer the cheapest withdrawal fees to maximize profit on short-term trades. Transaction Fees — All trading platforms and cryptocurrency exchanges won’t let you buy, deposit, or withdraw money or coins from a wallet without charging fees. Investors must factor these fees into account before taking arbitrage trades. Fees for buying, selling, and withdrawing coins or fiat currency can exceed the profit made by performing a successful arbitrage trade — adding extra layers of complexity for novice and experienced investors alike. Slow Transaction Times — As competition for a share of the crypto pie ramps up, so do transaction times, due to the increased volume. Because funds need to be reallocated and withdrawn quickly, these slow wait times can be the difference between an investor profiting, missing out on an opportunity, or losing out entirely. Precision Timing Needed — All trading is relatively time-sensitive, but none more than arbitrage trading. When prices across exchanges don’t match up, and an opportunity arises, investors have minutes or even seconds to react and turn a profit. Investors need to be quick to reduce the risk of the market turning against them, making it a method that’s most suitable for more experienced traders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which coin is the best for arbitrage? Arbitrage can be done with any crypto coin or token. However, coins with high volatility are most suitable as they open more opportunities for arbitration. Cheaper tokens and meme coins – like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Cardano – offer increased volatility and are also more accessible to investors with smaller portfolios. Can you lose money doing crypto arbitrage? Like any form of trading, if the market doesn’t fall in your favor — or you make a mistake on your inputs — you can lose money from crypto arbitrage. Unfortunately, trading has real-world consequences, so it’s critical to be informed and practice on a paper money account before committing personal capital. For more information on how to invest in crypto as a beginner and the potential pros and cons of trading, check out our helpful guide! Is crypto arbitrage legal? Crypto arbitrage trading is not only legal in the majority of countries across the world, but it’s also encouraged. It helps iron out market inefficiencies by making it easier for centralized and decentralized markets to receive a steady supply of coins to fulfill demand without affecting the market price. How to learn crypto arbitrage? When learning any form of trading, it’s important to learn from the best and practice the strategy in a safe environment. Most exchanges offer investors the option to set up a paper account. A paper account lets novice investors set up and try different investment strategies — including crypto arbitrage trading – without the risks associated with committing capital straight away.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/learn/how-to-arbitrage-crypto/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/14580838.jpeg

42419986,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlZ7,1688652111,AI Crypto Trading Bots Are the New ‘Edge’ – For Now,"There’s a word that every trader knows: “Edge.” You need an edge to trade successfully. And edge can come in many forms. Maybe you understand something the market doesn’t; maybe your analysis is sharper than the conventional wisdom; or maybe you’re so good at reading the price charts -- recognizing the patterns -- that you can sniff out the precise moments to buy and sell.  Edge is hard to find. Most people don’t have it. Studies suggest that more than 80% of day-traders lose money.  So what will happen to traders’ edge when the crypto markets get flooded by AI? “AI is going to be the enemy of the stubborn-minded,” Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner at Storm (a blockchain consultancy), told me recently, when I asked him for the biggest impacts of AI for crypto. “If a trader does not want to use [AI] and wants to do everything manually, they’re going to get left behind.”  This is not a trivial concern. Whether we like it or not, by far and away the most widespread use of cryptocurrency -- still -- is simply the buying and selling of cryptocurrency, often in the form of short-term scalping.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse)  The AI trading revolution might have already begun. As CoinDesk’s Ian Allison recently reported, investment data analytics firm Chain of Demand, which works with blue chip institutions like Bloomberg, has built a tool that leverages ChatGPT to analyze bitcoin price fluctuations. OkX, a crypto exchange, recently published a guide for the “9 best crypto trading bots to use in 2023,” which includes “Dollar Cost Averaging bots, Options bots and HODL bots.” And crypto Twitter oozes with sketchy-looking ads for AI trading bots, such as “This Crypto Ai Trading Bot makes $100 A Day!”  The appeal of AI trading, to many, is that you can put it to work and then go about your life. “A lot of us have a problem with knowing when to sell,” says Daisy, a crypto education influencer who goes by the alias Crypto Empress. Daisy now works with two AI trading projects, Otto Bought (get it?) and the DeFi Trading Club, that do things like hunt for entry and exit points, assist in technical analysis, and help with macro studies like evaluating a crypto start-up’s tokenomics structure.  “This is going to change how people take profits,” says Daisy. “Now people don’t have to be stuck at computers. AI bots are going to do it for you. All you have to do is cash out your money and do real-life things.” Other AI trading projects, such as Verox, are using the tech to evaluate social media activity (to gauge market sentiment), understand fluctuations in volume and optimize passive staking income.  Other traders are more skeptical. “Realistically, we’re not there yet,” says Christopher Inks, founder of the trading group TexasWest Capital. He knows the large trading desks and banks are touting that they use AI, but says “we don’t have much information on how much of an impact AI is having on their trading, and how much they’re investing, and how much they’ve allocated.”  As for the AI trading bots? Inks considers these to be the successors to algorithmic trading bots, which have long been catnip for rookie traders seeking easy wins. “Everybody and their grandmother swears that their bot has a 90% win-rate strategy,” says Inks. “They don’t.”  No silver bullets  Then again, even if the AI bots of today are not a silver bullet, it’s easy to imagine a world where they will be impossible to beat. I happen to have some first-hand experience here. For much of the past two years, I tried my hand day-trading U.S. stocks (not crypto). The idea is that you develop a set of rules -- a playbook -- and then you rigorously follow those rules, so you avoid trading with emotion.  Many day-traders embrace that philosophy. “Our edge comes from being robotic,” says trader Adrian Zdunczyk, founder of the trading group The Birb Nest. “Our edge comes from following the reliable steps that have predictive value.”  So that’s what I did. I tried to stick to my trading plan, only pulling the trigger on trades that met the exact criteria of A, B, C, and D. Example: The price of the stock jumps at the open (9:30am EST), then regresses back towards the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price); the direction of that movement is aligned with the daily trend; there’s decent volume on the one-minute candles; and on and on and on.  My takeaway? It’s hard. It’s very hard.  I tried to be robotic in my adherence to the rules, but the problem is that I never had rock-solid confidence that my baseline rules -- if followed to the letter -- would reliably cough up profits. When a trade works, it’s tough to know if you correctly followed your playbook or if you just got lucky. If a trade fails, maybe you perfectly followed your system but the market happened to move against you -- an acceptable loss. Even the best of traders lose all the time. Zdunczyk, at Birb Nest, says that he’s wrong in 70% of his trades, but the 30% winners are so profitable that on balance he comes out ahead.  Read more: Crypto Miner Hive Blockchain Touts Privacy of AI Models Running on Its GPUs  The point is that whereas traditional bots could only be programmed (more or less) to follow specific sets of instructions like the ones I used -- buy if Condition A, Condition B, Condition C, and Condition D are all true -- the new breed of AI will likely bring something else: Pattern recognition.  Here’s a quick analogy. Remember the infamous “China spy balloon” that hovered over Alaska? Its trajectory was found with AI. Synthetaic, a startup, used AI to quickly process an ocean of satellite imagery. It would have taken a human forever to pore through all the photos; the AI could do it in a blink. Similarly, a human trader needs to click through hundreds or thousands of cryptocurrencies to find the exact chart configuration that matches their tradebook. Once the AIs get better at pattern recognition, they’ll do this in a heartbeat.  Some traders, for example, swear by using chart patterns such as “head and shoulders,” which looks like a small hill on the left, then a big hill in the middle, then another small hill on the right. The theory is that this is bearish and a potential signal to sell. (You’d also look at many other factors, of course.) The AI bot could scour every single cryptocurrency -- and every trading pair, not just BTC/USD but more exotic ones like SOL/BTC -- at every second around the clock, hunting for those coveted Head & Shoulders patterns, and then only selling if it met a string of set conditions.  “AI helps you spot these more complex patterns that are present in nature,” says Zdunczyk. “It gives you more accuracy.” Or perhaps the AI will eventually laugh at our use of the Head and Shoulder patterns, and instead identify its own system for finding an edge. That’s what happened in chess, where AI eventually developed winning strategies that had never been used by humans.  Maybe crypto AI tools like Otto Bought and Verox are already capable of gobbling up inefficiencies in the market, or maybe they’re not. I’d argue it’s a moot point. Eventually they will be, and it’s only a matter of time. “The amount of AI is going to increase,” says Zdunczyk, who has been experimenting with ChatGPT to write scripts for trading bots.  But he takes a wider lens and sees this as part of a decades-long trend. After all, traders once needed to be physically present on the trading floor to bark out buy and sell orders. Then came a shift to digital, then the rise of high-frequency trading, then no-fee apps like Robin Hood. The space is always evolving.  At some point, you will likely need to be using AI or else you’ll be stuck with bow and arrows while the other armies fire machine guns. “The advantage will arbitrage itself away,” predicts Zdunczyk.  And once everyone is using AI?  Perhaps the only winners will be those who develop the beefiest, fastest, smartest AI systems. Or maybe if you’re using it and every other trader is using it, it’s hard to see where you -- or anyone -- will find an edge.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/06/ai-crypto-trading-bots-are-the-new-edge-for-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23f4e61c76834dc539782e40f716637aec7200f3-2207x1358.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new bill that would afford certain tax benefits to Israel’s crypto sector has passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset, the country’s parliament. A proposed bill that would exempt foreign residents from capital gains tax on the sale of digital assets and reduce tax on crypto options from 50% to about 25% passed its preliminary reading on Wednesday. Israel Vies to Attract Investment The bill, sponsored by Knesset member Dan Illouz, has the full support of Israel’s coalition government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Illouz explained the bill is part of a larger economic strategy to attract investors and companies to the country. The bill’s explanatory note details: Despite the growth potential of Israeli companies in the field, the regulatory reality in Israel is not adapted to the digital currency industry. Therefore, it is proposed to make a number of legislative amendments that will reduce the regulatory gap. If passed, the bill would grant tax benefits similar to those afforded to high-tech firms to Israel’s crypto sector. Mr Illouz said in a press statement: Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry. Adding, This law amendment aims to balance the situation and eliminate the discrimination in taxation. The bill further proposes that “digital currency” be used separately from “security.” Move Signals That Israel is Embracing Crypto The country’s decision to equal taxation for crypto investors is a clear sign of actively embracing the industry. Israel has been working toward integrating crypto into its economy. The country’s central bank, the Bank of Israel, issued principles for regulating stablecoin activity in February. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also revealed the Israeli government would conduct testing of a blockchain-based platform for issuing digital bonds. The project, dubbed “Eden”, aims to reduce costs and optimise the procedure of national bond issuance. Israel’s largest bank, Bank Leumi, also stated it would become the first Israeli bank to enable crypto trading, following a partnership with Paxos. The bank’s digital platform, Pepper Invest, said that collaborating with Paxos would allow its customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies.

The ADP report surprised markets in a big way to the upside, showing 497,000 private-sector jobs added in June, more than double the consensus forecast for 220,000. The data overshadowed a report by the Labor Department that showed modest labor market weakness, with first-time filings for jobless claims rising 248,000 last week, ahead of the forecast for 245,000.  Treasury yields extended an early rise after the ADP report, with the two-year yield jumping about 15 basis points to 5.118%, the highest since 2006, according to charting platform TradingView. The 10-year yield added 11 basis points to 4.05%, its highest level since March.  The two-year note is more sensitive to short-term interest rate expectations. Its rise to fresh multi-year highs suggests traders see the Fed extending its rate hike campaign. Indeed, fed funds futures traders now see a 94% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike this month, and markets are now factoring in a 75 chance of three additional rate hikes by the year's end. Before a pause last month, the Fed kicked off its so-called tightening cycle in March 2022 and has since raised rates by 500 basis points to the 5%-5.25% range. The tighter monetary policy has been among the factors for the swoon in crypto markets over the past 18 months.  Stock traders reacted negatively to this morning's ADP news as well, with futures tied to the S&P 500 trading 0.9% at press time and Nasdaq futures lower by 1.1%.

14579193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541388,1688649253,Under-The-Radar Bullish Bitcoin Moving Average Crossover Looks Imminent,"Many traders and technicians closely follow the well-known “Golden Cross” moving average crossover in key liquid markets such as Bitcoin, Gold, and the Nasdaq 100 Index among others. Today, however, we’ll examine an under-the-radar Bitcoin moving average crossover which looks imminent. Using Bitcoin’s reliable data from 2011 through today, let’s find out if this lesser known moving average crossover looks bullish or bearish going forward. This Lesser Known Moving Average Crossover May Soon Hit While the Golden Cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average crosses above the 200-day simple moving average, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50MA) currently looks poised to cross above its 100-day simple moving average (100MA) within days. Earlier this year, Bitcoin’s 50MA crossed above its 100MA as the number one crypto by market cap surged in January off of its post-FTX collapse low. Further Bitcoin gains followed from this most recent crossover. Bitcoin Daily Chart | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Humpback Wallets Reach ATH, Is BlackRock Behind The Surge? Now that Bitcoin has extended its year-to-date gains in recent sessions, its 50MA looks poised to cross back above its 100MA once again. Beyond the signal earlier this year, what’s happened in the past when Bitcoin’s 50MA has crossed above its 100MA? Sixty Days And Beyond Looks Bullish To find out, we’ll look at all signals since 2011, adding an extra condition which better describes current market conditions with respect to Bitcoin. Our extra condition requires that Bitcoin’s 100MA must be rising, meaning that the average closed at a value greater than the day before when the 50MA crossed above the 100MA. This additional requirement filters out 50MA > 100MA crossovers during periods of downward price momentum and better describes Bitcoin’s current technical state. While the holding time graphic below illustrates Bitcoin’s historical tendency for further upside following such signals, hypothetical gains appear unimpressively small with short-term holding times of seven to fifteen days, up only +1.8% and 1.9% respectively. Moving out to a 30-day holding time, the Average Trade of +10.4% looks far more promising. Bitcoin Holding Time Stats | SOURCE: Tableau From an intermediate-term perspective, however, the Average Trade stats jump significantly higher with hypothetical gains ranging from +45.7% with a 60-day holding time to +170.9% with a 90-day hold. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bulls Aren’t Running Out Of Steam Yet Returning to the early 2023 signal and assuming a 90-day hold (1/25/23 to 4/25/23), Bitcoin’s recent 50MA >100MA crossover gained a respectable +22.7%. While it’s clearly below the Average Trade value for the full history of these crossover signals, Bitcoin may be poised for potentially higher prices if it’s 50MA can once again close above its rising 100MA.

Are NFTs In Trouble Because Of Blur? NFT marketplace Blur faces a public backlash over the falling NFT prices as investors and traders point fingers at its incentivized trading model. The upstart marketplace surpassed OpenSea as the leading Ethereum NFT trading platform by volume in February but now faces scrutiny. As the NFT market faces turbulent times, questions about the long-term sustainability of incentivized trading models are being raised. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices hit a two-year low, and other notable projects have also seen sizable price declines. Traders and investors are reevaluating the underlying value of NFTs and whether the current market downturn is a natural correction or a symptom of larger systemic issues. Blur’s Controversial Stance On NFTs Blur's stance that NFTs are not unique assets but rather ""altcoins with pictures,"" as controversially tweeted by crypto influencer Cobie last year, has reinforced this sentiment. Blur made its debut as a marketplace in October, positioning itself as the platform for professional NFT traders. The promise of a token airdrop enticed users to choose Blur over competitors like OpenSea. When the BLUR token was finally launched in February, Blur quickly overtook OpenSea, becoming the top marketplace in terms of trading volume. A Short-Lived Success For Blur Traders began rapidly flipping NFTs to earn rewards, treating assets like Bored Apes and Otherside land plots as if they were fungible tokens. The surge in trading volume on Blur propelled the market-wide tally above $2 billion in February. As a result, some firms, like data platform CryptoSlam, denounced it as ""wash trading,” and the initial craze for the Blur marketplace died down pretty soon. In recent months, overall market trading has sharply declined, resulting in whale traders, who initially benefited from exploiting the rewards model, now suffering losses and withdrawing funds from Blur's NFT bidding pool. Founder Pacman Responds Blur founder Tieshun Roquerre, who is more popularly known as Pacman, responded to the allegations against Blur, saying, “We launched in October 22. Since then, some floor prices have gone up, some floor prices have gone down. One of the few times floor prices went up in concert was when we injected liquidity into nfts via our airdrop. One of the few times floor prices went down in concert was when $40m of liquidity was removed via the Azuki mint (not throwing stones, the market just moves based on liquidity more than anything else).” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new 13-month high above $31,500 early Thursday morning before a pullback to the current $31,100, up more than 2% for the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has traded above $30,000 for a couple of weeks, but has struggled to reach the $32,000 level. “For the bitcoin rally to continue, we will need to get confirmation that the SEC will grant permission for a spot-Bitcoin ETF in the U.S,” said Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. The top gainer among large-cap cryptos on Thursday, however, isbitcoin cash (BCH), up more than 12%, and continuing a big run higher following its listing on EDX Markets which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. Gains could continue in July as data from TradingView shows this month is historically a good one for cryptos. One year ago in July, BCH rose 34%, while BTC advanced 17%.  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said crypto, specifically bitcoin, could revolutionize the financial system in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday. “We do believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities – that’s what bitcoin is – it could revolutionize finance,” he said. Previously known to be a skeptic of crypto, Fink years ago suggested fans of the asset class heavily used it for “illicit activities.” Fink continued: “Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.”  Circle is considering issuing a stablecoin in Japan following legislation governing stablecoins in that country that took effect on June 1, the payment services company's co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said. In an interview with CoinDesk Japan, Allaire said that if stablecoins become more widely used for cross-border trade, foreign currency transactions and global commerce, Japan will become an extremely large market. Japan's stablecoin bill makes it one of the first countries to establish a framework for the use of overseas stablecoins, which Allaire considers “the most important thing the government and the Financial Services Agency have done.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the 24-hour trading volume in cryptocurrency trading pairs listed on South Korea's largest digital assets exchange Upbit.  The bitcoin cash/Korean won (BCH/KRW) trading pair has registered a trading volume of $303 million the past 24 hours, a significant decline from $557 million seen a week ago.  While BCH has gained 12% in past 24 hours, prices remain well below June 30 high and within the $250-$320 range that persisted since Korean volumes peaked a week ago.  ""The Koreans have stopped buying BCH,"" Matrixport's head of research and strategy Markus Thielen said, noting the decline in the BCH/KRW trading volume on Upbit.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Crypto Storage Token Storj Rallies 43% Overnight as Trading Volume Surges  Decentralized Exchange dYdX Launches Public Testnet on Cosmos  CryptoQuant Parent Raises $6.5M Round Led by Atinum Investment",POSITIVE,BCH,ASIA | BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/06/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-cash-largest-big-cap-gainer-as-cryptos-move-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b17cd7cc51754e403eaa184890b5ceab6a3813a3-1116x576.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14578174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541540,1688647035,"Bitcoin Exchange Supply Continues To Slip, Holders Not Interested In Selling?","On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin exchange supply has only continued to decline despite the recent rally that the asset has observed. Bitcoin Exchange Supply Continues To Register Net Decline According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchanges have continued to see withdrawals recently. The indicator of interest here is the “exchange balance,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net number of coins to these platforms currently. As one of the main reasons why holders may transfer their BTC to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have short-term bearish consequences for the price. On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator imply a net amount of the supply is leaving from the exchanges. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign that the investors are accumulating at the moment. Naturally, this could be constructive for the cryptocurrency’s price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange balance over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going downhill in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange balance had been in an overall uptrend during 2018 and 2019, but with the COVID crash in March 2020, a shift happened in the market and the indicator started moving in a downward trajectory. There was a break in this trend during the 2021 bull run, as the metric mostly moved sideways, with some increases coming near the top of the rallies. This deviation in the trend was possibly a result of investors depositing to take advantage of the profit-taking opportunity. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? With the end of the bull market and the transition toward a bearish period, though, the indicator resumed its decline. Events like the 3AC Collapse and the FTX Crash saw the exchange balance dropping especially hard, as these platforms going down made investors more wary of keeping their coins in centralized custody. With the start of the Bitcoin rally this year, however, the metric once again started moving sideways as demand for selling returned. In the leadup to the local top in April, exchanges were receiving net deposits as their supply outright registered an increase. Interestingly, while investors were looking to sell during the price surge back then, the latest uplift in the price above the $30,000 level has actually seen the exchange balance only decline further. This trend of net withdrawals can be a sign that there isn’t much appetite for selling in the market currently, at least when compared to the demand for taking coins to self-custody.

With the latest drawdown, the Bitcoin exchange balance has dropped to 2.26 million BTC, which is the lowest the indicator has been since way back in March 2018.

42419971,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlLh,1688647009,Binance Refers Dutch Users to Rival Coinmerce as It Exits Netherlands,"Binance is referring Dutch customers to rival crypto exchange Coinmerce as it ceases business in the Netherlands, according to a Thursday statement by Coinmerce.  Dutch residents can no longer use Binance’s service after the world’s biggest crypto exchange failed to secure recognition as a virtual asset provider, but has offered its customers a free transfer to its rival, which has been registered by the central bank to offer crypto exchange and wallet services since 2020.  ""Our priority is to ensure an orderly transition,” ​Jaap de Bruijn, chief executive officer of Coinmerce said in a statement, adding that customers can choose to transfer digital assets to Coinmerce for free under a process supervised by regulators.  Last year Binance was fined 3.3 million euros ($3.6 million) by the Dutch central bank for serving clients in the country without the required authorization. Last month it announced it would take no new customers in the Netherlands, with existing clients unable to deposit, trade or purchase after July 17.  Binance premises were recently raided in France, the company’s flagship center in Europe, in a probe into “aggravated money laundering.” The company and its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao have also been charged by U.S. regulators with operating an unlicensed securities exchange.  A spokesperson for Binance confirmed to CoinDesk it has been working on a ""seamless transition"" for Dutch users to enable them to transfer to Coinmerce ""quickly and securely"" should they wish to.  ""While we are leaving the Dutch market, Binance remains committed to obtaining the necessary authorizations to reintroduce its products and services to users residing in the Netherlands in the future,"" the spokesperson said.

While Bitcoin dominance has been useful in predicting crypto market trends, it has become less effective due to the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. I see Bitcoin going through a consolidation phase and altcoins performing relatively well but does not expect a full-blown altcoin season. Thesis Many crypto analysts point to the market capitalization of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to the ratio of altcoins' market cap - known as Bitcoin dominance and tracked through the Bitcoin Dominance index (BTC.D) - as one of the core metrics in predicting the direction of the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance has been used for years to tell if an alt season or a bearish trend is approaching. However, as the crypto landscape keeps evolving, is Bitcoin dominance still a reliable metric in predicting the direction of the crypto market? Looking at recent Bitcoin dominance data and the current direction of the crypto market, should investors still rely heavily on this metric in making investment choices for the coming weeks and months? Introduction Bitcoin has long reigned and remains the dominant force among cryptocurrencies. As the first and most recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to capture the attention and investment of individuals and institutions alike. Typically, good news for Bitcoin is good news for crypto, and a step towards the mass adoption of Bitcoin is always a win for the whole crypto landscape. Based on this premise, numerous attempts have been made to regularize Bitcoin, including attempts to get a spot Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC-the latest being the BlackRock ( BLK ) ETF filing . The need to introduce regulated investment vehicles like ETFs to help legitimize and establish Bitcoin as a recognized asset class within the traditional financial system has long been sought. Given Bitcoin's prominence and influence, it's no surprise that market observers often use the Bitcoin dominance indicator as a key metric to gauge the overall direction of the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance has been widely utilized to assess the sentiment and health of the crypto market, with fluctuations in this metric often prompting speculation about the rise or fall of altcoins. Bitcoin dominance chart (TradingView) Going by the latest Bitcoin dominance data, some analysts have hinted at an imminent alt season as the BTC.D index has shown a slight drop in Bitcoin's dominance, while BTC maintains sideways momentum. Bitcoin Dominance Limitations While Bitcoin dominance may provide some insights, it is far from a perfect measure. In this analysis, I delve briefly into some limitations of Bitcoin dominance as a reliable indicator of crypto market trends. Among other reasons, here are two main reasons why Bitcoin dominance is not a reliable metric in predicting the direction of the current crypto market. Exclusion of Tokenized Assets Bitcoin dominance does not consider the impact of tokenized assets or total value locked ('TVL') in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The rise of tokenization allows for the representation of real-world assets on the blockchain, expanding the scope of the crypto market beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. Tokenized assets, like security tokens , have substantial market value and liquidity but are excluded from the Bitcoin dominance metric. Evolving Crypto Market and Narratives The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic. Disruptive narratives are built using blockchain technology and Bitcoin dominance fails to capture the growth and innovation happening beyond the realm of Bitcoin, disregarding the potential impact of emerging projects that could disrupt the market unexpectedly. Often, regardless of the Bitcoin dominance indicator and the expected direction of the market based on this indicator, a new crypto narrative could gain traction, create a hype cycle, and push the crypto market into a bull-run trajectory. This has been witnessed in the past. For instance, when the DeFi narrative gained rapid popularity in the summer of 2020, it led to what is now known by the catchphrase ""DeFi Summer"" and paved the way for the 2021 crypto bull run. New and sustainable narratives that bring incredible use cases to the crypto space have the potential to alter the trend of the crypto market, regardless of what BTC.D depicts. A trending narrative that is capable of driving the next market boom is liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) . LSD protocols have recorded impressive growth in total value locked (TVL), especially on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) network. Conclusion While Bitcoin dominance has served as a convenient tool for evaluating the trajectory of the crypto market, it is not without its limits. Its inability to adapt to the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, the misleading nature of market cap, and the exclusion of tokenized assets limit the metric's effectiveness. Typically, when capital invested in Bitcoin starts to decrease following a period of increase in its dominance, the general sentiment is that the capital begins to flow into altcoins. However, there is a lot more going on in the current crypto landscape, and factors that determine bull and bear trends have become more complex. The recent and unexpected SEC scrutiny of major altcoins and the immediate delisting of these altcoins from major US-based exchanges is a clear example of how a factor outside BTC.D can drastically sway investor sentiment. Hence, a nuanced combination of key metrics, technicals, and common sense is vital in navigating the crypto market and properly managing risk. Contrary to calls of an imminent alt season, I see BTC going through a consolidation phase, moving sideways for a while between the current $28,500 support level and the $32,500 resistance, while alts perform relatively well; however, I do not expect a full-blown alt season yet as I believe investors trust in altcoins have not been fully restored following the recent SEC stance on major alts.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615462-dont-rely-on-bitcoin-dominance?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14577240.jpeg

Binance Suspends Multichain Support In a recent development, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced that it is ending support for withdrawal and deposit for several Multichain-bridged tokens. From July 7 onwards, customers on networks like BNB Smart Chain, Fantom, Ethereum, and Avalanche will be unable to deposit or withdraw bridged tokens until further notice. It is important to note that the suspension only applies to specific tokens bridged to Multichain and does not affect the trading of other cryptocurrencies on Binance. Users can still trade and engage in transactions with the wide range of tokens available on the exchange. Some of the tokens affected by this decision are Polkastarter (POLS), Alchemy Pay (ACH), Beefy.Finance (BIFI), Harvest Finance (FARM), tokens minted through the bridge on Fantom, like Beefy.Finance (BIFI) and Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), and a token minted on Ethereum’s bridge, Travala (AVA). Binance Assures Funds Safety Multichain is a cross-chain interoperability protocol. It enables the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks and currently oversees over $1.3 billion in assets, with $698 million minted on Ethereum, $339 million minted on BNB Smart Chain, and $92 million on Fantom. However, Binance is taking no chances when it comes to safeguarding user funds. Although the team has assured customers that funds remain secure, the uncertainty around the matter is worrying users whose funds are stuck in the protocol. According to a Binance spokesperson, the temporary suspension of these services on the Binance platform is only a temporary risk management measure. Users can still trade the tokens on Binance and withdraw them using alternative networks. This means that as long as the assets do not involve the Multichain project, they can proceed as normal. The Multichain Complication Although the team has not specified the exact reason behind this decision, it is implied that it is in response to the protocol’s difficulties that occurred in May. During that period, the project experienced transactional difficulties with processing bridge transfers. Kava, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and several other pathways of the cross-chain bridge were not functioning properly. Multichain CEO Zhaojun was also unreachable and rumored to be taken into police custody. As a result, Binance suspended deposits for Multichain-bridged tokens on May 25, citing complications within the protocol. The recent suspension is just a follow-up to the previous action against Multichain. In conclusion, Binance's decision to suspend transfers of several tokens tied to Multichain is a proactive measure to ensure the security and stability of its users' funds. Users are advised to stay informed through official channels and await further updates from the exchange. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin bull market is building The crypto bull market looks to be very much on this morning as bitcoin touches $31,500, a new high for this year. All that is needed is for bitcoin to get above this level and stay there for a few days in order to give the signal that the break is confirmed and that bitcoin can start traversing higher. This new bullish environment may have been caused in part by the CEO of Blackrock, the biggest AUM company on the planet, saying on national TV yesterday that bitcoin was ""digitising gold"", and that it was an “international asset”. This is also after Blackrock had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF along with some other large institutional entities. With Blackrock’s experience and fantastic success in getting the regulators to sign off on their many ETF filings, this one extra filing has the hallmarks of being an extremely good bet. Bitcoin’s current good fortune is also shared with some of the cryptocurrency market.

This lightning fast layer 1 has been beaten to a pulp, falling from its November 2021 high of $260 to as low as $8 in December of last year. However, at $8 it could be imagined that the bottom was in for Solana, with a wick down to $12.60 possibly signalling a double bottom. A descending trendline has suppressed the price since July of 2022 and therefore the $SOL break of this line today could herald much greater things as long as the break is confirmed. Stacks Stacks (STX) is another cryptocurrency to watch. It happens to be one of the only SEC-approved cryptocurrencies. It should certainly also benefit from the bitcoin narrative given that it's one of the very few bitcoin layer 2s, which enable apps to be built on top of bitcoin. It hit the 0.786 Fibonacci level yesterday and looks primed to go higher from here. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42419990,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlcD,1688641495,Bitcoin Price Rally Puts Focus on Futures Spread That Underscores Need for Spot ETFs,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent rally has revived concerns about a market peculiarity that puts traders of futures and futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at a disadvantage relative to coin holders.  The cryptocurrency topped $31,000 late last month, reaching the highest in a year. With the rally, the spread between prices for the Chicago-Mercantile Exchange (CME)-listed July futures contract and the now-expired (the-then front-month) June futures contract exploded to nearly $500, the highest gap since the bull market days of late 2021, according to data from charting platform TradingView.  The sharp widening of the spread, or the so-called steepening of the contango, has grabbed eyeballs in the crypto market. The spread raises the cost of pre-expiry futures rollover, or shifting of bullish long positions from front-month to next-month contracts, and affects the performance of the futures-based products offered by ProShares, VanEck and others. Observers, therefore, said the prevailing excitement about a potential launch of a spot-based ETF is justified.  Futures have an expiry date, which mandates the rollover of positions ahead of the settlement. When the spread between the front-month and the next-month contract widens, rollovers are characterized by traders selling the expiring contract at a low price and entering the new one at a high price (the exact opposite of buy low and sell high), inadvertently bleeding money.  ""We were not surprised to see the level of contango in the bitcoin futures market expand over the past week. The CME Bitcoin Futures Market has historically traded in relatively sharp contango during bull market periods, particularly when people are excited about future events (like an eventual spot bitcoin ETF approval). This level of contango will certainly impact [futures-based ETF] investors,"" Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto index fund and ETF provider Bitwise Asset Management, said in an email.  ""This generally points to why a spot bitcoin ETF would be superior for most investors vs. a futures-based ETF. People just want to own bitcoin, safely, with no ifs, ands, or buts. A spot-based ETF would achieve that goal,"" Hougan added.  The U.S.-based futures ETFs invest in CME-listed bitcoin futures.  The spot-ETF rally  Last month, bigwigs from traditional finance like BlackRock (BLK), Invesco (IVZ), Fidelity, and others filed spot-based bitcoin ETF applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin rallied nearly 12% in June.  A spot-based ETF, if approved, will be like SPDR Gold Trust ETF, which owns gold bars. The product will allow investors to hold their positions indefinitely while eliminating the rollover cost associated with futures ETFs and bypassing complexities involved with storing the cryptocurrency in a wallet. Besides, the spot-based ETF will track bitcoin's spot price more closely than futures-based ETFs.  In other words, the spot-based ETF will be a better investment avenue than futures-based products like ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which have underperformed the cryptocurrency this year. ProShares' futures-based ETF, which debuted in October 2021, is the world's largest and most actively-traded futures-based ETF.  Per Yahoo Finance, shares in ProShares' ETF, trading on NYSE under the ticker BITO, have risen 79% this year. Meanwhile, bitcoin has rallied 88%. That's notable a loss of upside for BITO investors. BITO bled more than bitcoin during the 2022 bear market.  ""We might expect underperformance vs. holding spot BTC. The cost of carry emphasizes that futures-based ETFs incorporate the effects of either contango, where holders experience lagging performance or backwardation, where holders experience outperformance. This emphasizes that there is a cost to investors to restricting them to just a derivatives-based ETF,"" Ryan Kim, Head of Derivatives at institutional crypto derivatives platform FalconX, said.  ""The dynamic does contribute to the excitement over spot-based ETFs,"" Kim added.  The situation is unlikely to improve if bitcoin continues to rally, brining more buyers to the derivatives market and keeping futures premiums elevated across the different expiries.  As of Wednesday, the basis in bitcoin and ether CME futures or the difference between futures and spot prices was notably higher at the front end (30-day and 60-day) of the futures curve.  ""For context, the 30-day annualized BTC basis just hit 19%, which is the highest value since October 2021, when BTC was trading at above $60,000,"" Kim said. ""The 30- and 60-day futures are the preferred vehicles for many investors, and more so for bitcoin than for ether.""  Ravi Doshi, co-head of trading at Genesis Global Trading, expressed a similar opinion, saying, ""the bullish market sentiment has driven up the front-end CME futures basis.""  Per Doshi, the situation was exacerbated last week as the futures ETFs were required to roll their long exposure from the expiring June contract to July and ""the illiquidity in the spread led to a temporary 23% annualized basis in the July contract costing futures ETF holders dearly.""  3:52 UTC: BITO's year-to-date gain is 79%. The previous version wrongly mentioned the figure at 56%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/06/bitcoin-rally-puts-focus-on-futures-market-quirk-that-underscores-need-for-spot-based-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/235e44beb33082376e0422f2c0c6f96c64e6a7ac-1280x985.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what on-chain data says regarding whether this is sustainable or not. Solana Trading Volume Has Remained Low Despite Price Rise In its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked at the underlying metrics of Solana to see what has been driving the latest increase in the price. The firm has looked at the “social volume” of the cryptocurrency for various social media platforms and has found that the asset has seen elevated interest on Reddit recently. Here, the social volume refers to a metric that measures the total number of unique posts or threads on a given social media platform that is making at least one mention of SOL. This metric can tell us about the degree of discussion that the coin is currently receiving on the website in question. Now, below is a chart that shows the trend in the Solana social volume on four major social media platforms: Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan. Looks like the value of the metric has been relatively low for most of these platforms | Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, the Solana social volume on Reddit has seen some spikes as the cryptocurrency has risen during the past week or so. The other platforms, however, haven’t observed that much discussion related to the asset. Related Reading: Blame The “Supermoon” If Bitcoin Crashes Or Rallies Towards $35,000 In July A notable spike in the social volume on Reddit also occurred before the coin’s 5% surge during the past 24 hours. This may imply that interest from users on the platform could partly be helping fuel the rise. In terms of the actual trading volume, though, SOL has continued to observe muted activity, despite the growth. Here is a chart that displays the trend in this indicator: The value of the metric hasn't been too high recently | Source: Santiment Interestingly, the initial, strong rise that Solana enjoyed was accompanied by elevated volumes, but at the start of this month, the indicator’s value noted some decline. Since this drop in volume, SOL has mostly moved sideways. Generally, for any price rise to be sustainable, high trading volumes are required. This is due to the fact that participation from a large number of traders is needed to provide enough fuel for any such price move to go on. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Registers 28% Gain – How Long Will It Last? Despite the sharp growth that Solana has observed today, the trading volume remaining at low values would suggest that the wider market isn’t finding the rally interesting enough to make moves on the network. Naturally, if the rally has to go on for an extended period, volumes may have to return to the market. There is also the fact that the SOL funding rates (a measure of the periodic fee that futures traders are exchanging between each other) on Binance and DyDx have become quite positive recently. Longs are dominating the market | Source: Santiment From the graph, it’s visible that the earlier increase in the asset’s price may have been helped by shorts being liquidated in the market – as the funding rates had been highly negative then. As long contract holders are the majority force in the futures market now, the chances of a long squeeze taking place are higher now. In this case, if one does take place, the price would feel a bearish effect. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $20, up 20% in the last week.

The draft document, seen by CoinDesk, also proposes relaxing regulations to aid innovation, and says it wants to look at the legal barriers to new forms of digital cooperation like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  “Virtual worlds bring unprecedented opportunities in many societal areas,” said the document, a version of which is due to be published next week, citing benefits for healthcare, education and culture. “This technological shift also involves new forms of global governance.”  International engagement on topics such as technological standards, identity management, censorship and surveillance is needed to ensure the next generation of the internet “is shaped as an open, secure space, respectful of EU values and rules,” the document said.  “The Commission will support the creation of a technical multi-stakeholder governance process to address essential aspects of virtual worlds and Web4 that are beyond the remit of existing internet governance institutions,” the document said, likely referring to the global bodies that underpin today’s online world such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  The commission said it wants by the end of this year to explore the potential of new digital cooperation models, such as decentralized autonomous organizations, which underpin many novel financial applications – and will carry out a study to “identify legal, administrative and economic barriers that prevent their uptake.”  Early next year it will promote “regulatory sandboxes” to test out short-term projects under a lighter regime, the document said. The paper also warns of the risk of large “gatekeeper” companies blocking out competition from rivals, and counterfeit goods undermining brands.  The document was promised by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in September of last year, and officials have said they want the metaverse to preserve EU values such as privacy and fundamental rights. A spokesperson for the commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sweet August For Shiba Inu Army Scheduled for August 15-16, 2023, ETHToronto and the Blockchain Futurist Conference will provide the perfect backdrop for Shiba Inu’s grand unveiling.

The SHIB community can expect an immersive experience, featuring presentations, demonstrations, and discussions that will reshape the future of Shiba Inu’s decentralized finance and governance. The highlight of these events will undoubtedly be the introduction of Shibarium, the highly anticipated cornerstone of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. Shibarium aims to push the boundaries of scaling Ethereum, providing innovative solutions for the Shiba Inu community. The long-awaited L2 holds immense potential for revolutionizing the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Remarkably, the event is not only about Shibarium.

Furthermore, all projects that expressed interest in building with Shibarium Tech will be showcased at the conferences.

Additionally, discussions and potential releases of the long-awaited L2 Shibarium are highly likely. SHIB Is Up 3% With the news, the countdown to the eagerly awaited Blockchain Futurist Conference, where Shiba Inu will take center stage, has begun, and with it, possibly, a renewed SHIB hype. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00000758 and has risen around 3% since the publication of Kusama’s blog post. This puts the SHIB price on the verge of a possible breakout from the downtrend channel that has been in place since early February. A significant rise above $0.000008 towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.00000831) and a subsequent breakout above this resistance is needed to avoid a fakeout.

14572576,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541463,1688634060,Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Registers 28% Gain – How Long Will It Last?,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is captivating the attention of the crypto community with its ongoing price surge. The recent inclusion of BCH on EDX, a Citadel Securities-backed crypto exchange, has sparked fresh interest in this digital asset. As investors eagerly monitor its progress, the price of BCH on CoinGecko stands at $291.80, showcasing a 24-hour rally of nearly 7% and an impressive seven-day surge of 27.5%. Source: Coingecko The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has contributed to the positive trajectory of BCH. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, investors are seeking alternatives beyond the traditional giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and BCH has emerged as a viable contender. However, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin Cash can sustain its current bullish streak. BCH Whales Pause Buying Spree Amidst Price Surge While the recent listing on EDX has undoubtedly played a part in this rally, on-chain data reveals an intriguing aspect of the price surge. A cluster of Bitcoin Cash whales holding significant amounts of 1 million to 10 million coins has emerged as a pivotal player in driving last month’s rally. Source: Santiment Between June 21 and June 30, these BCH whales accumulated 170,000 coins, which amounted to approximately $52.4 million in value. Their substantial purchases had a significant impact on the asset’s price, as whales possess substantial financial power and strategic influence on other investors. When whales buy more coins, it often leads to an increase in the asset’s price. Related Reading: Recent 800 Billion Shiba Inu Dump Has Short Traders Worried – Here’s Why However, an interesting development emerged in July. The same cluster of BCH whales, who were actively accumulating coins during the June rally, has conspicuously paused their buying spree. Specifically, between July 1 and July 4, their total BCH balances remained relatively stable, hovering around 1.51 million coins. BCH market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The Future Trajectory Of Bitcoin Cash The whales’ decision to halt their buying activity raises questions about the current market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin Cash. Are these whales taking a cautious approach, waiting to assess the market before making further moves? Or does their pause indicate a temporary lull in the BCH price surge? Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor Understanding the behavior of large-scale investors such as whales is essential in predicting market trends. Their actions often influence the sentiments and decisions of other traders and investors. The temporary pause in their buying activity could potentially impact the short-term price dynamics of Bitcoin Cash. As the market eagerly watches Bitcoin Cash, the question arises as to whether the recent price surge can be sustained without the continued support of these influential whales. The coming weeks will shed light on the market’s overall sentiment and the role these whales will play in shaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin Cash.

42419984,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlY5,1688633630,Bittrex Faced Enforcement Action From Florida Regulator Ahead of Bankruptcy,"Crypto exchange Bittrex Inc. was accused of violating multiple Florida laws by the U.S. state's financial regulator ahead of the platform's bankruptcy filing in May, court filings from Wednesday show.  The filing by Brandon Greenberg, assistant general counsel to the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR), opposes a request by Bittrex Inc. for Automatic Stay, which would block certain creditors from starting or continuing to taking action against a bankrupt estate. Greenberg states the regulator had advised U.S.-based Bittrex Inc. on exploring avenues for settling charges against it.  The platform was accused – among other things – of failing to segregate customer assets with the company’s operating capital and ""failure to maintain a surety bond in the correct amount at all times.""  ""Deciding which of those violations to charge or not charge in our Administrative Complaint falls squarely within the OFR’s administrative discretion,"" Greenberg argued in his declaration.  The filing says that between October 2022 and March 2023, the OFR worked with financial regulators from Texas, Maryland and Michigan on a ""multistate examination of Bittrex Inc.""  On March 31, Bittrex Inc. announced it was winding down its U.S. operations, citing an uncertain ""regulatory and economic environment.""  Following its investigation, the OFR issued a three-count complaint to the exchange platform on April 17, Greenberg said in Wednesday's filing. On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm of violating federal laws by operating a securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The OFR advised the company to follow administrative procedure if it was interested in ""having a more substantive discussion and possibly explore avenues for settlement,"" the filing said.  According to Greenberg, the exchange later expressed its ""disappointment"" that the OFR had taken enforcement action instead of letting the company surrender its license and leave Florida. The platform also did not reveal plans for file for bankruptcy at that time, Greenberg said.  While Bittrex Inc. surrendered its money transmitter license on April 30, counsel for the platform also ""stridently asserted"" that although it ""may have had regulatory issues in the past, it had been compliant with Florida law since then.""  ""In response, I explained how the OFR’s examination findings revealed recent conduct by Bittrex Inc. that violated several provisions of chapter 560, Florida Statutes, which indicated an ongoing pattern of noncompliance with our money services business laws, and that it was within our administrative discretion in deciding which legal violations to charge and not charge in our Administrative Complaint,"" Greenberg said.  On May 8, the platform filed for bankruptcy in the state of Delaware.

42419972,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlMj,1688633518,"BlockFi Bankruptcy Plans Opposed by FTX, Three Arrows, and SEC","Proposals put forward by defunct crypto lender BlockFi are an abuse of bankruptcy rules, according to a Wednesday legal filing made by FTX, with over a billion dollars of disputed transactions at stake.  BlockFi’s plans, set to be discussed at a July 13 New Jersey court hearing, were also opposed by liquidated hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and by federal regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  FTX, which bailed out the troubled lender last year before itself filing for bankruptcy in November, says its sizable claims against BlockFi have been unfairly downgraded by the proposed plan.  “BlockFi Debtors believe some bankruptcy wand can be waived to make the FTX Debtors’ claims disappear… without satisfying basic procedural fairness and due process requirements” in a proposed wind-up plan filed in June, FTX said. “This is abuse of the plan process.”  FTX cites hundreds of millions of dollars of repayments and collateral linked to a loan with FTX’s trading arm Alameda Research, and $1 billion in collateral pledges made by Emergent Fidelity, a company set up by FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried to hold shares in Robinhood (HOOD).  The filings are an attempt to unravel complex financial transactions among crypto companies which are now undergoing separate bankruptcy cases as they attempt to repay customers and other creditors. BlockFi may also have claims against FTX in parallel proceedings being held in Delaware, to which FTX’s lawyers “expect to object,” the filing said.  Three Arrows Capital, which says it’s owed over $220 million by BlockFi, also protested that it wasn’t being given a chance to contest fraud allegations, while the SEC said proposed clauses to release BlockFi and its management were overly vague and broad.  After the SEC voiced similar objections in relation to crypto lender Voyager, legal delays meant Binance.US pulled out of its offer to buy the company. BlockFi’s creditors have also argued that its bankruptcy plan is a costly and elaborate way to free executives from legal responsibility for poor financial decisions, and have said the company should simply be liquidated.

It has emerged that if a majority of commissioners from the CFTC agree with the conclusion, then the regulator could file a case against Mashinsky in federal court later this month. Mashinsky Broke Rules The United States Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced the conclusion of its probe into Celsius Network. According to attorneys from the regulator’s enforcement unit, Celsius and Mashinsky deliberately misled investors and broke several of the country’s investment laws before the firm’s eventual collapse in 2022. The CFTC revelations come a year after Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and left thousands of customers, creditors, and investors in the lurch. The New York Attorney General had sued Mashinsky on the 5th of January, 2023, alleging that the former Celsius CEO had misled investors, resulting in losses of billions of dollars. “I’m suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform @CelsiusNetwork for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. Alex Mashinsky lied to people about the risks of investing in Celsius, hid its deteriorating financial condition, and failed to register in New York.” The New York Attorney General stated at the time that Mashinsky had defrauded investors, including 26,000 residents of New York State, out of billions of dollars worth of crypto. She added that Mashinsky’s actions leading up to the Celsius bankruptcy led to significant investor losses as he misrepresented the platform’s financial condition. “As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. “The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses.” CFTC Could File Lawsuit Against Celsius According to reports, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission attorneys believe that Celsius misled investors. They also added that the crypto lender should have registered itself with the CFTC. According to sources close to the matter, the CFTC could initiate the filing of a federal case against Celsius if a majority of its commissioners agree with the conclusion that the crypto lender misled investors and customers. Court filings have also revealed that the bankrupt crypto lender was under scrutiny from several federal agencies. These include the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), The Washington Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division, and the Massachusetts Securities Division. As a result of these developments, the platform’s native CEL token has seen a 12% drop in value. Currently, the token is trading at $0.15. Fahrenheit To Acquire Celsius Assets Meanwhile, it was revealed last month that crypto consortium Fahrenheit won the bid to acquire Celsius Network’s assets after a successful bid. Fahrenheit beat fellow bidder NovaWulf, while the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC) was shortlisted as a backup. Fahrenheit’s winning consortium was backed by mining company US Bitcoin Corp, Arrington Capital, Ravi Kaza, Steven Kokinos, and Proof Group. Court filings revealed that Celsius Network’s assets were previously valued at $2 billion. The successful bid will see Fahrenheit acquire Celsius’s institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, mining units, and additional alternative investments.

The forecast is based on data that show a multimonth bull market comprising a meteoric surge in market value unfolds once prices confirm the end of a bear market, which they do by setting a 12-month high for the first time in at least a year.  That signal was triggered late last month after prices topped $31,000, the highest since June 2022. Previous signals occurred in August 2012, December 2015, May 2019 and August 2020, with prices rallying in the following years.  ""On June 22, 2023, bitcoin made a new one-year high, marking the first time in a year. This signal has historically indicated the end of bear markets and the start of new crypto bull markets,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a report shared with CoinDesk.  ""If history is any guide, bitcoin prices could climb by +123% over twelve months and by +310% over eighteen months – based on the average return of the signals triggered in 2015, 2019 and 2020. That would lift prices to $65,539 in twelve months and $125,731 over eighteen months,"" Thielen added.  Thielen ignored the 2012 signal and the subsequent 5,285% price rise in 2013, calling it an ""epic, out-of-proportion"" bull market.  Bitcoin changed hands near $30,700 at press time, CoinDesk data show.  Matrixport's view is consistent with bitcoin's tendency to chalk out sharp uptrends in the 12-18 months after the mining reward halves.

That the institutions have arrived there can no longer be any doubt. Blackrock is the biggest asset management company in the world with more than nine trillion dollars in assets under management. Larry Fink, the CEO of this company, was interviewed on Fox Business Network last night and gave no doubt at all as to his view that Bitcoin was an “international asset” and that it was “digitising gold”. This is a 180 degree turn around from someone who back in 2017 said that bitcoin was an “index of money laundering”. Whether he said this through ignorance or by design we shall probably never know, but Fink appears to now have full conviction in the number one cryptocurrency. Blackrock knows the game The Fox Business Network interviewer referred to the 575/1 batting average of Blackrock when it comes to getting its ETFs accepted by the regulators.

Fink’s own words were that “we work really closely with our regulators” and he went on to say that if the regulators found any particular issues, his company would work around that in order to “get the filing approved one day”. Bitcoin is an international asset The Blackrock CEO said that his company was a believer in “digitising products” and that he saw the future as tokenisation of assets and securities which would lead to a revolution in finance. Fink continued that his company wanted to “democratise crypto” and make it “much cheaper for investors”. He said that bitcoin was something that could be held as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the devaluation of any particular currency. He stated: “Lets be clear, Bitcoin is an international asset. It’s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative”. Bitcoin rises on the news After a couple of days of red price action, bitcoin is up 1% this morning and is looking strong. It can be expected that Fink’s statements last night will be taken very seriously by the market. Some more positive price action can be expected, and with bitcoin only just below the most important level of $31,000 the bull market is just beginning.

42419970,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlKf,1688629296,"EU Metaverse Strategy Set to Examine Privacy, Competition and Rights","The European Commission’s metaverse strategy due next week is delayed and won’t have real teeth – but there are real policy concerns about how virtual worlds will cope with policy issues like property rights, technological standards and privacy.  First announced by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as part of an annual address made back in September, a policy paper on virtual worlds has been put off as long as it could be. EU commissioners are due to agree to it next Tuesday; any later and they’d be running into preparations for the next edition of the State of the EU speech.  The commission has previously suggested the proposal won’t be legislative, discussing the policy issues rather than proposing a formal bill – but it might point the way towards stronger action in future.  The metaverse strategy is “the start of something, it sets the agenda,” said Patrick Grady, editor of Brussels-based website and research initiative Metaverse EU. “Once the machine gets moving it doesn’t really stop.”  Grady, who also leads the technology practice at consultancy Fourtold, points to the commission’s 2018 strategy on Artificial Intelligence – which, though it did little more than promise a stakeholder alliance and reinterpreted liability rules, proved the portent of more to come, and an AI bill followed in 2021.  That brings risks as well as opportunities. A clear regulatory framework is often welcomed by the industry, but EU rules in areas such as AI have proved controversial. The example of the bloc’s recent Data Act – nominally concerned with governing information gathered by connected objects like cars or fridges, but which some Web3 proponents worry could effectively make smart contracts illegal – shows there’s always the chance of unintended consequences.  European values  The commission has said the metaverse will need to embed “European values” – with officials specifying topics like discrimination, safety and data controls. A blog by Commissioner Thierry Breton, and a subsequent consultation from the commission, hinted at a more immediate EU fear – that Web3, like its predecessor, could be dominated by big players that squash competition.  That may include some familiar faces. Facebook has rebranded itself Meta (META) as it pivots towards a more immersive experience, and Apple’s (AAPL) move into the space could prove transformative.  At an April hearing, Meta’s EU Public Policy Director Aleksandra Kozik was cross-questioned by lawmakers interested in topics ranging from the impact of the technology on jobs, discrimination, and abuse by organized crime.  “The metaverse is not one single product that will be built by one company,” Kozik told members of the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee. “It is a constellation of platforms, technologies and products that will be built by many different stakeholders, by companies big and small.”  The commission may be skeptical of such analogies, given that it has often taken Meta to task for trying to be the brightest, if not the only, star in its firmament. Grammar might offer a clue as to the EU executive’s real thinking, Grady points out.  As with the internet, the whole point of the metaverse is that it’s a single unfragmented space – “siloed metaverses is almost the situation the EU’s trying to avoid,” Grady said.  Yet the commission’s own paper is about virtual worlds, plural – suggesting Meta’s might be one of several separate walled gardens – while Breton talks about both the metaverse, and about different metaverses.  One solution is to ensure that developers like Meta work within common international standards. But, as Grady points out, the EU’s own antitrust rules can sometimes stand in the way, since any grouping of supposed competitors is liable to be treated as a cartel.  Rights  Some in the digital sector see an opportunity in whatever the commission might announce.  “Virtual worlds are increasingly part of a modern, digital industry and this is where Europe excels, so we’d like to see a strategy that aims to support this,” a spokesperson for lobby group DigitalEurope told CoinDesk in an emailed statement, citing possibilities like cheaper online job training, and virtual factories and power grids.  But there’s plenty more legal quandaries raised by the metaverse – including basic rights.  “Personal property interests in virtual worlds are radically undermined” by the fine print in online terms and conditions, Joshua Fairfield, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, told lawmakers back in April. “The metaverse end-user license agreement beats the United States Constitution, because it acts under this concept of consent to replace many of the social rules that we take for granted.”  How to deal with those fundamental problems remains hotly debated – and, in particular, whether the metaverse is really so new that it needs its own rulebook.  “The metaverse is not being built in a regulatory vacuum,” Meta said in its response to the EU’s consultation, citing existing online laws that continue to apply. “To the extent that any novel or unique issues arise over time as the metaverse continues to evolve, we call upon the Commission to address any emerging legislative gaps on a case-by-case basis, using evidence-based policy development.”  For others, virtual worlds are a step change, given how much they rely on potentially invasive technology such as headsets and glasses.  Extended reality tech “poses substantial risks to human rights” and “could continue the march towards ever-more-invasive sensitive data collection and ubiquitous surveillance” by governments and corporations, even going into people’s thoughts and emotions, said a consultation response by online rights activists the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Does any of this matter for your average crypto fan? It likely will do, if the predictions of the commission’s own Joint Research Centre come true.  “Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are likely to be the technological building blocks of a decentralized infrastructure” that underpins the metaverse, a JRC report published Monday said.  That will be music to the ears of those who believe online virtual worlds require a radically different way of thinking than the centralized structures that came to dominate Web2. It also means metaverse regulation carries a risk for the crypto sphere.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/06/eu-metaverse-strategy-set-to-examine-privacy-competition-and-rights,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8b44e28797853501d3597fe6ca07c86a1c6d40f-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But what caused this massive sell-off and what does it mean for the future of Shiba Inu? This major token offloading extravaganza went down on Binance alone, with traders ditching their SHIB for USDT. The Buying Selling View indicator revealed that this frenzy took place from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. UTC. To understand the degree of the situation, let’s delve into the factors behind this recent market movement and explore the potential consequences for both short-term traders and long-term SHIB investors. What SHIB Offloading Means For Short-Term Traders When a massive token offloading event like the recent SHIB dump occurs, it creates a ripple effect that can have significant implications, especially for short-term sellers aiming for quick gains. Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor Token dumps often result in increased market volatility, causing sudden price drops and erratic fluctuations. For short-term traders, this can be both a bane and boon. On one hand, volatility presents opportunities for quick profits if they time their trades well. On the other hand, it also raises the risk of unexpected losses if the market turns against their positions. Source: TradingView Massive offloading events tend to put downward pressure on the token’s price. The increased supply flooding the market can lead to price depreciation, which may discourage short-term traders from entering or maintaining their positions. This, in turn, can impact the overall trading sentiment and make it harder for traders to secure favorable gains. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Sustains Weekly Run With 16% Gain – What Fuels It?

The recent court approval (June 30) granted the company permission to convert its altcoin holdings into the two leading digital assets, raising concerns about a potential sell-off of popular altcoins. Celsius Network, known for its altcoin lending services, has been undergoing bankruptcy proceedings since July 2022 when it filed for Chapter 11 protection, revealing liabilities of up to $10 billion. The recent court ruling allows Celsius to convert its altcoins into BTC and ETH starting from July 1. LINK, AAVE And SNX Sell-Off Due To Celsius Coming? According to on-chain analysis provider Lookonchain, Celsius has been actively transferring altcoins to different wallets. Most of the altcoins have been moved to wallet address “0x4131”. Remarkably, Celsius made its first swap today. Lookonchain tweeted: Note that Celsius seems to be starting to swap altcoins for BTC and ETH. Currently: Most of the altcoins have been transferred to wallet”0x4131″.

Yesterday, data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that Celsius moved around $70 million worth of altcoins and stablecoins to different wallets, including those related to crypto market maker Wintermute, crypto custodian Fireblocks, and stablecoin issuer Paxos. Related Reading: Blame The “Supermoon” If Bitcoin Crashes Or Rallies Towards $35,000 In July Today’s first swap of altcoins to Ethereum by Celsius Network raises concerns that the movements to new addresses was just the preparation for a potential sell-off for the aforementioned altcoins. LINK, AAVE and SNX could face a dump if Celsius sells these altcoins in one go, but the prices of MATIC, UNI, ZRX and BNB could also see a negative impact. It’s worth noting that while the court approval allows Celsius to convert altcoins into BTC and ETH, the exact details and timeline of the conversion process remain unclear. It is uncertain whether Celsius plans to sell all of its altcoins and in what proportion it intends to acquire BTC and ETH. Traders and investors holding the aforementioned altcoins should closely monitor market developments and prepare for possible market turbulence.

Celsius’ largest altcoin holding, Chainlink, could potentially see the most selling pressure, and the timing is conceivably bad. Just two weeks ago, the LINK price managed to climb back into the 1+ year trading range between $5.31 and $9.62. Earlier in the week, the LINK price was rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. A dump of Celsius could put the price in danger of falling again to the lower end of the trading range.

14563118,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541410,1688612436,"Blame The “Supermoon” If Bitcoin Crashes Or Rallies Towards $35,000 In July","If historical Bitcoin price performance leads, one trader is adamant that the coin is at a critical inflection point at spot rates. Based on astronomical patterns and moon arrangement, trading desk QCP Capital believes Bitcoin prices can swing higher in a bull run towards the $33,000 to $35,000 level, reversing following sharp losses in 2022. Conversely, after a recovery that has seen Bitcoin price rally 20% from mid-June 2023, there can be a contraction that may see the coin dip after an impressive performance in the past few trading weeks. Supermoons Coincide With Key Bitcoin Price Reversals Based on technical and fundamental actions, the trading desk cited the past performance of Bitcoin at different cyclical stages. For instance, when Bitcoin fell in the early days of 2020, primarily due to fears of the far-reaching consequences of lockdowns brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, it posted a 161% rally from early March to May 2020. The same was observed from mid-June to August 2022 when Bitcoin, at the depth of the last cyclical bear market, prices soared 43%. Marking peaks, Bitcoin corrected from the end of April to June 2021, falling 51% in a predominantly bullish market. According to the trading desk, major reversals in bearish and bullish runs occurred during a “supermoon.” In astrology, a supermoon is a full moon that forms when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth in its elliptical orbit. The moon appears brighter than usual during this time and happens only once or twice a year. A supermoon formed on July 4, and the trader believes Bitcoin is at a critical reaction point. Related Reading: AAVE Records 26% Weekly Gain, Looks To Break Key Resistance For years, there has been a belief that supermoons correlate with bullish markets. However, no scientific findings support this, and neither have statistical correlations. Still, based on the trader’s analysis, the multiple correlations and timing of peaks and bottoms of Bitcoin prices during supermoons can be used to predict BTC markets. Will Prices Rally Or Dump? While it is yet to be seen whether BTC will edge higher, breaking above $31,300 and rally towards the $35,000 zone, the trading desk says fundamental factors will play a critical role and remains bullish that BTC may rally to within the $33,000 to $35,000 liquidation zone. Overall, monitoring how the Federal Reserve of the United States will implement its monetary policies will be necessary in the future. Although inflation has been dropping, the trader observes that it has not fallen low enough to warrant a rate cut. Rate cuts tend to move the capital to store-of-value assets from which Bitcoin will likely benefit. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why On a more pessimistic side, the trading desk expresses caution saying BTC has strong resistance at spot levels since the recent leg up was most likely the fifth and the last wave from November 2022 lows. At the same time, the $33,000 to $35,000 resistance zone is a critical resistance trend line. For this reason, any dump may see BTC retest the $24,000 and $26,000 support zone.

Shibarium’s testnet, also known as Puppynet, launched on March 11 and has seen an increase in overall transaction count over the past 24 hours. Shibarium added almost a million transactions in a single day, catapulting past the 27 million mark and setting a new record. On June 13, a peak of 324,000 transactions was recorded, after which it slightly decreased over the following days. However, since June 19, the daily transactions have hovered around the 274,000 mark. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Records Surge In Daily New Addresses In Q2: A Sign Of Growing Interest? Consistent Growth In Wallet Links And Blocks Alongside transaction growth, the number of wallets linked to Shibarium continues to rise, albeit slower, according to Puppyscan data. The current count of linked wallets is over 17 million, with no substantial spikes recorded recently. The total blocks have increased to surpass 1.56 million, and the time required to create a new block has been reduced to 8.3 seconds. Notably, the community anticipates the official launch of Shibarium’s mainnet, with excitement fueled by a statement from the lead developer of Shiba Inu and Shibarium, the elusive Shytoshi Kusama. The developer informed the SHIB army about the planned “launch strategy” for Shibarium, noting that the date and time have been confirmed. The community speculates that the Shibarium mainnet could be launched between August 13 and 16 in Toronto, Canada, during the annual ETHToronto event. This event celebrates the creation of Ethereum, and given SHIB’s original launch on this blockchain, the community believes it would serve as a fitting tribute to Ethereum and its founder, Vitalik Buterin. Awaiting The Launch Of Shibarium Mainnet Kusama recently dropped a hint in a Telegram channel solely for Shibarium discussions, possibly confirming the theory regarding the mainnet’s launch date and location. Before this, he disclosed that Shiba Inu was “going somewhere” and clarified that this location would be outside the United States.

42419977,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUGlSv,1688606322,Circle Considers Issuing Stablecoin in Japan Under New Rules,"Circle is considering issuing a stablecoin in Japan, given that legislation governing stablecoins took effect on June 1, the payment services company's co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said.  In an interview with CoinDesk Japan, Allaire said that if stablecoins become more widely used for cross-border trade, foreign currency transactions and global commerce, Japan will become an extremely large market.  Japan's stablecoin bill makes it one of the first countries to establish a framework for the use of overseas stablecoins, which Allaire considers “the most important thing the government and the Financial Services Agency have done.”  He said that Circle is interested in partnerships in Japan, which he visited last month.  Japan’s revised Payment Services Act certifies stablecoins backed by legal tender as an “electronic payment method” and allows their issuance.  Stablecoin issuers will have to abide by tough rules. Stablecoins must be pegged to the yen or other legal tender and guarantee holders the right to redeem them at face value. Only licensed financial institutions like licensed banks, registered money transfer agents and trust companies will be able to issue stablecoins.  The country's Financial Services Agency moved to lift a ban on overseas stablecoins in December last year.  Circle recently obtained a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license in Singapore, which allows it to offer digital payment token services, cross-border money transfer services and domestic money transfer services in the city-state.  Major Japanese financial institutions have been exploring stablecoins, with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation announcing its plans to issue its own stablecoin platform, called Progmat.

Related Reading: Valkyrie Follows In BlackRock’s Footsteps, Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF At $14.87 billion, the total number of Bitcoin Options open interest at top trading platforms, mostly Deribit, CME, and OKX, stood at near all-time highs registered in October 2021 when prices went on to rally, printing all-time highs of over $69,000. On October 21, the total Bitcoin open interest stood at $15.06 billion, a record high that has never been broken. BTC Options At Near 2021 Peaks Many traders seem optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, as open interest remains high and trending near the peak levels of October 2021. With a strong close to the first half of 2023, the expectation is for prices to continue rising. The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching new highs in June 2023 at $31,300, could be seen as a sign of overall bullishness, similar to the period before prices reached over $69,000 in November 2021. This skew and apparent optimism can be shown by the distribution of “call” and “put” Bitcoin options across major crypto derivatives trading platforms of which Deribit dominates. For instance, as of July 5, over 65% of all Bitcoin options orders are “calls,” meaning more traders expect prices to rise from spot rates. At this level, roughly 206,000 BTC orders are placed as “calls.” Meanwhile, a minority of traders expect price contracts from spot rates towards $28,300 or lower in the coming months. About 99,000 BTC options have been placed as “puts” to align with traders’ expectations of worse prices in the coming months. Bitcoin Traders Bullish The same can be observed in trading patterns over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin prices falling 2% but staying above the $30,000 psychological level, most options traders are bullish since there are more “calls” than “puts.” Typically, Options give the contract holder the right or the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed price on or before the expiry date. Mostly, options contracted are used by traders to mitigate risks. More “calls” could mean more BTC traders are optimistic, expecting the coin to clear recent resistance levels. Based on recent trends, Options trading volumes have been decreasing on Deribit. After peaking at $3.29 billion on October 16, 2021, participation levels have been shrinking over the past 20 months.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $30,465, down slightly more than a percentage point over the past 24 hours. After surging above $31,000 in mid-June following multiple spot bitcoin ETF filings, BTC has remained mostly impervious to potential price catalysts, even as investor sentiment has brightened.  In an email to CoinDesk, Tim Frost, the CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App, wrote that the crypto market was likely transitioning from the 18-month bear market to more promising times. Frost noted parallels in the crypto 2019 crypto market when bitcoin stalled after emerging from a crypto winter before spiking again the following year.  ""We could be looking at that same period of stability around about now. Indeed, bitcoin has remained relatively stable over the past three months ranging between $28,000 and its current level of just below $31,000,"" Frost wrote. ""If we were to see a few more months of this, this would set the stage for a much more optimistic period in terms of price.""  Frost added that macroeconomic signals and crypto industry trends were pointing positively, including recent declines in inflation, the unveiling of a quantitative easing program in China, increased regulatory clarity in Singapore, Korea and Thailand to prevent the type of asset co-mingling that led to the implosion of disgraced exchange giant FTX and subsequent contagion. He also noted that the SEC was allowing bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius to sell altcoins for bitcoin and ether that it can then distribute to creditors and other clients.  Read More: Bankrupt Celsius Can Convert Altcoins to BTC, ETH Starting July 1 Following SEC Talks  ""We really are seeing a clearing of the decks in cryptocurrency,"" Frost wrote, ""and regulation is creating a landscape that will make it easier for everybody to operate. This, combined with some more stable and promising price signals, means that now may be a very good time to think long term.”  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,910, off 1.5% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red with ADA, the token of smart contracts platform Cardano, declining 3%. Litecoin, and popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB all recently dropped more than 2%.

U.S. stocks edged down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 falling 0.3% and 0.2%, despite Fed minutes showing some officials favoring a June rate hike. Central bankers have been wrestling with how to continue addressing annual inflation, which remains more than double their 2% goal without casting the U.S. economy into recession. The bank seemed to forge a compromise at its last meeting by halting its year-long diet of rate hikes while indicating in subsequent comments that it would pass two more rate hikes in 2023. The U.S. Labor Department will announce its next Consumer Price index on July 12, giving economic observers their next key read on price trends.  In recent months, equity and crypto prices have increasingly decoupled, a trend underscored by recent data from derivatives analytics firm Block Scholes.  Late Wednesday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink seemed to buoy crypto markets' prospects, telling Fox Business in an interview that crypto ""could revolutionize finance."" Last month, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, applied for a spot bitcoin ETF, spurring a mini-run of filings and re-filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by other prominent, financial services firms. The SEC has yet to approve a spot BTC ETF.  Read More: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Could ‘Revolutionize Finance’  “We believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities – that’s what bitcoin is – it could revolutionize finance,” he said, adding: “Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.”  Bitcoin traded sideways in the subsequent hours.

In Korea, one elected representative was referred to their parliamentary ethics committee after he disclosed that he owns a “significant amount of coins”, with a large holding consisting of GameFi platform WeMIX tokens.  To put into perspective how mainstream crypto is in Thailand, the Move Forward Party wasn’t “the” crypto party in the country’s recent elections. That honor goes to the Pheu Thai party, one of the other parties to form a governing coalition. The Pheu Thai party promised an airdrop of 10,000 THB (around $300) to every Thai citizen, although the Move Forward Party did make promises about integrating blockchain into government affairs to increase transparency.  Pita isn’t Prime Minister quite yet. Thai political procedure requires the House of Representatives and Senate to vote on who will be prime minister, and that could be an uphill battle.  But there is a chance that an elected leader of a major country in Asia will also be a bitcoin hodler. Isn’t that a sign of the times?
