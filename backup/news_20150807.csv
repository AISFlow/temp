One of the more curious observations included in documents recently released by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) was a submission from Deutsche Bank.  The letter, a response to ESMA's call for information on digital currencies, included the claim that the blockchain was already being widely used in the country's financial sector. The claim was cited by Deutsche Bank as an example of how blockchain technology is being used to solve complex problems in the world's financial markets.  When contacted for comment, Piret Putko, a representative for Eesti Pank, Estonia’s central bank, told CoinDesk that while there is activity among the country’s banks to develop products based on the technology, there is no nationwide effort to broadly integrate banking and the blockchain.  Putko noted:  “I guess that blockchain is expected to be put into operation in Estonia soon because one of our banks is developing new products which will be based on blockchain. But, it certainly does not give us the right to say that Estonian banking infrastructure is secured with a blockchain.”  He added that Deutsche Bank may have confused an existing card security system with the blockchain concept.  Putko's refers to ongoing projects at LHV Bank, a major domestic bank that has been conducting experiments with bitcoin and earlier this year developed a wallet product for the digital currency.  When reached for comment, bank representative Priit Rum echoed this sentiment, suggesting that the two systems had been confused.  “Although for example we at LHV bank are experimenting with blockchain - this infrastructure has not been used that thoroughly here [in] Estonia,” he said.

42398574,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDLi,1438962660,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Mt Gox Erupts Again,"Bitcoin naysayers could not have hoped for a better week.  The arrest of Mark Karpeles – CEO of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – late last week all but ensured negative bitcoin coverage was broadcast far and wide.  The global media frenzy is perhaps unsurprising given our love of extremes. In this case, the magnitude of the losses (approximately $350m of customer funds) also made the story a winner in the eyes of editors.  Although this week's news cycle was mostly negative as a result, some journalists preferred to focus on more positive yet arguably more unimportant news.  Mt Gox stirs Japanese media  The fact that Mt Gox was based domestically, coupled with the magnitude of its financial losses, resulted in a mass-coverage of the arrest by local Japanese media outlets.  Sankei published a piece following Karpeles' arrest which sought to assess bitcoin's viability and credibility, highlighting its negative connotations.  A loosely translated excerpt read:  ""But unlike the general currency that is backed by the country's credit, the question mark is attached to the safety and reliability. In particular, anonymity is high, crime successfully exploits the difficult features .... in April, a man who was smuggling drugs from China using the bitcoin has been arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department.""  The piece called out for regulation, noting how bitcoin, like other payment methods, can be used for money laundering and financing terrorist activity. ""To hurry the actual situation, it's time to consider the specific laws and regulations.""  Mainichi Shimbun's piece, emphasized how the value of bitcoin fluctuates against fiat currencies, but also noted its potential in the remittance market and stated that its current market capitalisation amounts to approximately ¥500bn.  More complicated were the reporter's interpretations of developments within the bitcoin industry, which sometimes drew correlations between arguably unrelated events.  ""On the other hand, transactions on the Internet because of the center are also associated with the risk of cyberattack. Immediately after Mt Gox bankruptcy, Canadian exchanges closed and a large amount of bitcoin has been drawn in the unauthorised access,"" the piece read.  Western coverage  Mark Karpeles' arrest equally captured the Western media's attention, which should come as no surprise to those who have been following the case since Mt Gox collapsed in early 2014.  A quick Google news search with the words ""Mark Karpeles"", ""bitcoin"" and ""arrest"" brought up over 300 news articles, roughly equalling that of what was produced by Japanese outlets.  The volume of coverage resulted in articles from a wide range of mainstream outlets including the BBC, The Guardian, Time, Business Insider an CNN. Similarly to some Japanese outlets, most like the Daily Mail also touched upon the need for regulation in the industry.  The piece noted:  ""Japanese authorities have previously acknowledged they were baffled by the Mt Gox case because they had never dealt with possible crime dealing with bitcoin. Experts also said it might be difficult to take action because of the absence of laws over virtual currencies.""  Breath of fresh air  There was a time when bitcoin merchant adoption was actually news, but times are changing. If 2014 was the year of merchant bitcoin adoption, 2015 has seen major entities emphasize the capabilities of bitcion as a distributed database system.  According to CoinDesk's State of Bitcoin Q2 2015, the rate of growth in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants continues to lag below that of previous quarters.  The fundamental challenge for bitcoin as a medium of exchange, the report said, is the lack of compelling reasons for mainstream consumers to use the digital currency, something that was not lost on the press even as they widely covered such a story this week.  Writing for TechCrunch, John Biggs, said:  ""I'm not a big fan of 'X accepts bitcoin' type of post but this one is near and dear to my heart – and actually interesting. LOT Polish airlines, the official Polish air carrier, is now accepting bitcoin. What does that mean? It means that you'll soon be able to pay BTC to go KRK.""  Despite seeming unenthused by the bitcoin integration, Biggs continued to note that Poland was a leader in payments with a number of clever smaller banks offering more near-field communication (NFC) and bitcoin payment options than elsewhere in Europe.  With every nascent industry comes progress. Take the Internet for example – an overdone comparison albeit a useful one – and its decentralised, open-source code, state of development and disruptive potential and how far it has come since its days of early inception in the 1950s.  Now consider how far bitcoin has come since it first burst on to the scene. Still think an airline in Poland accepting bitcoin payments is that interesting?  USA Today did, noting that LOT Polish Airlines joined a small, but growing group of airlines that list ""the software-based currency"" alongside other payment options.  The piece added:  ""Don't be surprised if most airlines begin offering you the option to pay for your flight with bitcoins.""

42398563,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDBs,1438956823,Vitalik Buterin: On Public and Private Blockchains,"Vitalik Buterin is a programmer and writer. He founded Ethereum, a decentralized web 3.0 publishing platform, for which he won the World Technology Award in 2014. In this article, he explores the differences between public and private blockchains and the pros and cons of both.  Over the last year, the concept of 'private blockchains' has become very popular in the broader blockchain technology discussion.  Essentially, instead of having a fully public and uncontrolled network and state machine secured by cryptoeconomics (eg proof-of-work, proof-of-stake), it is also possible to create a system where access permissions are more tightly controlled, with rights to modify or even read the blockchain state restricted to a few users, while still maintaining many kinds of partial guarantees of authenticity and decentralization that blockchains provide.  Such systems have been a primary focus of interest from financial institutions and have, in part, led to a backlash from those who see such developments as either compromising the whole point of decentralization or being a desperate act of dinosaurish middlemen trying to stay relevant (or simply committing the crime of using a blockchain other than bitcoin).  However, for those who are in this fight simply because they want to figure out how to best serve humanity, or even pursue the more modest goal of serving their customers, what are the practical differences between the two styles?  First, what exactly are the options at hand? To summarize, there are generally three categories of blockchain-like database applications:  1. Public blockchains  A public blockchain is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process – the process for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current state is.  As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These blockchains are generally considered to be “fully decentralized”.  2. Consortium blockchains  A consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid.  The right to read the blockchain may be public, or restricted to the participants, and there are also hybrid routes such as the root hashes of the blocks being public together with an API that allows members of the public to make a limited number of queries and get back cryptographic proofs of some parts of the blockchain state. These blockchains may be considered “partially decentralized”.  3. Fully private blockchains  A fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions are kept centralized to one organization. Read permissions may be public or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Likely applications include database management, auditing, etc internal to a single company, and so public readability may not be necessary in many cases at all, though in other cases public auditability is desired.  Distinctions  In general, so far there has been little emphasis on the distinction between consortium blockchains and fully private blockchains, although it is important: the former provides a hybrid between the “low-trust” provided by public blockchains and the “single highly-trusted entity” model of private blockchains, whereas the latter can be more accurately described as a traditional centralized system with a degree of cryptographic auditability attached.  However, to some degree there is good reason for the focus on consortium over private: the fundamental value of blockchains in a fully private context, aside from the replicated state machine functionality, is cryptographic authentication.  There is no reason to believe that the optimal format of such authentication provision should consist of a series of hash-linked data packets containing Merkle tree roots; generalized zero knowledge proof technology provides a much broader array of exciting possibilities about the kinds of cryptographic assurances that applications can provide their users.  In general, I would even argue that generalized zero-knowledge-proofs are, in the corporate financial world, greatly underhyped compared to private blockchains.  For now, I will thus focus on the simpler “private versus public” blockchain discussion. In general, the idea that there is “one true way” to be blockchaining is completely wrong headed, and both categories have their own advantages and disadvantages.    Private blockchain advantages  First, private blockchains. Compared to public blockchains, they have a number of advantages:  1. Rule changing  The consortium or company running a private blockchain can easily, if desired, change the rules of a blockchain, revert transactions, modify balances, etc. In some cases, eg national land registries, this functionality is necessary; there is no way a system would be allowed to exist where Dread Pirate Roberts can have legal ownership rights over a plainly visible piece of land, and so an attempt to create a government-uncontrollable land registry would in practice quickly devolve into one that is not recognized by the government itself.  Of course, one can argue that one can do this on a public blockchain by giving the government a backdoor key to a contract; the counter-argument to that is that such an approach is essentially a Rube Goldbergian alternative to the more efficient route of having a private blockchain, although there is in turn a partial counter-argument to that that I will describe later.  2. Known validators  The validators are known, so any risk of a 51% attack arising from some miner collusion in China does not apply.  3. Cheaper transactions  Transactions are cheaper, since they only need to be verified by a few nodes that can be trusted to have very high processing power, and do not need to be verified by ten thousand laptops.  This is a hugely important concern right now, as public blockchains tend to have transaction fees exceeding $0.01 per tx, but it is important to note that it may change in the long term with scalable blockchain technology that promises to bring public-blockchain costs down to within one or two orders of magnitude of an optimally efficient private blockchain system.  4. Well-connected nodes  Nodes can be trusted to be very well-connected, and faults can quickly be fixed by manual intervention, allowing the use of consensus algorithms which offer finality after much shorter block times.  Improvements in public blockchain technology, such as Ethereum 1.0’s uncle concept and later proof of stake, can bring public blockchains much closer to the “instant confirmation” ideal (eg. offering total finality after 15 seconds, rather than 99.9999% finality after two hours as does Bitcoin), but even still private blockchains will always be faster and the latency difference will never disappear as unfortunately the speed of light does not increase by 2x every two years by Moore’s law.  5. Privacy  If read permissions are restricted, private blockchains can provide a greater level of, well, privacy.  Given all of this, it may seem like private blockchains are unquestionably a better choice for institutions. However, even in an institutional context, public blockchains still have a lot of value, and in fact this value lies to a substantial degree in the philosophical virtues that advocates of public blockchains have been promoting all along, among the chief of which are freedom, neutrality and openness.  Public blockchain advantages  The advantages of public blockchains generally fall into two major categories:  1. Users protected from developers  Public blockchains provide a way to protect the users of an application from the developers, establishing that there are certain things that even the developers of an application have no authority to do. From a naive standpoint, it may be hard to understand why an application developer would want to voluntarily give up power and hamstring themselves. However, more advanced economic analysis provides two reasons why, in Thomas Schelling’s words, weakness can be a strength.  First, if you explicitly make it harder or impossible for yourself to do certain things, then others will be more likely to trust you and engage in interactions with you, as they are confident that those things are less likely to happen to them.  Second, if you personally are being coerced or pressured by another entity, then saying “I have no power to do this even if I wanted to” is an important bargaining chip, as it discourages that entity from trying to compel you to do it. A major category of pressure or coercion that application developers are at risk of is that by governments, so “censorship resistance” ties strongly into this kind of argument.  2. Network effects  Public blockchains are open, and therefore are likely to be used by very many entities and gain some network effects. To give a particular example, consider the case of domain name escrow.  Currently, if A wants to sell a domain to B, there is the standard counterparty risk problem that needs to be resolved: if A sends first, B may not send the money, and if B sends first then A might not send the domain.  To solve this problem, we have centralized escrow intermediaries, but these charge fees of three to six percent. However, if we have a domain name system on a blockchain, and a currency on the same blockchain, then we can cut costs to near-zero with a smart contract: A can send the domain to a program which immediately sends it to the first person to send the program money, and the program is trusted because it runs on a public blockchain.  Note that in order for this to work efficiently, two completely heterogeneous asset classes from completely different industries must be on the same database – not a situation which can easily happen with private ledgers.  Another similar example in this category is land registries and title insurance, although it is important to note that another route to interoperability is to have a private chain that the public chain can verify, btcrelay-style, and perform transactions cross-chain.  Necessity  In some cases, these advantages are unneeded, but in others they are quite powerful – powerful enough to be worth 3x longer confirmation times and paying $0.03 for a transaction (or, once scalability technology comes into play, $0.0003 for a transaction).  Note that by creating privately administered smart contracts on public blockchains, or cross-chain exchange layers between public and private blockchains, one can achieve many kinds of hybrid combinations of these properties.  The solution that is optimal for a particular industry depends very heavily on what your exact industry is. In some cases, public is clearly better; in others, some degree of private control is simply necessary.  As is often the case in the real world, it depends.
