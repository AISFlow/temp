42416877,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhCc,1377108145,Trsst to turn bitcoin addresses into blog IDs for encrypted messaging,"The pros and cons of online privacy have been much debated recently. Since the Edward Snowden fiasco, people have hailed sites that facilitate online anonymity as the best thing since sliced bread. However, there's a darker side to the concealment of identity that the internet provides – just look at the storm still brewing around Ask.fm after teenager Hannah Smith committed suicide having being bullied by anonymous users of the site.  With the above in mind, encrypted messaging platform Trsst will, potentially, be faced with praise from one camp and resistance from the other. The platform, which is currently in development, will allow users to send messages secretly and anonymously, if they so desire.  It will be something like a cross between social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and blog sites like WordPress, except public posts will be search indexable by anyone and private messages really will be private.  Each user will have a keypair for each Trsst blog they own, and the public key will also be the globally unique identifier for the blog. As this keypair is generated in the same way that bitcoin payment addresses are generated, each Trsst blog ID is therefore a valid destination payment address for bitcoin.  The man behind Trsst, technology entrepreneur Michael Powers, said: ""This opens up tremendous room for innovation in content micropayment monetization, including for example 'tipping' a blogger when you like a post, or being able to charge for an article you wrote based on who is syndicating it and how many views it gets.""  Private messages  Powers spoke to CoinDesk about the lack of privacy Twitter and Facebook users have, explaining both are corporations that operate under license from the US government.  ""This means their shareholders and directors can, at any time, direct the executives to make or break any privacy promises to their user base, and the government can compel or even appropriate their user data by law or executive order.""  Powers explained that a private direct message sent on Trsst is encrypted with the recipient's public key. The recipient then has to use their private key to open the message, which means the information and photos contained can't be intercepted by anyone but the addressee.  This feature could fill the void left by the closure of Lavabit and Silent Circle's Silent Mail service, but only if Trsst receives the funding required to complete development. It has so far raised over $5,600 of its $48,000 goal and has 23 days to go until the funding period ends.  Public posts  Powers, who once worked in financial services and then on ""top-secret military stuff"", said existing RSS readers will be able to parse and read the posts users decide to set as public (private messages will appear as blocks of encoded text).  A user's Trsst client, which will typically be a web browser but could also be a native app, encodes and signs their public posts with each entry's signature, incorporating the signature of the previous entry, forming what is called a ""blog chain"".  ""This allows you to prove your entries were not modified or censored or suppressed, which is important if you're a dissident in a dangerous country trying to communicate with your followers,"" Powers explained.  The user's client maintains a copy of their blog chain, but it also exists in cached copies throughout the Trsst federation of servers. People can push updates to any server to update the distributed copy and they can pull others' blog chains from any server just by searching by blog ID.  ""This makes it very hard blacklist or filter out Trsst blogs and even harder to make sense of site logs and traffic patterns. This is important if you're trying to get information into or out of a country with a repressive regime,"" Powers said.  Crime and trolling  Not everyone sees the preservation of privacy that Trsst will afford as a positive thing. There are legitimate concerns people could take advantage of the encrypted messaging system to aid their criminal activities. Criminals would find it a lot easier to plan terrorist attacks or drug deals, for example, if they could send messages safe in the knowledge the police wouldn't be able to have a nosey.  Not only this, but it could facilitate trolling, allowing people to bully others under the cloak of anonymity. Baroness Susan Greenfield, a neuroscientist and professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, spoke on this topic just last week at the Edinburgh International Book Festival.  Computers have given ""spiteful people"" the opportunity to share their ""monstrous"" views without paying attention to normal social concerns, the Telegraph reports her as saying.  ""Of course there's always been bullying, there's always been spiteful people. But until the screen gave a platform and the cyberworld gave them a means of expression and an anonymity, we have always been constrained,"" Greenfield said.  ""It's not that the blogosphere is making people like that; it's like Lord of the Flies. It's giving people the chance to express the worst side of human nature which is normally constrained by body language,"" the Baroness explained.  Powers recognises that crime and cyberbullying are big issues, but suggested he values lack of privacy as being a greater problem.  ""I don't pretend this isn't disruptive technology, but it does boil down to a fundamental rights issue. If we allow censorship, people will be censored. If we allow surveillance, people will be surveilled. My take is that there are a lot of people in a lot of countries with bigger problems than cyberbullying, and life and liberty is an overriding consideration,"" he explained.  Safety measures  On Monday, Ask.fm announced measures it's going to implement to improve its safety policy, including a more visible button that people can use to report abuse, plus a dedicated report category for 'bullying and harassment'. From October, people will also be able to opt out of receiving questions from anonymous users, and in January, the company will hire a safety officer to moderate comments on the site.  Powers said Trsst users will be able to choose between a number of hosting providers and each provider will be responsible for the establishing their own terms and conditions relating to user safety as well as adhering to local laws governing freedom of speech.  He said that in the UK, for example, content hosting services have to be careful because laws against libel are very strong and hosts can be held to account for disparaging remarks they serve.  ""You could imagine UK hosting providers flagging certain Trsst IDs and refusing to serve or relay their content if it is reported as harassment. The same could be true for any hosting provider in any jurisdiction,"" Powers added.

42416884,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhQq,1377105402,Blockchain.info issues refunds to bitcoin theft victims,"Another bug has been discovered in a bitcoin wallet, leading to the theft of around 50 bitcoins. This time, Blockchain.info's web wallet was at fault, and the company is now offering refunds to users who lost bitcoins due to the flaw.  The popular Blockchain website primarily offers market data and serves as the main block chain explorer for the bitcoin currency. However, users can also create web-based wallets to send and receive bitcoins. The bug lies in the random number generator that the web wallet uses to sign bitcoin transactions. The random numbers are generated in web browsers using the JavaScript programming language. It was discovered on Monday, when a bitcoin user reported that he had 1.8 BTC (around $223) stolen.  ""Funds from other addresses in this wallet were not affected. This leads me on thoughts that Blockchain.info or Firefox may have some weakness in random number generator like the vulnerability was recently found in the Android, [sic]"" he said.  This bug follows another random generator flaw found in the Android operating system earlier this month. That flaw affected the generation of private keys for bitcoin addresses. The repetition of random numbers enabled attackers to determine the private keys of users' wallets, which in turn enabled them to take ownership of the bitcoin addresses associated with those keys.  Multiple Android clients were affected by that flaw (including Blockchain.info's client, for which it issued a patch). But this latest flaw affected Blockchain.info's browser client, its Chrome and Firefox extensions, and its Mac OSX app.  Unlike the Android bug, this flaw only affected the signing of transactions, rather than the creation of private keys, confirmed Blockchain's Ben Reeves (aka Piuk) on the Bitcointalk forum. Firefox was particularly vulnerable to a poor seeding of its random number generator, he added.  ""Unlike the Android issue the RNG [random number generator] used to generate private keys was not affected so wallets do not need to be re-keyed,"" Reeves told CoinDesk. ""As long as your client is up to date for future transactions you will not be at risk.""  Blockchain.info has now patched the bug. Users must make sure they are using the following client version numbers:  Chrome extension - v2.85  Firefox extension - v1.97  Mac client - v0.11  Also, those who just use the web wallet (without a plugin) should clear their browser cache before using the Blockchain website.  Another forum user advised USA-based forum members that there is possible legal redress via federal laws against criminal wire fraud.  When asked about the identity of the attacker(s), Reeves confirmed that the attacker is an individual and that all stolen funds have been sent to the following address: 1HKywxiL4JziqXrzLKhmB6a74ma6kxbSDj.  Significantly, funds transferred to that account also include funds taken from Android users earlier this month, suggesting that the same person could be behind the theft of bitcoins using both bugs.  For those looking to recover lost funds, Reeves told us: ""If someone thinks they have had funds stolen, if it is due to this bug it is very likely the coins will have been sent to the above address. If in doubt they can contact help@blockchain.info and I will investigate further. Only a couple of BTC have been refunded so far.""  Reeves hinted at a glimmer of hope for lost funds: ""It depends on [the attacker's] intentions, but there is still a possibility they might return the funds."" But the prevailing message is: don't bank on it.  A Blockchain.info representative said that Reeves had issued the (aforementioned) patches within hours of the flaw being detected, and added: ""This is a truly amazing turnaround time.""  A list of the addresses affected by the random number generator bugs on both Blockchain and Android were published on the Bitcoin forum, and has also been updated with new finds. He told us: ""If someone thinks their money was stolen due to this exploit, they should check if their bitcoin address is on the list. If it is, contact us at: https://blockchain.info/support-desk. If it isn't, then you were not a victim of this exploit.""  Have you lost bitcoins? Have you been refunded?

42416885,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhIi,1377097511,CoinDesk launches bitcoin information centre,"CoinDesk has launched a bitcoin information centre designed to educate people about bitcoin. It contains guides on everything from the very basics of digital currency to how to set up your own bitcoin mining rig.  The guides target both beginners and intermediate bitcoin users, helping to boost their knowledge of key topics.  As we looked through online discussions about bitcoin and spoke to people outside the bitcoin world about the currency, frequent questions kept coming up. People didn't understand what gave bitcoin value, or where bitcoins came from. They had no idea how or where to buy them, and even less of a clue about how to spend them. So, CoinDesk decided to build a resource that would help provide the answers. We have conducted months of research to make sure our guides are exhaustive and contain the most important and up-to-date information.  The initial guides contained in the information centre are designed to get people started with the basics of mining, buying, and trading bitcoins. The following pages are accessible:  What is bitcoin?  Why use bitcoin?  How can I buy bitcoins?  How to store your bitcoins.  Is bitcoin legal?  How do bitcoin transactions work?  How bitcoin mining works.  How to set up a bitcoin miner.  Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?  The Satoshi page includes a piece of information that we hadn’t seen elsewhere, disproving the claim that bitcoin.org was originally registered in Finland. The Finland premise helped fuel one theory that three security experts authored the Bitcoin protocol (one of whom had travelled to Finland shortly before the website was registered). In fact, browsing a history of WHOIS registrations reveals that the site was originally registered in Japan, and only moved to Finland later.  CoinDesk has also produced a glossary of terms, designed to be the definitive dictionary for all things bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related. This glossary contains over 100 terms, covering not only the technology behind bitcoin, but also some fundamental economic terms, which are becoming more important as it matures and more sophisticated markets emerge. So, if you've ever wondered what an orphan block is, how the Buttonwood project got its name, or how OTC trading differs from a conventional exchange, you can find out about it here.  These guides are written in plain language, and designed not to be daunting. Bitcoin has historically been a difficult world for non-technical people to enter. Now, as more companies begin building commercial services around the currency, as legislators officially state that it is money, and as the industry engages regulators to help ease it into the mainstream, it is more important than ever that non-specialists are given easier access to the fundamental underlying concepts.  Access these guides to find out how a bitcoin wallet works (and how you can use paper to store a digital coin), how you can buy and spend bitcoins without ever having to go through the cumbersome paperwork involved with an exchange, who pays for bitcoin transactions and who reaps the rewards.  There are plenty of guides to look through now, but we'll continue adding more, so keep checking back to see what's new. If you think there is something missing or have an idea for a guide, please get in touch by emailing us at contact@coindesk.com.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/21/coindesk-launches-bitcoin-information-centre,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a6a1d63c1b02ce0fc5b0198b3f634d810960718-1988x1278.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
