30770168,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629101,1720652416,Solana Primed For Massive Gains: Crypto Pundit Forecasts $600 Price Target,"In recent weeks, Solana (SOL), the 5th largest cryptocurrency on the market, experienced a period of decline, hitting a two-month low of $121 on Friday. The coin’s value struggled to break above the $188 level in May, resulting in a continuous downtrend further exacerbated over the past seven days with the general market’s correction. However, crypto analyst Jelle has sparked optimism by suggesting the potential for substantial gains for SOL in the coming months, reminiscent of the fabled “Solana Summer” of 2021. Analyst Draws Parallels To 2021’s “Solana Summer” Jelle took to social media to share an analysis of SOL’s price action, drawing parallels between its current behavior and the events of the summer of 2021. The analyst noted months of consolidation, characterized by lower highs while maintaining support above the $120 level. Jelle emphasized that SOL is rebounding from the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) midlevel, mirroring the pattern observed in July 2021. Encouraged by these similarities, Jelle boldly believed in Solana’s future, setting a target of $600 for this market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Solana Goes ‘Parabolic Soon’ As Firedancer Draws Closer During the Solana Summer of 2021, the price of SOL more than tripled between July and November. The coin’s market capitalization grew significantly from a pre-summer low of $10 billion to an impressive high of $63 billion by the end of the year, eventually leading the SOL’s price to its current all-time high of $259. Jelle’s optimistic outlook implies the potential for even greater gains this time. A surge from the current trading price of $141 to $600 would represent a remarkable 352% increase, surpassing the coin’s current value. Nevertheless, Solana faces immediate resistance just above its current trading price at $143, a formidable barrier that has proven challenging for the token over the past six days. The subsequent targets are the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the $150 resistance level. The 200-day EMA has served as a crucial support level for the token over the past six months, contributing to its price appreciation in the first quarter of this year, reaching a yearly high of $210 on March 18. Regaining the 200-day EMA would be imperative for Solana Bulls, as it would position the token to target and surpass its next obstacle at $170. Market Cap Sees Double-Digit Decline Delving into key financial metrics to gauge Solana’s blockchain performance and price correlation, Token Terminal data shows that Solana’s fully diluted market capitalization is $80.78 billion. However, this figure represents a decline of 11.9% over the past 30 days. Related Reading: Avalanche Aims Higher As Price Continues To Gain Pace Above $23.50 The circulating market capitalization of Solana, which considers the number of tokens actively trading in the market, currently amounts to $64.54 billion. Like the fully diluted market cap, this metric has experienced an 11.4% decrease in value over the past 30 days, along with SOL’s price. However, despite the recent market dip, Solana’s token trading volume over the past 30 days has remained relatively stable, with a trading volume of $77.37 billion, indicating continued interest from bullish investors.

42407867,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7DiE,1720650264,Crypto Exchange BitMEX Pleads Guilty to Violating the Bank Secrecy Act From 2015 to 2020,"BitMEX has pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), according to a Wednesday announcement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  According to newly published court documents, the Seychelles-based crypto exchange willfully failed to set up an adequate know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange between September 2015 and September 2020, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged the exchange with offering illicit crypto derivative trading services to U.S. customers and the DOJ charged four of the exchange’s employees with violating the BSA.  Until September 2020, BitMEX allowed customers to register and trade cryptocurrency basically anonymously, without providing any identifying information or documentation, and advertised itself as a place where retail customers could trade without real-name verification, the DOJ alleged. Because of the lax AML/KYC standards, prosecutors say, BitMEX became a destination for money laundering and sanctions violations.  Additionally, according to court documents, the company and its executives made false statements to an unnamed international bank to convince the bank to open a bank account for a shell company called Shine Effort Inc. Limited, ultimately controlled by Delo, for which BitMEX was the beneficial owner.  “As BitMEX’s founders and long-time employee admitted in federal court in 2022, the company, one of the leading cryptocurrency derivatives platforms in the world from 2015 to 2020, operated in the United States without any meaningful anti-money laundering program, as required by federal law,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a DOJ press release. “As a result, BitMEX opened itself up as a vehicle for large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion schemes, posing a serious threat to the integrity of the financial system. Today’s guilty plea indicates again the need for cryptocurrency companies to comply with U.S. law if they take advantage of the U.S. market.”  The 2020 charges against BitMEX’s three co-founders Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo – and its first employee, Gregory Dwyer – are nearly identical to the charge BitMEX pleaded guilty to, and concern the company’s actions over the same time period. The executives all previously pleaded guilty as well.  In a blog post, BitMEX called the charge ""old news"" and said: ""BitMEX has long since fully remediated its operations, and there is nothing new in this charge. We have accepted the BSA charge, will seek an expedited sentencing hearing, and argue that no further fine should be imposed, given the substantial amounts already paid by our founders under the BSA charges brought against them, and under our no admission/no denial settlements with the CFTC and FinCEN in 2021.""  ""Needless to say, this charge has no impact on our business operations. The BitMEX platform will continue to lead the market as the safest, most trusted, financially-stable, and professionally operated crypto derivatives exchange, employing new products and innovations month by month to many satisfied users,"" the post said.  A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment on why the charges against BitMEX as a company were filed four years after the same charges were filed against four of its executives.  BitMEX has not yet been sentenced. The case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl of the Southern District of New York (SDNY).

Chainlink FUD Could Lead Towards Bottom Formation According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LINK investors have just shown their largest capitulation event of the year. The indicator of relevance here is the “Network Realized Profit/Loss,” which keeps track of the net amount of profit or loss that Chainlink traders are realizing right now. The metric works by going through the blockchain history of each coin sold to see what price it was moved at before this. If this previous price for any coin was less than the spot price it’s being transferred at now, then the coin’s sale is realizing some profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Forming Pattern That Last Led To It Blasting Off Similarly, transactions of coins of the opposite type would lead to loss realization instead. The indicator adds up these profits and losses for the entire network and then calculates their difference to find the net situation. When the value of the Network Realized Profit/Loss is positive, it means the investors as a whole are realizing profits. On the other hand, the negative metric suggests that loss-taking is the dominant form of selling in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink Network Realized Profit/Loss over the past few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Chainlink Network Realized Profit/Loss has seen a negative spike recently, suggesting that LINK investors have realized some large losses. This significant loss-taking spree from the LINK traders has come as the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through a significant drawdown over the past few weeks. The coin is down almost 10% in the last seven days alone. Given this timing, it would appear that these investors have been scared by the bearish price action so much that they have decided to exit the market at a loss. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for another metric, the Age Consumed, which keeps track of whether dormant coins are moving. Related Reading: Solana Mirroring 2021 Bullish Pattern, Crypto Analyst Reveals It would seem like this indicator also spiked alongside the loss-taking from the investors, implying that even some holders previously sitting tight have been shaken out by the price plunge. This FUD in the market can benefit Chainlink, as historically, the asset has been more likely to bottom out when fear is ripe among the investors. As Santiment highlighted in the graph, a red spike in the indicator also proved bullish for LINK in April. LINK Price Chainlink is trading around $12.8 when writing, down around 3% over the last 24 hours.

42407872,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Dyl,1720643278,"As DOE Preps for Take Two of Controversial Crypto Mining Survey, Industry Weighs in","After the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) first attempt to survey crypto mining companies about their energy usage was kneecapped by a lawsuit, the department is getting ready to try again – but this time, it’s seeking input from crypto industry participants first.  The Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency within the DOE that oversees energy statistics and analysis, hosted a public webinar on Wednesday to hear comments from interested members of the public – including crypto miners and industry participants – about how such a survey should be crafted ahead of a planned rulemaking proposal to be published in the Federal Register.  In January, the agency floated a mandatory survey for nearly 500 “identified” commercial crypto miners, requiring them to respond with detailed data about their energy use or else risk civil and criminal penalties. The survey was authorized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which oversees federal agencies and administers the federal budget, as an emergency collection of data request, meaning it did not go through the normal notice and comment process.  The proposal was immediately met with outrage from crypto miners, including Marty Bent, director at bitcoin mining firm Cathedra Bitcoin, who called the mandatory survey “Orwellian” in a blog post and expressed concern that it could be used to create a “hyper-detailed registry of mining operations” in the U.S.  The following month, the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC), an industry group, and mining company Riot Platforms filed suit against the DOE, EIA, OMB and various officials, accusing them of violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and calling for a temporary restraining order and injunction to suspend the survey until proper a notice and comment process had been observed.  The EIA ultimately agreed to temporarily suspend their survey in February – now, they’re taking another stab at it.  Take two  More than 100 attendees joined the EIA’s 45-minute webinar on Wednesday, and 10 people – including crypto miners, industry participants, researchers and one member of the public – spoke.  Bitcoin researcher Margot Paez, a PhD candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology and sustainability consultant at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, agreed that a survey needed to be conducted, but said the industry was “wary” of the EIA’s motives and suggested that an outside institution be selected to run the survey.  Lee Bratcher, president and founder of the Texas Blockchain Council, suggested that the EIA also include traditional data centers in its survey, and not just limit the request for information to crypto-focused data centers. The suggestion was seconded by Jayson Browner, senior vice president of government affairs at Marathon Digital Holdings, who said the industry would be “skeptical” of the survey if traditional data centers were cut out of the request.  “At this point we’re considering everything,” said Stephen Harvey, an official with the EIA, adding that including traditional data centers in the survey was “clearly on the table.”  Harvey said that the EIA is currently in the process of developing a preliminary proposal which is expected to be published in the Federal Register sometime this quarter. It will then go through a 60-day comment period during which the industry can respond to the proposal.  “At the end of that 60 days we will take all the information in as well, and we’ll look at that and make any adjustments based on new information that we think are necessary. We will respond to major issues that get raised in that process, and file a new posting for the federal registry,” Harvey said.  Following that, there will be a 30-day review process, Harvey explained, after which the decision on whether the EIA can move forward with its survey rests in the hands of the OMB.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/10/as-doe-preps-for-take-two-of-controversial-crypto-mining-survey-industry-weighs-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d80768f8386afa6cb173de4bc933a12403bb8103-1489x838.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407880,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7ESW,1720641709,"Bitcoin Price Decline on Germany, Mt. Gox and Miner Sell Pressure May Be Overblown: NYDIG","Bitcoin {{BTC}} has plunged 15% over the past month, with many market observers placing the blame on selling pressure from bitcoin mining operators, Mt. Gox refunds and, most recently, the German state of Saxony.  The case for the above catalysts as behind the major price decline has been overstated, said Greg Cipolaro, research head at NYDIG, in a Wednesday note.  ""While emotions and psychology may rule over the short-term, our analysis suggests that the price impact from potential selling may be overblown,"" he wrote.  ""We aren’t oblivious to the fact that other factors may be at play here, but it is reasonable to think that the rational investor may find this an interesting opportunity created by irrational fears,"" he added.  Over the past weeks, investors have been fixated on transfers related to Bitcoin addresses linked to the estate of defunct exchange Mt. Gox, the U.S. government and the German state of Saxony, sparking fears about imminent sales of the over $20 billion worth of stash these three entities held combined.  Read more: It's Not Germany Selling Bitcoin. It's One of Its States and It Has No Choice.  Even if all three were selling all their assets – roughly 375,000BTC as of June 9 – at once, Cipolaro found that BTC's price decline over the past weeks was deeper than it would have been for stocks based on Bloomberg's transaction cost analysis (TCA) – a well-followed indicator long used in traditional markets for estimating the price impact of block sales of common stocks.  Cipolaro also argued that recent reports about miners capitulating and selling their BTC stash en masse after this year's halving event has not just been overstated, but in some cases wholly inaccurate.  NYDIG's data showed that publicly listed mining companies actually increased their bitcoin holdings in June. And while the amount of BTC sold picked up slightly last month, it was still well below levels seen earlier this year and last year.  Cipolaro advised against relying on blockchain data about miners moving assets without knowing the nature of those transactions.

30763332,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628986,1720641640,"Ethereum Whale Sparks Sell-Off Rumors With 11,215 ETH Coinbase Deposit","An Ethereum whale has caused panic among community members following a recent transaction suggesting they might be looking to offload their holdings. This comes amid a recent prediction by research firm Matrixport that Ethereum’s price could significantly rebound from its current price level. Ethereum Whales Transfers 11,215 ETH Onchain data shows that the Ethereum whale transferred 11,215 ETH ($34.3 million) to the crypto exchange Coinbase. A trader usually makes such a move when selling these tokens, and considering the amount of tokens involved, such a sale could significantly impact ETH’s price. However, data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that there might be a demand for these tokens if, indeed, this whale is looking to offload their tokens. Related Reading: 83% Of All Bitcoin Holders Still In Profit Despite Drop Below $60,000 There has been an increase of 132% in the large holders’ netflow to exchange netflow ratio in the last seven days, which suggests that Ethereum whales are actively accumulating more ETH. The flow metrics also paint an accumulation trend among Ethereum holders, with inflow volume into exchanges down by over 11% in the last seven days. During this period, the outflow volume from these exchanges has increased by 3%, further confirming that Ethereum investors are looking to hold their positions and accumulate more ETH at this point. This is undoubtedly a positive development for Ethereum’s price, which could witness a significant rebound thanks to this wave of accumulation. Research firm Matrixport also predicted that ETH’s price would rebound from its current price level thanks to the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which they claimed could launch as early as this week. While that remains uncertain, market experts like Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart have suggested that it shouldn’t be long before these Spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading. This is because fund issuers have implemented most of the comments that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had on their S-1 filings. ETH Is Primed For A Rally Crypto analyst Leon Waidmann mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ethereum is primed for a rally. He made this assertion based on Ethereum’s dwindling supply. He noted that 40% of Ethereum’s supply is locked up, with 28% staked and the other 12% in smart contracts and bridges. Additionally, Waidmann expects this supply to continue to reduce once the Spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading, with institutional investors taking a huge chunk of the supply off exchanges. Based on this, Ethereum could rally on the back of the supply and demand dynamics since demand is bound to outpace supply at some point.

42407869,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Doq,1720638649,Bragging Rights Are Key to Retaining Web3 Gamers,"Gamers are competitive beasts. Sure, they play for passion and love for the game, but, deep down, it is victory and glory that they're really after. Through the creation of online digital identities, modern gamers can play for a completely new type of prize: extensive social clout in their online communities.  This post is part of CoinDesk's GameFi theme week. Allen Ng is the Co-Founder of OpenSocial Protocol and EVG, one of Asia’s largest Web3 operating groups in consumer products.  Web3 gaming has struggled for various well-documented reasons, most notably in the form of great backlash from the gaming community due to Web3 games being “boring” and “depthless.” With evolving Web3 systems enabling a new wave of gaming achievements that are verifiable and interoperable across gaming ecosystems, we will be able to witness new Web3 social systems and communities that can change not just Web3 gaming but the entirety of online gaming forever.  The social layer of gaming  In 2016, Pokémon Go, an augmented reality mobile game, became so popular that players could be seen trawling cities and socializing to catch Pokémons, making the company earn over $6 billion in that year alone. Today, 40% of Gen Z and millennials socialize more in online games than in the physical world. This is primarily due to technological advancements and the rise in smartphone availability, which have made mobile gaming more prominent over the years, making the average amount of time and money spent on mobile gaming much higher than on gaming consoles.  The hidden truth is that the success of Pokémon and others, like Clash of Clans, stems from their strong social layer, which enhances user retention, gaming experience, and revenue.  Socializing is built into human nature and is a vital aspect of gaming. These immersive gameplays rely heavily on well-constructed social elements that create both competition and community where players are able to go online to interact and play together with their friends or even battle them through PvP (player versus player). After all, we are all social beings and tend to spend more time and money when we are not alone.  Eliminating Web3 gaming obstacles  Currently, most Web3 games use airdrops and token rewards to attract players, but more often than not, the retention rate of players in these games is low. Projects often focus on sustainable tokenomics and rewards but forget about the social layer and shared fun in games, which is key to user retention and network bootstrapping.  Gaming and social are distinct but intertwined layers. Gaming creates enjoyment and fun, while the social layer creates an emotional attachment and app stickiness, eventually creating a longer-lasting bond when you enjoy it with someone else.  Ultimately, Web3 social systems are necessary for games to allow players to perform transactions with one another and not just with the game itself. By integrating the social layer, you're enabling emotions and bonding between players and teams.  It will not be just you and ""The Matrix"" anymore. It will be you and your friends, your competition, and your community.  Bragging rights are gaming’s crude oil  In the fine lines of the social layer, there is one aspect that keeps gamers hooked, and that is the bragging rights that they have achieved in their gaming journey. Think of Xbox Live, online games, and eSports, where players are able to compete with one another, grow in their rank/levels, gain recognition medals, and unlock achievements.  With all the time invested into a game, players will grow more attached when they have something to brag about in their time spent gaming, and a place to brag about it. Those bragging rights are the crude oil that is constantly fuelling the $200 billion-a-year gaming economy after the right refining, but they are also missing in Web3 gaming, relegated behind grind-and-earn mechanics.  The next generation of Web3 gaming dApps needs to understand the importance of the social layer by including community self-sovereignty, creating composable UI layers and giving gamers something to brag about, in addition to offering financial incentives. Only then will the adoption of Web3 games increase.

30759994,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629007,1720636232,"Ethereum Rising, 2 Million Addresses Will Be In Money If $3,200 Is Broken","Ethereum, mirroring the performance of Bitcoin and other top altcoins, is back above $3,000, days after the fall below $2,800. As the second most valuable coin recovers, injecting optimism among crashed token holders and traders, a close above $3,200 will be crucial in catalyzing demand. Ethereum Rising: Will Bulls Push Above $3,200? According to IntoTheBlock on July 10, if Ethereum edges above the $3,200 level, it will be a massive development for traders. When this happens, an estimated two million entities who traded ETH at this price point will be in the money. Therefore, if prices retest this level, those who went long can exit at break even. Alternatively, other “diamond hands,” expecting more gains on the horizon, can double down and ride the expected leg up. Related Reading: Avalanche Aims Higher As Price Continues To Gain Pace Above $23.50 Thus far, there are hints of strength. However, though sellers are still in control, a breach of $3,300 will be crucial in the short to medium term. The $3,300 level, looking at the ETHUSDT candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, is previous support, but it is now resistance. A breakout, ideally with rising volume, will likely serve as a base for more gains, lifting the coin towards a key liquidation level at $3,700 and later $3,900. Conversely, if sellers take over, reversing recent gains and aligning with the July 4 and 5 losses, a drop below $2,800 will signal trend continuation. Looking at candlestick arrangements, Ethereum will dump to new multi-week lows in that event, even dropping to $2,500. Eyes On Spot ETFs, Whales Accumulating As ETH Becomes Scarce Overall, analysts are optimistic, expecting Ethereum to float higher. The anticipated launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the coming days is a big catalyst behind this bullish outlook. Like how to spot Bitcoin ETFs opened the floodgates for institutional exposure in the world’s most valuable coin, the same inflow will likely be seen in ETH. With institutional demand, supports think ETH will tear higher, breaching $4,100 and registering new 2024 highs in the coming months. Related Reading: Big Rally Coming For Chainlink?

We've got that story plus lots of announcements emanating from Europe's biggest Ethereum-focused conference.  But one of the biggest blockchain stories making waves is the revelation (scooped by CoinDesk's Sam Kessler) that a prominent builder in the space has been accused by his former employer, the prestigious crypto venture-capital firm Polychain, of violating ethics policies by taking an undisclosed personal allocation of tokens from a project that raised funds from the firm. Read on.  ALSO:  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Combinder, Tezos, TON, Worldcoin, Union.  More than $20 million of blockchain project fundraisings: Rome, Dora, BOB, Term Labs.  Private equity firms are suddenly interested in bitcoin miners' data centers – thanks to AI.  The German state of Saxony is roiling the global bitcoin market with its apparent liquidation of seized BTC.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  Polychain says Ritual co-founder Niraj Pant, an ex-general partner, broke its policies. (Ritual)  SIDE DEAL? Two months ago, the blockchain-development world was rocked by the news that Neel Somani, founder of the uber-modular blockchain project Eclipse, was stepping aside from his role in response to sexual misconduct allegations. Now, there's fresh accusations surrounding the project's fundraising. Crypto venture capital giant Polychain has accused Niraj Pant, a former general partner at the fund, of making a backroom deal with Eclipse that broke the fund's policies, a scoop by CoinDesk's Sam Kessler. According to three sources close to the situation and internal Eclipse documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Eclipse's Somani quietly allocated Pant 5% of a forthcoming Eclipse crypto token in September 2022 – just days after Pant directed Polychain to lead the company's $6 million pre-seed funding round. The allocation was eventually reduced to 1.33%, worth $13.3 million at the token's most recent fully diluted valuation in a private investment round. Pant insists the arrangement was completely kosher because it wasn't finalized until September 2022 – the month after Polychain had already invested in Eclipse. Under a copy of an agreement obtained by Kessler and signed by Somani, Pant's Psychological Operations Co. would receive a grant of Eclipse's tokens in exchange for ""periodic teleconference sync meetings"" as requested by Eclipse. Somani told his inner circle that the generous token grant was meant to incentivize Pant to secure Polychain's cash and the veteran VC's coveted endorsement, according to two people familiar with the matter. ""Polychain's statement to CoinDesk grants a rare insight into the sausage-making process of the cozy world of crypto VC firms and the projects they fund,"" Kessler wrote. Snarky posters on the social-media platform X snickered ironically that they were ""shocked"" to learn that such practices might go on in the crypto fundraising scene.  Former President Donald Trump's Republican Party has officially adopted a platform that would seek to support cryptocurrency innovation, according to the document released Monday by the Republican National Committee. Separately, Multicoin Capital, one of the largest U.S. investment firms focused on cryptocurrency, is pledging up to $1 million to support Senate candidates with favorable views of the industry.  Residents of the small city of Granbury, Texas, have complained of suffering physical symptoms due to a ""dull aural hum"" emanating from a nearby Bitcoin mining facility that was ""exceeding legal noise ordinances on a daily basis,"" Time reported.

Blockchain games are ""now emerging fully-cooked,"" writes David Z. Morris in a guest column: ""That is, many are at least as enjoyable as games that have nothing to do with crypto."" Another CoinDesk contributor, Jeff Wilser, examined the success of the tap-to-earn darling Hamster Kombat, a game launched on TON blockchain that has become so popular in Iran that the country's deputy military chief described it as part of the West's ""soft war.""  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin gave a keynote talk about hardening the Ethereum blockchain as a base layer, in front of a packed room full of an estimated 1,100 attendees, at a developer conference in Brussels on Wednesday. Buterin spoke at length during his presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) about the strengths and weaknesses of the largest smart-contracts blockchain and its sprawling ecosystem, including his concerns about transaction censorship, as well as a proposal to increase the “quorum threshold” from 75% to 80%. Buterin said he believes the strengths of the Ethereum ecosystem include that it is a “large and reasonably decentralized staking ecosystem,” and that it is a highly international and intellectual community.

Leveraging real-world data to simulate the energy needs of an average household, the project team will build a physical nano-grid involving a plug-in green energy source and an AC unit.""  2. Trilitech, focused on the Tezos blockchain, announced what the team described as a ""major development"" – the introduction of Jstz (pronounced ""justice""), a ""smart rollup powered by JavaScript."" According to the team: ""The upcoming layer-2 rollup being built on Tezos will allow developers to use JavaScript and its vast resources. But more than just enabling the language itself, what sets Jstz apart is that it’s being designed to comply with standard JavaScript APIs, enabling builders to tap into a massive ecosystem of familiar, battle-tested JS tools and libraries."" (Please see our recent story here on Tezos's plan for a ""canonical rollup."")  3. A new project called TON Applications Chain (TAC) is building a layer-2 network for the TON Blockchain ecosystem, known for its affiliation with the popular messaging app Telegram. The project, which is backed by The Open Platform, an investor focused on the TON blockchain ecosystem, will rely on technology from the Ethereum-focused layer-2 developer Polygon, according to a press release. The team made the announcement on Tuesday at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Brussels, Belgium.  4. Union Labs, the modular interoperability layer, has added support for Arbitrum, the leading layer-2 ecosystem by TVL, to connect Arbitrum Orbit chains with IBC-enabled blockchains, as well as other networks integrating with Union such as Polygon, Scroll and Movement. According to the team: ""This integration will unlock unprecedented liquidity flow between IBC and the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will also see the reduction of the latency in optimistic cross-chain operations while maintaining the security and integrity of transactions in and out of the Arbitrum ecosystem.""  5. The developer firm behind the Worldcoin protocol shared Tuesday that its upcoming layer-2 chain, World Chain, is now open for developers to use. This means that select developers can apply to build, test, and give feedback to Tools For Humanity, the developer firm behind Worldcoin, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. World Chain has tapped Optimism’s OP Stack, acustomizable toolkit that lets developers build their own blockchains using Optimism’s technology, to build out its own network.

Rising price, creative ideas, and a charitable inclination are driving FLOKI’s comeback in popularity following a fairly quiet time. But you should be aware of the possibilities and drawbacks of this meme-tastic asset before you let your inner puppy investor loose. Related Reading: Mass Adoption? NEAR Protocol Sees 17 Million Unique Addresses In 30 Days From Burj Khalifa Billboards To Building Schools: Floki Inu’s Tail Wags Charity Unlike most meme currencies depending just on viral trends and celebrity tweets, Floki Inu shows a more deliberate approach.

But their present fundraiser and charitable initiatives provide their story an surprising turn. With the second biggest nation in the globe when it comes to the number of inhabitants, their next targets following successful programs in Africa and South-east Asia, FLOKI has set out a mission to build schools in underdeveloped nations. This philanthropic approach could help FLOKI to become more well-known, therefore increasing its long-term worth.

Forecast For FLOKI’s Price With a price of $0.00023 now, FLOKI ranks 52nd in the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. Right now FLOKI’s market capitalisation is 9.5 billion dollars and its supply of circulation is $2.2 trillion. Indicative of market expansion, the value of the cryptocurrency has increased by $0.000024 during the past twenty-four hours. Related Reading: Big Rally Coming For Chainlink? Analyst Predicts Double-Digit Surge Over the previous week, FLOKI shows an amazing growth pattern; the price rose by 11.74%. This development makes the meme coin seem to have a lot of possibilities, which attracts investors.

This could indicate that, should this price ascent continue, it might just push it to become an asset to reckoned with. In the meantime, technical evaluations show that, with an average trading value around $0.000179, the FLOKI price will swing between $0.000173 and $0.000198 this current year.

42407873,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7E24,1720628196,"As the U.S. Commodities Regulator Urges Fast Crypto Action, Senators Still Scrambling","The chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee suggested she's got a legislative proposal for crypto oversight on the verge of delivery to her fellow panel members.  The panel's senior Republican said his meetings with crypto industry leaders suggested that the legislative work might not be ready.  Meanwhile, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam gave urgent testimony that Congress needs to do something about digital assets.  While Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said that her latest legislative proposal for overseeing the crypto markets is on the way to her panel's fellow members this week, the committee's top Republican said his meetings with the digital assets industry indicate that those businesses don't yet like what they're seeing.  ""The frank and honest feedback we have received from these discussions does not lead me to believe the necessary level of support for this proposal to be successful currently exists among stakeholders, and people are working very hard to try and rectify that,"" said Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), the panel's ranking Republican, in a Wednesday hearing on the digital assets sector.  The head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, echoed sentiments in his testimony that generally match the view of cryptocurrency advocates: Congress has been failing to produce a regulatory answer to crypto, and it's hurting investors and leaving the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage.  He said that what ""concerned me the most"" about watching the growth of digital assets has been Congress' lack of action  ""I believe the single most important thing I have done, and continue to do, is advocate to this body to fill the regulatory gap,"" Behnam told the senators. ""Congress must act quickly in order for regulators, like the CFTC, to provide basic customer protections that are core to U.S. financial markets.""  The senators atop the Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, have worked for years on their own crypto legislation that would – more narrowly than other efforts – focus on granting authorities to the regulator to police the spot trading in digital commodities. That category, which includes bitcoin {{BTC}} and which Behnam and others argue also includes Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, represents the majority of crypto trading activity.  However, the details of a current effort led by Stabenow haven't officially emerged, and she indicated at the hearing that she hopes to share specific legislative language with fellow panel members by the end of the week.  ""We cannot afford to wait any longer to regulate these assets,"" she said in the hearing. ""The time to act is now.""  Boozman called the hearing ""a good start,"" suggesting that his stated intent to keep working with Stabenow on new legislation isn't nearing a finish line.  The U.S. House of Representatives has moved well beyond the Senate in crypto legislative progress, having passed a wide-reaching bill on market structure with a large bipartisan majority. But the industry has encountered more difficulty in the Senate, where prominent members such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) have been critical of the dangers crypto poses to consumers. Brown's Senate Banking Committee has so far failed to move on legislation, despite years of discussion on the topic.  ""Some in this town are less interested in protecting consumers and investors than others,"" Brown said at Wednesday's hearing.  Little time remains in this session of Congress to address complicated regulatory legislation, and the November elections will take even more of the lawmakers' attention as that date approaches.  Behnam argued that failing to institute federal rules on crypto isn't going to keep investors away.  ""I do not believe inaction will quash public interest for digital assets; it will only result in greater risk to our financial markets and investors,"" he said.  The CFTC chairman contended that any legislation should define how his agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will figure out what's a digital commodity and what's a security. But Boozman said during the hearing that this committee shouldn't push beyond its CFTC jurisdiction and into the workings of other regulators ""not under our authority,"" such as the SEC, Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.  The CFTC chief also said that his agency's current powers, which are largely limited to enforcement, are too reactive to be a useful preventative of bad behavior in the industry.  ""The point of any comprehensive legislation on this is to prevent more of the fraud before it occurs and reduce regulation by enforcement,"" said Christopher LaVigne, a partner at the law firm Withers, in an email. ""It was interesting to hear Chairman Behnam state his belief that enforcement of existing rules does not have the same deterrent effect that a comprehensive regulatory regime would have. It is hard to imagine [SEC] Chairman [Gary] Gensler making such an admission.""

42407874,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7E8g,1720627803,How Staking Rate Benchmarks Can Build Digital Assets Markets,"As the staking industry matures, and more node operators enter the market, the need for performance metrics becomes increasingly important for gaining a competitive edge. The Ethereum staking rate is the closest equivalent to the “risk free rate” of digital currencies.  Institutional staking service operators, like Pier Two (where I work as CFO) and Figment, are dedicated to providing security and stability to the Ethereum ecosystem while delivering premier staking yields to customers.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Understanding CESR  One such metric gaining prominence is the CESR (Composite Ether Staking Rate) benchmark, created by CoinDesk Indices and CoinFund. CESR measures the average staking rate across the Ethereum network, providing a reliable standard for operators and stakers to gauge performance. By comparing staking rates to CESR, operators can objectively assess their competitiveness and effectiveness.  Why benchmarks are important  Benchmarks are important in financial markets to create structure, standardization and comparability for many financial products, including ETFs. CESR is a useful rate for issuers that are looking to offer ETH Staking funds, and for validators that are looking to engage in performance monitoring, or swaps to lock in rates and build more sustainable and less volatile business models.  How Operators Can Use the CESR Benchmark  1. Performance Benchmarking  CESR offers operators a metric to benchmark their validator performance against the broader network. By comparing their returns to a trusted industry benchmark, operators can identify areas for improvement and optimize their operations, as well as to differentiate their staking products in a competitive market.  The CESR benchmark fosters healthy competition among operators. Those who outperform are rewarded with increased delegations, while those who don’t are incentivised to enhance their performance to remain competitive.  2. Market Monitoring and Strategic Insights  CESR enables operators to gain deeper insights into the Ethereum ecosystem. By monitoring trends, operators can make informed strategic decisions and adapt to market conditions and network changes (including recent Shapella and Dencun upgrades).  The CESR benchmark demonstrates that well-managed operators can achieve consistent returns despite market and network fluctuations. This underscores the value of robust operational practices and vigilant monitoring.  3. Enhancing Infrastructure Performance with Rated RAVER  Reliable and performant infrastructure is key to yield success. Operators must leverage high uptime, low latency, and rigorous operational protocols to maximize staking efficiency and rewards. Using Rated’s Validator Effectiveness Rating (RAVER) helps measure these factors, considering uptime, participation in consensus, and overall reliability.  By using CESR as the industry signal and Rated's RAVER metrics to measure infrastructure performance, an Institutional staking service operator may optimise to maintain a competitive edge. This comprehensive approach allows operators to fine-tune strategies and operations continuously, to further enhance services.  Final thoughts  The CESR benchmark offers a tool for operators to measure and enhance their performance within the Ethereum ecosystem. By leveraging CESR alongside operational metrics like Rated RAVER, operators can achieve greater transparency, trust, and efficiency. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve, these benchmarks will play an increasingly vital role in guiding and evaluating validator success. CESR will continue to be used by market participants, validators and financial institutions worldwide when engaging in products that reference Ethereum as the first bedrock financial rate of return for the Internet.

42407879,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7EPD,1720626773,How Tokenized Real World Assets Are Outperforming Crypto,"Real world asset (RWA) tokenization has been growing in popularity among institutions with financial giants such as BlackRock entering the space with their own tokenized assets.  Leveraging blockchain technology, this allows traditional assets to be issued, managed, and distributed more efficiently compared to their off-chain counterparts, especially private and alternative assets.  Security Token Market has covered this space since 2018 and, from tracking 600-plus tokenized products, here are some themes we’re seeing along with their performance.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Looking at the talk of town, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ($BUIDL) is a prime example of an asset institutions are increasingly deploying into: tokenized money market funds. BUIDL saw a 5.93% increase in net inflows closing out June 2024 at $483,311,326.32 in AUM.  How is putting a fund like this on-chain worth the effort?  One answer is because of the utility that comes with it. Issued on the Ethereum public blockchain via Securitize, this token was recently used as collateral on prime brokerage FalconX to secure loans and collateralize derivatives positions.  Meanwhile, in venture capital, Mike Reed from Franklin Templeton shared an anecdote at TokenizeThis 2024 where a venture capitalist mentioned wanting to use their tokenized money market fund ($BENJI), to fund portfolio companies. The idea here is that he can directly send his company a yield-generating asset to hold in their treasury and theoretically see how the money is used thanks to the power of blockchain.  Of course there are other examples of cost savings and utility being uncovered through both proofs of concept and in-production use cases. Here are a few:  Broadridge reports $1M savings for every 100K repo transactions  Through a Project Guardian proof of concept, Onyx by JPMorgan reports cutting rebalancing portfolios from 3,000 steps to a few clicks of a button (assuming 100,000 discretionary portfolios)  The proof-of-concept above also resulted in eliminating cash drag from discretionary portfolios by around 18% annually through the use of smart contracts.  Figure has tokenized $7B+ worth of HELOCs. By issuing, warehousing and securitizing them, they’ve saved 150 bps out of the process. These savings go to the issuer and the end investor.  Hashnote’s USYC product is looking to work with Broadridge to access the intraday market (primarily for banks), boost their yield, and then pass on to their customers.  Keeping these use-cases in mind, what kinds of assets are being tokenized? Security Token Market covers on-chain equity, fund LP units, real estate, debt, and more.  Taking from STM’s RWA Securities Market Update - June 2024 report, a hypothetical security token bundle of all STM-tracked RWAs outperformed the CoinDesk 20 Index, closing out June 2024 at +13.73% versus the index’s -11.74%. The drop in the crypto market could be attributed to macroeconomics as there are expectations of fewer rate cuts.  This paired with spot bitcoin ETF net outflows creates negative sentiment in the crypto space, impacting bitcoin’s price and therefore other cryptocurrencies’ in the CoinDesk 20. With that in mind, the STM Team will also compare performance throughout June 2024 by asset class: see here for our latest research report.

30753414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628985,1720625438,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000, But What About Altcoins?","A crypto analyst has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) will surge to $100,000 in a few years. At the same time, he has expressed skepticism about the potential for altcoins to embark on a similar bullish trajectory to new highs. Bitcoin Anticipated To Hit $100,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on June 8, a crypto analyst identified as ‘DonAlt,’ disclosed that he was more pessimistic on altcoins than Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. DonAlt believes that Bitcoin could witness a mega rally, pushing its price to trade at $100,000 in the coming years. Related Reading: Crypto Whales Buy The Dip As $22 Million In XRP Flows Out Of Binance Considering the inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs and numerous forecasts of an upcoming bull run, a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin seems increasingly plausible. Moreover, numerous market experts, including DonAlt, have maintained an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, predicting major bull rallies for the cryptocurrency. Specifically, Standard Chartered has projected a price increase to $250,000 and Bernstein analysts anticipate a surge to $200,000 for Bitcoin. In contrast, altcoins have been underperforming significantly, influenced by broader market trends and bearish sentiment. Due to the declining price of these cryptocurrencies, DonAlt has highlighted a possible future where Bitcoin dominates the crypto market while many altcoins trade 90% lower than their current valuations. Sharing a similar sentiment, a crypto community member disclosed that other than meme coins and a few random altcoins, many cryptocurrencies have failed to outperform Bitcoin in this current market cycle. He revealed that all the altcoins which previously witnessed gains on par with Bitcoin have declined significantly, while BTC has remained slightly below its previous all-time high. Furthermore, a few community members have questioned whether Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) were among the altcoins predicted to decline as Bitcoin price increases. This concern arises because, despite slight declines and market volatility, Ethereum and Solana have witnessed massive gains since the beginning of the year. Solana, in particular, surged significantly following the launch of a Spot Solana ETF filing, whereas Ethereum has been subtly following Bitcoin’s price movements, surging upwards during favorable market conditions and declining severely amidst volatility. Will Altcoins Follow Bitcoin’s Rise To New Highs? A crypto analyst identified as ‘Doctor Profit’ on X released a detailed report on altcoins for the third quarter (Q3) of 2024. According to the analyst, altcoins are poised to witness a massive pump following the release of the official launch date for Ethereum Spot ETFs. This implies that altcoins could potentially exit bearish trends and align with Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory if it witnesses a price reversal. Related Reading: XRP Price: Crypto Analyst Identifies ‘Point Of Control’ That Could See A Repeat Of 2017 The crypto analyst believes that the recent decline in altcoins presents a great buying opportunity for investors. He asserts that the altcoin market’s recent 35% downturn is a healthy correction that potentially signals a surge to new highs as market conditions stabilize. Furthermore, the crypto expert has predicted a new valuation target for the altcoin market, anticipating its market capitalization to exceed $1 trillion by the end of the year.

Analyst Sets Sights on $0.43,"With a strong mix of optimistic technical signs and a recent breakout from a downtrend, Chiliz (CHZ), the digital money driving the sports fan engagement website Socios.com, is creating buzz in the crypto market. Related Reading: Is This The Ethereum Endgame? Investors Pull $3 Billion From Exchanges CHZ Primed For Growth Reflecting a rising confidence among investors, CHZ has been on a consistent increase throughout the medium to long term. The way the token treats a significant resistance level of $0.16 accentuates this good attitude even more. A successful breach of this barrier could set off a buying frenzy that drives CHZ to far higher price points. Fueling the flames, trading pattern trends show a positive tilt. More trading volume amid price rises points to strong underlying demand for CHZ. This demand, together with the technical breakthrough, gives one hope that CHZ will see a large price increase. Renowned bitcoin specialist Alex Clay supports this perspective by pointing out a positive flag pattern on CHZ’s monthly chart. Often considered as a hint of major price fluctuations, this technical setup exactly corresponds with the recent breakthrough from the downtrend channel. #CHILIZ Monthly Timeframe Re-Accumulation below the top of descending channel in the form of Bullish Flag💁‍♂️ Now breaking out of this massive descending channel👀 Send it✈️ 🎯1st Target – 0.26620$ 🎯2nd Target – 0.43090$#CHZ $CHZ pic.twitter.com/nugbkBCNNQ — Alex Clay (@cryptclay) June 1, 2024 Clay has set various pricing targets; the first barrier is $0.2662, then the more ambitious second target is $0.4509. For Chiliz, the breaking out from the declining channel is a clear sign that the downtrend is ending and a fresh period of expansion is starting. Technical elements together with favourable market mood present a somewhat hopeful picture for the future of the token. Optimistic Yet Cautious Outlook For Chiliz, the near future seems promising; but, unanticipated price swings can happen and the currency may run across opposition at the specified pricing levels. Though there are certain possible obstacles, Chiliz’s general future is clearly bright. Chiliz is positioned for a possible price increase with a strong technical basis, high investor confidence, and recent breakthrough from a downturn. Related Reading: Notcoin Unstoppable!

This product may not be suitable for long-term investors. BITU uses swap agreements and cash-settled futures contracts to achieve 2x daily returns relative to spot BTC prices. Returns may be amplified during periods of sequential gains and losses in the reference BTC index, resulting in returns outside of the 2x target. ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) is ProShares 2x leveraged BTC strategy that provides leveraged returns relative to the spot price of BTC. Given that BITU is a leveraged strategy, there are inherent risks involved that may not make this strategy appropriate for everyone. As described below, BITU is not meant to be held for longer than a single day in order to achieve a 2x return over the underlying asset and may accelerate gains or losses if held longer. As such, I cannot recommend BITU as a buy-and-hold strategy, and it is not appropriate as an asset allocation for advisors. This product should be strictly used for day traders as risks may compound over long periods of time. Because I am not a speculative BTC trader and cannot recommend a direction for the cryptocurrency, I will provide BITU a HOLD rating and recommend against this product otherwise. For those seeking 2x inverse returns, be sure to check out UltraShort Bitcoin ETF ( SBIT ). ProShares BITU was created on April 2, 2024, as ProShares' solution to providing excess returns, or losses, relative to the daily price swings as realized by BTC. As the description implies, BITU seeks to provide 2x the performance of spot BTC before fees, whether to the upside or downside. BITU is benchmarked to the Bloomberg Bitcoin Index, which is designed to track the price of BTC as a proxy for the BTC market. BITU was designed for speculative traders who seek to profit from actively trading this product on a daily basis. Adding emphasis on “daily basis,” this strategy is not meant to be bought and held for a time period longer than a single day. The “2x” performance is a daily performance metric and will not be reflected if the ETF is held for a longer period. Because of how the portfolio is structured, returns may be amplified based on higher volatility and larger daily returns when grouped together; however, losses will equivalently be amplified if sequential days of extreme losses occur. Given the riskiness of the leveraged ETF, I cannot recommend this vehicle to the general investor, especially those in advisory positions. This product is purely meant for active day traders and should not be considered otherwise. Be sure to review my two reports covering the VanEck BTC ETF ( HODL ) and the iShares BTC ETF ( IBIT ) as a primer: VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF May Not Be The Optimal Bitcoin Fund To 'HODL' IBIT Is A Great Vehicle For BTC Investing Diving into the mechanics of the fund, BITU functions similar to other leveraged ETF products. Like the ProShares' UltraPro QQQ ETF ( TQQQ ) or their ultra-short ETF ( SQQQ ), the portfolio, BITU does not directly hold BTC within the portfolio. Instead, BITU uses swap agreements that provide the 2x daily return the portfolio management team seeks out. In certain circumstances, the management team may elect to utilize cash-settled futures contracts as a proxy if unable to obtain the desired exposure. The contracts held in the portfolio are typically traded using the shortest duration exposure, or the front month, in order to obtain the targeted 2x leverage. From there, contracts are rolled forward to the next month in order to maintain a similar level of exposure. The swap contracts are priced to the Bitcoin Reference Rate on a daily basis, meaning that cash will be owed to one of the parties in association with the swap contract at the end of each trading day. Because the BTC futures curve is in contango, or higher in future periods, the portfolio does not realize gains from the roll forward effect. In addition to market risk, derivatives inherently hold carry risk as it pertains to interest rates. Assuming the Federal Funds rate is not lowered this year, the cost of carry will be between 5.25-5.50%. To the contrary, if the cost of carry goes down, the value of the swap contract may appreciate as a result, and vice versa if rates increase. CME In addition to this, volatility drift can become an issue for the portfolio during times of extreme volatility. Given that BTC is inherently a volatile asset, drift may be more likely to occur when compared to leveraged index ETFs like TQQQ. Market Chameleon As such, with leveraged portfolios, the net asset value is a race to the bottom and shares are multiplied over time. This is a significant risk to consider when holding BITU for longer than a single day, as the multiplier effect and the declining NAV can come to haunt a long-term holder. ProShares Another major risk with this ETF is liquidity. The fund’s volumes, as reported by Seeking Alpha, average 1.2mm shares, meaning that liquidity may become a challenge in times of distress. In the instance of declining BTC prices, this must be considered prior to entering a position as there may be more sellers than buyers of BITU and lead to a trader being left with an unfilled sell order, or a sell order below their intended price. TradingView As referenced in the preface, BITU is meant to be traded within a single day as it pertains to the 2x target reset on a daily basis. If held for longer than a single day, upside and downside risk can be amplified, as presented in the chart below. TradingView Given this risk, I cannot stress enough that the ETF should be held for no longer than a single day. As can be seen in the chart for the provided period, BTC provided a -13.27% return while BITU provided a return of -34.03%, a significant dispersion from the 2x target. On the flipside, as visualized by the chart below, returns can be compounded above the 2x target during times of excess returns during sequential days of positive returns. TradingView This effect is the result of the daily reset of the leveraged ETF. What this means is that your returns are compounded on the previous day’s closing value rather than your cost basis. This means that if you buy a hypothetical asset valued at $10/share, and it closes that day at $11, the following day’s performance will be based on the $11 rather than the $10 starting value. For additional information on risks involved in leveraged ETFs, please visit the SEC website using the link below: Leveraged and Inverse ETFs: Specialized Products with Extra Risks for Buy-and-Hold Investors BITU holds a significantly higher expense ratio when compared to spot BTC ETFs at 95bps. IBIT and HODL each hold an expense ratio of 12bps and 20bps, respectively. For more information on these two funds, please visit the links above, as they may be more appropriate for long-term BTC investors. BITU also has significantly lower trading volume when compared to IBIT at 1.2mm shares traded vs. 18mm in IBIT. This can pose a major liquidity risk when entering or exiting a trade and higher spreads. ProShares Conclusion BITU is not meant to be utilized as a long-term buy-and-hold strategy, as gains or losses can be amplified, especially during times of high volatility. The ETF also holds underlying derivative risk as it pertains to cost of carry, volatility drift, and counterparty risk, amongst others. This strategy is not recommended for advisors seeking to build a BTC position in their clients’ portfolios. This strategy is purely meant for day traders and should not be considered otherwise. Given these factors, I rate BITU with a HOLD recommendation with no directional indication.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703346-bitu-may-be-too-risky-at-2x-leverage?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30751594.jpeg

Bitcoin {{BTC}} is it a crucial stage of this market cycle as several factors signal continued downside while others indicate that prices are set to bottom out.  Currently trading at $57,700 having bounced from last week's low of $53,600, bitcoin remains in a technical downtrend from March's record high of $73,800, having made consecutive lower highs at $71,300 and $63,900.  Data from CryptoQuant suggests that a major correction or the onset of a sustained bear market could be on the horizon as the profit and loss index is hovering around its 365-day moving average.

42407876,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7EBz,1720620161,Stop Trying to Sell Gamers What They Don’t Want,"Video game players do not care about NFTs. They don’t care about ownership of in-game assets. They don’t care about faster and cheaper blockchains. They fundamentally don’t care at all about the underlying tech stack behind the games they play.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Week 2024.  Every year, the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco has a main floor filled with every manner of game development tools and platforms. Among these are inevitably Web3 companies trying to explain to an audience of completely uninterested Web2 developers how easy it is to tokenize in-game items and how many transactions per second their layer 2 scaling solution has. But never once has a single of these developers heard from their communities “I really wish my magic spells were NFTs.”  So why do Web3 game developers and infrastructure companies continue to champion these ideas as the key to bringing Web3 gaming to the masses?  Since Web3 developers care about decentralization and ownership of assets, they mistakenly believe everyone else must as well. But the average gamer doesn’t have a clue they don’t “own” the video game skins or items they have bought or received through gameplay. While Web3 fans may care about cutting edge technology and all the metrics associated with it, many gamers happily play on mid tier cell phones or a generation old game console.  This is why there is such a massive disconnect between video game communities and crypto spaces. Instead of focusing on what gamers actually care about, the sales pitch is what crypto fans care about. Car commercials don’t advertise the latest updates they’ve made to streamline head gasket design and how easy it is to change the oil. They market that their car makes your morning commute more fun and comes in your favorite color, because that’s what the average car driver wants from their car.  Then, what do gamers care about? Well, playing an enjoyable game goes without saying. Beyond that, they actually care about many of the same things that those in Web3 care about. The most important of these being community, data, and extensibility. Fortunately, these are all problems Web3 technologies are perfectly set up to solve.  Read more: David Z. Morris - 5 Blockchain Games: What Works and What Doesn't  Years ago, indie game developers discovered that empowering their communities to contribute to development, testing, and marketing is the key to building an impactful (and profitable) game on a tight budget. Releasing early access builds and doing community playtesting offers a huge spectrum of benefits from practical bug testing to getting feedback on identifying and connecting their game with the exact target audience. All without spending money to acquire that information and service. By involving their communities early and often, game developers also build a network of evangelists that feel a personal connection to the project. These advocates generate hype, content, and general grassroots goodwill simply because they are genuinely excited to do so. This is a resource that’s nearly impossible to buy.  If this sounds familiar, it’s because Web3 communities need this exact same level of community involvement. Projects live or die in the crypto space based on iteration alongside their communities. They need these evangelists to champion the endeavor, building organic trust and recognition. Web3 technology is inherently designed for and powered by a community.  Data is also at the forefront of both video games and Web3 in perhaps the most obvious way. One only needs to glance at things like esports tournaments or speed-running stats to see how important data is for players. Not to mention the countless Websites dedicated to strategy and statistics within the most popular games. Digging a level deeper into game development itself, analytics are absolutely crucial from every stage of a game’s lifecycle. Developers use analytics for in-game activity like balancing or tracking player behaviors, but also for finding what demographics and marketplaces are best for advertising and selling.  Web3 is almost nothing but data. People pore over DeFi protocol metrics and their return rates. They dissect and evaluate whitepapers while comparing the throughput and scalability of blockchains and smart contracts. Even the meme coin fans spend hours staring at charts.  Finally we have extensibility, or the ability of these systems to be expanded upon. Gamers adore user-generated content. They love every aspect of it, from community tournaments to fan art, to custom maps to secondary marketplaces. You can see these constantly popping up organically across platforms like Reddit or Discord and many of them eventually even mature into their own whole Websites and ecosystems.  Again we see a direct parallel to Web3. Users building on top of or alongside blockchain architecture is core to the concept of decentralization. The base technologies in crypto not only allow this behavior, but make it a near necessity. Essentially all content in Web3 is user-generated.  We know what Web2 gamers and developers want and it’s time to give it to them. Stop showing up at conventions trying to sell them on the intricacies of your novel consensus mechanism. Stop pitching that if you only make a fast enough blockchain with cheap enough fees eventually Valve will tokenize the entire Steam marketplace on a blockchain as NFTs. Stop selling things gamers don’t want.  If you want to convince gamers and developers of the merits of blockchain technologies, show them how it solves their real problems and meets their real needs right now. Show the strong communities it empowers, show the rich data it provides, and show the opportunities for expansive user-generated content.  Web3 technology truly has a lot to offer to the biggest entertainment industry in the world. The only way to bridge that gap is to meet video games in the reality of what their players and developers actually want, and how Web3 is the best way to deliver it to them.

The SOL price is up 19% from the local low. But the current setup of the Solana price suggests the potential for an even stronger upward breakout, similar to that of summer 2021, according to popular crypto analyst Daan de Rover, better known as Crypto Rover. From the end of July 2021 to the beginning of November 2021, SOL rallied by more than 1,100%. The chart shared by Rover displays Solana’s price action on a weekly timeframe, showcasing the formation of a descending triangle pattern similar to 2021. A descending triangle in this setting can be considered a continuation pattern, often leading to a breakout to the upside, especially following a prior uptrend. Currently, SOL is trading around $141. The base of the triangle, acting as a support zone, is between approximately $120 and $130. Meanwhile, the descending upper trendline currently caps the price. Related Reading: Bonk Inu (BONK) Skyrockets 10%, Dethroning WIF As Solana’s Largest Meme Coin If the Solana price breaks above this descending trendline, Rover predicts that Solana could repeat history and explode beyond $800. “SOL will go parabolic soon,” Rover asserted via X. However, investors need to monitor the $120 support level closely. A sustained move below this could invalidate the bullish scenario, whereas a strong upward push through the triangle’s upper boundary could set the stage for the anticipated rally. Potential Catalyst: Solana 2.0 Makes Major Progress A potential catalyst for the breakout comes from the Jump Crypto team. The Solana network is about to get a major infrastructure update with the new Firedancer client which is currently being developed. @CantelopePeel, an engineer at Jump Crypto, shared via X today, “Full Firedancer client built its first accepted block on Solana testnet.” Full Firedancer client built its first accepted block on Solana testnet. pic.twitter.com/T7FgkbHT8N — CANTELOPEPEEL (@CantelopePeel) July 10, 2024 He added, “Of course what you are not seeing here is that Firedancer built another 3 blocks after this, got skipped, then detected that it had mismatched against the rest of the cluster, and then summarily shutdown (gracefully, of course).” Related Reading: Solana Mirroring 2021 Bullish Pattern, Crypto Analyst Reveals The transparency in detailing both successes and hurdles reflects the ongoing complexity to scale the technology. “Fixing that is a tomorrow problem! Still a ton more to do, but hey at least you can see it on the blockchain now!” he added. This introduction of the Firedancer client to the Solana ecosystem is probably the biggest technical update thus far. Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz expressed his enthusiasm for the progress via X, noting, “Firedancer has been achieved internally. No one is ready for this. Accelerate.” His remarks underscore the disruptive potential of the new client. He further elaborated on the significance of this development: “Firedancer is the 2nd Solana client (the software that nodes run) — and arguably one of the most performant pieces of open source software ever created. Solana 2.0 if you will.” On Monday, Jump Crypto announced a new bug bounty initiative targeting Firedancer v0.1, nicknamed Frankendancer. As reported by Bitcoinist, this security initiative invites developers and ethical hackers to probe the client for vulnerabilities. The initiative comes with a substantial $1 million prize pool, facilitated through the cybersecurity platform Immunefi. At press time, SOL traded at $142.82.

The news was announced at the Ethereum Community Conference in Brussels, Belgium, by the company’s CEO Eli Ben-Sasson.  Ben-Sasson submitted a Starknet Improvement Proposal to the community which suggests that users can choose whether they would like to become a staker, with rewards for participation to be proportional to the amount of STRK tokens staked.  Stakers will have to lock their tokens for a 21-day period before being allowed to withdraw their funds, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  If the proposal is approved by the community, a testnet for staking on Starknet will go out soon, with staking coming to mainnet by the last quarter of 2024.  StarkWare, the main development firm behind Starknet, shared that staking will be rolled out in several phases. “In the first main stage, stakers will need to connect to Starknet, interact with the staking contracts, and follow the proposed protocol rules to stake,” the press release said. Teams at StarkWare and Starknet Foundation will study their users' staking habits to determine later staking mechanism updates.  “In subsequent stages, stakers will need, in real time, to provide attestations to the content of blocks,"" StarkWare added. ""Then in the final stage, stakers will be performing sequencing and proving activities to fully secure the network.”  “As Starknet continues its decentralized journey, StarkWare is excited to propose the first stage of staking,” Ben-Sasson said in the press release. “This is an important step in building the staking community and technology, offering new opportunities for users and developers.”  Read more:Starknet Blockchain Plans Much-Awaited Airdrop of New STRK Tokens Next Week",POSITIVE,STRK,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | STRK | AIRDROP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/10/layer-2-starknet-introduces-staking-proposal-to-its-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb9191ef3546d9a96048f7eef3d1d839914e2bba-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Buterin spoke at length during his presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) about the strengths and weaknesses of the largest smart-contracts blockchain and its sprawling ecosystem, including his concerns about transaction censorship, as well as a proposal to increase the “quorum threshold” from 75% to 80%.  Buterin said he believes the strengths of the Ethereum ecosystem include that it is a “large and reasonably decentralized staking ecosystem,” and that it is a highly international and intellectual community.  Weaknesses of the blockchain still need to be addressed, Buterin said, including the difficulty of solo staking given the requirement for 32 ETH to become a validator for the blockchain, and that running a node is technically complicated. He said both of these issues “are very addressable.”  The Ethereum community's intellectual leader ran through an array of technical improvements – meant to fix the various weaknesses that exist on Ethereum – that would allow for “protocol simplification.”  “So if you want a robust ecosystem, it needs to be simple,"" Buterin told the crowd. ""It should not have these, like, 73 random hooks and some kind of backwards compatibility because of some random dumb thing that this random guy called Vitalik came up with in 2014.”  51% attack  Buterin also expressed concerns about a 51% attack on the blockchain, sharing that the collective Ethereum community assumption would be that everyone rally together, force a minority soft fork and slash the attacker.  “It depends on a lot of assumptions around coordination, ideology, various other things, and it's not clear how to do something like that as well in 10 years,” Buterin said.  One of Buterin’s more concrete proposals that he was advocating for came from the idea that recovering from chain attacks becomes very hard if that chain finalizes; increasing the quorum threshold to 75% to 80% might help prevent that.  “I think there's value in really doubling down on these strengths, and at the same time, recognizing and fixing our inadequacies and making sure that we actually live up to our very high standards,” Buterin told the crowd.  Buterin has frequently made an appearance at EthCC in past years. In 2023 he spoke about challenges surrounding ""abstraction,"" and the year before that he spoke about Ethereum ahead of the Merge.

Analyst Predicts Double-Digit Surge,"For Chainlink (LINK), the waters of the bitcoin market are moving in its favor. Inspired by recent accumulation from big investors and forecasts of an upward trend, the asset is exhibiting signs of life following a period of slow performance. Nonetheless, the path to recovery might be a meandering one as experts have conflicting projections for the next years. Related Reading: Mass Adoption? NEAR Protocol Sees 17 Million Unique Addresses In 30 Days Whales Build Chainlink During Crisis Market observers are fixated on the behaviour of “whales,” or heavily weighted investors. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez claims that these whales have been on a purchasing frenzy, grabbing an amazing 6.2 million LINK tokens valued $76.88 million during the most recent price drop. According to this “buy-the-dip” approach, whales find promise in LINK and think the present low price offer a good purchase possibility. For his part, crypto expert Michael van de Poppe sees a seasonal pattern of “finding bottoms in June of every year.” According to him, most likely than not, such patters are having the same bottoming procedure so far this year, and will “start to crawl upwards from hereon.” $LINK has been getting a seasonal pattern of finding bottoms in June of every year. Very likely, it’s having the same bottoming procedure in 2024 and will start to crawl upwards from here. pic.twitter.com/5T4GikNrFa — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 8, 2024 Forecasts From Analysts: An Ocean Of Possibilities Analyst opinions on LINK’s future course vary. With LINK hitting $14.92 by July 15th, a surge of 12%, CoinCheckup, a crypto trading site, projects a quite calm ride ahead. Forecasting a 30% jump in the following seven days followed by a notable 154.88% growth within a year, CoinCheckup, a price prediction tool, presents a more clearer picture and links the altcoin to a price of $32.83. Not everyone, meantime, is raising a positive flag. Another crypto analyzer tool, CoinCodex, presents a more wary image. By August 9th, their projection points to a 66.07% increase that will bring $21.39. Their technical indicators, however, show a “bearish” attitude towards LINK; the Fear & Greed Index ticks around 28 (the fear zone). Network Evolution And Regulatory Headwinds Although optimistic forecasts and whale activity point to good things ahead, LINK’s road forward is not without difficulties. Regulatory obstacles still brings forth issues as governments all over struggle with how to monitor the always changing bitcoin terrain. Also of big importance for LINK’s future direction will be changes in networks and more general market trends.

Neither Israel nor the EU has yet committed to issuing a CBDC.  The Bank of Israel won't decide whether to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) before the European Central Bank does, Deputy Governor Andrew Abir told Reuters.  ""We’re all waiting for the first western central bank to pull the trigger, which is almost certainly going to be the ECB. And then you may see a rush of countries going forward with it,"" Abir said.  A few weeks ago, Israel's central bank announced the launch of a Digital Shekel Challenge as part of an ""action plan for a possible issuance of the digital shekel,"" to develop uses in the world of payments. It reiterated then that it hadn't decided whether to issue a CBDC, even as it kept up to pace with the research.  As of May, 134 countries or jurisdictions representing 98% of global GDP are exploring a CBDC. Among them, the EU has shown particular interest in developing its own digital currency. Last year, it proposed legislation for the digital currency, even though officials have said the work on a digital euro is not a commitment to issue one.  Abir said whether the public will adopt a digital shekel is uncertain, and the bank is conducting a behavioral study on the subject. He said that one has to have ""a good set of use cases."" But in a nation where two large banks dominate more than 60% of the market, the main incentive is to create a ""level playing field for payment providers and allow them to compete with the banks""  Read More: Israel to Start Digital Shekel Challenge to Develop Payment Use Cases",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/10/israel-decision-on-digital-shekel-wont-occur-before-the-eus-call-on-digital-euro-reuters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8142dec16a595aba3e6c3f1bb742b14314bedc43-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rallied to over $59,000 early in the European morning, extending a recovery from below $54,000 at the start of the week. The rally could see BTC reclaim $60,000 but will be short-lived, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said. ""The $55,000-$56,000 range is forming a base from a technical analysis perspective. However, given the medium-term technical damage, we anticipate no more than a short-term tactical bullish countertrend rally,"" Thielen wrote on Tuesday. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at just under $58,500, an increase of 1.7% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, rose about 1.65%.  Data availability blockchain network Celestia's native cryptocurrency, TIA, has jumped 25% to $7.30 this week, the biggest gain among the top 100 digital assets by market value. Traders seem skeptical about the surge and are taking bearish bets by shorting perpetual futures tied to the cryptocurrency, according to funding rates tracked by CoinGlass. Average funding rates across exchanges flipped negative over the weekend and have dropped to -0.1231% since then, reaching levels last seen in January. In other words, the bias for bearish bets is most pronounced in six months.  Bitcoin miners are attractive partners to help build AI data centers due to their available power supplies and operating capabilities, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday. Recent AI deals including Core Scientific’s (CORZ) 12-year agreement with CoreWeave and Coatue Management’s $150 million investment in Hut 8 (HUT) have become key catalysts for the sector, the report said. Bernstein initiated coverage of miner Iris Energy (IREN) with an outperform rating and a $26 price target. The broker also initiated coverage of Core Scientific with an outperform rating and a $17 objective. CORZ and IREN were up around 3.5 and 6.5% respectively in pre-market trading.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the top 10 meme coins by market value.  Solana-based MONK has replaced dogwifwhat (WIF) as the fourth largest meme coin.

(Technical Analysis),"Summary Bitcoin is consolidating in a corrective pattern before advancing to 100k. The recent drop appears to have been the c-wave down of the abcde Elliott Wave pattern. Fearish market sentiment may indicate bottom for recovery rally. It's been my position since March when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) reached an all-time high near $74,000 that the leading cryptocurrency would consolidate in a sideways corrective pattern before advancing to 100k and beyond. In spite of recent short-term weakness, my analysis is that this continues to be the correct outlook and that dips remain buying opportunities. The recent drop appears to have been the c-wave down of the abcde Elliott Wave sideways triangle pattern. TheBullBear.com, TradingView Note that the recent low only exceeded the May 1st low by 5%, a tiny movement in Bitcoin terms. Price appears to be recovering now. While it's likely that there are d and e waves to come in the sideways pattern before the next big rally ensues, this is probably the best entry point we are going to see. Above 60k should confirm this analysis. The Bitcoin Fear/Greed Index shows that fearish market sentiment was at about these current levels at the end of the last such sideways correction, leading to the last big rally. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, alternative.me Sentiment should be fearful enough to put in a bottom here and allow for a recovery rally back near the highs of the range. Here's the daily chart. TheBullBear.com, TradingView Note that back in September, when sentiment was in its current bearish range, price also corrected to the convergence of the 50 and 200 day EMAs (blue and red, respectively) and then took off. It's in a similar position now. We also see that in August/September daily RSI level corrected back into its green support zone and put in a bull divergence, as it is doing now. On the bearish side of the ledger, we have a trendline break and also a drop back into the green trend channel after breakout out to the upside. These, however, are consistent with a bullish sideways corrective period. Now on to the weekly chart: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Here we can see that weekly RSI corrected to the same level as in September. This is a solid technical reset without much price damage. I'm placing the wave count now as 4 of 3. The next bullish impulse wave will be 5 of 3, with 5th waves typically being the strongest moves in Bitcoin bull markets. Monthly chart: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Note that within bull moves, the 10 month SMA in blue has been key and that level is being tested now. If price does dip back into the 55-53k zone, then I would have to re-evaluate this analysis and consider other scenarios. Above 60k and we can become more confident that we are on track for a resumption of the long term bull trend. It may be that an additional period volatility and churn within the range may be needed to finish this corrective pattern, lasting about 2-6 weeks.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703317-bitcoin-bottoming-or-breaking-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30745918.jpeg

42407884,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7NWc,1720611584,Wallets Linked to Global Scams on Cambodia's Huione Guarantee Collect $11 Billion: Report,"Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian online platform said to be linked to the nation's ruling family, hosts merchants who allegedly supply scam operators and have collected as much as $11 billion in crypto, according to a research report.  Services offered by merchants' customers include production of deepfakes, money laundering and website development for ""pig butchering"" scams, according to Wired.  Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian online financial platform linked to the nation's ruling family, is a marketplace that hosts merchants whose customers include scam artists, particularly those helping develop pig-butchering scams, that have raked in $11 billion, Wired alleged, citing its own research and information from crypto-tracing firm Elliptic.  Wired said the platform, which provides deposit and escrow capabilities for peer-to-peer transactions conducted over the Telegram messaging system, hosts listings that can be used for activities including deepfake scams, money laundering and so-called pig butchering, in which a victim is wooed before being financially drained by their apparent admirer.  Users transact primarily using USDT, the world's largest stablecoin. Because USDT can be traced over the blockchain, Elliptic said it was able to follow the fund flows.  “I’m not sure whether Huione Guarantee was originally established with this in mind, but it’s certainly become primarily a marketplace for online scammers,” Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s cofounder and chief scientist, told Wired.  According to Elliptic, Huione Guarantee is ""part of Huione Group, a Cambodian conglomerate with links to Cambodia’s ruling Hun family,"" which includes Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Manet.  ""Because our services are all public, covering Asia, Europe and America, and the privacy attributes of cryptocurrency are superimposed, our KYC capabilities are now seriously insufficient,"" Huione Guarantee wrote in an email after this story was published. ""Therefore, some hidden users may commit fraud and money laundering through loopholes in the rules, which is also a challenge faced by many banks in various regions around the world! ... We are cooperating with Elliptic to let them help us with high risk address identification. We have deleted the posts about selling illegal equipment mentioned by Elliptic.""  The office of the Council of Ministers of Cambodia did not respond to an email seeking a comment sent after office hours.  The website includes the disclaimer: ""Huiwang Guarantee does not participate in nor understand the specific business of customers. As the guarantor, we are only responsible for one party receiving the goods and the other party receiving the money,"" according to a Google translation.  In May, companies including Coinbase, Kraken, Meta, Ripple, Tinder and Hinge formed the ""Tech Against Scams"" coalition to protect users.  USDT's popularity as a medium for money laundering was mentioned in January by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). USDT issuer Tether said at the time that the stablecoin had been singled out.  When blockchain analysts choose to publicize their findings without engaging directly with counterparties this “encourages a bystander effect, where individuals and in this case companies, observe wrongdoing but choose to record it for social media engagement and notoriety – rather than prioritize intervention,” a Tether spokesperson said today.

This upward movement has signaled bullish sentiment among market participants and potential further gain for the crypto asset. As Avalanche continues to gain pace above $23.50, this article delves into providing an in-depth analysis of this recent price surge and its potential for further growth by examining current price actions and technical indicators focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day chart. At the time of writing, AVAX’s price was up by over 4.85%, trading at about $26.88, with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion and a trading volume of more than $305 million. In the last 24 hours, the market capitalization of AVAX has increased by 4.44%, while trading volume has decreased by 32.13%. Analysis Of AVAX’s Recent Price Momentum Currently, the price of AVAX on the 4-hour chart with bullish momentum has crossed above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The digital asset has been on an upward spiral since breaking above its previous low of $26.50. As a result of the price movement, Avalanche could still extend its rally toward the $30.34 resistance level. Also, an examination of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator indicates that the price of AVAX might continue to rise since the indicator’s signal line has crossed above its simple moving average, and both are trying to move above 50%. On the 1-day chart, although Avalanche is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it can be observed that the crypto asset is attempting a bullish move towards the $30.34 resistance level. After the cross above $26.50, AVAX has been showing bullish resilience thereby keeping its pace above this level. With this recent bullish momentum, the digital asset could potentially extend its rally to other resistance levels. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the composite trend oscillator also indicates that AVAX could potentially expand its bullish move as the signal is attempting to cross above the SMA of the indicator and are both trying to move out of the oversold zone. Can Avalanche Sustain Its Upward Trajectory? Currently, AVAX is trying to move higher toward the resistance level of $30.34. If the crypto asset’s price hits this level and closes above, it will likely move on to challenge the resistance level at $37.29. If the $37.29 level is surpassed, it may also target the $39.94 resistance level and other higher levels. Nonetheless, if it reaches the $30.34 mark and encounters resistance, the price might begin to decline once more in the direction of the $23.50 support level. When it breaches this $23.50 support level below, Avalanche will keep falling to test the $18.83 support and other lower levels.

BTC held largely steady amid Germany's continued divestment of coins.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} holds steady at around $58,500 amid German state Saxony's fresh movement of coins on-chain, having failed to keep gains above $59,000 during the Asian hours.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value traded at $58,470, down 1.6% from the high of $59,450 reached at 1:06 UTC, according to data tracked by CoinDesk.  Per Arkham Intelligence, so far today, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has moved over 10,853 BTC worth $637 million, to exchanges Kraken and Coinbase and market makers like Cumberland and Flow Traders, continuing its proactive approach of liquidating BTC seized from a privacy website.  On Tuesday, CoinDesk reported that it was the German state of Saxony that has been moving bitcoin for the past few weeks in accordance with standard procedure.  The state began selling BTC in the second half of June and has since liquidated 30,997 BTC, roiling the crypto market. BTC has dropped over 15% in the past four weeks, with prices hitting a low of $53,550 at one point last week. As of writing, the wallet tied to BKA held 13,360 BTC ($784.96 million).  The steady price action suggests the market is slowly getting comfortable with the divestment and potential selling by Mt. Gox creditors.  ""The market seems to be growing more comfortable with the outflows from Mt. Gox and the German government. The spot Bitcoin ETFs are now seeing strong inflows again, indicating signs of a trend reversal. This is further supported by the RSI, which shows that the undersold level we highlighted a few days ago was seen as an opportunity by investors,"" Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN, said in an email.  ""We continue to expect positive news from [Thursday's U.S.] CPI, but we anticipate the Fed will delay rate cuts until September. Possible hawkish comments, as seen after the strong PCE on June 28, could lead the market to react as if inflation is not decreasing. Therefore, we recommend taking profits ahead of a potentially shaky end to the week.""

Siddiq has previously called for mitigating the risks that crypto poses as well as harnessing the sector's potential.  U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer named Tulip Siddiq as Economic Secretary to the Treasury and City Minister, a position that involves overseeing financial services including crypto.  Siddiq, who held the Shadow City Minister post while in opposition, was appointed after the Labour party's landslide election victory last week. The party said recently it will support the Bank of England's digital-pound plans and wants to make the country a tokenization hub.  In a New Statesman article two years ago, the 41-year-old wrote about both the threats and potential she saw in the crypto and blockchain industry.  ""Properly regulated crypto assets have the potential to transform our economy and the financial services sector,"" Siddiq, who represents London's Hampstead and Highgate constituency, said in the article. ""Many innovative companies are embracing different forms of blockchain technology to improve transparency in finance and to create high-skilled, high-productivity jobs across the UK.""  She has also spoken about crypto fraud in parliamentary debates, and urged for more to be done to mitigate this. The Conservative Party's City Minister at the time, Andrew Griffith, said measures were being put in place to help tackle fraud via the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act in response, which passed into law last year. That legislation was promoted by the Home Office, which will now be headed by Yvette Cooper.  While in government, the Conservative Party said it wanted the country to be a crypto hub. Last year, it passed legislation for crypto to be treated as a regulated activity and held consultations on a phased approach for regulating crypto that started with stablecoins.  Siddiq's predecessor, Bim Afolami, promised to usher in secondary legislation for stablecoins and staking but did not manage to do so before the election. Members of the crypto community told CoinDesk they expect the Labour government to push ahead with these plans.

The quantity of network activity has increased significantly, but the cryptocurrency’s price is still unpredictable. It’s stuck in a rut, held back by both a possible technical breakthrough and a chronically pessimistic outlook. Related Reading: Mass Adoption? NEAR Protocol Sees 17 Million Unique Addresses In 30 Days Polygon: Can Active Addresses Raise The Bar? Polygon’s network was humming on July 8th, with an astounding 1.18 million active addresses. For the same period, this easily outpaced Ethereum (365K) and Bitcoin (594K). The increase in user activity stoked expectations of a positive breakout, especially as MATIC was trading over a crucial $0.50 barrier level. Co-founder of Polygon Mihailo Bjelic excitedly provided this statistics, emphasising the increasing use of the network. Some cryptocurrency fans, meanwhile, were quick to label this as a “vanity metric.” They contended that robust economic fundamentals or important transactions are not always correlated with raw address count. Number of active addresses (24h): Polygon: 1.18M Bitcoin: 594k Ethereum: 365k Not too shabby, I guess.. — Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) July 8, 2024 Although resistance lingers, the falling wedge pattern suggests a breakout. Taking into consideration the technological aspects, it seems that things are getting better for MATIC. As the token has been moving in a falling wedge formation, which is commonly seen as a sign that an upswing in the market is about to occur, the pattern has been observed. In addition, as a result of a recent spike in price, MATIC came dangerously close to crossing the threshold of $0.50 for a brief while. It is probable that this is an indication of a future breakout, particularly if the volume of trade grows. MATIC market cap at nearly $5 billion today. Chart: TradingView.comBut the bulls are up against an unyielding obstacle. As the mark has shown to be a strong resistance level in the past, a clear break above it is essential to the validation of the falling wedge breakout. Moreover, the general mood of the market is still biassed towards the bears. At the time of writing, MATIC was down 10% in the weekly timeframe, data from Coingecko show. Bullish Binance, But Can They Move The Market? Meanwhile, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance offers some optimism. When it comes to MATIC, Binance, users seem to be far more optimistic than the whole market. With a solid long to short position ratio of 3.2052, they appear to have a high conviction in the potential of MATIC going forward. Related Reading: XRP Stages A Comeback: Aims To Reclaim $0.50 After Recent Plunge It’s encouraging to see such strong enthusiasm on a significant exchange. But it’s not clear if it will be sufficient to counter the general pessimism. For MATIC, the next several days will be critical. A falling wedge breakthrough might occur if it can generate enough volume to break over the $0.50 barrier and maintain the momentum. But if the barrier holds and the bearish attitude persists, MATIC can experience more downside pressure.

42407885,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7NTJ,1720602000,Trump's New Crypto Enthusiasm Could Help Him Win More Votes: Poll,"Former President Donald Trump's recent embrace of cryptocurrency after his long-standing skepticism may win him some votes among reluctant Republicans as he seeks a return to the White House in November, according to an industry-sponsored poll released on Wednesday.  His party's presumptive nominee for president, Trump made a series of positive remarks about aiding the U.S. crypto sector that has caught the attention of some voters, the poll paid for by crypto investment firm Paradigm indicated. The snapshot of Republican sentiment suggested 13% of those who weren't planning on voting for him felt his crypto position made them see him in a more positive light, according to the data compiled by polling firm Echelon Insights.  Most of those surveyed (60%) believe Congress needs to come up with regulations for crypto businesses, the polling suggested, and the Republicans generally don't like how today's financial system operates.  ""Republicans understand the appeal of crypto and support congressional action to establish clear and predictable rules,"" Katie Biber, Paradigm's chief legal officer, and Alex Grieve, the company's government affairs lead, wrote in an analysis of the data.  The poll of more than a thousand likely GOP voters was conducted in mid-June, well before the televised debate that threw the race between Trump and President Joe Biden into some turmoil. Trump cruised toward his party's nomination in this year's primaries, and the party convention is approaching next week to make it official.  More than one in four of the Republicans polled had dabbled in crypto ownership (28%), and that involvement skewed toward younger, male and non-white demographics.  Those responding almost universally (94%) believe their personal financial records should remain private, and among the smaller subset of people familiar with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), 68% opposed it for the U.S. The results were a bit narrower on whether the U.S. government ought to pave the way for the private sector to produce payment products that can compete with China's digital yuan: 40% of the people were for it and 31% against.  Polling of voters this year has revealed complicated impressions of crypto. This poll showed slightly more of the Republicans answering the questions had a positive impression of crypto (36%) versus a negative view (30%), but the 3.5% margin of error leaves some uncertainty in those levels.  A Harris Poll survey released in May suggested fewer than one in three – 31% – of voters in a handful of key swing states had a positive take on crypto. A separate Harris Poll questioning a wider pool of likely U.S. voters released later that month showed a third of the electorate saying they'll weigh candidates' crypto positions when they're making a decision on whether to support them. So, crypto may be emerging as one deciding factor for voters, though their sentiments aren't universally in favor of the industry.  Republican leaders seem to have received the message of voters favoring cryptocurrency, and the Republican National Committee announced earlier this week that it was including digital assets support in the party platform.  Trump remains in a very close race against President Joe Biden, according to national presidential polling, though Trump's slight edge grew after the CNN debate in which Biden was perceived as delivering a poor and halting performance.

Bernstein initiated coverage of miners Iris Energy and Core Scientific with outperform ratings.  The broker remains a bitcoin bull and forecasts the token reaching $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029 and more than $1 million by 2033.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners are attractive partners to help build artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, due to their available power supplies and operating capabilities, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.  Recent AI deals including Core Scientific’s (CORZ) 12-year agreement with CoreWeave and Coatue Management’s $150 million investment in Hut 8 (HUT) have become key catalysts for the sector, the report said.  Bernstein initiated coverage of miner Iris Energy (IREN) with an outperform rating and a $26 price target. The broker also initiated coverage of Core Scientific with an outperform rating and a $17 objective. Iris Energy was trading at $13.40 in early trading on Tuesday, Core Scientific at $9.79.  Bitcoin miners have secured large amounts of power supply, and today control about 6 gigawatts (GW) of power access with a pipeline of up to 12 GW by 2027, the report noted. The miners have a lead in the “large load power interconnect queue” and therefore can help potential partners save time in securing energy supplies.  “Bitcoin data centers are ideal for retrofit due to high power density racks, cooling infrastructure and general data center operating capabilities,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote, adding that “we expect 20% of bitcoin miner’s power capacity to pivot to AI by 2027 end.”  The five largest U.S. bitcoin miners are expected to continue consolidating scale and to grow to about 25% of the bitcoin global hashrate, with the medium-term option to pivot to AI, Bernstein said. Hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The broker remains a bitcoin bull, and forecasts the asset reaching $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029 and more than $1 million by 2033, and following the successful launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January it said its conviction is higher.

30737812,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628801,1720598421,8 Reasons Why The Bitcoin Bear Phase Is Just A ‘Boogeyman’: Fund Manager,"While the Bitcoin price hasn’t reclaimed the crucial $60,000 level to reenter the previous 4-month trading range, Ikigai Asset Management Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Travis Kling thinks that the current bearish phase is not more than a “boogeyman.” Via X, Kling listed eight reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin. He stated: “NFA. I’m wrong often. The current “bearish” backdrop seems easier to look through and buy than most of the boogeymen we’ve had in these markets over the last 6 years.” #1 Rapid Bitcoin Liquidations By Germany Travis Kling observes that Germany has significantly decreased its Bitcoin holdings, from 50,000 BTC to 22,000 BTC in recent weeks. According to him, “Germany is speedrunning their #Bitcoin dump.” He predicts the selling will soon cease, suggesting, “By the time they get down to ~5k, the market will look through it.” Kling implies that the market impact of Germany’s Bitcoin liquidations is temporary and nearing its end. #2 Mt. Gox’s Overestimated Market Impact Kling addressed the potential market effects of the Mt. Gox repayments, characterizing the fear of massive sell-offs as more speculative than based on the creditors’ likely actions. He stated, “Gox seems more FUD than actual mass selling (just a guess but feels that way).” Related Reading: Bitcoin to the Moon? 300% Growth Predicted By This Latest Crypto Analysis He believes the creditors, many of whom are sophisticated investors, are likely to sell their holdings methodically, e.g. via TWAPs, thus reducing the impact on the market. Regarding the retail investors, Kling asked a rhetorical question, “You’ve hung on for decade when you could have sold ages ago. You’re just going to aggressively dump now, three months after the halving?” #3 US Government’s Bitcoin Strategy Regarding the US government’s Bitcoin sales, Kling emphasized the measured approach taken so far. He stated, “But they’ve been pretty measured with selling so far, so I assume they’ll continue to be pretty measured.” While he admits that the US government selling is the “hardest to get your head around in terms of pace/method, and their stack is huge,” he claims that the selling is unlikely to disrupt market stability. #4 Retail Investment Boost Through ETFs Kling highlighted a surge in retail investment in Bitcoin, particularly through ETFs, following recent price dips. He remarked, “You have boomers slurping the dipperino in the BTC ETFs Fri and Mon.” This trend indicates strong retail investor interest in capitalizing on lower prices, suggesting a bullish sentiment among this investor segment. #5 Ethereum ETF Anticipation With the anticipation of US spot Ethereum ETFs, Kling noted that the price of ETH remains only slightly below its level prior to the emergence of ETF rumors, indicating minimal speculative hype has been priced in. This observation suggests that the market could react positively to the launches. #6 Interest Rate Cuts Are Near Kling also discussed the potential for upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts, noting the market has priced in a significant probability of such an event in September. He stated, “If inflation/labor data is light this month, Powell will likely tell the market that Sept is a live meeting at the 7/31 FOMC. Nickileaks has already teased this.” Related Reading: If History Repeats, Bitcoin Price Could Crash 33% Again: Here’s Why The fund manager is referring to Wall Street Journal’s Nick Timiraos who is also known as “mouthpiece of the Fed”. A few days ago, Timiraos wrote via X that the June jobs report will make the July Fed meeting “more interesting” because. “For the first time all year—a real debate over whether to cut at the *next* meeting (in September),” he remarked. #7 The Potential Trump Pump Kling speculated on the political landscape’s influence on Bitcoin, particularly under a potential Trump presidency. Kling posed a rhetorical question, “What else would you rather own than crypto going into a Trump presidency?” with regards to the latest pro-Bitcoin and crypto comments by the leading presidential candidate in the polls. #8 Bitcoin And Nasdaq Re-Coupling Kling pointed out the disparity between NASDAQ’s continual new all-time highs and Bitcoin’s relative underperformance. He noted, “NASDAQ keeps making new ATH after new ATH. Crypto has completely decoupled to the downside.” He suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued relative to the major market index and soon starts a catch-up rallye. “You could argue BTC is lagging QQQ by 40% YTD,” Kling concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $59,147.

42407895,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7O3g,1720597257,"Celestia's TIA Token Surges 25%, Leaves Crypto Traders in Disbelief","TIA surges 25% in one week, hinting at a positive turnaround following a five-month downtrend.  Traders continue to short TIA perpetual futures, negative funding rates suggest.  TIA's rally may have legs, according to one observer.  Data availability blockchain network Celestia's native cryptocurrency TIA has jumped 25% to $7.30 this week, registering the best performance among the top 100 digital assets by market value.  Traders seem skeptical about the ongoing price surge and are taking bearish bets by shorting perpetual futures tied to the cryptocurrency, according to funding rates tracked by CoinGlass.  Average funding rates across exchanges flipped negative over the weekend and have dropped to -0.1231% since then, reaching levels last seen in January. In other words, bias for bearish bets is most pronounced in six months.  Calculated and collected from traders every eight hours, funding rates represent the cost of holding bullish or bearish bets. A negative rate implies that traders with short positions, betting on a price drop, are paying a funding fee to longs. It occurs when there is a high demand for short positions relative to long positions.  The bias for shorts amid a price rally looks like a classic case of recency bias, whereby trades are placing more weight on the TIA's price crash in recent months than other vital developments. TIA's latest bounce comes after a five-month downtrend that saw prices slide 80% from $21 to less than $5. As such, it's not particularly surprising to see traders sell the bounce.  However, traders could be overlooking modular blockchain Celestia's role as a data availability layer for layer 2 networks like the booming permissionless liquidity layer for Web3 trading, Orderly Network, which means the price bounce could be sustainable.  ""The need for a data availability layer here makes sense after realizing that safe/permissionless liquidity is by far one of the biggest hurdles in making onchain perps markets usable. So having a middle layer that can provide shared liquidity to any exchange seems like an obvious solution moving forward,"" psuedonymous analyst DeFi^2 explained on X.  ""As an actual core piece of infrastructure for cases like this, Celestia has a lot of the right factors coming together this week for a strong market bottom to be put in, including the Modular Summit taking place this week with Celestia at the center of it,"" DeFi^2 added.  Celestia, a modular blockchain, separates consensus from execution, boosting scalability. It acts like a storage system for data used by rollups and layer 2 networks, helping them become faster and handle more transactions.  Orderly Network, a permissionless liquidity layer and infrastructure provider for Web3 trading built on top of the Near blockchain, uses Celestia for data availability. On July 5, Orderly Network's cumulative trading volume reached a record $6.2 billion, with cumulative net fees exceeding $6.6 million while accounting for 40% of the total data posted on the Celestia network, the network told CoinDesk in an email.  Besides, the bias for short positions could catalyze further price rise. The funding fee that traders holding shorts are currently paying will become a burden if prices remain resilient, eventually forcing them to square off their bearish bets. That, in turn, could bump up prices in what is a known as a short squeeze rally.",NEUTRAL,TIA,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TIA,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/10/celestias-tia-token-surges-25-leaves-crypto-traders-in-disbelief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bf07936137d88f456defd08c34cd655bfdf107c-1678x1123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30735645,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628743,1720594800,Bitcoin Loses Correlation With US Equities As Supply Challenges Mount,"In recent months, the correlation between surging US equities and Bitcoin (BTC) has shown signs of collapse, as the cryptocurrency faces a combination of excess supply and weakened demand that has led to an over 20% price drop from June highs above $70,000 for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Bitcoin Correlation With Nasdaq 100 According to Bloomberg, the 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index dropped to 0.21 on Tuesday, marking its lowest level since the beginning of May. This decline reflects a more than 50% drop in correlation over the past two months. Market experts attribute this decoupling to several “idiosyncratic” supply events affecting Bitcoin. Joshua Lim, co-founder of trading firm Arbelos Markets, explains that the cryptocurrency is grappling with the impact of spot sales from seized BTC held by the German and US governments experienced over the past month, as well as the distribution of funds from the defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Related Reading: Football Takeover? Solana-Based Token Skyrockets 350% Following Messi and Ronaldinho’s Promotion As reported by NewsBTC, Bitcoin’s decline since its March all-time high of $73,700 has been accelerated by the recent process initiated by Mt. Gox’s administrators to return approximately $9 billion worth of tokens to creditors. In addition, German authorities sold more than half of the 50,000 BTC seized from a pirate website in January, adding to the ongoing selling pressure seen last month. Manuel Villegas, research analyst at Julius Baer, highlights the looming supply overhang as the primary factor impacting market confidence. Villegas stated: Excess token supply is expected to reach centralized exchanges in the next few days, likely putting pressure on prices. The looming supply overhang has been the main factor affecting confidence. Miner Capitulation And Falling Profits In addition to these challenges affecting BTC’s price, Bitcoin miners face pressure to sell tokens due to declining profitability. These miners, responsible for powering the Bitcoin blockchain, are dealing with the financial fallout from April’s Halving event, which reduced the number of new tokens they receive for their mining activities. In response, some miners sell some of their BTC holding inventory to offset their fiat-based operating costs. Data from crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that miner capitulation mirrors December 2022 levels with a 7.7% hashrate drop, similar to post-FTX collapse conditions. Related Reading: Solana Mirroring 2021 Bullish Pattern, Crypto Analyst Reveals According to estimates made by Bloomberg, the average all-in cost of production for miners is approximately $54,500. When prices fall significantly below this threshold, miners may need to liquidate some token holdings to cover operational expenses. Ultimately, the combination of supply overhang from seized coins, the Mt. Gox distribution, and miners’ selling pressure has increased uncertainty for investors, further affecting BTC’s price recovery. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to recover the $57,850 level, surging over 2% in the past 24 hours.

30733513,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628714,1720591253,Bitcoin Traders Beware: Analyst Warns Of Potential Traps Amid Price Fluctuations,"In a recent episode of Crypto Banter’s “The Sniper Trading Show,” the analyst dissected Bitcoin, discussing various hurdles and approaches to handle trading through these challenges. With Bitcoin currently teetering around the $57,403 mark, up by 2.4% in the past 24 hours yet still down 21.9% from its March peak, the market sentiment is cautiously tinged. This cautious stance is echoed by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which the analyst shows stands at a wary 28, indicating that buyers are getting “cold feet”—a sentiment that historically signals buying opportunities though with a careful approach. The analyst reminded the viewers to keep an eye on longer time frames, drawing from a consistent bullish stance on Bitcoin since its $10,000 valuation in 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Make-Or-Break Test: Will Support Hold? Is Bitcoin Setting a Trap? The analyst pointed to critical resistance levels at $65,000 and $70,000, cautioning that the market could see a bounce back or bull traps set to liquidate over-leveraged positions. Throughout the conversation, the analyst then discussed Bitcoin’s current struggle to maintain support above a very important range of $60k-$61k recently– one that proved strong as support has now become a formidable resistance. According to the analyst, this inability to break through this price range, now seen as resistance, suggests a changing market structure where previous supports become resistant, potentially stalling further price ascents. The analyst discussed the possibility of Bitcoin entering a range or getting ensnared in a trap that could precipitate a flurry of liquidations, emphasizing the need for traders to be versatile and prepared for sudden market movements. Outlook On Altcoin Adding to the mix, the analyst identified that the small dip in market dominance for Bitcoin hints at a possible uplift for altcoins should the broader market sentiment pivot to bullish. He emphasized that this gradual change might indicate a potential upside for altcoins, consistent with prior times when Bitcoin dominance started to fall before any uptrend amongst the alternative cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, recent technical analyses from prominent Analyst Ali reveal Bitcoin is inside a parallel channel on higher time frames, and TD Sequential has just presented with a buy signal hinting at a possible short-term rebound to around $58,300.

Avalanche could rise further if there is a clear move above the $27.75 resistance zone. AVAX price is moving higher from the $24.70 support zone against the US dollar. The price is trading above $26.50 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $26.50 on the hourly chart of the AVAX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $26.00 and $25.50 support levels. AVAX Price Aims Higher After a steady decline, Avalanche’s AVAX found support near the $22.00 zone. A support base was formed above $22.00, and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price gained over 7% and broke many hurdles near $25.00. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $26.50 on the hourly chart of the AVAX/USD pair. It cleared the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $27.17 swing high to the $24.72 low. The pair even cleared the $27.00 resistance to move into a positive zone. AVAX price is now trading above $26.50 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near $27.75. The next major resistance is forming near the $28.70 zone or the 1.618 Fib extension level of the downward move from the $27.17 swing high to the $24.72 low. If there is an upside break above the $28.70 level, the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily toward the $30.00 level or even $32.00. Dips Supported in Avalanche? If AVAX price fails to continue higher above the $27.75 or $28.70 levels, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $26.50 level. The main support is near the $26.00 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The meme coin’s price jumped 10%, coinciding with the broader market rally, resulting in Bonk Inu becoming the largest meme coin by market capitalization in the Solana ecosystem, surpassing Dogwifhat (WIF). Bonk Inu Surges Ahead Of Competitors According to CoinGecko data, the recent surge propelled Bonk Inu’s market capitalization to $1.735 billion, surpassing WIF’s market cap of $1.69 billion. This places BONK in the 52nd spot among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market, trailing behind Optimism (OP) and Sui (SUI). Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash: Here’s What The Data Says About Buying The Dip However, in the top 100, Bonk Inu still lags behind larger meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepecoin (PEPE), which have market caps of $15 billion, $9 billion, and $3 billion, respectively. Despite this, Bonk Inu has outperformed these tokens in price action, as the trio recorded significant losses of 13%, 5%, and 20%, respectively, over the past week, while BONK has surged by 3% during the same time frame. Token Burn Proposal The recent surge in Bonk Inu’s price comes after an announcement from the coin’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The BONK DAO revealed on Monday that it had received a proposal to burn approximately 84 billion BONK tokens from its Treasury, representing the Q2 amount of BONK sent to the DAO from BONKBot, which is currently being voted on by the community. Burning tokens is a common practice employed by crypto projects such as Shiba Inu to control inflation and overall token supply. By reducing the supply of tokens, the aim is to increase the value of the remaining coins and create a healthier ecosystem. In the long run, burning tokens tend to support an asset’s price, making it a positive move, which may be one of the catalysts behind the recent surge in Bonk Inu’s token price observed over the past week. Whale Accumulation In addition to these positive developments, Bonk Inu has caught the attention of large investors, commonly referred to as whales. A report from smart money tracker FishTheWhales reveals that there have been five alerts of whale accumulation and buyouts in the past week alone, with a 24-hour trading volume reaching $150 million. Furthermore, crypto analyst Crypto Bull has identified an inverse head and shoulders pattern in Bonk Inu’s daily chart, indicating a potential continuation of the current price recovery. The analyst suggests that BONK is the most “obvious” coin to experience a pump from its current position, with expectations for other meme coins to follow suit.

While the token is undergoing a minor correction from its trading price of $0.00002610, it remains positioned to retest its next significant resistance level at $0.00002885. This level is crucial for the meme coin’s prospects of regaining momentum and potentially revisiting its all-time high of $0.00004547, achieved in March.

The price could gain bullish momentum if there is a move above the $0.440 and $0.4450 resistance levels. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $0.4220 zone. The price is now trading above $0.430 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $0.4370 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a decent upward move if it clears the $0.440 and $0.450 resistance levels. XRP Price Aims Higher XRP price formed a base above the $0.4050 level and recently started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to climb above the $0.420 and $0.4250 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4500 swing high to the $0.4035 low.

The first major resistance is near the $0.4400 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4500 swing high to the $0.4035 low. The next key resistance could be $0.450. A clear move above the $0.450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4720 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.480 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.4880 resistance. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.440 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4320 level. The next major support is at $0.420.

30728083,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628689,1720582258,Bitcoin to the Moon? 300% Growth Predicted By This Latest Crypto Analysis,"Bitcoin is preparing itself for a substantial bull run in the years ahead. One of the latest price trend models predicts significant gains by late 2025 from an analysis rooted in ‘power law,’ a statistical method that has historically proven to be a solid support band for Bitcoin’s value. Revisiting the theory, an engineer named Apsk32 on X has shared an update on Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, despite a notable 25% price drop from March’s peak, the potential for a substantial rally looms, anticipating up to 300% gains by the end of 2025. The optimism is built on the fact that cycle patterning has been a theme in Bitcoin’s past, indicating that we are just months away from a forming and observable move higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Bottom? QCP Analysts Spot Signs of Capitulation as Prices Tumble Below $59K Examining the Predictive Power of the Power-law The power law isn’t just a mathematical abstraction; it’s a practical tool that reliably indicates where Bitcoin’s price might find its footing. According to Apsk32, this metric provides a lower support band that has held strong since Bitcoin’s early days when it was valued merely at a dollar. The same model forecasts a rise to $1 million by 2036, assuming the trend continues. Further analysis by Apsk32 shows that Bitcoin’s journey follows a four-year cycle, a pattern that has seen it rebound from periodic lows to new highs. This cycle is currently in a phase that typically precedes significant growth, as detailed in Apsk32’s analysis. The application of this model today considers various market factors, including recent regulatory changes and shifts in investment strategies, such as the arrival of ETFs. These elements have recently nudged Bitcoin’s price out of its typical range, but if history is any guide, a correction toward growth is likely on the horizon, according to Apsk32. The engineer referred to the Power Law Fractal Cloud, a conceptual tool that predicts price movements within specific bands. The ETFs pushed us out of the cloud and now we’re reverting back. We’re 3+ months away from upwards acceleration and we could see prices go up 4x by the end of 2025. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin has managed to reclaim its $57k mark and is now stabilizing above it. This follows the asset’s notable drop from last week, which brought the asset to trade as low as $53k on Friday following the German government selling some BTC holdings worth millions of dollars. Bitcoin trades for $57,646 at the time of writing, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Samson Mow, the former Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream and CEO of Jan3 – a Bitcoin-centric company, has recently expressed his faith concerning the demand for Bitcoin, which would not succumb to heavy market sell-offs.

This led to one of the largest drops seen for the pioneer cryptocurrency in the last two years, costing the market billions of dollars. However, despite this, Bitcoin holders are still seeing major gains, with the vast majority of investors currently in profit despite the market crash. Bitcoin Holders Enjoy Massive Gains According to data from the on-chain tracker IntoTheBlock, there are around 53.57 million Bitcoin holders worldwide. Of these investors, a total of 83% are still seeing profit despite the BTC price drop below $60,000, as it currently sits just above $56,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins This figure leaves just around 17% of the total BTC holders that are not currently seeing a profit. Out of this figure, 13% are losing money, meaning they bought their BTC coins when the price was higher than the current value, leaving 4% of holders at breakeven. This means that this 4% bought their coins around the current value, so they are neither making nor losing money at the current price. At these percentages, it means that around 44.61 million Bitcoin investors are still enjoying profits in their positions. 6.8 million BTC holders are suffering losses now, and around 2.16 million investors are currently sitting at breakeven. Interestingly, the majority of these investors sitting in profit have their entry prices below $50,000, meaning that even with another 10% crash from here, the vast majority of Bitcoin investors would still be seeing their holdings in profit. BTC Long-Term Holders At Risk Of Losses While the data shows that the vast majority of Bitcoin investors are still seeing profits, there is a growing trend that is particularly affecting long-term holders. According to a Sentiment report, the average returns of Bitcoin long-term holders risk falling into losses for the first time in more than one year. Related Reading: Finance CEO Raoul Pal Says Crypto Will Reach $100 Trillion Market Cap – Here’s When However, this is not a negative thing for the price, given how BTC has responded in the past when the average long-term holder returns fell into the red. As Santiment notes, this is usually a good time to buy, especially when “Bitcoin’s 30-day and 365-day MVRV are in negative territory.” The tracker further added, “This is when there is mathematical validation that you are buying relative to other traders’ pain.” To put how much of a good buying opportunity this is, “If you had bought the last time both of these lines were in negative territory, your return on BTC would be at +132%,” Santiment notes. To put it in plain terms, developments like these can often be a good indicator of where the bottom is and when to start buying.

Assuming Bitcoin lacks fundamental use value as a fiat alternative, its returns appear driven by excess liquidity in the financial market. COVID-era stimulus created immense excess financial market liquidity, most of which has dried up, causing speculative assets like Bitcoin to stagnate. BITO faces added liquidity risk due to exposure to the Bitcoin futures market, potential tax issues, and counterparty liquidity concerns that could arise temporarily during a crash. BITO may now be a short opportunity. That said, it could rise if speculative fervor returns or the Federal Reserve quickly returns to QE policies in a potential recession. One of the first articles I published this year was "" BITO: 2024 May Be Bitcoin's 'Make Or Break' Year. "" At that time, I was bearish on the popular Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) due to what I perceived as a potential top to the cryptocurrency bull market. I also believe that BITO's risks were slightly elevated because of its exposure to liquidity risk factors in the Bitcoin futures market. BITO has declined by ~10% since then, although its total return is positive due to its capital distribution. Bitcoin is still up 30% YTD but has lost around 17% of its value over the past month, with BITO falling by 23%. It is worth pointing out that I was not so bearish on BITO that I saw it as a short opportunity. As I stated, I would not short Bitcoin or BITO because it could quickly rise higher over the coming months due to decent speculative momentum. This view has primarily proven accurate. Bitcoin and BITO initially continued to climb over the spring months and have reversed those gains. That said, Bitcoin is still higher than when I became bearish on it. Thus, I think it is more reasonable to consider whether or not it may be a good time to short Bitcoin or BITO. Of course, other factors could still prove bullish for Bitcoin, so I aim to reconsider both the positive and negative arguments surrounding BITO to provide an updated outlook on the fund and its underlying asset. Why Bitcoin and BITO Have Likely Peaked My dominant view is that Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies have reached a cyclical peak. It is worth stating outright that my views on Bitcoin are predicated on my fundamental belief that it is a speculative vehicle and not a viable currency. Those curious regarding my specific views may benefit from reading my recent article on the Bitcoin ""miner"" Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), "" Riot Platforms: A Cash-Burning Machine, Even In The Crypto Bull Market. "" To summarize, I believe Bitcoin's energy transaction cost and time length are magnitudes too high to make it remotely viable as a currency. That is not to say cryptocurrencies may not have viability, but that Bitcoin is likely akin to a dinosaur. It is based on a very outdated technological framework compared to more recent innovations like XRP or XMR that have superior transaction times and greater privacy abilities (particularly with XMR), as well as lack the extremely power-intensive platform such as used by Bitcoin miners like Riot. For example, while some of Texas is seeing its grid fail due to the hurricane, Riot may be using GW of power to mine an increasingly small amount of Bitcoin. To me, issues such as that are potential catalysts that could lead to the gradual or rapid disbelief in Bitcoin. BITO is based on Bitcoin, which, in turn, is powered by speculative activity and, in my view, misfocused hope. Bitcoin and BITO are also poor hedges, with BITO being positively correlated to stocks and bonds based on monthly total returns of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) and the Bond market ETF ( BND ). See below: Data by YCharts Many see Bitcoin and BITO as hedges against financial market risk. For the most part, that is not true, as Bitcoin will usually rise and fall with stocks and, to a lesser extent, bonds. Notably, although its bond correlation is never very high, it is almost never negative, implying that it is potentially not an inflation hedge (given bonds are negatively exposed to inflation). On a shorter-term basis, BITO is not so highly correlated to stocks and bonds that investors may notice. Indeed, some exposure to BITO would reduce overall portfolio volatility on a day-to-day basis, given its correlation is usually below 0.5. However, during market crashes, or periods of considerable volatility, it is often the case that correlations rise, causing exposure to increase when it is most problematic. For example, during the summer of 2022, which saw an increased interest rate outlook amid inflation concerns, we saw notable declines in Bitcoin, which was well-mirrored in the S&P 500 and bond market. See below: Data by YCharts Of course, this is just one example, but investors may want to remember it. During low volatility periods, it may seem that BITO and Bitcoin are not highly exposed to general market risk. However, when volatility increases, and people are looking to sell virtually anything, Bitcoin seems to be among the things people wish to sell. Again, that implies that it is a speculative asset, not a hedge, and may crash during a period of negative stock or bond market activity. Indeed, the recent declines in Bitcoin, mirrored in BITO, potentially indicate an increase in general financial market risk. Those who've read my articles likely know that I see markets as primarily liquidity-driven (cash, bank lending, Fed QE/QT) and secondarily driven by fundamentals (earnings, economy, etc.) Over recent years, most aspects of the US and global economy have stagnated, with some growing (technology) and other sectors declining (manufacturing). Still, most stocks, huge technology stocks have seen their best performance. To me, that is because the financial system has had excess liquidity coming out of the COVID stimulus and QE efforts, most of which are now burned up amid QT. This pattern is mirrored by the relationship between Bitcoin, BITO, and individual investor cash allocations. For example, as rates were rising in 2022, many individual investors flocked to cash to take advantage of higher rates and reduce exposure to the usual economic risk that comes from higher rates. We saw Bitcoin crash during that ""negative individual investor liquidity"" period. However, that led to a buildup in cash allocations, which have since been redeployed into (in my view) primarily speculative assets from those looking for abnormal short-term gains. No surprise, Bitcoin and BITO have likely been among those. See below: Note that this shows the change in cash allocations from the baseline. The average individual investor cash allocation level from AAII surveys is 15% today, which is the typical cyclical minimum. Usually, when cash allocations are this low, markets tend to decline or stagnate as there is insufficient sideline cash to deploy. Many broader economic and monetary factors point to less liquidity for speculative instruments. Of course, the Fed is effectively ""deleting"" money through its slow QT program, bank deposits are stuck (capping lending), and personal household savings are very low (due to rising living costs). Thus, the potential sideline cash that could be deployed into Bitcoin is far lower than it has been over most of the past two years or perhaps even in Bitcoin's history (until recently, during periods of extreme money supply growth). The only area of decent liquidity is foreign banks with US cash . I suspect that is due to more significant monetary issues in countries like Japan. However, I do not believe the potential return of overseas US dollars is sufficient to improve the overall US financial market liquidity decline. When investors treat cash as valuable during periods of lower liquidity, we usually see overvalued financial assets decline. Conversely, periods of low interest rates or excess liquidity growth often cause some financial assets to become overvalued. From that view, I believe Bitcoin has been an area where investors with extra cash have speculatively deployed money and will thus withdraw that money first as liquidity falls back into short supply. Although the Fed may cut rates, that will likely require a continued rise in unemployment. I believe there is very strong evidence to suggest that we're seeing the beginnings of a much larger increase in unemployment . To me, the liquidity demands of higher unemployment would be far greater than any added supply from rate cuts. However, a return of QE could provide enough liquidity that Bitcoin and BITO may benefit. That said, I suspect that we will not see QE return until/unless stocks, bonds, and Bitcoin are far lower. Does BITO Face Added Liquidity Risk? Previously, one issue I saw with BITO was its exposure to the Bitcoin futures market. As I discussed, BITO owns most of the Bitcoin futures market, so if Bitcoin crashes, there may not be sufficient counterparties to the ETF. One issue is that it may have poor tax exposure because it has to occasionally sell futures and realize gains, distributing them as a cash payment. Again, BITO does not have a 41% yield, as that ""yield"" represents the distribution of its gains on futures, which are likely to be taxed at the short-term rate because the holding period will generally be low. Those curious should research this issue, though that is what I surmise based on the research of others . However, from an overall efficiency standpoint, I am sure that owning Bitcoin outright is the best option for taxation issues (given your holding period is over a year), counterparty liquidity, and avoidance of BITO's 95 bps expense ratio. BITO's potential counterparty liquidity issues were highlighted recently as its premium shot up during increased Bitcoin volatility. See below: Data by YCharts Realistically, the counterpart risk to BITO is a short-term problem. It may be that if you're looking to sell BITO during a crash (the same day or the same week), there is a chance that BITO has an odd premium or discount that could be pretty large. To me, this risk is higher today because BITO has become very popular, as seen in its outstanding share (measured by AUM/price in the lowest chart). Again, BITO should always settle very close to Bitcoin's spot price, but I would not want to sell the fund during a period where many others are as well, since that is likelier to see a greater spread between its NAV and price. Still, that spread could be positive, potentially making it a benefit. The Bottom Line Overall, I downgrade my view on BITO from bearish to very bearish, with my expectation that Bitcoin has reached a cyclical peak and is becoming more firm. Since January, we've seen the necessary continued deterioration in total financial market liquidity drivers, such that there is insufficient ""sideline cash"" for Bitcoin to continue to rise. Again, while I like some cryptocurrencies, I see zero fundamental value to Bitcoin and believe it is a waste of increasingly scarce electricity resources. So then, for me, Bitcoin relies on the "" Greater Fool Theory. "" In other words, I think having a bullish view of Bitcoin is entirely valid if you feel it may rise due to speculative momentum. However, considering its fundamentals as a cryptocurrency, its correlations with other asset classes, and market liquidity, it is, to me, very clear that it is only driven by excess liquidity. BITO is where you park money you don't need, hoping it may rise, but not an investment that causes proper (economic) capital growth, as seen in most stocks. To that end, I think BITO should decline at a faster pace because I believe financial market excess liquidity is drying up much faster and could evaporate if we see a large upward swing to unemployment. If the Fed is swift to cut rates and pursue QE, Bitcoin may stand to benefit. Of course, the Fed is, in my view, almost always too late. However, I expect that gold and silver (in particular) would benefit the most in that scenario. It is worth pointing out that silver and gold may also decline during market shocks, but not likely to the same extent as Bitcoin, which behaves more similarly to the stock market than the physical commodities. Would I short BITO or Bitcoin today? Perhaps, but not necessarily. Over the first half of 2024, I've shifted from the view that ""Bitcoin may peak soon"" to ""Bitcoin has likely peaked."" To me, it remains unclear how considerable Bitcoin's overall downside is. I feel that Bitcoin may be due for a record decline because many may need to sell it if unemployment spikes in a traditional recession. Bitcoin remains untested in a conventional recession, given the 2020 recession was driven by external circumstances and was met with extreme liquidity stimulus. I guess that Bitcoin may perceptively become ""BitCon"" as in a ""con"" in a 2000-like market crash, but that is speculative. Personally, I am not going to place a short on my guesses, as I feel there are other assets where short-selling is less risky. So, I may bet against BITO today. However, I would only do so with a small allocation since its downside is unclear. We could still see a resurgence in bullish speculative activity. However, I believe the odds of that are increasingly low. Lastly, it may be that my belief that Bitcoin has no value as an alternative to fiat currency is proven incorrect. Still, again, in a world where electricity and energy prices are rising, I cannot see how Bitcoin could be a long-term viable currency alternative where many cryptocurrencies do not require so much energy per transaction .",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703240-bito-bitcoin-bear-market-begins-as-excess-liquidity-dries-up?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30722010.jpeg

On Tuesday, it emerged as the market’s top performer with a 16.4% increase in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $6.78. TIA Price Analysis Last Friday, July 5, the TIA token hit an 8-month low of $4.16, influenced by the declining prices of major cryptocurrencies and the cautious sentiment among bullish investors. However, recent developments have reignited interest in Celestia, allowing it to regain key indicators that have prevented a more substantial surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash: Here’s What The Data Says About Buying The Dip A significant resistance wall for TIA is its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $7.74, marked by the yellow line on the TIA/USD daily chart below, which will be a crucial milestone for the token in the coming days if the bullish trend continues, with the potential to extend the price surge. However, before reaching this level, Celestia will have to overcome another resistance level at $7.26, which will act as an 8-month threshold for bearish investors to prevent a potential continuation of the current rally. Orderly Network Boosts Celestia Dominance Of On-Chain Perps Market expert and technical analyst DeFiSquared highlights the nature of Celestia’s recent uptrend, noting that despite current market conditions driven by a perceived lack of utility in cryptocurrencies, Celestia stands out as a blockchain infrastructure that facilitates “real and useful activity.” In a recent social media post, the expert noted that a significant portion of the data posted on Celestia comes from the Orderly Network, which provides permissionless liquidity for on-chain perps markets – a sector with consistent and significant demand. The Orderly Network handles a significant portion of the market’s volume, exceeding half a billion daily trades and growing. According to the analyst, the need for a data availability layer to facilitate secure and permissionless liquidity for on-chain perps markets has become apparent. Celestia’s role as a core piece of infrastructure in this context positions it favorably for a strong market bottom. Related Reading: Massive Mt. Gox Bitcoin Shift Unlikely To Disrupt Prices, Says CryptoQuant CEO In addition, the ongoing Modular Summit, with Celestia at the forefront, adds to the positive sentiment surrounding the project, as evidenced by a 40% increase in trading volume for the token over the past 24 hours, amounting to $206 million, according to CoinGecko data. DeFiSquared further explained that traders attempting to short the current upward movement, negative funding rates on perpetual trading, and indicators suggesting a potential market bottom contribute to optimism.
