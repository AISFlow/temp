42381552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nE9B,1550099713,Blockchain Analysis Ties 5 Bitcoin Addresses to QuadrigaCX Exchange,"Blockchain watchers have identified a group of bitcoin addresses that likely belong to one of the so-called cold wallets of failed crypto exchange QuadrigaCX.  The discovery is notable in light of QuadrigaCX's claim that it has been unable to access these wallets – which held the lion's share of the $190 million owed to customers – since the death in December of CEO Gerald Cotten. In court filings, the company has said Cotten had the sole responsibility of moving funds from the exchange's ""hot,"" or active, wallet to offline ""cold"" storage.  But Quadriga did not share its cold wallet addresses, driving many researchers to try to trace transactions to determine which wallets these were, as well as whether they truly contained the $136 million in cryptocurrencies, including about $92 million worth of bitcoin, said to be held offline. (Another $53 million of customers' fiat currency has been held up at payment processors.)  A clue came on Tuesday, from Ernst & Young (EY), QuadrigaCX's court-appointed monitor in the creditor protection case. In its first progress report to the Canadian court, EY revealed that on Feb. 6 Quadriga had mistakenly transferred 103 BTC (around $350,000) to the ""cold wallets which the Company is currently unable to access.""  Internet sleuths then found a group of addresses that had received multiple small transfers on that date totaling 104.335 bitcoin – nearly the same amount mentioned in the report. Prior to this, these addresses had not seen any transactions since April.  Reddit user Decoze published the addresses of these wallets on Wednesday:  1HyYMMCdCcHnfjwMW2jE4cv9qVkVDFUzVa — received 36.37786282 BTC,  1JPtxSGoekZfLQeYAWkbhBhkr2VEDADHZB — received 33.19556316 BTC,  1MhgmGaHwLAvvKVyFvy6zy9pRQFXaxwE9M — received 19.54328527 BTC,  1ECUQLuioJbFZAQchcZq9pggd4EwcpuANe — received 10.34268585 BTC,  1J9Fqc3TicNoy1Y7tgmhQznWrP5AVLXj9R — received 4.87560516 BTC.  Further supporting the connection, the first address once received a small amount of bitcoin from 3N8auHdN9rtmHDHqNnXK4eWhfukBAQcve1, the same address that was listed as QuadrigaCX's hot wallet by the exchange's owners in a court affidavit.  Plus, those five addresses had earlier been ""clustered"" together, or determined to belong to the same entity, by two blockchain analysis sites, Walletexplorer and OXT.  Laurent, a developer at OXT who would not disclose his last name, told CoinDesk he also believes the cluster to be related to QuadrigaCX based on patterns of transactions it sent and received.  Careful now  Stepping back, it's important to be careful when analyzing the bitcoin blockchain, or any other public ledger that relies on unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).  Unlike the account-based ethereum, in bitcoin, what can be considered a ""wallet"" is often not one address but a group of them. In the UTXO model, addresses designate not accounts but transaction outputs, i.e. the parts into which initial amounts of bitcoin are split during transactions.  ""These addresses are automatically clustered thanks to a script processing a conservative version of a method called the 'merged inputs heuristic',"" Laurent said in explaining how OXT draws connections between addresses. ""In its basic version, the 'merged inputs heuristic' states that all addresses associated to the inputs of a bitcoin transaction are controlled by [the] same entity and should be clustered.""  However, Laurent warned that bitcoin blockchain analysis, by its nature, cannot lead to exhaustive, unambiguous conclusions.  For example, he said, the Mt Gox exchange, which failed spectacularly in 2014, had a feature that confused the analytics platforms, ""leading to the appearance of a giant cluster merging wallets controlled by independent entities. As a result, some analytics platforms label all the addresses of this cluster as 'suspicious' because some transactions found in the cluster seem related to dark markets.""  The lesson, he said, is simple:  ""Despite what many people think, blockchain analysis is far to be 100% reliable.""  Older transactions  With those caveats in mind, there's one more interesting piece of information about the five addresses now believed to be QuadrigaCX's cold wallet.  In his Reddit post, Decoze noted that in December 2017 – a year before QuadrigaCX's unraveling – the first and second addresses in the group sent transactions to address No. 1PdBMFkicx1vTHs9P6whPGondSVcmndVha, which he determined belongs to another exchange, Bitfinex.  ""Experience (or google) with the BTC blockchain and popular exchanges shows this is the main collection address of Bitfinex's hot wallet,"" Decoze wrote. ""This means we can be very confident 1PdBMFkicx1vTHs9P6whPGondSVcmndVha was a deposit address generated by Bitfinex for a customer.""  Laurent told CoinDesk he, too, had identified transfers to Bitfinex from the cluster.  ""My main theory is that it might be a wallet controlled by QCX and used as a kind of 'pivot wallet' between QuadrigaCX hot wallet and several exchanges. Large financial flows (in/out) can be observed between this wallet and exchanges like Bitfinex,"" Laurent said.  This would be consistent with a pattern observed on the ethereum blockchain, where CoinDesk and independent researchers identified a significant flow of Quadriga's funds to Bitfinex and other exchanges as well.

The move comes just days after the proposal for the Reality Shares Blockforce Global Currency Strategy ETF was first submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to a note submitted to the SEC on Tuesday, the company withdrew its ETF proposal at the request of agency staffers.  A lawyer for Reality Shares confirmed the move when reached for comment by CoinDesk, stating:  ""I can confirm that we did withdraw it and it was withdrawn because the staff are still taking the position that it's not appropriate to file a registered 40 Act fund with cryptocurrency exposure at this time.""  The lawyer added that the Investment Company Act of 1940 – which the proposal was filed under – would have resulted in the proposal becoming automatically approved within 75 days, which is a specific aspect with which SEC staffers took issue.  An attorney familiar with U.S. securities regulations told CoinDesk that SEC Director of Investment Management, Dalia Blass, essentially forbade fund sponsors from registering crypto-related investment products under the 40 Act in a letter dated January 2018.  The letter further added that these fund sponsors should particularly not use rule 485(a), which Reality Shares' proposal did.  Indeed, the initial filing does indicate that the ETF would have gone live 75 days after the initial filing.  Unlike other bitcoin-specific ETFs filed by companies such as Bitwise and VanEck/SolidX, whose proposals would be examined by the Division of Corporation Finance, Reality Shares' filing falls under Investment Management (IM) due to the 40 Act filing.  ""IM reviews 485(a) filings and provides comments, but unlike filings for non-investment companies on Form S-1 ... a 485(a) filing goes effective without action from IM,"" the attorney explained.  This is because there is no ""'delaying amendment' that specifies that the filing will not go effective until approved,"" he added.  Blockforce Capital could not be reached for comment.  The ETF proposal would have invested in a portfolio of sovereign debt instruments, alongside bitcoin futures products from the CME and Cboe exchanges. Reality Shares also left the door open to investing in other bitcoin futures products after the ETF began trading.

Before joining the company in August, Powell held senior positions at such large corporates as Thomson Reuters and Warburg Pincus.  His responsibilities at DA were assumed by Shaul Kfir, the CTO of architecture and a member of the founding team, the source said. Powell did not answer requests for comment by press time.  Meanwhile, DA has hired Zohar Hod, a trading technology veteran, as its chief strategy officer. Hod reports to co-founder and chief operating officer Yuval Rooz.  In his newly created position, Hod will assess the competitive landscape and market demand for distributed ledger technology (DLT) to advise the company’s leadership about growth opportunities, according to a bio provided by the company. His hiring was reported earlier Tuesday by Global Custodian, a trade publication.  Hod spent eight years at Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, as global head of sales and support. He also spent three years at IBM as head of its trading solutions group. Just prior to joining DA, he was CEO of truePTS, a post-trade data firm.  New HQ  Hod is based in New York at the company’s new headquarters on the 47th floor of 4 World Trade Center in the financial district. DA recently moved offices from 96 Spring Street in Soho so its 70-plus New York-based employees could work together on the same floor.  Digital Asset has more than 175 employees working in six global locations – New York, London, Zurich, Budapest, Hong Kong and Sydney.  The firm is seen as something of a bellwether for industrial-grade DLT upgrade and integration thanks to its undertaking to replace the Australian Stock Exchange’s (ASX's) CHESS clearing and settlement system.  Although the deadline for that project has been pushed back to early 2021, ASX told CoinDesk in an interview last year that Masters’ departure would not impact its timeline.

42381547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nE49,1550080862,Status Launches a 'Tap-to-Pay' Crypto Hardware Wallet,"Status, the ethereum messaging app and mobile browser startup, has relaunched their cryptocurrency hardware wallet under a new name: the Keycard.  Developed entirely open-source, the wallet will first be distributed to interested blockchain developers for free and later sold directly from Status’ website at $29 apiece.  The hardware, as highlighted by Status project lead Guy-Louis Grau, is “the exact same shape as a Visa card you have in your wallet today.”  Speaking to CoinDesk, Grau added:  “[Keycard] is contactless. It’s going to work with your mobile crypto wallet. You’ll just need to tap your Keycard on a mobile device to sign transactions. Functionally speaking, it's really a hardware wallet but it works with mobile.”  According to the firm, the Status Keycard is compatible with several cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP, ether and all ethereum-based ERC20 tokens.  The first batch of Keycards is expected to arrive in the mail to interested parties by early March. but according to Grau. they won’t be user-facing initially.  “We’re not announcing a full end customer product with Keycard,” Grau said. “We’re releasing a tool actually. That’s the way it should be seen. At this stage, it’s a tool for third-party blockchain projects that want to secure their application with a cost effective hardware wallet.”  Adding that the integration of Keycard into Status software for end-users specifically will be released later this year, Grau also explained that Status, unlike most other cryptocurrency wallet manufacturers, wants to encourage people to build the card themselves.  And in order to reduce the barrier to entry for blockchain projects to do so, the Keycard API – which is the codebase integrating with hardware to perform a number of different applications such as storing private keys, signing transactions, tap-to-pay, and more – runs on common, standardized technology that has been around for over 15 years.  “Our software is open and runs on Java Card so if a third-party project wants to build its own Keycard, they would use our open-source software and they just need to have it run on the Java Card – which is available through hundreds of manufacturers since it’s such a common hardware,” highlighted Grau.  Indeed, emphasizing that the security of any cryptocurrency hardware wallet “is tightly linked with openness,” Grau added:  “Security should be able to be assessed by anyone. That’s why software and hardware needs to be open. That’s the first and most important thing. And then as much as possible, use widely used hardware platforms.”  Status’ Keycard is now available for developers to review on Github and can also be ordered for early delivery next month through the official website.

42381554,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nEED,1550073625,"Coinbase Wallet to Feature Private Key Backup on Google Drive, iCloud","Coinbase Wallet users will soon be able to back up their private keys on personal cloud storage platforms Google Drive and Apple's iCloud.  The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange announced the news in a blog post Tuesday, saying that, in case users misplace their private keys or lose devices, they can use the new feature to back up their 12-word recovery phrase to avoid losing access to funds held in the app.  With cloud storage backup, users will have to only remember a password to recover their funds, Coinbase said, as the private keys would already be safely stored. For added security, the firm still recommends storing the passphrase manually after activating the cloud backup service.  The backup feature is encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption and accessible only by the Coinbase Wallet mobile app, Coinbase said. It can only be decrypted using the password.  The exchange further said that neither it nor cloud service providers would be able to access to users’ passwords or funds at any time, as passwords would be in the sole possession of users.  Users wanting to use the feature will have to opt in when the Wallet app gets updated in the ""next few days."" Cloud backup can be enabled at any time from the Settings menu, by selecting ""Recovery Phrase"" and following the prompts, according to the post.  Coinbase said it's also planning to add support for other cloud platforms in the future, besides iCloud and Google Drive.  The news is getting a certain amount of pushback on social media, as people raise the risks of storing vital keys on the cloud.  One Twitter user said:  ""This is IMO good but remember 1) Cloud storage is compromised all the time, so the password matters 2) if you need to remember your password, where are you storing it? How secure is that location? How redundant?""  Others offered a more cynical take. Again on Twitter, a joke poll asking if people would save their private keys in the cloud using the feature had 100 percent saying ""no."" The poll was closed with two votes.  Last week, Coinbase announced bitcoin support for the Wallet app on iOS and Android.

The Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) will offer “real-time” information on the Nasdaq Global Index Data ServiceSM (GIDS), its consolidated data feed, Nasdaq said.  Specifically, the BLX and ELX indices will offer a “real-time spot or reference rate” for the price of 1 bitcoin (BTC) and 1 ethereum (ETH) respectively, quoted in USD, and “based on the most liquid ends of their markets.” The data will be refreshed at a frequency of thirty seconds.

Likewise, the ELX has been calculated back to 2014,” the exchange operator added.  Nasdaq has been very active in the crypto and blockchain space, including investors in industry startups.

42381541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nDxr,1550059235,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Is Forming a ‘Token Task Force’,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is boarding the tokenization train.  The 385-member standards body plans to form a “token task force” this year, executive director Ron Resnick told CoinDesk. The group will work on a specification for tokens that run on top of ethereum and private blockchains based on it, with business uses in mind.  Notably, the task force will do this not only for assets whose units are interchangeable with one another (such as shares in a corporation, or blockchain representations of fiat currency), but also for individual tokens with unique properties (with CryptoKitties being the most famous example, although a more plausible business application would be digital certificates for diamonds).  “We are creating a token task force; we will do that first half of this year,” Resnick said. “It's going to be focused on support for fungible ERC-20 and non-fungible, ERC-721 tokens.”  Tokenization generally refers to the creation of tradable assets on a blockchain, separate from its native currency (ether in the case of ethereum). Crafting a business-grade spec for this process could ease corporate adoption of the technology, whose main use case to date has been fundraising by startups, often in a legally dubious manner.  “We want to create a token specification standard for enterprise tokenization so basically [assets] can be managed in a much better way with more assurance than what's happening today,” Resnick said.  Public meets private  The EEA, which aims to harmonize deployments of ethereum among the business community, has long held cross-pollination between public and private versions of ethereum as a desired end-goal.  But the planned task force marks its first direct technical approach addressing the token phenomenon which swept crypto-land in recent years – first in the uninhibited initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, and more recently with a wave of regulated security token offerings (STOs) and platforms.  “Since the explosion of ICOs there has been an incredible technology development in the open source community around token standards. Whether it's ERC-20, ERC-223, ERC-721 and beyond – there are quite a lot of them,” said John Whelan, the blockchain lab director at global banking giant Santander, and head of the EEA board.  Framing the task force’s job as similar to the work done by industry bodies like the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) around standardization of communication, or the FIX protocol for foreign exchange, Whelan told CoinDesk:  “We can imagine a time where similar kinds of standards are needed in the world of tokens. And that would be a guiding driver behind these kinds of initiatives.”  Resnick said the new initiative was under wraps at the moment but added that the project will not only assist in enterprise tokenization but also “build better confidence in the public world,” following “the speculative craziness of what happened in crypto.”  Further down the line, Resnick said that once EEA specs and standards are firmed up, the industry group will work on helping ethereum and its private variants communicate with other blockchain ledgers, concluding:  “We should look at interoperability with other tokens, whether it's bitcoin, Ripple, etc.”  Ether image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/13/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-is-forming-a-token-task-force,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8290328841c27a89a34dffe5856842c4e76f0e14-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nE2t,1550056252,Crypto Funds Say 'Generalized Mining' Is the New Way to Invest,"Crypto investors are pushing each other to actively participate in the networks they fund.  A segment of the blockchain world has been buzzing since at least last fall about ""generalized mining,"" an idea that the decentralized web invites users to contribute resources to running different services – all while earning rewards for doing so. Extended to the investment community, that means directly engaging the networks you invest in.  The latest funds to make the case for direct involvement are CoinFund and Placeholder, with a new partnership revealed first to CoinDesk. The partnership comes in tandem with the launch of the Grassfed Network, an initiative meant to showcase CoinFund's commitment to helping its portfolio projects achieve network effects.  ""CoinFund and Placeholder have both spoken previously on the use of generalized mining as a differentiated strategy for cryptofunds to directly engage networks and generate returns,"" CoinFund wrote in a Medium post announcing the initiative. ""These services include, but are not limited to, transaction processing, staking, software or Merkle Mining, content curation, market making, active governance, and many others.""  Investors began articulating this perspective over social media, and many of those conversations point back to a Twitter thread that CoinFund founder Jake Brukhman shared in October, in which he concluded:  ""Not only does #GeneralizedMining enable investors to add measurable concrete value to their portfolio networks through bootstrapping, liquidity provision, and operational loss-leading; cryptoinvestors are also the best-positioned profile for this type of early network engagement.""  New protocols need users, and Grassfed is meant to dramatize that dynamic. CoinFund is already providing support to live networks such as Livepeer, Steemit, Compound and others.  Anti-fragile engagement  Placeholder has consistently been interested in protocols that allow different kinds of stakeholders to participate in different ways. From its backing of Aragon, MakerDAO and Decred, the fund has consistently invested in optimizing cooperation.  Placeholder has been bullish on Decred. As we previously reported, the protocol was conceived to improve bitcoin governance by sharing authority over the network across stakeholders. Decred holders stake tokens to win a chance to participate in governance, and Placeholder will delegate their tickets to Grassfed's voting service, marking an ongoing collaboration across the two funds.  Putting voting into the same category as hashpower stretches what some longtime crypto watchers think of as ""mining,"" but CoinFund actually takes the notion even further: including putting crypto into on-chain loan-making services, starting with Compound.  ""We see any activity that is compensated with on-protocol rewards denominated in network assets as 'generalized mining,'"" Devin Walsh, an analyst at CoinFund, told CoinDesk in an email.  Trending strategy  Brukhman hasn't been the only one to articulate the advantages of deep-pocketed investors putting resources into network health.  Multicoin Capital's  Tushar Jain wrote about some of the active network participation his fund has pursued, concluding:  ""Just as a traditional VC firm would set aside capital for follow-on rounds, we believe that crypto investors who typically invest in protocols will find it’s a best practice to also set aside capital for supporting the network.""  Meanwhile, another Brooklyn-based fund, Notation Capital, admitted that the deeper it gets into this kind of work, the harder it is to understand how to optimize it, writing:  ""We’re super excited to participate in these communities and learn from others, and to be frank, we still have more questions than answers. Should we be building more internally? Partnering? Outsourcing? It may be some combination of these strategies or something else entirely.""  Early entrants into the generalized mining space appear to be betting that a track record in aiding companies' bootstrapping will pay off – in investor-speak – asymmetrically.  ""As investors, we are looking to attract great teams seeking our network participation in their early stage projects,"" CoinFund's Walsh said. ""We want teams to come to us because they know they will get measurable value from this relationship while bootstrapping their networks in early stages.""

42381556,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nEGj,1550055612,Bitcoin Making Little Headway as Resistance Caps Price Gains,"View  Bitcoin is struggling to cross the 50-day moving average hurdle for the fifth straight day. The repeated failure at that key hurdle has neutralized the bullish outlook put forward by Friday's falling wedge breakout.  A convincing move above $3,630 (50-day MA) would revive the short-term bullish outlook and open the doors to $3,730 – the neckline of a potential inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the 4-hour chart. A violation there would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a rally to $4,130 (target as per the measured move method).  The bears could make a comeback if the 50-day MA hurdle remains intact for another 24 hours, pushing prices below $3,400.  Bitcoin's struggle to cross a key moving average lined up above $3,600 is a cause of concern for the bulls.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $3,575 on Bitstamp, having faced rejection at the widely followed 50-day moving average (MA) hurdle at $3,629 earlier today.  Notably, that average line has been capping upside since Friday, countering expectations of a quick move toward $4,000 built following the high-volume falling wedge breakout.  The sideways action below the 50-day MA has also invalidated the bull flag pattern created on the 4-hour chart over the last three days.  So, the bullish case appears to have weakened and the probability of a drop to levels below $3,400 would rise if the 50-day MA hurdle remains intact for another 24 hours.  Daily chart  As seen above, the odds are stacked in favor of the bulls: the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, validating the falling wedge breakout. The 14-day RSI is reporting bullish conditions above 50.00.  Even so, BTC is struggling to find acceptance above the 50-day MA, currently at $3,629. As a result, the bears may feel tempted to hit the market with fresh offers, driving the prices down to the ascending 10-day MA at $3,521.  It is worth noting that the 50-day MA had worked as stiff resistance multiple times in the second half of the last month. As a result, a convincing move above that average is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.  4-hour chart  BTC is likely creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart. A break above the neckline resistance, currently at $3,730, would confirm a bullish breakout and could be followed by a move higher to $4,130 (target as per the measured move method).  So, while a break above the 50-day MA would revive the bullish outlook, only an acceptance above the neckline hurdle of $3,730 would put $4,000 back on the table.

Called the Global Open Network, the system will be capable of processing over a million transactions per second, MUFG claimed. The firms are also looking to integrate internet of things (IoT) and Akamai’s cloud computing platform into the network.  The new venture launches with capital of 250 million yen ($2.26 million), with MUFG having an 80 percent stake and Akamai the remaining 20 percent.  The planned network was initially announced back in May. At the time, Akamai said that the network will provide a number of services, including current payment processing, pay-per-use, micropayments and ""other developing IoT-enabled payment transactions.”  Previously, MUFG has been exploring blockchain tech for several uses cases. Back in November, the firm participated in a pilot that put a syndicated loan for $150 million on the blockchain, along with Spanish banking giant BBVA and France’s BNP Paribas.  In December 2017, the group launched a blockchain proof-of-concept with tech firm NTT for improving cross-border trades.

Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) announced Tuesday that it has partnered with IBM “to improve trust, transparency, patient safety and patient empowerment in clinical trials” using the tech giant's blockchain platform.  The firm said the trial aims to address quality issues with clinical trial processes and records, which are currently “often erroneous or incomplete” and could potentially put patient safety at risk.  The project will test how blockchain can help provide a decentralized framework that preserves the integrity of data, provides ""provenance and transparency,"" and enables the automation of processes, ultimately boosting patient safety and reducing costs.  “The clinical trial ecosystem is highly complex as it involves different stakeholders, resulting in limited trust, transparency and process inefficiencies without true patient empowerment,” said Dr. Uli Brödl, vice president for medical and regulatory affairs at Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada).  IBM Canada’s general manager for services, Claude Guay, said:  “We’ve been using blockchain in other industries, and we are now investigating how we can use this technology to give Canadian patients the same level of security and trust when it comes to their personal health information.”  Other major pharmaceutical firms have also been exploring the potential benefits of integrating blockchain tech. In January 2018, Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi were eyeing blockchain as a way of streamlining the process of developing and testing new drugs.  Last June, Merck was seeking a patent for a way to use blockchain in order to track goods as they move through the supply chain and tackle the issue of counterfeit meds.

42422910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qz7h,1550042125,GMO Internet’s Crypto Business Reports $12 Million Loss in 2018,"Japanese IT giant GMO Internet has reported an operating loss of 1.36 billion yen, or about $11.75 million, for its cryptocurrency business last year.  The firm published its financial results for the fiscal year 2018 on Tuesday, saying its overall crypto segment, including exchange and mining businesses, made $74.51 million in net sales for 2018.  While its exchange business achieved profits of almost $7 million over the period, the profitability of GMO's mining unit continued to decline throughout the year and recorded $18.3 million in total losses. The fourth quarter saw the largest loss in the crypto mining segment, accounting for 60 percent of the year's drop in mining returns.  Further, GMO indicated that the loss for the year did not include an “extraordinary loss” of 35.3 billion yen (or $319.23 million) in its cryptocurrency mining business, as forecast by the firm in December.  At the time, GMO said it would record an extraordinary loss, consisting of impairment loss and losses from transfers of receivables, as it quit making and selling crypto miners following a year of bearish market conditions.  On Tuesday, GMO also announced a change in policy for its crypto mining business, including relocation to a new mining center. The firm said this was because its mining share did not increase as expected due to the rise of the hashrate, the decline in bitcoin price last year and the purchase of “expensive mining machines from other manufacturers, which led to decreased profitability.”  As such, the company now plans to move to a new, undisclosed region by end of this year, which will be able to provide a less expensive power supply.  “The electricity cost in the new location, which is confidential, is less than half of that in Northern Europe, which is 7-8 cents per kWh including running costs. We believe the relocation will impact our earnings this summer,” GMO said.  Regarding its plans for a yen-pegged stablecoin called GMO Japanese Yen or GYEN, the firm said work is on track and plans a launch later this year in overseas markets.  The firm initially announced the planned stablecoin issuance back in October, in preparation for a move into the blockchain remittance and settlement business.
