21393739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563472,1702598351,How To Accept Crypto Payments And Who Accepts Bitcoins?,"Accepting crypto payments may sound daunting, but with the right tools and knowledge, it’s a game-changer for businesses. This article simplifies the process, from understanding the basics of crypto payments to seamlessly integrating them into your business operations. We’ll explore how to accept crypto payments, the most effective cryptocurrencies for transactions, highlight businesses leading the charge which accept Bitcoins as payments, and unveil the advantages of adopting this futuristic payment method. Crypto Payments For Businesses Explained For businesses, adopting crypto payments is not just a nod to modernity; it’s a strategic move towards cost-efficiency and broader market access. One of the most significant advantages of crypto payments is the substantial savings on fees typically imposed by centralized point-of-sale (POS) service providers and credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, which means transactions do not require intermediaries. This absence of middlemen significantly reduces transaction costs, a benefit that can be particularly impactful for businesses with high sales volumes or those dealing with international transactions, where traditional fees can accumulate quickly. Moreover, crypto payments provide an alternative to the delay often associated with bank processing times. Transactions can be completed at a much faster rate, enhancing the cash flow for businesses. This speed, coupled with the reduced cost, presents a compelling case for businesses to integrate crypto payment options. Another crucial aspect is the security and fraud prevention inherent in blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies. The encrypted and immutable nature of blockchain transactions adds a layer of security that is challenging to achieve with traditional payment methods. By accepting crypto payments, businesses not only align themselves with a tech-savvy consumer base but also leverage a global payment system devoid of geographical boundaries and currency conversion issues. This global reach can be particularly beneficial for online businesses looking to expand their market. Providers Of Crypto Payment Systems Crypto payment gateways are essential for businesses looking to accept cryptocurrency transactions. These platforms provide the necessary infrastructure, such as point-of-sale (POS) systems and shopping cart integrations, for seamless crypto transactions. They also offer additional conveniences like protecting merchants from the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies and facilitating currency conversions and invoicing​. Each of these gateways has its unique strengths, catering to different business needs and preferences. Choosing the right provider depends on factors like the range of cryptocurrencies you wish to accept, the ease of integration with your existing systems, the level of exposure to crypto volatility you’re comfortable with, and the specific features you need to streamline your crypto transactions. Coinbase Commerce Known for its easy integration with major US cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase Commerce offers a flexible solution for businesses. It provides custom checkouts, a connection to the Coinbase crypto exchange, crypto wallets, invoicing, refunding, reporting tools, and an API for developers. Importantly, it offers volatility shielding under its managed plan. Coinbase Commerce supports a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others, with a transaction fee of 1%​​. BitPay One of the early entrants in the crypto payments sector, BitPay is known for its robust infrastructure and integration capabilities. It provides volatility protection, invoicing, mass payouts, and the option for a prepaid Mastercard. BitPay supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. It charges a transaction fee of 1% + $0.25, which may be higher for certain high-risk industries​​. CoinGate Particularly suitable for companies outside the US, CoinGate supports an impressive array of over 70 cryptocurrencies. It integrates well with various eCommerce platforms and offers features like crypto conversions, invoicing, and a developer sandbox. CoinGate’s transaction fee is 1%, with additional charges for settlements in fiat currencies like the Euro​​. NOWPayments This gateway stands out for its low transaction fees, starting at 0.5%, and supporting a wide range of over 70 cryptocurrencies. NOWPayments is ideal for businesses looking for straightforward solutions without custodial features. It offers services like cryptocurrency conversions, fiat settlement options, invoicing, mass payouts, and POS software. The platform’s pricing model is attractive, although additional costs for services like fiat settlement and volatility shielding can add up​​. AlfaCoins AlfaCoins distinguishes itself with flexible payment options and competitive fees. It supports a more limited range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The transaction fee is slightly lower than its competitors at 0.99%, and it offers unique features like the CoinSplit option, which allows for partial payments in different currencies. AlfaCoins is particularly advantageous for non-profit organizations, offering lower fees for donations and even zero-fee plans​​. Strike Strike stands out as a unique player in the realm of crypto payments, primarily leveraging the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a layer 2 payment protocol layered on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to facilitate faster and more cost-effective transactions. This is particularly beneficial for handling microtransactions, which are impractical with traditional Bitcoin payments due to higher fees and longer processing times. Setting Up Crypto Payment Systems Integrating a crypto payment system into your business involves several key steps to ensure a smooth and secure transaction process. Here’s a guide to getting started: Choose A Crypto Payment Gateway: Select a provider that aligns with your business needs. Popular options include Coinbase Commerce, BitPay, CoinGate, NOWPayments, AlfaCoins, and Strike via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Create A Merchant Account: Once you’ve chosen a provider, you’ll need to create a merchant account on their platform. This typically involves providing business details, setting up security measures, and linking bank accounts for fiat settlements if needed. Integration With Your Business Platform: Integrate the crypto payment gateway with your existing business infrastructure. This could be through plugins or APIs. Set Up A Digital Wallet: To receive and store cryptocurrency payments, you’ll need a digital wallet. Some gateways offer their own wallets, while others may require you to set up an external wallet. Configure Payment Options: Configure your payment gateway settings according to your preferences. Implement Security Measures: Ensure that robust security measures are in place to protect against fraud and hacking. Educate Your Team: Educate your staff about how crypto payments work, how to process them, and how to troubleshoot common issues. Testing: Before going live, thoroughly test the crypto payment system to ensure that it works seamlessly. Launch And Marketing: Once testing is complete, launch the crypto payment system. Use marketing strategies to inform your customers, highlighting the benefits. Best Crypto For Payments Selecting the best cryptocurrency for business transactions is crucial for ensuring efficiency, security, and customer satisfaction. Here are some of the best cryptos for payments: Bitcoin (BTC): As the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is widely accepted. However, its transaction times and fees can be higher compared to other cryptocurrencies, when not choosing a Lightning Network based solution. Ethereum (ETH): Known for its flexibility and the support of smart contracts, Ethereum is a popular choice for businesses. It’s particularly suitable for businesses involved in digital services and products. However, fees can be quite high on the base layer as well. Litecoin (LTC): Often considered as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI): Pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, stablecoins offer the benefits of cryptocurrency without the volatility. This makes them ideal for businesses concerned about the fluctuating value of other cryptocurrencies. XRP: Known for its low cost and fast transaction times, XRP is becoming a preferred choice for international transactions and businesses with a global customer base. Dogecoin (DOGE): Initially started as a joke, Dogecoin has gained popularity and is now used by some businesses, especially in the retail and entertainment sectors. When selecting the best cryptocurrency for payments, consider factors like transaction speed, fees, market acceptance. It’s also important to decide if you want to keep Bitcoin or crypto on your company’s balance sheet. Then, Bitcoin is probably the less riskiest bet as “digital gold.” Who Accepts Bitcoins As Payment?

This is particularly beneficial for microtransactions, which can be impractical on the main Bitcoin network due to higher fees and longer processing times. Key features include: Speed: Transactions are almost instantaneous, drastically reducing waiting times. Reduced Fees: Much lower than traditional Bitcoin transactions, making it economical for small purchases. Scalability: Can handle a massive volume of transactions, which the main Bitcoin network might struggle with. Enhanced User Experience: Provides a smoother and more efficient transaction process, ideal for everyday purchases. Increased Adoption: Its efficiency makes Bitcoin more practical for mainstream use, encouraging wider adoption. Businesses using the Lightning Network can offer customers a quick and low-cost way to pay with Bitcoin, making it an attractive option for both small-scale and large transactions. This technology is particularly appealing for online businesses and retailers, where speed and efficiency are crucial. Advantages Of Crypto Transactions Crypto transactions, particularly at the point-of-sale (POS), present several advantages over traditional methods like Visa, Mastercard, or other payment service providers. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means lower transaction fees, as there are no intermediary institutions such as banks or credit card networks charging for their services. This can result in substantial savings for businesses, especially those with high transaction volumes. Moreover, crypto transactions often process faster than conventional methods, a significant advantage for both merchants and customers. They enhance security, leveraging blockchain technology’s inherent encryption and immutability, which minimizes fraud risks. Unlike traditional payment methods, cryptocurrencies are not bound by national borders or subject to the same regulatory constraints, offering a more seamless experience for international transactions. Additionally, accepting cryptocurrencies can enhance a business’s market appeal, especially to tech-savvy customers who prefer using digital currencies. By adopting crypto payments, businesses position themselves as forward-thinking and adaptable to emerging financial technologies. FAQs On Crypto Payments How To Accept Bitcoin As Payment?

And the memecoin BONK is almost certainly the reason why.  Arbitrage traders appear to be chasing a 30 million BONK token airdrop that's available to every owner of the Saga phone. At current prices that much BONK is worth nearly $700 for a phone that costs $599.  ""Saga sales have >10x'd in the past 48 hours, and are now on track to sell out before the new year,"" Solana co-founder Raj Gokal tweeted midday Thursday. The surge is so pronounced that Gokal's counterpart, Anatoly Yakovenko, tweeted they needed to raise the price.  The euphoria around BONK – Solana's dog-themed equivalent to Dogecoin – has led to a turnaround story for Saga, which just one week ago faced dimming prospects amid forgettable sales figures. Saga is a blockchain-enabled smartphone with special features for storing one's crypto securely on the phone's own hardware.  The Saga Discord server exploded on Thursday with newcomers declaring they just bought the phone and wanted to get the airdrop.  According to posts on the Discord server, the BONK airdrop is available to those who download the BONK app from Saga's crypto-forward custom app store.  ""When you physically have the phone you will be able to mint 'Genesis token' through the 'dApp store, [this token is eligible to claim the bonk drop,"" said a user who identified themselves as an employee of Solana Mobile in the Discord server.  ""The bonk drop is NOT forever, at some point that promotion will end,"" the user, whose screen name was Jax, said in the Discord.

21391785,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565407,1702594847,Terra Classic Validator Presents ‘Legally Absolved Route’ To Burn 800 Million USTC,"Back in August 2023, the Terra Classic community passed a proposal that would see 800 million USTC incinerated. This move came about as the community worked to help the token recover and be re-pegged back to the US dollar. Naturally, the proposal passed and the community prepared for the massive burn. That is until the plan hit a snag. Terra Classic Validators Worried About Code Changes The 800 million USTC mentioned in the proposal to be burned are the tokens held in the community treasury and managed by Risk Harbor. After the proposal was passed, the community turned toward carrying out the burn, until validators raised an issue with the plan. Related Reading: Avalanche Open Interest Just Smashed A New ATH, Can AVAX Reclaim $100? According to Risk Harbor, they no longer had the keys to the wallet which happens to be a multi-sig wallet. So by default, these USTC coins are no longer accessible. But to burn the token, validators would be required to update the codes on their nodes and the legalities around this move have been questioned. As a result of this, validators have begun to vote no to carrying out the burn, citing these legal issues. This is derailing the massive burn which is expected to reduce the token supply by around 8% in a single go. In response to this, a Terra Classic validator known as Lunanauts has proposed what they say is a “legally absolved route” to completing the burn. Basically, Lunanauts has devised a way in which validators would not have to update the codes on their nodes and thus, avoid any legal issues. Token price still trading well below dollar peg | Source: USTC/USDT on Tradingview.com Legal Way To Burn 800 Million USTC In a proposal made on the Terra Classic community forum titled “Burn of 800m USTC Funds – legally absolved route,” Lunanauts suggests using a smart contract to actually burn the tokens. The objective of the proposal, Lunanauts explained, is to still carry out the burn but eliminate legal repercussions for validators. The process would involve creating a smart contract carrying a “sole MsgSend to transfer all holdings to Anxu.” Once this is done, the multis contract can then be transferred via governance to the code id create. So there is no need for any code changes by validators. As Lunanauts explains, “The proposed method achieves the same effect as (proposal 11913) without requiring validator installations.” Related Reading: Here’s How Much You Would Have If You Bought Bitcoin When Jim Cramer Said Sell Lunanauts’s ‘solution’ comes hot on the heels of Proposal 11832 which has taken another route to address validators’ legal concerns. The proposal wants to blacklist the multisig wallet holding the 800 million USTC instead, making it impossible to transfer tokens from that wallet. The two proposals are currently going head to head. As always, token holders are able to vote on the proposal they want to support. Once voting ends, whatever proposal passes will determine what happens to the 800 million USTC in the community wallet. Nevertheless, all of this is being done with the endgame of re-pegging USTC to the US dollar. The token is still trading about 96% below its peg with a 9.78 billion total supply.

42419020,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGBx,1702592389,Financial Regulators Reiterate Call for Legislation to Address Crypto Risks,"Congress still needs to pass legislation to address concerns the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has about crypto, a new report by the intragovernmental group said Thursday.  FSOC, a financial stability watchdog composed of the heads of most major U.S. financial regulators, published its annual report after one of the group's meetings, taking a look at the past year in climate, banking, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and other issues. As it has in years past, crypto received a section.  The council is recommending that Congress pass legislation defining and addressing crypto spot markets, as well as stablecoins. These are the same recommendations FSOC had at the end of 2022, the report noted.  ""The Council urges Congress to pass legislation that provides federal financial regulators with explicit rulemaking authority over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities. Congress should also pass legislation that would create a comprehensive prudential framework for stablecoin issuers that would also address the associated market integrity, investor and consumer protection, and payment risks.""  The House of Representatives has two bills addressing these issues sitting before it, after Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) secured enough support to move these two bills out of committee.  It's unclear whether these bills will make it to a Senate vote. While McHenry reportedly tried to get the bills into annual must-pass defense legislation, Congress ultimately did not include any crypto provisions in this year's National Defense Authorization Act.  But as it did last year, FSOC said regulators may need to act if there is no Confessional action.  ""The Council remains prepared to consider steps available to it to address risks related to stablecoins in the event comprehensive legislation is not enacted,"" the report said.  Vulnerability concerns  Thursday's report flagged vulnerabilities like price volatility, a huge amount of leverage within the industry, cybersecurity and other risks to investors and financial markets as some of the group's concerns around crypto.  The report mentioned this year's Curve Finance hack, which saw the protocol lose $50 million. Though Curve later regained 73% of those funds, the report said one of the major concerns was that the loans backed by CRV might fall apart with the loss of so much collateral.  ""The drop in CRV’s price reportedly put over $100 million worth of loans taken out by Curve Finance’s founder at risk of being liquidated on other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms,"" the report said. ""Given that DeFi protocols sell underlying collateral in the market if a user is unable to maintain their position, platforms holding CRV as collateral were at risk of experiencing significant losses if the loans liquidated and the price of CRV continually declined.""  The report also continued to mention concerns about investor protections and market integrity, saying some companies may be operating outside existing law.  Stablecoins, which have long been a concern for finance regulators in the U.S., received its own subsection in the report.  ""if a stablecoin were to scale significantly, a run on the stablecoin could lead to fire sales of the traditional assets backing the stablecoin like bank deposits, MMFs, Treasury securities, and commercial markets is also small relative to the crypto-asset market and the traditional financial system,"" the report said as one example.  Another section of the report focused on nonbank financial institutions, which are becoming increasingly active and must be monitored for potential risks, the report said.",NEUTRAL,CRV,BUSINESS | CRV | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/14/financial-regulators-reiterate-call-for-legislation-to-address-crypto-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59874f59e741954d9151071f58bfb8edba8357b7-4922x3281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419023,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGF3,1702589979,'Bitcoin NFT' Hysteria Comes to Sotheby's as Super-Mario-Style Mushroom Character Tops $200K,"The first-ever sale by Sotheby's of ""inscriptions"" created using the Bitcoin blockchain's Ordinals protocol – from a pixelated collection known as ""BitcoinShrooms"" – drew about $450,000, or five times the highest estimates, potentially revealing a mainstream fervor for the tradable digital images colloquially referred to as ""NFTs on Bitcoin.""  The auction, which concluded on Wednesday, consisted of three of the images, including a pixelated avocado that fetched more than $100,000 and a design that appears to be derived from a mushroom in the Super Mario franchise that sold for north of $240,000, according to Derek Parsons, a spokesman for the auction house. There were 148 total bids across the three lots, and more than two-thirds of all bidders were new to Sotheby's.  There are ""plans for more soon,"" Parsons wrote in an email.  The results recall the mania that swept digital-asset markets a couple years ago when digital artwork and non-fungible tokens or ""NFTs"" first started drawing eye-popping sums, and captured mainstream attention; one NFT by the artist Beeple drew $69 million at the auction house Christie's. Many of those collections, however, were built atop the Ethereum blockchain.  The Ordinals inscriptions, which debuted late last year featuring a new technology pioneered by Casey Rodarmor atop Bitcoin have witnessed bouts of popularity this year sufficient to cause congestion and elevated fees on the distributed network, launched in 2009 to be a peer-to-peer payments network.  There's a debate raging among Bitcoin users and developers over whether to filter out transactions in NFT-like ""inscriptions"" minted using the Ordinals project, since they're not a core financial use in keeping with many advocates' vision for the original blockchain.  So the idea that some of the images might be considered high art could tip the scales of the debate toward profit interests.  The three digital images come from the BitcoinShrooms collection of Ordinals inscriptions, by the pseudonymous artist Shroomtoshi, according to the Sotheby's website.  The digital avocado, known as ""BIP39 SEED,"" was initially tipped to draw $20,000 to $30,000, but it ended up selling for $101,600.  EDITOR'S NOTE: After publication of this story, this reporter received a direct message from the @BitcoinShrooms account on X (formerly Twitter) asserting that ""there is no affiliation to the Nintendo brand,"" requesting removal of ""any reference to Super Mario or Nintendo to avoid confusing your readers.""  ""This is Shroomtoshi,"" the sender wrote. ""The sole inspiration for this project was Bitcoin, and the reason behind the use of the mushroom is explained here: https://ord.io/35458816.""  The link leads to what appears to be an interview with the artist posted on Oct. 24, in which they explained that ""Mushrooms are neat and easy to customize, and allow you to express bitcoin concepts as complex and diverse as sighash_noinput and separation of money and state on something as small as a 32x32px canvas.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/14/bitcoin-nft-hysteria-comes-to-sothebys-as-super-mario-style-mushroom-character-tops-200k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb444c2ed94edd875583d9338648d755791051c4-1393x888.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This analyst claims ADA is poised to surge to $11 in the next extended bull cycle, an incredible 1700% gain from its current price level. Unlike many, the analyst didn’t just pull that prediction out of thin air. According to him, the prediction was solely based on ADA’s historical data and past actions. $11 Cardano is a very realistic figure for bull market high based on new data I just discovered. Video later explaining why. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 12, 2023 Prediction Based on Historical Price Analysis Cardano has had one of the best price gains among major altcoins this year. This price spike has brought in predictions from various analysts, with some predicting very bullish price points than others. According to a video shared by Gambardello, if history repeats itself, ADA could spike to a market cap of $400 billion by 2025. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Uncanny Similarities In The Bitcoin Charts Of 2020 And 2023 How did he come by this number? Well, data has shown that the price of Cardano (ADA) has always correlated with Ethereum’s (ETH) past actions. A weekly timeframe chart shared by the analyst in a video on social media platform X showed that the last bull run in 2021 which saw ADA reach its current all-time high of $3.10 was a mirror of ETH’s performance in 2017. During the bull run in 2021, ADA spiked to a total market cap of $93 billion, a 75% correlation with ETH’s $123 billion at the 2017 peak. It’s important to note that at this first stage, both Ethereum and Cardano weren’t well known for their DeFi capability. Now, it looks like ADA is getting ready to enter the 2021 Ethereum first DeFi bull cycle phase where it peaked at a market cap of $546 billion. Cardano’s blockchain has grown since the first stage, with the network now one of the fastest-growing in terms of DeFi and smart contracts. If this cycle is consistent with the previous one, a 75% performance of ETH’s market cap peak will put that of ADA at $409 billion by 2025. At this point, ADA could speculatively be at a 4% total crypto market dominance and peak over $11. ADA price at $0.65 | Source: ADAUSD On Tradingview.com Gambardello correctly predicted ADA’s all-time high of over $3 in June 2020, one year before the crypto reached this price point. The analyst also noted another scenario where the spike doesn’t mirror 75% of Ethereum’s DeFi cycle. According to him, a lesser market cap of $350 billion would put ADA at $10, way higher than its current all-time high.

42419018,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGAv,1702585303,Crypto-Friendly Does Not Mean Crypto-Easy,"A major theme of 2023 was Asia’s continued rise as a critically important region in the crypto world. This is largely thanks to well-known digital asset hubs like Singapore, as well as the re-emergence of Hong Kong and Japan. While these jurisdictions indeed welcome digital assets, the hype around them can be somewhat misleading. Places that are commonly referred to as “crypto-friendly” or “pro-crypto,” actually have some of the toughest rules in the world. Crypto-friendly does not mean crypto-easy.  Singapore's crypto regulation  Singapore got its pro-crypto reputation thanks to its early moves to regulate the industry and a consultative approach from its regulators. But while Singapore may be all in on asset tokenization, it’s actually not “crypto-friendly” at all. Singapore’s financial regulator basically said as much. Last year, Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, gave a talk called, ""Yes to Digital Asset Innovation, No to Cryptocurrency Speculation.” This year he went even further, saying that cryptocurrencies “have failed the test of digital money.” Menon argued that cryptocurrencies have not performed well as a medium of exchange or a store of value. He also pointed to sharp speculative swings and significant losses by crypto investors.  It’s not just talk, either. Last year MAS issued guidelines to discourage crypto trading by the general public, which included prohibiting crypto service providers from advertising in public areas. By contrast, Singapore regulators are extremely enthusiastic about the tokenization of funds such as foreign exchange and bonds.  Hong Kong's friendliness comes with conditions  There’s also been a lot of excitement about Hong Kong’s re-emergence as a crypto hub. In June, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) started accepting license applications for crypto exchanges. Hong Kong appears to be more outwardly friendly to crypto trading than Singapore. Hong Kong regulators, for example, pushed banks to take on more cryptocurrency exchanges as clients.  But again, this friendliness comes with a lot of conditions. Hong Kong still has only two licensed exchanges, with only spot trading and a limited list of tokens. Ninety-eight percent of an exchange’s assets must be held in cold wallets. Exchanges also must set up a legal entity for custody inside of Hong Kong. Operating an exchange in Hong Kong is neither simple nor cheap, as getting approved entails a team of lawyers, consultants and insurance providers. Getting a new license could cost anywhere between $12 and $20 million, CoinDesk reported.  Japan's regulatory approach  Then there’s Japan, whose ruling Liberal Democratic Party has been clear about its intention to make Japan a Web3 capital. “While many other countries are standing still and shrugging their shoulders in the face of the cold wind, Japan is positioned to play a unique role in the crypto industry,” read a 2022 proposal from Japan’s LDP project team. Japan is no stranger to cold winds. Following the Coincheck hack of early 2018, Japanese regulators were so tough on crypto that some feared the local industry was in crisis. But when FTX collapsed in November 2022, Japan’s regulatory approach led to a major win. Japan requires crypto exchanges to segregate exchange and customer assets, and this helped FTX Japan users actually get their money back.  Japan also is among the first major economies to see stablecoin regulations go into effect, but it sets a very high bar. Only banks, trust companies and fund transfer services are allowed to issue stablecoins in Japan. The trust structure is likely to be a common path, but this requires that 100% of the assets backing the stablecoin to be kept in a trust in Japan, and are only permitted to be invested in domestic bank accounts. Given Japan’s low interest rates, this could make it very challenging for yen-based stablecoins to be profitable. But in the end, Japan’s biggest obstacle to being a destination for crypto entrepreneurs may be high taxes.  Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan have something important in common. They might not be easy on crypto, but they are relatively clear. Exchanges have an idea of what they can and can not do. Regulators in all three jurisdictions have put in the time to craft comprehensive regulatory frameworks and have also demonstrated willingness to engage with the industry. In other words, you may not like the rules, but at least you know how to find them.  Lessons for the United States  This approach poses a stark contrast to the United States. Crypto advocates often criticize the U.S. government, and more specifically SEC Chair Gary Gensler, for being unfriendly toward crypto. The larger problem is not that regulations are too harsh, it’s that people are still arguing about what is a security and what is a commodity.  The result is that in the absence of a national crypto framework, people look for clarity in court decisions. The SEC has levied complaint after complaint. Many in the industry looked to the Ripple court decision in the hope that it would set a clarifying precedent. But not all companies have the time and capital to spend years battling the SEC in court. The crypto environment in the United States is decidedly unfriendly, but it’s not because the rules are too strict. It’s because no one agrees on what they are.  Global crypto regulations are clearly trending toward strictness, as we will see when Europe’s MICA takes effect next year. The extensive regulations for the 27 member states of the European Union, covering about 450 million people, are going to be anything but lax. And yes, it is possible to be too strict. That’s why it’s so important for regulators to be flexible and open to talking to the industry, so that they can make appropriate changes if overbearing rules are making it impossible for businesses to thrive.  It may be time to retire the term “crypto-friendly,” which gives the impression of ease. A more accurate term is crypto-clear. If and when the crypto market fully revives, that clarity will give places like Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan a distinct advantage.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/14/crypto-friendly-does-not-mean-crypto-easy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a43db3ff350d6330680a39579ab08b2cbf3bdb35-5501x3094.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Recently Made A Retest Of A Strong On-Chain Support Zone In terms of on-chain analysis, the potential of any particular price range to act as support or resistance lies in the total number of investors who bought their coins inside said price range. The reason behind that is the holders are more likely to react whenever the price retests their cost basis or acquisition price, which is obviously an important level to them since it can flip their profit-loss situation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Deja Vu: Capital Inflows Mirror Pre-2021 Bull Run Momentum A single holder showing such a reaction won’t cause any effects on the market, naturally, but if a large number of investors share their cost basis inside a tight range, the asset’s retest of the range could perhaps produce a sizeable reaction. Hence, the larger the concentration of investors inside a particular range, the higher the ability of said range to act as resistance/support. Analyst Ali shared this chart recently in an X post that showed how the various Ethereum price ranges looked like in terms of the amount of addresses who acquired their coins at them at the time of the post: The various on-chain support and resistance levels | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s apparent that the $1,934 to $2,160 range is the Ethereum range that hosts the cost basis of the most amount of addresses. At the time Ali had made the post, Ethereum was retesting this range. Now, since this range has such a high number of investors, a retest of it is probable to cause some reaction on the ETH price. But what kind of reaction would it be, support or resistance? What decides this is the direction the price is retesting from. If the retest is from above, that is, these investors had been in profit just before the retest, then the market could feel some support. This is because the holders might think this same price range could be profitable again in the future, so they might decide to participate in some accumulation at it. Related Reading: Santiment Points Out Trigger Behind 65% Cardano Rally Similarly, a retest from below could end up leading to resistance for Ethereum, as the investors might fear the asset dropping once more, so they could become more likely to sell. Therefore, this huge range holding the cost basis of 5.85 million addresses should have acted as support for Ethereum during its latest retest. And indeed, since the retest, the asset has successfully found a rebound, as it has shot up towards higher levels. As is visible in the chart, the ranges ahead up to the asset’s all-time high are all relatively thin with investors. This means that, thanks to the large support basis below, ETH shouldn’t have too much trouble traversing through these levels, at least in theory. ETH Price Since finding the rebound at the support range, Ethereum has climbed towards the $2,300 level.

42419027,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGH7,1702577956,TradFi Goes All-In on Fed Rate Cuts. What It Means for Bitcoin,"The so-called ""dots"" released Wednesday as part of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision showed central bankers expect 75 basis points in rate cuts in 2024. That's up substantially from just 25 basis points expected by policymakers three months ago.  Already in a sharp upswing since October on expectations of easier monetary policy, traditional markets soared further on the news, with all three major U.S. stock indexes climbing more than 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 37,000 for the first time ever. Stocks are higher again Thursday, though more modestly.  Read more: Federal Reserve Holds Policy Steady, but Indicates More Dovish 2024  The rally in the bond market has been even bigger, with the yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries now having plunged roughly 40 basis points since the news hit to 4.32%, its lowest level since May. With the current fed funds rate, or overnight borrowing rate, at 5.25% to 5.5%, two-year money at 4.32% shows a substantial belief that significant rate cuts are soon to come.  Indeed, the CME FedWatch tool now shows a 21% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut as soon as January and an 84% chance of one or more rate cuts by March.  Checking other rate-sensitive markets, the U.S. dollar index is lower by about 2% since Wednesday's Fed news and gold has rallied 2.5% – both of which further suggest TradFi is, for now, fully buying into the rate cut story.  The Fed's dovish signal also boosted the price of bitcoin [BTC], which this week has been trying to recover from Sunday evening's ""flash crash"" that saw prices tumble more than 5% in the space of a few minutes. At $43,200 as of press time, bitcoin is now only lower by about 1% from its pre-crash price.  Are market participants getting ahead of themselves?  While the Fed's median forecast is for 75 basis points in rate cuts in 2024, markets have priced in nearly 150 basis points. Needless to say, for even the Fed's more modest expectation to materialize, it would require a substantial slowdown in the economy and/or inflation.  Claims of imminent recession have been popular this year, but the data continues to say otherwise. Third-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth was a whopping 5.2% – the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2021, when substantial government Covid stimulus was still sloshing through the economy.

This will undoubtedly be a welcome development for the XRP community that, as of late been bewildered by XRP’s price action. XRP Forming A Bullish Pattern On The Charts In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto researcher ABS of the 3T Warrior Academy highlighted the fact that XRP could be forming the largest bull flag in crypto history. This speculation was based on a monthly chart that he shared. From the chart, one could see that XRP was indeed forming a bull flag, which instantly signals a bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Analyst Sees Bitcoin Move To $69,000 As Cup And Handle Pattern Appears The crypto expert further went on to note how XRP has been trading below its all-time high (ATH) of $3.8 for “2,165 days & counting.” He alluded to the fact that this could have been a result of the label of “unregistered security,” which the SEC had put on it. However, Abs is bullish on XRP as he stated that there are “brighter days ahead” for the crypto token, considering that it has managed to get rid of the label and gained regulatory clarity. Another crypto analyst had also recently highlighted a similar pattern on the charts as he noted that the altcoin was forming a bull flag that could send its price to $25. Many in the community seem to share this analyst’s sentiment as regards the price prediction. Abs had put out a poll under his initial post asking his followers what they think would be XRP’s peak price target when the breakout occurs. The majority of those who voted were of the opinion that XRP will be greater than $22.35 when the anticipated breakout occurs.

Nina Rong, the head of ecosystem development at the Arbitrum Foundation, submitted a proposal to the Celo community on Tuesday, suggesting that Celo pick Arbitrum’s Orbit tech stack, which builds customizable layer 2 and layer 3 chains based on Arbitrum’s optimistic technology.  “The team at Arbitrum Foundation has been following the development of cLabs Proposal for Celo to transition to an Ethereum L2 closely and would like to welcome Celo back to the Ethereum community by proposing the Arbitrum Orbit tech stack as the path forward,” Rong writes.  Celo originally planned in July to build its layer 2 with Optimism's OP Stack, a similar stack also based on “optimistic” technology. But since then, Polygon and Matter Labs have both pitched their stacks, which are based on zero-knowledge technology, to the Celo community.  Celo has said it's aiming for mid-January to pick a stack to build its new chain on, giving time for community members to evaluate which is the best stack.  “The Arbitrum Foundation is aligned with Celo’s mission to build a financial system that creates the conditions for prosperity for everyone,” Rong wrote in the proposal.  Celo Labs, the primary developer behind the network, posted an update this week on its discussion-forum page saying that the team had ""begun work on technical evaluations.""  ""We’re focusing on learning first – understanding each stack and how it fits together, and familiarizing ourselves with the technology and its current state of production-readiness,"" the update reads.  The post included a preliminary assessment of the pros and cons of the various proposals – including the one from Arbitrum, ""hot off the press,"" as the team put it.  A notable fact about Arbitrum is that it's the largest layer-2 based on the key metric of ""total value locked,"" or TVL, which represents deposits locked into decentralized-finance protocols on any given network. The figure currently stands at $8.4 billion for the Arbitrum One network, according to the website L2Beat, almost double No. 2 OP Mainnet's $4.6 billion.  ""Arbitrum has the largest TVL of any L2, which is relevant insofar as it speaks of the trust earned by Arbitrum in the market,"" according to the post from the Celo Labs team.

According to Coingecko, the token is up nearly 8% in the weekly, with the biggest bump happening in the bi-weekly timeframe at 23%. Shibarium’s recent achievement isn’t the only thing positive on SHIB this week. With the broader market seemingly ending the year on the green, Shiba Inu aims to follow suit.

Chart: TradingView.com According to the blog post, SHIB burns come in two phases: manual and automatic. As of writing, Shibarium is in the manual phase with an estimated 3 massive manual burns coming this month. This would further decrease the supply available on the market, placing upward pressure on SHIB’s price. Related Reading: OKX DEX Loses Over $400,000 To Hackers – What Happens To Customer Funds?

If this trend continues, SHIB will continue to give gains to the bulls. Bulls Aim To Knock Another Zero Off SHIB is currently on its way to knock another zero off of its price as the bulls break through the $0.00000997 price level. If the bulls can stabilize the token at this price point, further gains can be speculated shortly. However, the over-reliance of SHIB’s price action on major coins like ETH and BTC might be a problem in the long term.

42419022,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGE1,1702572457,What We Know About the Massive Ledger Hack,"Multiple Ethereum-based applications including Zapper, SushiSwap, Phantom, Balancer and Revoke.cash were compromised early Thursday due to a Ledger security breach. Ledger, the Paris-based crypto hardware wallet manufacturer, said it has fixed the malicious code as of 13:35 UTC — the company also warned users to “Clear Sign” transactions, a way to ensure you are interacting directly with the company’s website and software.  It’s not yet known how many decentralized apps (dapps) were/are affected, or how much money has been lost. Anecdotal reports on social media suggest the exploit is widespread. Blockaid, a blockchain security firm, said upwards of $150,000 in crypto had been lost due to this unique “supply chain attack” on Ledger’s Connect Kit, which is deployed across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Do not interact with ANY dApps until further notice,” Sushi Chief Technology Officer Matthew Lilley wrote on X/Twitter, one of the first people to acknowledge the attack. “It appears that a commonly used Web3 connector has been compromised, which allows for injection of malicious code affecting numerous dApps.”  Hacks are a common occurrence in crypto, especially in the free-wheeling world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where financial software is frequently deployed without the appropriate level of auditing and testing as well as used by people without the knowledge to do proper due diligence. Centralized entities, aka companies, like Ledger, are also common targets for assaults.  These types of breaches are a stain on the industry, affecting not only actual people and projects but also crypto’s reputation. Internet pioneer and security expert Steve Gibson keeps up with the litany of crypto hacks on the popular podcast, “Security Now,” he co-hosts with fellow tech legend Leo Laporte, and recently said any industry where there is a running tally of the largest hacks should be treated with extreme skepticism.  Still, there is sometimes a silver lining to crypto exploits. These events, however blackening, can also be moments of levity, and a chance for seasoned crypto professionals to showcase their skills and the built-in benefits of blockchain. Most crypto transactions cannot be reversed, but attackers can end up in a dead-end trying to actually capitalize on their ill-gotten gains.

So, is it too soon to laugh about it? Just last week, CoinDesk listed Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier and several of the impacted DeFi protocols on its annual Most Influential list — perhaps we can laugh about the inauspicious timing.

42419026,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGI9,1702572300,Crypto for Advisors: ETH Staking in 2024,"The ability for investors to earn income on crypto assets is a big draw to the world of decentralized finance, aka DeFi. Michael Nadeua looks at ETH staking and what 2024 may hold in store.  Scott Sunshine tackles the topic of why learning about this asset class is challenging and ways to overcome that hurdle.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The ETH Stake Rate in 2024: What Advisors Need to Know  The ETH stake rate is the heartbeat of the Ethereum Network. As we head into 2024, the new standard is poised to catalyze a new era in yield-based financial products.  Background  The ETH stake rate = the yield that the nearly 900,000 validators (who approve transactions) receive for “staking” their ETH within the network. The yield is comprised of consensus rewards + user fees.  Consensus rewards = tokens issued by the network to incentivize a decentralized network of validators.  Transaction Fees = fees paid (in ETH) by users to access services within the network.  Below is a visualization of the fees vs consensus rewards (token incentives) over the last year.  As we can see, transaction fees (purple) have exceeded rewards for the better part of the year – the sign of a healthy network that can economically support its decentralized network of validators with user fees – rather than consensus rewards (as is the case for every other L1 network today).  If you were a “staker” (i.e. validator of network transactions), over the same period, below is what your yield looked like.  As we can see – the yield peaked at over 8% in May and bottomed around 3.5% in October over the last year.  We can also see that the peaks and troughs correspond with the highs and lows in transaction fees on the network — which is why we refer to the stake rate as “Ethereum’s heartbeat.”  The first peak in the spring of 2023 corresponded with the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. The second peak in May was due to a pike in DeFi trading. And the recent uptick is due to renewed interest in crypto as we (hopefully) head out of the bear market.  CESR  Coindesk recently released “CESR” – designed to provide participants in the Ethereum ecosystem with a standardized benchmark rate for staking and a settlement rate for derivatives contracts.  Standardizing the ETH stake rate calculation with “CESR” may seem inconsequential, but we think it could catalyze a benchmark rate for all of crypto — and spark a frenzy of new financial products built “on top” of the new standard.  Standards: Why CESR is Important  Interest rates are the backbone of finance. Interest rate standards such as LIBOR, SOFR, and the Fed Funds Rate are the foundation upon which trillions worth of financial products are built.  The creation of a standard benchmark rate for the Ethereum ecosystem could be the first step toward the formation of a forward yield curve for DeFi – similar to the role that treasuries play in the traditional markets.  Furthermore, the creation of interest rate swaps (the largest derivative markets in the world) could allow users to swap fixed and floating liabilities, making fixed-rate products possible – as we see with mortgages in traditional markets. Introducing interest rate swaps in DeFi would not only unlock fixed-rate products, but could open up a floodgate of new participants ranging from sophisticated speculators to institutions and retail investors.  Finally, with the potential for a Bitcoin ETF approval next year, it’s reasonable to foresee an ETH ETF in the future. Investors will likely demand a total return ETH ETF powered by standardized staking rates.  Looking Forward to 2024  The approval of a Bitcoin ETF next year could be the catalyst for renewed interest in crypto. In fact, we’re already seeing the green shoots of this. If you’re an advisor, you should expect your clients to start asking about Ethereum – the second-largest network by market cap – and the only crypto network with a positive real yield.  Eigen Layer & Re-Staking  We’re expecting “re-staking” to become a hot topic next year – thanks to the introduction of Eigen Layer, a new protocol within the Ethereum ecosystem that allows layer-2 networks (Ethereum scaling solutions) to “rent” economic security from the more decentralized and secure Ethereum network. This creates opportunities for investors to “re-stake” their ETH, earning additional yield – while taking on additional smart-contract risk.  We think “re-staking” could catalyze the next leverage cycle in crypto and play a significant role in the next bull market.  The future of finance is here. And it all starts with the ETH stake rate.  – Michael Nadeau, Founder, the DeFi Report  Ask an Expert  Q. Why are Advisors Reluctant to Dip Their Toes in the Crypto Pool?  Financial advisors’ reluctance to invest in crypto is similar to their historical hesitation towards recommending emerging non-correlated asset classes to their clients, including alternative investments like hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital.  In recent years, however, many advisors have incorporated these asset classes into portfolios as investors seek broader exposure, non-correlated investments, and a potential for higher returns. This shift reflects a recognition of these asset classes’ benefits and a willingness to explore more diverse investment options.  Over time, as the market matures and regulatory frameworks develop, attitudes toward crypto will likely evolve as a better understanding of risk, transparency, and potential returns emerges.  Q. How Can Advisors Better Familiarize Themselves with Cryptocurrency?  1. Education: Learn about blockchain technology, how crypto works, and the different types of cryptocurrencies available.  2. Stay Informed: Keep up with news and developments in the crypto space. Read reputable sources and stay informed about market trends.  3. Network: Connect with professionals involved in the crypto space. Networking can offer practical insights and the opportunity to learn from others’ experiences.  - Scott Sunshine, Managing Partner, Blue Dot Advisors LLC  Keep Reading  Asset tokenizaton takes a $4 billion step forward.

42409224,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEs7B,1702570479,"Ledger Exploit Drained $484K, Upended DeFi; Former Staffer Linked to Malicious Code","Hackers stole $484,000 on Thursday after inserting malicious code into the Github library for Connect Kit, a widely-used piece of blockchain software maintained by the crypto wallet firm Ledger. Several major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that use the library have been impacted, and users have been warned to avoid using decentralized apps (dApps) altogether until these protocols are updated.  Ledger's Connect Kit is a piece of code that allows DeFi protocols to connect to crypto hardware wallets. The exploit potentially impacts the front-end of all protocols that use the Connect Kit, which include the likes of Sushi, Lido, Metamask and Coinbase.  In an X post on Thursday addressing the incident, Ledger confirmed that an employee had been targeted in a ""phishing attack,"" after which point the attacker ""published a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit.""  Read more: Ledger Exploit Endangers DeFi; Sushi Says 'Do Not Interact With ANY dApps'  A ledger spokesperson told CoinDesk that it has ""identified and removed a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit,"" and the company said in its X post that ""the window where funds were drained was limited to a period of less than two hours.""  Although Ledger has updated its own code, Ido Ben-Natan, the CEO of blockchain security firm Blockaid told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that ""many websites are still affected and users are getting hit."" For the risk to be completely mitigated, every protocol using Ledger's Connect Kit has to manually update their version of the library. In the meantime, several protocols remain at risk, specifically revoke.cash, which is a service that is used to remove permissions from DeFi protocols.  ""Revoke.cash specifically is affected so don’t interact with it,"" Ben-Natan added. ""the number of impacted funds is hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past two hours.""  DeFi-related hacks have been frequent throughout this year, and $303 million was stolen in July alone following exploits to Curve Finance and Multichain. After hacks take place, users typically use websites like revoke.cash to remove permissions from impacted protocols.  In this case, however, as the front-end of websites has been impacted as opposed to hot wallets, revoke.cash users will be prompted to connect their wallets to a malicious token drainer, thus broadening the scope of the hack to anything in a user's wallet.  MetaMask announced that it had deployed a fix to remove the malicious code two hours after the hack occurred.  The nature of the exploit emphasizes the fragile nature of decentralized applications; as protocols use code from several software providers like Ledger, there are numerous points of failure along the supply chain that can ultimately impact users.  Ledger has previously fallen victim to security issues. In 2020 its entire customer database was leaked, leading to fears of sim swapping and home invasion attacks. It also faced controversy this past year after a software update revealed discrepancies between the security of its hardware versus how it was marketed to users.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/14/ledger-exploit-drained-484k-upended-defi-former-staffer-linked-to-malicious-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f23058fb993c002a69b124935324acbbc829763f-1265x712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21382424,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565414,1702569615,Bitcoin Deja Vu: Capital Inflows Mirror Pre-2021 Bull Run Momentum,"On-chain data shows the cryptocurrency capital inflows currently look similar to December 2020, right before Bitcoin rallied from $18,000 to $65,000. Bitcoin & Ethereum Are Getting $19.7 Billion In Capital Injections Currently As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, Bitcoin and Ethereum are receiving a large amount of capital inflows currently. To showcase these positive flows, the analyst has referred to the “BTC + ETH Net Position Change” indicator from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. What this metric does is that it keeps track of the 30-day change taking place in the combined realized cap of these top two cryptocurrencies. The “realized cap” here basically refers to the total amount of capital (in USD) that investors have used to purchase a given asset. As such, the metric’s net position change could provide hints about whether the total money invested into the coin in question has gone up or down during the past month. Related Reading: Santiment Points Out Trigger Behind 65% Cardano Rally Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past few years: The value of the metric appears to have been going up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin + Ethereum Net Position Change has been inside the positive territory recently and has only been climbing up. The trend naturally makes sense, as both of the assets have registered some sharp rises during the past month. Currently, the indicator has a value of $19.7 billion. As Ali has pointed out, “This is around the same capital inflow we saw back in December 2020 before BTC surged from $18,000 to $65,000!” In the same chart, data for two other metrics is also shown. The first is the “Stablecoin Net Position Change,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the monthly inflows and outflows for the major USD stablecoins in the sector. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, though, this metric doesn’t make use of the realized cap, but simply the supply of the stables. This is obviously due to the fact that these coins have mostly the same value at all points, so the realized cap wouldn’t be any different from the market cap (which itself is equivalent to the supply as the price is $1). From the chart, it’s visible that the stablecoins have also enjoyed positive inflows recently. This means that all three major asset classes in the sector, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stables, are receiving capital injections currently. Most of the capital inflows and outflows towards the cryptocurrency sector happen through these three. The altcoins only receive their capital through a rotation from these core assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sell Signal Goes Off: Analyst Predicts Targets Thus, the stablecoins and top two cryptocurrencies simultaneously enjoying positive inflows have historically been a very bullish combination for the sector as a whole. This constructive combination didn’t form for most of this year but finally has during this latest leg in the rally. The last indicator on the chart keeps track of the net incomings and outgoings from the sector as a whole by simply summing up the netflows for BTC + ETH and the stables. As is apparent, this metric also has a value similar to December 2020 at the moment. Looking at Bitcoin’s historical performance following December 2020, it could mean that the BTC price is set for another price surge going forward.

42409234,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEsaw,1702565218,The Ends of Aragon,"The young woman stares at you through a door. Her eyes narrow; her head lowers. Then a hand draws the door closed. Clearly, something sinister is afoot. It’s capitalism, a man’s reedy voice-over informs you.  After Aragon raised $25 million from its token launch in 2017, one of the first things they did with that money was commission a revolutionary-chic video with fat cigars, grainy samizdat, and a group of determined young people trekking Frodo-like towards a big blue blockchain door. It’s vaguely ridiculous, but also endearing. I feel wistful as I watch it. Here was Aragon in its youth. And now, it is on the verge of ending.  Joshua Tan leads research at Metagov, a governance research collective.  Two young hackers, Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo, started Aragon on the heels of the first DAO. Aragon was the first DAO platform: a tool to help people start their own DAOs. Riding a surge of enthusiasm for crypto, they crowdfunded a bunch of cash and produced some code. The code managed to get some stuff done, like secure Lido’s governance and thus effectively a third of all stake on Ethereum. But team turnover, governance paralysis, and operational missteps caused the product to fall behind the rest of the industry.  While the product foundered, funds from the token launch were managed by the Aragon Association, a Swiss nonprofit, and grew to over $200 million in value due to the rally in eth. During a planned governance transition from the Aragon Association to the Aragon DAO, some activist investors (or “governance raiders,” as some like to call them) bought up control of the DAO and started lobbying for the liquidation of the treasury controlled by the nonprofit. This attack — exacerbated by internal tensions in the nonprofit board — triggered some complex legal and financial maneuvers, resulting recently in the exit of about $75 million from the ecosystem as well as the effective liquidation of the nonprofit, the DAO and the token. For now, a diminished Aragon lives on in the form of a new nonprofit to be funded by a reserve of funds from the liquidation.  How did Aragon get here?  In one telling, Aragon is the story of how a group of kids learned the hard way that building a new world order isn’t quite as straightforward as writing a white paper or cutting a slick video. There’s a flourish of dramatic irony and a hint of Greek tragedy: a project advertising a revolution against capitalism brought low by unchecked capital, where the seeds of its downfall were planted in its crowning moment of success.  The depressing lesson for other builders: get rich, get out.  I don’t like this story. It’s easy and lazy — easy because it’s so typical of projects in crypto, and lazy because all cynicism is lazy.  A hint of Greek tragedy: a project advertising a revolution against capitalism brought low by unchecked capital  In another telling, Aragon is a high-tech corporate thriller featuring a shadowy web of venal anons, a stuttering battle over community opinion, and eye-popping sums of money gained and lost. Aragon’s story laid bare a hard truth: that DAOs are as susceptible to power plays as any traditional entity.  But it also highlighted ways in which governance actually works on-chain and ways it could work better.  Aragon, the DAO, was deployed, organized, and incentivized like a corporation, and many of the arguments for liquidation flowed out of the way we justify decisions about corporations and other for-profit concerns. Aragon was underperforming; its book value was worth more than its market cap, thus it should be liquidated. In this sense, the actions of the raiders were foreseeable and justifiable, just as well-functioning capital markets should have a place for activist investors.  I would love if this crisis could be an opportunity to re-examine the roles of such activist investors, just as the Curve Wars or the recent fallout between Aave and Llama have given us opportunities to re-evaluate the roles of professional delegates. Wall Street responded to the hostile takeovers of the 1980s with a raft of poison pills (mechanisms that discourage any one shareholder from obtaining too large an interest in a company) and other policies that concentrated power in executive teams and reduced the dynamism of capital in those markets. But those are not the only options to guard against “DAO raiders.” For example, we could introduce more disclosure and staking guardrails for large investors or install community-managed buyouts that create a decentralized version of “white knight” defenses where a preferred investor buys out the raider.  The lesson: much has been said about the limitations of coin voting, but if you do have coin voting, you should do it well. DAOs are not corporations, but the DAOs that are corporations should invest in good corporate governance. Decentralization cannot be an excuse for exploitation.  Two technologies  At its deepest level, Aragon is a tale of two technologies.  Aragon DAO had codified through its token a set of corporate incentives: token holders wanted to maximize returns, team members wanted to advance their careers, the underlying blockchain operators wanted their fees.  But the Aragon Association, a Swiss nonprofit, was organized around a mission, with a board legally and ethically responsible for fulfilling that mission. What did the nonprofit owe, legally and ethically, to the token holders in Aragon DAO? Asked less often: what did token holders in a particular smart contract owe to the mission of a Swiss legal entity? Did that smart contract have a mission, too?  Aragon’s governance could not resolve the underlying conflict between profit and mission, but its failure was not foretold. Modern corporations have both boards and “tokens.” Many such boards are charged with missions beyond making a profit, from Patagonia to Bosch to OpenAI, while the “tokens” help define the underlying incentives of the management team and backstop the ambitions of both the board and the team against the reality (and opportunities) of the market.  Governing these entities is not an easy task. Incentives can be built directly into code and into law, but mission statements, even when written into bylaws or the cap table, are only as strong as a board’s will or a team’s culture. Missions also change; often, they need to change.  The governance challenge is especially difficult over composite entities: a nonprofit that owns a for-profit corporation, a foundation that funds a development team, or a DAO sitting more or less uneasily within a legal wrapper. But it is doable; it has been done.  Back in 2017, Aragon’s token launch was carried out by an Estonian nonprofit. The money was then transferred to and managed by a Swiss nonprofit. Now, between $10 to 50 million will be transferred into a third nonprofit, pending the results of the liquidation.  This new Aragon, sans founders, sans token, will need to decide what to do and then to build an organization—a board, a team, and governance—that can do it. So what will it do?  Most obviously, Aragon could continue doing what it was already doing: fund a development team to keep building on top of the existing open-source Aragon stack — in which case the team will have to face some hard questions about the sustainability of the product and the size of the market.  It could turn into a foundation that invests in a broad range of DAOs and DAO projects, becoming to the DAO ecosystem what Uniswap Foundation is to Uniswap — but without the benefit of Uniswap’s product-market fit. Aragon could reorganize as a high-tech research lab for DAOs akin to DeepMind or OpenAI, rather than a product shop, with all the attendant spinout possibilities — as it was starting to do with its ZK team.  On the crazier end of options: it could use its treasury to leverage buyouts of DAOs and DAO tooling, becoming a kind of national bank for DAOs. Or, it could pull back from funding altogether and just focus on communicating values and fostering an open-source community, like the Linux Foundation, or what Bitcoin Foundation was trying to do for Bitcoin.  What Aragon cannot do is operate like a blank check for a small group of insiders. It has a mission. Fortunes and careers can be made and lost within the scope of that mission. Markets will rise and fall. DAOs may go on to own 50% of the world economy, with Aragon leading the way. Or DAOs might prove to be a gleam on the bubble of crypto. But the mission remains; it is why Aragon remains. The lesson is simple: if you’re a nonprofit, act like a nonprofit.  It’ll take a while for the new Aragon to figure things out. In the meantime, it should build a brain trust. Perform an act of goodwill. Nurture a dream.  Good luck. You’re going to make it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | UNI | RESEARCH,Joshua Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/14/the-ends-of-aragon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a14b24932ce2e619c89e14857357b8b32cc12e1-2874x1622.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This comes on the back of the belief that the bull run and some other factors could help uphold this trend. More ETH Goes Out Of Circulation According to data from Ultrasound Money, Ethereum has seen a decrease in its circulating supply in the last seven days, with over 14,160 ETH going out of circulation. This is a result of over 30,700 being burned during this period while only just over 16,500 ETH have been issued during this same timeframe. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bucks Bearish Trend: Large Holder Netflow Rises 1079% To 4.68 Trillion SHIB This development continues a growing trend where the number of tokens being burned outpaces the number of tokens being issued. NewsBTC had reported earlier this month how over 106,000 ETH had been burned in the last 30 days (between November 4 and December 4). At the same time, only just over 70,000 ETH had been issued. This deflationary trend has been attributed to the increasing number of validators exiting the Ethereum ecosystem. This trend is said to have begun at the start of October. Glassnode noted that the average number of validators exiting per day surged from 309 to 1018 validators per day at the start of October. This isn’t the only contributing factor, as network activity on Ethereum has picked up significantly. According to data from Etherscan, the daily number of transactions on the network has stood over a million in the last seven days. This has caused a spike in gas fees, causing more ETH to be burned with the EIP-1559 protocol. ETH price rises above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Ethereum Deflationary Trend Expected To Continue It is no coincidence that network activity on Ethereum has picked up as many continue to position themselves ahead of the imminent bull run, which is projected to kickstart in 2024. The recent surge in the trading volume of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum has also been a big factor. This is expected to continue once the bull market takes its full course. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Predicts That XRP Price Will Rise “Dramatically,” Here’s When Another factor to consider is the fact that more liquidity is expected to flow into the Ethereum ecosystem if the pending Ethereum Spot ETFs applications get approved. This would likely spark a further increase in the trading activity on the network as many will look to invest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. ETH investors will undoubtedly be delighted at the fact that the future trajectory of ETH looks bullish. One can expect the crypto token’s value to rise as it continues to maintain this deflationary status. The less ETH in circulation, the more valuable it likely will be. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,270, up by over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

21379739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565443,1702562425,"BREAKING: Sushi DeFi Security Breach: CTO Sounds Alarm, SUSHI Price Drops 4%","In a significant blow to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the Sushi DeFi protocol has fallen victim to its second exploit this year. The protocol’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Matthew Lilley, has issued a stark warning to users, advising them to refrain from using any decentralized applications (dApps) until further notice. Sushi And Zapper Frontends Compromised The latest breach has prompted concerns about the security and integrity of the Sushi DeFi protocol and other associated dApps. According to Lilley, a widely-used web3 connector has been compromised, allowing malicious code injection that affects numerous dApps. Specifically, dApps that use the LedgerHQ/connect-kit, a dApp that allows users to connect other dApps to their Ledger hardware wallets, are considered vulnerable. Notably, Lilley’s warning underscores the severity of the situation, emphasizing that this is not an isolated attack, but a large-scale assault targeting multiple dApps. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Applicants To Integrate Mandatory Cash Redemption Model Further investigation by security experts has revealed a potential supply chain attack on the ledger connect kit. The attacker allegedly successfully injected a wallet-draining payload into the popular Node Package Manager (NPM), impacting several prominent dApps, including Hey and others. Additionally, it has been discovered that the Zapper and Sushi frontends have been hijacked, exacerbating the scope of the breach. Slowmist, a module of Ledger, further confirmed that their system was hijacked and tampered with during the supply chain attack. This compromised the integrity of the ledgerhq/connect-kit library, which is relied upon by many dApps. As a result, users are urged to exercise caution when conducting any dApp-related operations and to scrutinize requests for wallet information that may appear unexpected. Malicious Connect Kit Neutralized? In an official statement, Ledger has confirmed the identification and removal of a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit. The company assures users that their Ledger devices and Ledger Live remain uncompromised. The company stated that a genuine version of the Connect Kit is currently being pushed to replace the malicious file. Ledger advises users to refrain from interacting with any dApps at the moment for their safety. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Uncanny Similarities In The Bitcoin Charts Of 2020 And 2023 The company pledges to provide updates as the situation develops, ensuring users stay informed about the ongoing efforts to address the security breach. SUSHI’s Uptrend Threatened By Exploit Fallout In light of recent events affecting the Sushi DeFi protocol, its native token, SUSHI, has experienced a decline of over 4% within the past hour, reaching a low of $1.590. Before the exploit, SUSHI had been exhibiting a notable uptrend structure on its 1-day chart, marked by higher highs and higher lows. However, with the loss of its crucial support level at $1.961, there is a potential invalidation of the previously established uptrend. The uncertainty surrounding the protocol’s native token raises the possibility of further downside in SUSHI’s price action. If a sustained downtrend continues, the next significant support level for SUSHI is located at $1.084.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  JPMorgan said it is cautious about cryptocurrency markets into 2024, but expects ether to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to an upgrade that will make the Ethereum blockchain more scalable. The SEC's decision on approving a spot BTC ETF is unlikely to spur major gains as there is a “high chance of buy-the-rumor/sell-the-fact effect,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote on Wednesday. Ether is likely to shine due to the EIP-4844 upgrade, or proto-danksharding. That's a development of sharding – splitting the network into shards to improve transaction speed – by way of Danksharding, which uses the shards to increase space for groups of data. Proto-danksharding involves adding a new transaction type to Ethereum: the “blob-carrying transaction.”  Cathie Wood’s investment firm, ARK Invest, offloaded a sizeable chunk of Coinbase as the shares of the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange rose to a 20-month high on Wednesday. ARK sold 283,104 shares worth $42.6 million based on Coinbase’s last close of $150.46. The firm has sold over $150 million worth of the shares since Dec. 5. On Wednesday, COIN rose more than 7.7% to top $150 for the first time since April 2022. Despite recent sales, the exchange still constitutes over 10% of ARK’s portfolio and retains the top spot on the investment firm’s list of top 10 holdings. The investment firm also sold some $1.63 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.  The value locked on Cardano’s ecosystem grew rapidly in the past few weeks as a recent boost in Ethereum alternatives is likely pushing crypto investors and users toward other blockchains in search of returns and capital allocation. The total value locked in all Cardano-based projects jumped to over $440 million earlier this week, crossing a previous peak of $330 million set in April. Cardano's ADA token has surged some 17% in the past 24 hours, extending its monthly gain to almost 80%. The total amount of capital locked or staked across all DeFi protocols reached $50 billion at the start of December for the first time in six months, led by Solana ecosystem protocols as optimism around the blockchain has picked up in recent weeks.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio of open or active bitcoin puts and calls across derivative exchanges, including Deribit.  The so-called put-call open interest ratio has increased from 0.40 to 0.52 in less than three weeks, signaling a growing bias for puts or options offering downside protection.  Broadly speaking, the ratio remains well below 1, indicating an overall bullish bias.

21378296,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565415,1702558857,Bitcoin Spot ETF Applicants To Integrate Mandatory Cash Redemption Model,"Recent reports have revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has implemented a “new regulatory standard” for all Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applicants while awaiting approval from the regulatory body. Cash Redemption Model For Bitcoin ETF Applicants Top Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the latest update by the regulatory watchdog. According to him, every Bitcoin Spot ETF applicant will have to bend their knees to this new model. The SEC’s latest “Cash Redemption Model” came amid the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers ironing their filings with the US regulator. It seems that the SEC is unwavering in its demand, rather than approve the different model that other issuers have suggested. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval: Why Price Could Be Set For 300% Surge The model enables authorized participants to deposit funds in the ETF equal to the net asset value of the creation units to be created. The underlying assets, which in this case is Bitcoin, are subsequently purchased by the fund using this money. Seyffart’s X post was accompanied by another post from financial lawyer Scott Johnsson, who initially shared the update. The financial lawyer shared a screenshot which revealed more details about the new model by the regulatory body. Johnsson asserted that Invesco is the most recent company to adopt the cash creation and redemption standard for its ETF. The trust anticipates that “creation and redemption transactions will be made in cash at first.” However, in the future, the Trust may permit/require creation and redemption transactions to be carried out with the “in-kind” model. This is the initial model that several ETF applicants have suggested. For the in-kind model, the participant deposits a collection of securities that are weighted and composed in accordance with the ETF’s portfolio. This will allow investors to receive creation units from the fund without having to sell the securities for cash instantly. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas has also confirmed Invesco’s adoption of the latest cash model. The analyst asserted that the firm is embracing the initiative as per its just updated S-1 filing. Blackrock’s In-Kind Redemption Model Blackrock recently adjusted its Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) application introducing an in-kind redemption model called “Prepay.” This is to tackle the restrictions that financial firms are facing in order to hold cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: $9 Trillion BlackRock Sees Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Delayed, What This Means The adjustment aims to make it easier for Wall Street Banks to participate in the fund. With this modification, authorized participants (APs) would be allowed to issue new fund shares using cash instead of just Bitcoin. The funds that the APs use for this procedure can subsequently be converted into Bitcoin through an intermediary and kept in storage by the ETF’s custody provider. As a result of this, it provides access to banks that are unable to store cryptocurrencies directly. So far, Blackrock believes the model will offer greater protection against market manipulation, which has since been the major reason behind the SEC’s rejection of an ETF.

Teylor’s credit portfolio tokens, whose structure was overseen by law firm Allen and Overy, can be admitted for secondary market trading on Taurus’ TDX marketplace, the companies said on Thursday.  The tokenization process involves a Luxembourg-based investment vehicle and is compliant with Swiss and European regulations, according to Taurus co-founder Lamine Brahimi. The tokenized debt product for the German SME market will receive “landmark” investment from some institutional investors in the next two weeks, Brahimi added in an interview.  “TDX market is Taurus’ other business besides custody, and we have done 20-plus transactions,” Brahimi said. “These include tokenized equity, debt, structural products and art. In terms of notional value, it’s over $1 billion so far.”  The tokenization of traditional finance has taken off globally, so it’s not surprising that crypto-friendly Switzerland is giving a range of asset classes an institutional-grade blockchain treatment.  Teylor, which offers loans between 100,000 euros ($109,000) up to 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million) to Germany’s vibrant Mittelstand economy, is backed by investors like U.K. bank Barclays (BARC). The fintech firm offered just shy of $25 million of loans last month, its CEO Patrick Stäuble said in an interview.  “We give loans to businesses that make usually between five and 50 million revenues, that are kind of maybe a little bit too big for a bank branch, and a little bit too small for a corporate finance department,” Stäuble said. “The loans we are going to tokenize will be for fantastic German businesses, everything from industrials, chemicals and precision machinery to import/export.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/14/deutsche-bank-backed-taurus-starts-tokenizing-german-sme-loans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17805d99f74e13874a8eacc780fac19be47f19d7-1000x617.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ledger, a maker of hardware wallets, provides Connect Kit software that decentralized finance protocols such as Lido, Metamask and Coinbase, along with Sushi, use to connect decentralized applications (dapps) to its products. By compromising the front end of a website or application, hackers can alter functions users see and con them into inadvertently sending cash to the exploiters rather than their own wallets.  “Do not interact with ANY dApps until further notice,” Sushi CTO Matthew Lilley wrote on X. “It appears that a commonly used web3 connector has been compromised, which allows for injection of malicious code affecting numerous dApps.”  Read more: Ledger Exploit Drained $484K, Upended DeFi; Former Staffer Linked to Malicious Code  The exploit reportedly prompts users to connect their wallets via a pop-up, which then triggers the token drainer. Issues have also been reported across other DeFi websites, including Zapper and RevokeCash.  Five hours after the hack, Ledger published a post-mortem on X. It confirmed that a former Ledger employee fell victim to a phishing attack, which allowed a hacker to insert malicious code into Ledger's Connect Kit. It adds that the code has now been removed and stablecoin issuer Tether has frozen the hacker's wallet.  ""We've identified a critical issue the ledger connector has been compromised, potentially allowing the injection of malicious code affecting various dApps,"" Sushi wrote in a statement. ""If you have the Sushi page open and see an unexpected 'Connect Wallet' pop-up, DO NOT interact or connect your wallet.""  One X user pointed out that Ledger’s library had been compromised and replaced with a token drainer.  Ledger said it had ""identified and removed a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit.""  ""A genuine version is being pushed to replace the malicious file now,"" Ledger said. ""Do not interact with any dApps for the moment. We will keep you informed as the situation evolves. Your Ledger device and Ledger Live were not compromised.""  UPDATE (Dec. 14, 13:23 UTC): Adds context throughout.  UPDATE (Dec. 14, 14:49 UTC): Adds statement from Ledger.

According to CoinGecko, the token is up 12% in the weekly timeframe, with the biggest jump in the monthly at 30%. Investment manager VanEck also speculates that Solana will join the ETF race, following recent news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, further bringing exposure to traditional investors. Related Reading: OKX DEX Loses Over $400,000 To Hackers – What Happens To Customer Funds? A Not-So Far Off Possibility VanEck recently released a list of 15 predictions for the crypto world for 2024. In summary, the post favors a bullish 2024 for crypto, especially in the realms of Web3 gaming and DeFi. According to the prediction, both Web3 and DeFi will start 2024 on a strong note; with Web3 gaming getting a breakout and DeFi finally reconciling with the Know-Your-Customer issues it’s known for. However, the most eye-catching of these is the speculation that SOL will be part of the spot ETF race in 2024. “Solana will become a top 3 blockchain by market cap, Total Value Locked (TVL), and active users,” said VanEck in the blog post. VanEck sees Solana as a top player within the DeFi space, eyeing even the possibility of SOL flipping Ethereum in the long run. This prediction is influenced by the fact that VanEck is running an exchange-traded note (similar to an ETF) with SOL being the underlying asset. This Solana ETN was released in 2021 in the heyday of the crypto boom. SOLUSD currently trading at $71.449 territory. Chart: TradingView.com If Solana does become part of the ETF race in 2024, it will bring in more institutional investors that willing to take some exposure from crypto investments. Short-Term Pain For Long-Term Gain The token sits at a high price point after following Bitcoin in its rally. This naturally brought SOL to a position that is slightly untenable in the short term. So far, investors and traders should be careful as the current price level might result in a slight dip in the next couple of days. Chart: TradingView Related Reading: Immutable Momentum: IMX Rockets To $2.21, Scaling Heights Unseen Since 2022 However, a dip in price shortly shouldn’t be feared. This will only bring SOL in a better position for higher gains. If the token settles on the $70 price level, we might see gains far beyond $80 to $90 in the coming days. For now, the year will end on a positive note as SOL is on the road towards $100.

Rulematch, which will offer bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] spot trading against the dollar for a select range of institutional participants, uses crypto custody tech from Switzerland’s bank-friendly Metaco as well as Nasdaq’s pre-trade risk checks, trade matching and market surveillance features.  In the wake of events like last year's collapse of crypto exchange FTX, institutional interest in crypto trading is being catered to directly by buttoned-up approaches that closely mimic traditional finance, with an onus on segregated functionality and solid compliance with market rules.  Rulematch aims to provide firms with the institutional feel they are accustomed to, including an anonymous central-limit-order book with 30 microseconds execution times as well as integrated post-trade settlement with multilateral clearing, according to a press release. Upfront liquidity is guaranteed by designated market makers like Flow Traders, and Germany’s Bankhaus Scheich Wertpapierspezialist.  “The crypto spot market is really dominated by players which do not really fulfill the very high requirements of a regulated participant,” CEO David Riegelnig said in an interview. “Primarily, the mix of functions that so-called crypto exchanges typically do, which makes them much more of a broker than actual exchange, was what triggered us to start rolling out Rulematch.”  Rulematch is backed by Netherlands-based Flow Traders, Consensys Mesh and FiveT Fintech, formerly known as Avaloq. Aside from BBVA, the platform is being used by Germany's DLT Finance. Most of the other participating institutions did not want to be named at this time, Riegelnig said.  “We have many more banks in the pipeline. but the onboarding takes quite a while,” Riegelnig said. “There's a lot of due diligence involved on both sides, and we only select from jurisdictions that are fulfilling the OECD and FATF requirements, so from places like the European Union, U.K. and Singapore.”  UPDATE (Dec. 18, 09:19 UTC): Clarifies that the relationship is with BBVA's Swiss unit in first paragraph.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/14/rulematch-a-swiss-crypto-exchange-for-banks-goes-live-with-spains-bbva,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfc6c337048641a38c65db04e5b1e79db202627a-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409220,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcErtx,1702548550,Global Banking Regulator Wants Tougher Criteria for Giving Stablecoins Preferential Risk Treatment,"The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision proposed tightening the criteria governing stablecoins.  The regulator wants to ensure that stablecoins' reserve assets have the short-term maturity, high credit quality and low volatility that allow them to meet holders' expectations for redemption.  The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) wants to impose stricter criteria for allowing stablecoins to be treated as less risky than unbacked cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC).  In a consultative document published Thursday, the global banking regulator proposed 11 standards for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose value is supposed to be pegged to a specific asset such as the dollar, euro or gold. To qualify for so-called Group 1b consideration, stablecoin reserve assets have to meet a range of criteria including having a short-term maturity, high credit quality and low volatility. The consultation runs until March 28.  ""The reserves assets that are used to cover redemptions can pose various risks that call into question the ability of the stablecoin issuer to meet holders’ expectations of redemption on demand,"" the paper said.  The standard-setter has so far taken a tough stance on crypto, recommending the maximum possible risk weight of 1,250% for free-floating digital assets like bitcoin, which means banks have to issue capital to match their exposure. Banks are also not allowed to allocate more than 2% of their core capital to these riskier assets. The BCBS will not be making any changes to these standards, it said in a statement.  However, cryptos with ""effective stabilization mechanisms"" – which covers stablecoins – qualify for ""preferential Group 1b regulatory treatment."" This means they are subject to ""capital requirements based on the risk weights of underlying exposures as set out in the existing Basel Framework,"" instead of the tougher requirements set for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Right now, stablecoins must be ""redeemable at all times"" to qualify for this preferential regulatory treatment. This ensures ""only stablecoins issued by supervised and regulated entities that have robust redemption rights and governance are eligible for inclusion,"" the BCBS has said.  Stablecoins that do not meet the Basel Committee's conditions qualify instead for the Group 2 category and are subject to ""a new highly conservative capital treatment,"" the committee said in the consultation document.  The Criteria  The committee said that to meet the Group 1b criteria, stablecoin reserves would need to be ""comprised largely of assets with short-term maturities.""  To reduce credit risk, the financial loss that can occur when borrowers are not able to repay their loan, the reserves ""should be invested in assets with high credit quality.""  They should also have low volatility: ""Assets whose prices remain relatively stable and are less prone to stressed market conditions are more likely to be liquidated rapidly with minimal adverse price effect to meet redemption requests,"" the report said.  The reserves also need to be protected from the bankruptcy of any party involved in a stablecoin's operations.  ""This means that other creditors of those parties as well as any creditors of the custodian must have no claims on the reserve assets, except where such parties are also stablecoin holders,"" the consultation said.  Organizations are also looking for ways to assess the quality of stablecoins - given their rise in popularity. Earlier this week global rating agency S&P Global launched its stability assessment for stablecoins - scoring them from 1 (strong) to 5 (weak). The assessment looked at how well a stablecoin could stick to the asset it is pegged to. One of the things the body assessed when measuring the stablecoins ability to stay tied to its peg was asset quality risks.  ""As we look to the future, we see stablecoins becoming further embedded into the fabric of financial markets, acting as an important bridge between digital and real-world assets,"" Lapo Guadagnuolo, senior analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said in a press release.

The two charts taken from 2020 and 2023 show a very similar price trend, and the most important part is what happens if Bitcoin continues to follow this trend. Bitcoin Charts From 2020 And 2023 Compared Pseudonymous crypto analyst Crypto El Presidente first shared his comparison of two Bitcoin charts back on December 1. In this initial post on X (formerly Twitter), the analyst revealed that the current market movements matched those that were seen in 2020. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Predicts That XRP Price Will Rise “Dramatically,” Here’s When To make this clearer, El Presidente puts the movements from both years into consideration when they are both unmorphed and morphed to scale. The similarities between both trends were eerily alike, with dips and recoveries at almost the same angles. Then in a follow-up post, the crypto analyst showed an even more glaring similarity with a new chart. These charts took the Bitcoin price movements from the last six months of the year and looked at how they moved. As shown in the chart, both started out trailing low but then surged as August moved into view. Then the dips would happen around September and trail the lows once more before recovering again. Then toward November, there was a recovery once more. While not exactly identical, these dips and recoveries, as well as subsequent ones, share an obvious likeness that could continue going forward. BTC bulls reclaim control of price | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com What Happens If This Trend Continues? If the historical performance of Bitcoin back in 2020 is repeating itself once more, then it is very bullish for the price. This is because 2020 is actually the year the last bull run began. From December 2020, going into the year 2021, the Bitcoin price would rise continuously to beat its previous all-time high set in 2018. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Rally To $0.0001? Shibarium Transaction Count Breaches 90 Million Milestone A repeat of this trend would mean the recent dip below $41,000 was only a short pit stop. Furthermore, such a recovery would see the price break above $45,000 once more, before correcting back downward again, as shown in the chart. The next leg-up after this dip, however, would be the main event as the chart shows a push toward $50,000. In such a case, the price of Bitcoin would be looking at an at least 20% increase by the time that 2024 rolls around. The significance of this similarity also doesn’t end at just the 20% increase given that the 2020 surge kickstarted another bull market. So a repeat of this would likely mean that BTC is headed into another bull run.

CoinList ""opened 89 accounts for customers, nearly all of whom had specified 'Russia' as their country of residence but all of whom provided addresses in Crimea upon account opening,"" the OFAC notice reads. ""Screening protocols failed to recognize that ‘Crimea’ or a city name in Crimea, provided in another data field, indicated likely residence in Crimea.""  Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, and most countries still see the region as part of Ukraine. The occupation led to the imposition of sanctions on Russia.

42409217,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEs0Z,1702544400,"Cronos, Partner of Crypto.com, to Start Layer 2 Network With Matter Labs","Cronos Labs, the developer behind the Cronos blockchain, announced Thursday the launch of a new layer-2 network, joining the growing ranks of second-tier projects that have opted to build auxiliary networks within the dominant Ethereum ecosystem.  The new ""Cronos zkEVM chain"" is launching initially as a test network, based on Matter Labs’ software tools, which can be used to spin up new layer 2 and layer 3 “hyperchains” atop Ethereum.  The testnet, powered by zkSync’s ZK Stack software kit developed primarily by Matter Labs, will add a new chain to Cronos’ existing ecosystem, currently consisting of the Cronos EVM blockchain, and Cronos PoS chain. The crypto exchange Crypto.com is a partner with Cronos Labs, according to its website, contributing to the source code of the PoS chain.  It is also the first public testnet making use of Matter Labs’ ZK Stack, according to a press release. Cronos zkEVM mainnet will follow, aiming for the network to be up in the second quarter of 2024.  ""Seeing a layer 1 like Cronos being the first to make the move to deploy as a hyperchain is a great testament to the ZK Stack architecture,” Omar Azhar, head of business development head of Matter Labs, told CoinDesk over Telegram. “Cronos and Crypto.com have shown they are able to build an impressive community – currently an addressable user base of more than 80 million crypto users.""  Cronos, while a fraction of the size of Ethereum, the dominant smart-contract blockchain, nevertheless maintains a respectable rank among the top-20 projects, in a universe of primary blockchain networks that Messari numbers close to 200.  According to DeFiLlama, Cronos boasts some $354 million of total value locked, or TVL – a commonly used metric, similar to deposits, that analysts use to rank blockchains' relative stature in decentralized finance. That's good for a No. 11 ranking in the industry, but still pales in comparison with Ethereum's $28.2 billion.  The latest blockchain addition to the Cronos ecosystem is part of a wider trend of projects launching layer-2s, which is made possible through the easily available software stacks, also sometimes referred to as blockchain development kits.  “The Cronos zkEVM testnet represents an opportunity for Cronos Labs and our partners, including VVS, Fulcrom and Veno, to experiment with ZK layer 2 technology in order to prepare the next phase of growth starting in 2024,” Ken Timsit, managing director of Cronos Labs, said in a press release seen by CoinDesk.

42409221,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEs3s,1702544393,JPMorgan Is Cautious About Crypto Markets Into 2024,"Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) said it is cautious about cryptocurrency markets into 2024, but expects ether [ETH] to outperform bitcoin [BTC] and other cryptocurrencies due to an upgrade that will make the Ethereum blockchain more scalable.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision on whether to approve spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) is unlikely to spur major gains, it said in a report on Wednesday.  There is a “high chance of buy-the-rumor/sell-the-fact effect once the SEC approves spot bitcoin ETFs early next year,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  “Excessive optimism by crypto investors arising from an impending approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has shifted bitcoin to the overbought levels seen during 2021,” JPMorgan said, adding that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is “largely priced in.”  Ether is likely to shine due to the EIP-4844 upgrade, or proto-danksharding. That's a development of sharding – splitting the network into shards to improve transaction speed – by way of Danksharding, which uses the shards to increase space for groups of data. Proto-danksharding involves adding a new transaction type to Ethereum: the “blob-carrying transaction.”  The bank notes that there has been some “reinvigoration” in venture capital (VC) funding in the fourth quarter of 2023, but it appears “rather tentative.”  While there has been some improvement in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, the “biggest disappointment continues to be the inability of DeFi to encroach into the traditional financial system, which is necessary for the crypto ecosystem to transition from crypto native to real world applications,” the report added.

This bullish outlook for Ethereum reflects a distinctive perspective within the institution, suggesting that the analysts see unique potential and favorable prospects for Ethereum relative to other digital assets, even amid an overall cautious sentiment towards the broader crypto landscape. In a published note on Wednesday, a team of analysts headed by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou conveyed their expectation that Ethereum (ETH) will reclaim its prominence and regain market share within the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the upcoming year. Ethereum Will Overtake Bitcoin – JPMorgan Source: Coingecko “We believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,” Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note. The analysts underscored the pivotal role of the EIP-4844 upgrade, popularly known as Protodanksharding, as the primary catalyst for Ethereum’s anticipated resurgence. Related Reading: Immutable Momentum: IMX Rockets To $2.21, Scaling Heights Unseen Since 2022 This crucial upgrade, scheduled for implementation in the first half of 2024, is poised to bring about substantial improvements in Ethereum’s network activity. Danksharding is a more efficient sharding method for Ethereum, and protodanksharding is the first step toward its complete implementation. Danksharding sidesteps the tedious procedure of dividing Ethereum into several shard chains, as contrast to the initially intended sharding method. ETH market cap currently at $273 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Data blobs, which are connected to blocks and can hold more data than blocks but are not permanently stored or accessible by the Ethereum virtual engine, are instead introduced. Meanwhile, JPMorgan’s optimistic forecast aligns with Standard Chartered’s, as they previously stated in a communication that Ether might experience a 400% surge within a few years, followed by a more sustained upward movement towards $35,000. Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research, expressed the viewpoint that the upward trajectory for Ether might unfold at a more gradual pace compared to Bitcoin. Related Reading: OKX DEX Loses Over $400,000 To Hackers – What Happens To Customer Funds? Ethereum Price Prediction: 5x Increase Despite this potentially more extended timeframe, Kendrick envisions Ethereum eventually attaining a higher price multiple than Bitcoin relative to their current levels. Specifically, he anticipates Ethereum reaching a price multiple of 5.0x, surpassing Bitcoin’s expected 3.5x multiple. Layer 2 networks, such as Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), would gain the most from the upgrade, according to the JPMorgan analysts. Ether seen rising to $2,426 this month. Source: Coincodex Layer 2 networks on Ethereum would benefit from the increased temporary data space, which would increase network throughput and decrease transaction fees. Data blobs improve Layer 2 network efficiency without changing the size of an Ethereum block. In the meantime, as ether discovers new applications, demand for it will rise, and cryptocurrency-related trends will only grow. For example, the most common Ethereum use case is NFT transactions, which Kendrick believes will grow. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $2,281, up 5.0% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin was exhanging hands at $42,910, with a 2.3% increase in the same timeframe.

The total value locked (TVL) of all Cardano-based projects jumped to over $440 million late earlier this week, crossing a previous peak of $330 million set in April. Most growth seemingly occurred over the past week, with lending protocol Indigo and on-chain exchange Minswap seeing their TVL surge by over 50% to nearly $100 million each.  Djed [DJED] stablecoin, a token pegged to the U.S. dollar, saw a supply increase of over 45% in the past week – indicative of capital inflows toward the token as investors looked to capitalize on yields.  Meanwhile, value locked on relatively smaller protocols LendFi and Spectrum Finance, has surged by 90%, suggesting users were starting to take riskier bets.  Such on-chain growth has boosted the price of Cardano’s ADA token, which is used to pay for network activity. The tokens surged some 17% in the past 24 hours, helping extend monthly gains to nearly 80%, data shows, and a 100% growth in leveraged futures bets on further ADA price volatility in the same period.

42409239,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEsrT,1702540136,"Bitcoin's Bull Run Has Plenty of Steam Left, These Indicators Suggest","Cognitive biases like anchoring may see investors anticipate a BTC price slide in the wake of this year’s 150% rally.  Indicators like Puell Multiple, MVRV Z-Score, and Mayer Multiple suggest bitcoin is far from being overvalued and could continue to rally in 2024.  Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has surged over 150% this year, beating traditional assets like the S&P 500, gold, and the U.S. dollar by a huge margin.  That may have some investors, particularly those who haven’t seen the previous crypto bull runs and are “anchored” to the brutal bear market of 2022, intuitively view the cryptocurrency as being overvalued and anticipate a price slide in the coming months. Anchoring is a cognitive bias that causes investors to rely overly on recent or initial data while making future judgments.  Traditional finance investors who want exposure to bitcoin could fall victim to the anchoring bias and intuitively wait for cheaper entry prices. That’s because, in conventional markets, assets rarely double in value in less than a year. Besides, investors, in general, are vulnerable to loss aversion, a cognitive behavior of booking out of winning trades early and holding on to loss-making bets for longer.  Believing in the aforementioned cognitive biases, however, could prove costly as three indicators – tracking activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, miner flows, and the 200-day moving average – suggest the cryptocurrency has plenty of upside left.  Let’s discuss these indicators in detail.  Puell Multiple  The Puell Multiple measures the U.S. dollar value of the daily bitcoin issued relative to the 365-day moving average of the dollar value of the issuance. The issuance here refers to the current supply, i.e., minted or new coins released to the network. Since the last halving in early 2020, miners have minted roughly 900 tokens per day.  Elevated readings indicate that the present profitability of miners is high compared to the yearly average, and hence, they could liquidate their holdings at a faster pace, adding to bearish pressures in the market. Low readings suggest otherwise.  In the past, readings above four have coincided with market peaks, with values reaching as high as 10 in early bull cycles. Meanwhile, multiples of less than 0.5 have hinted at market bottoms.  As of the time of writing, the Puell Multiple stood at 1.53, well short of the red zone above four, according to data tracked by Glassnode.  The indicator could slide back into the accumulation zone (below 0.5) early next year after bitcoin’s mining reward halving. The inbuilt code will cut the per-block issuance of bitcoin to 3.25 BTC from 6.5 BTC.  “Because the quantity of BTC issued in the subsidy literally gets cut in half, the only way for this metric to recoup so quickly is for the price of BTC to rapidly increase,” analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in the latest edition of the weekly newsletter.  “The next halving is estimated for March 2024. That’s not too far away at all,” analysts added.  MVRV Z-score  The Z-score of bitcoin's market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio shows how many standard deviations the assets' market capitalization differs from its realized or fair value.  The market capitalization is obtained by multiplying the total number of tokens in circulation by the going market price. The realized value is a variation of the market cap, which can be calculated by dividing the value of all bitcoins at the price they were last moved on-chain by the number of coins in circulation. The metric excludes coins lost from circulation and is said to reflect the fair value of the network.  At press time, the Z-score stood at 1.6, indicating that the cryptocurrency is far from being overvalued and may continue to rally next year, as anticipated by several analysts.  Historically, Z-scores above eight have signaled overvaluation and signaled bull market tops, while negative values have signaled discounted prices and bear market bottoms.  Mayer Multiple  The Mayer Multiple, developed by bitcoin investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, measures the difference between bitcoin's going market price and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).  The indicator helps identify overbought and oversold conditions by comparing the present market price with its 200-day moving average. The assumption is that the market will revert to its mean or the 200-day SMA after extended bullish/bearish trends push the multiple above 2.4/below 0.5.  As of the time of writing, the Mayer Multiple was 1.404, meaning bitcoin’s price at $42,937 was 1.4 times its 200-day SMA at $30,563.  In other words, bitcoin has plenty of room to rally before we can say it’s overbought relative to its 200-day SMA. The 200-day SMA is one of the most widely tracked gauges of long-term trends. As per technical analysis, an asset is said to be in a bull market once its value drops above the 200-day SMA and vice versa.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/14/bitcoins-bull-run-has-plenty-of-steam-left-these-indicators-suggest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd6d7f3dcc7690e7b3d8916310d6113caeba5c7a-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409238,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEsoA,1702535400,In Search of the Elusive Crypto Voter,"Election season continues unabated, with candidates willing to discuss crypto. There's an audience, but it's still unclear whether crypto is a voter issue.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Crypto candidates  The narrative  On Monday, a New Hampshire state representative asked a mostly-filled room at an industry campaign event to raise their hands if they were visiting from another state. More than half the people in the room raised their hands. These visitors had come to hear from industry representatives, state lawmakers and – perhaps most importantly – three presidential candidates talk about the upcoming election.  Why it matters  Crypto isn't exactly a major campaign issue. While it's come up during one of the primary debates and we've seen some candidates express views on crypto, issues like the economy and healthcare tend to rank much more highly as voter priorities. Still, there is a growing movement to have crypto be an issue for voters. It's too early to say whether this will succeed, especially given the sheer amount of time that exists between now and the election next November.  My colleague Jesse Hamilton and I went up to Manchester, New Hampshire on Monday to hear from presidential candidates about crypto and see if any voters were present who ranked crypto regulation or related industry topics as a primary concern next November.  Breaking it down  Three presidential candidates – Vivek Ramaswamy, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and Rep. Dean Phillips – took the stage in Manchester, New Hampshire on Monday to discuss their positions on cryptocurrency issues with CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton.  There were well over 100 people at the event, listening to the candidates, as well as other speakers like New Hampshire State Representative Keith Ammon and industry names like Coinbase's Kara Calvert.  I spoke to a handful of those audience members; none said they would vote on crypto issues as their primary focus, though clearly they were engaged enough in the industry to attend an event focused on the election.  The candidate forum was hosted by Stand With Crypto, a Coinbase-backed organization that's said it has raised over $2 million from some 80,000 individual contributors (though it's worth noting that over $1 million of that came from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong). Its stated goal is to connect crypto enthusiasts directly with their elected officials.  Ammon told CoinDesk that blockchain technology is becoming more interesting for people.  ""It's still a small segment of the population that even understands crypto, but it's growing, and I think it's growing exponentially,"" he said.  State Representative and Majority Leader Jason Osborne echoed Ammon's comments, saying the crypto industry was a ""very enthusiastic segment of society.""  ""Critically for these candidates, to be able to get in front of those folks and really connect with them. I think that's an excellent opportunity for them,"" he said.  Justin Gilanyi, founder of WhereArt.Works, said he came in from Ohio to listen to the speakers and participate in the event..  ""I'm very excited about what they're doing all across the nation to bring awareness about the positive aspects of crypto and blockchain technology,"" Gilanyi said. ""We really need sensible legislation to help provide guardrails. … we need legislators and leaders that are really going to have a great understanding of this new technology so that in America we continue continue to create jobs and to have a sustainable economy.""  Abbie Li, a former Ph.D. student at Harvard studying psychology came in from Boston alongside members of the Boston DAO to listen to the speakers, said she was interested in hearing about the candidates' thoughts on regulation around crypto.  It's worth noting of course that the candidates present on Monday are not exactly frontrunners for their parties' nominations. Whether crypto will become enough of a campaign issue to warrant the attention of President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump is an open question, but it doesn't seem likely in December 2023.

BONK prices reversed nearly all losses from last week following the announcement. BONK traded at $0.000014 on Thursday morning, with a trading volume of over $235 million.  The tokens were issued last December in the aftermath of Sam Bankman-Fried’s downfall – which prompted a sharp drop in sentiment for the Solana ecosystem at the time as the once crypto titan was a prevalent backer of the network.  Despite initially being fashioned as a meme coin, bonk saw quick adoption in the Solana ecosystem. Several Solana projects integrated the token for use as payment for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), while some used “burn” mechanisms for NFT-based events in the weeks after launch.  Bonk has been a team of 22 individuals with no singular leader, all of whom were involved in the inception of the project; CoinDesk previously learned from one of the several developers. The project has previously built decentralized applications (dapps), NFTs, and other related products on Solana.  Since October, strong interest in the Solana ecosystem seemed to have boosted the token’s appeal. SOL's market capitalization has risen from $50 million to as much as $800 million, making it one of the best-performing tokens of 2023.",POSITIVE,SHIB | SOL | BONK,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | SOL | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/14/meme-coin-bonk-spikes-40-on-coinbase-listing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2f1ffbe39ed0f9f9212b74a89608a356e3974a4-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Unshakable Bottom: Analyst Reveals The Price BTC Won’t Drop Below Navigating Resistance Levels: The Path To Growth Crypto Rand’s leveraged the price action index of various cryptocurrencies, such as Cosmos (ATOM), Chainlink (LINK), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Algorand (ALGO), and MultiversX (EGLD), among others to highlight his point. Rand identifies multiple resistance levels in these assets’ trajectories, suggesting these as potential points for market turnaround. These resistance levels are categorized as major or minor, depending on the frequency and intensity of price actions historically observed at these points. Despite the temporary pullbacks that these resistance levels might introduce, Crypto Rand views them as necessary pauses that allow the market to gather strength for future upward movements. This perspective is particularly relevant in light of Bitcoin’s recent price behavior. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen a notable dip from its recent high of $44,000, currently trading just below $42,000. This downward trend has echoed across the crypto market, impacting other major assets like Ethereum including altcoins Rand mentioned like Chainlink, and Algorand. Over the past 7 days, BTC and ETH have experienced declines of 4.4% and 2%, respectively. Meanwhile, Chainlink has seen a 6.9% drop during the same period, and Algorand has fallen by 4.1% in just the past 24 hours. Always be ready for more shakeouts, but remember, these corrections are needed for healthy growth. The Mid Caps for example got rejected on the main resistance, but overall macrostructure remains in tact. ⚡️ INDEXED: $ATOM, $LINK, $NEAR, $ALGO, $EGLD and more. pic.twitter.com/YKUhwyRM9C — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) December 13, 2023 The Broader Perspective On Crypto Market Corrections The sentiment that market corrections are a healthy and necessary aspect of growth is not exclusive to Crypto Rand. William Clemente, the co-founder of Reflexivity Research, echoes this viewpoint. Clemente posits that the current market retraction, which could potentially bring Bitcoin’s price closer to $40,000, should “not be a cause for alarm.” Clemente argues that this process is crucial for eliminating weaker market participants and reducing excess leverage, ultimately establishing a firmer foundation for future upward trends. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Crash To $40,000 Is Not A Bad Thing Clemente further articulates that the inherent volatility of Bitcoin should be perceived as “a feature, not a bug”. It is worth noting that this stance reinforces the notion that the crypto market is still evolving and that such fluctuations are part and parcel of its journey towards maturity. BTC just ~doubled in 2 months with no pull backs, a correction is not that surprising. Corrections shake out “weak hands” and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher.

U.S. Judge John Dorsey, from the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, scheduled a hearing for early next year to calculate the crypto exchange's debt to the IRS, a sticking point that has stagnated efforts to remunerate the exchange's many victims. As FTX's largest creditor, the IRS' claim must be resolved before FTX victim's can recover their losses.  During the bankruptcy hearing, the judge said that while FTX's bankruptcy was ""a complicated case,"" it still needs to be resolved more quickly.  ""The idea here in bankruptcy, tax court bankruptcy, [is] we're trying to get to conclusions occlusions quickly and be as accurate as possible without wasting a lot of time and resources of the state or the other creditors,"" he said near the end of the hearing.

The IRS is usually among the first creditors to receive payouts in corporate bankruptcy cases, but Judge Dorsey has warned the agency it should temper its expectations of a multi-billion-dollar recovery.  ""You might not get to a point where the debtors owe any taxes. Might be they owe a little bit of taxes, might be they owe a few million [dollars], tens of millions of dollars,"" he said.

These projections provide a glimpse into the future of the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting major milestones and potential breakthroughs for the largest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and exchanges like Coinbase. Bitcoin Predicted To Smash Records Bitwise’s first prediction suggests that Bitcoin will surpass previous records and trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high. The firm attributes this bullish outlook to two key catalysts: the imminent launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) early in 2024 and the anticipated halving of new Bitcoin supply by the end of April. Furthermore, Bitwise expects the spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved and to collectively become the most successful ETF launch in history. Related Reading: OKX DEX Loses Over $400,000 To Hackers – What Happens To Customer Funds? Interestingly, Bitwise also forecasts that Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, will witness its revenue double, surpassing Wall Street expectations by at least 10 times. The firm points out that Coinbase’s trading volumes typically surge during bull markets, and they anticipate a similar trend in 2024. Additionally, Bitwise highlights Coinbase’s successful launch of various new products that have gained traction in the market. On the other hand, the investment firm predicts that more money will settle using stablecoins compared to traditional payment giant Visa. Bitwise highlights stablecoins as one of crypto’s “killer apps” and notes their remarkable growth from virtually zero to a $137 billion market in just four years. Bitwise anticipates 2024 to be another significant year for stablecoin expansion. Ethereum Set For Major Breakthrough Bitwise expects Ethereum’s revenue to more than double from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $5 billion in 2024. The firm attributes this growth to the increasing number of users flocking to crypto applications. Bitwise emphasizes Ethereum’s potential as one of the fastest-growing large-scale tech platforms globally. Furthermore, Bitwise anticipates a major upgrade to Ethereum, labeled EIP-4844, which could reduce average transaction costs to below $0.01. This significant cost reduction is expected to pave the way for mainstream adoption and the development of groundbreaking applications within the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Predicts That XRP Price Will Rise “Dramatically,” Here’s When Bitwise’s bonus prediction suggests that by the end of 2024, one in four financial advisors will allocate funds to cryptocurrencies in their clients’ accounts.

In summary, Bitwise Invest’s crypto predictions for 2024 paint an exciting future for the cryptocurrency market. With expectations of a new all-time high for Bitcoin, the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and revenue growth for industry giants like Coinbase and Ethereum, the crypto space is poised for significant advancements in the coming years. As of the current update, ETH is trading at $2,200, reflecting a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. This positive movement follows a similar trend set by BTC. However, Ethereum has experienced a slight decline of 2.4% in the past seven days.
