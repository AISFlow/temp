42408122,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9pW0,1717112315,RFK Jr. Says Guilty Verdict May Help Trump's Election Prospects,"AUSTIN, TEXAS — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his presidential election opponent Donald Trump's guilty verdict Thursday may end up boosting Trump's prospects in November.  ""My belief is that it will end up helping President Trump among a large part of the American public,"" Kennedy said on stage at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, hours after the news broke.  Kennedy, breaking from his family's Democratic Party roots, is running as an independent, facing off against Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and President Joe Biden. He said that his team's internal research shows he'd beat either Trump or Biden in a head-to-head contest in the presidential election but noted that if he dropped out of the race, more than half of his supporters would instead vote for Trump.  ""I'm not a fan of Trump's,"" Kennedy said. ""The division in our country is largely down to him and Biden, and it's not a good thing for our country.""  Kennedy's Pro-Crypto Stance  He delighted the standing-room-only crowd – filled with crypto enthusiasts – with comments in support of the technology.  ""Transactional freedom is absolutely as important as freedom of expression,"" he said.  Crypto has in recent weeks become more prominent on the campaign trail. Trump has turned from past crypto skepticism to open support, including soliciting campaign donations denominated in crypto. While Biden has not expressed support, one-third of Democrats in the U.S. House just joined with Republicans to pass a crypto bill. Also, under the watch of Biden's Democratic administration, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just took a big step toward approving exchange-traded funds designed to hold Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} – something that seemed unlikely just weeks ago.  Before appearing on stage, Kennedy spoke to reporters at the Austin Convention Center. He was asked about Trump's new pro-crypto stance.  ""I'm happy about that,"" Kennedy said. ""I think it's a good thing for our country. Commitment to crypto is a commitment to freedom and transparency. I'm not going to question if it was a political decision. I'm happy he did it, and I hope President Biden does, too.""  He also discussed his own feelings about crypto.  ""We need to make sure America remains the hub of blockchain technology,"" he said. ""I'm going to make sure cryptocurrency is regulated in a way that protects the consumer from deceptive schemes.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,"Jesse Hamilton, Nick Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/30/rfk-jr-says-guilty-verdict-may-help-trumps-election-prospects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c92d059f98ebecfe5dcb20625ea1dd3699f1023-4811x2706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Garlinghouse criticized the SEC's unclear crypto regulations, highlighting the need for better regulatory clarity in the U.S.  AUSTIN, TEXAS — More crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are coming – following approval of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs and progress on ones designed to hold Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} – predicts the CEO of Ripple.  ""I think it's just a matter of time, and it's inevitable there's gonna be an XRP ETF, there's gonna be a Solana {{SOL}} ETF, there's gonna be a Cardano {{ADA}} ETF, and that's great,"" he said. Ripple is closely linked to XRP.  Recently, ether ETFs made abrupt and unexpected progress, with key filings being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Final approval is needed before they can begin trading.  Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, also said during Consensus that these ether ETFs were approved because crypto is now an election issue.  Garlinghouse said that there will be a significant regulatory approval process before these are approved, but in the end these will be ""speed bumps.""  Garlinghouse also railed against what he perceives as a lack of regulatory clarity from Washington.  ""[SEC Chair] Gary Gensler has been called to Congress, and when asked if ether is a security, he won't answer the question. Yet, he insists that the rules are very clear and don't need updating,"" he said.  In 2022, the SEC kept confidential emails and notes from William Hinman's 2018 speech, which declared ether not a security. Ripple, sued by the SEC, obtained access to these redacted documents, revealing extensive internal SEC discussions about ether's status as a security.  The U.S., the world's largest economy, represents, in Garlinghouse's opinion, the ""bottom decile of regulatory clarity.""  ""Somehow, [Gensler] believes that the Orange Grove tests from 70-80 years ago provide clear rules for crypto,"" he said, referring to the Howey Test's Floridian roots. ""It makes no sense and is a travesty because the SEC's stance has become such a political liability, affecting even the presidential race.""  Garlinghouse also mentioned that last year 75% of Rippple's hiring was outside the U.S., and this year it's about 60%, with major offices in London, Geneva and Singapore.  The hiring trends reflect Ripple's focus on regulatory clarity and customer locations, he said.

I purchased 21 bitcoins since I started this campaign. I also bought three coins for each of my kids.""  What does the future hold for crypto fans?

I believe that it should be a currency used to purchase things like apples, lunches and coffee and that people can do that.""  What inspired him to run for president  ""I toyed with getting into politics when I was younger. For two decades I took that off the plate. I saw what happened during Covid and when the government shut down the economy. I thought it was wrong. The government shut down every church, attacked the 5th amendment, shut down business without due process … they shut down jury trials, they violated prohibitions and I saw this attack on the constitution and censorship, not just to me but so many people who were trying to talk.

This suggested that the meme coin’s recent price correction was simply part of a bigger picture, with the analyst predicting the meme coin will hit a new all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up. SHIB’s Price Is Headed Towards $0.00022 Capt Toblerone shared a Shiba Inu chart on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, which showed that Shiba Inu will rise to as high as $0.00022000 when Wave 3 of the five-way sequence takes place. The chart shows that Wave 2 of the sequence was currently taking place, with SHIB witnessing a corrective move. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says Market Has Begun A Macro Bullish Expansion – What This Means For Bitcoin And Altcoin Prices A rise to $0.00022000 would create a new all-time high (ATH) for the second-largest meme coin by market cap, with its current ATH at $0.00008845. Capt Toblerone’s analysis also showed that Shiba Inu could hit this new ATH by September this year. Interstingly, Shiba Inu’s price isn’t expected to peak there, as the chart also showed that the meme coin could hit another ATH when Wave 5, which is also a bullish move, takes place later on. In the meantime, SHIB is facing corrective Wave 2, with the meme coin declining by over 7% in the last 24 hours. This follows its recent impressive price rally when it gained over 15% and even flipped Cardano to become the tenth-largest crypto token by market cap. Although Shiba Inu has once again dropped out of the top 10 rankings with its recent price decline, the meme coin could easily break into it again if it eventually rises to $0.00022, as Capt Toblerone predicts. Shiba Inu undoubtedly has the bullish momentum to enjoy such price gain since this bull run is expected to be a meme supercycle. Bitcoin Analyst Is Also Bullish On Shiba Inu Crypto analyst and early Bitcoin investor Jeremie Davinci recently reaffirmed his bullish sentiment toward Shiba Inu. He mentioned in an X post that the meme coin will break out and rise to as high as $0.00006000 when this downward trend is over. He further revealed that he will be looking to accumulate more SHIBas he sees an opportunity to make money. Related Reading: Solana Remains Institutional Investors’ Favorite, YTD Flows Ramp Up To $29 Milion Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos also recently mentioned that SHIB is set to run to its current ATH and “beyond.” He added that the meme coin is ready to shed another zero and rise to $0.0001. The crypto analyst had previously highlighted this price level as his target for Shiba Inu in this bull run. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002604, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42408104,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9obn,1717103647,Everyone at Consensus 2024 Is Talking About Biden’s Crypto Flip Flop. Is He for Real?,"AUSTIN, Texas – The biggest news this year at Consensus seems to be the political sea change happening in the Democratic party over crypto. While President Biden’s administration essentially carried over the same reluctant-to-the-point-of-being-nearly-hostile approach to crypto as its predecessor, ever since the bottoming out of the industry in 2022 (the year from crypto hell) it has been actively hostile. The easiest way to sum up Biden’s “whole of government” attempt to wrangle in the crypto industry is with the catchphrase Operation Choke Point 2.0, coined by VC Nic Carter to describe the apparent debanking of many crypto firms.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But in a matter of weeks, this has changed. Beginning with the bipartisan vote in the House and Senate to repeal the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) much-maligned accounting bulletin (SAB121) and extending to yesterday’s reveal that the Biden administration is reportedly doing outreach to crypto firms in a late-stage attempt to hear what they have to say about what good crypto policy would look like, it has become (nearly) believable that brighter days are ahead on the political, regulatory and legislative fronts for the domestic crypto industry.  See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)  The feeling is in the air, probably because everyone appears to be voicing it out loud. For instance, yesterday on the Consensus stage, NYSE President Lynn Martin said that she doesn’t think that crypto will remain a “partisan” issue much longer. In the same way that stock and bonds are mostly apolitical, it doesn’t really make much sense to view crypto as inherently political (in fact, crypto may have a better case for actually being apolitical, given the technical design of protocols like Bitcoin).  However, not everyone is in alignment here. For instance, a big name crypto lawyer who works for a red hot DeFi startup, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of his work, said he doesn’t think Biden’s apparent change of heart is genuine. “He’ll likely revert back to course, if reelected,” he said. Asked whether he felt any weight off his shoulders at all, or whether his job has or will get any easier, under seemingly improving regulatory conditions, he said “absolutely not.” Today is the same as yesterday.  Austin Campbell, a Columbia University business lecturer who is plugged into the D.C. circuit, echoed this idea when noting that the seemingly parallel change in Congress is not likely permanent. In fact, if you look at how the voting on the landmark Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) happened, it largely broke down on age lines. Though this in itself could be a positive, given that younger members of Congress are more likely to “get it,” and despite the fact that U.S. politics is a gerontocracy, the dinosaurs won’t rule the world forever.  This morning, Messari founder Ryan Selkis, who recently spoke with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago Club, and Uniswap Labs chief lawyer Marvin Ammori, a longtime Democratic operative, actually debated the recent political machinations afoot on the Main Stage. Selkis’ main argument was that any easing up on crypto by the Democrats is largely a result of Trump capturing the “single issue” crypto vote, and that it should be treated as suspect. While Ammori argued that political changes don’t flip like a switch, and that things like SAB121 and FIT21 were the result of real bipartisan collaboration and successful crypto lobbying.  See also: Trump Widens Lead Over With Biden (on Polymarket and PredictIt) After Courting Crypto Vote  “My point is, we don't necessarily want to be partisan, because that will be a setback in the long term,” Ammori said. In other words, crypto should be wary of aligning itself with any one party or any one candidate – especially considering that campaign promises are rarely kept. For his part, Selkis wanted to step out of wishful thinking (i.e., that Democrats could be suddenly supportive of crypto after so many years) and into the realm of realpolitik (i.e., that if the theory of bipartisan support were true, it’d be because Dems’ needs have shifted).  “Democrats right now are like a cheating spouse; we caught them with their pants down,” Selkis said. “To reward this Democrat, mainstream party at this point in time is not only foolish, but I think it shows a profound lack of self-respect – they need to do penance.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/30/everyone-at-consensus-24-is-talking-about-bidens-crypto-flip-flop-is-he-for-real,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8ab94ca03f5d38d84f74e12fdb578d41c9697ed-1674x956.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Holdings Of Bitcoin Investors With At Least 10 BTC May Correlate To Price In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed about a metric that has historically been one of the top leading indicators in the sector. The metric in question is the total amount of supply held by the Bitcoin investors carrying at least 10 BTC in their wallets. Related Reading: How High Can Bitcoin Go Before A Top? Analyst Chimes In At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this cutoff is equivalent to around $683,000. As such, the investors holding sums of this scale or higher would be larger than the regular retail holders. Key groups such as sharks and whales fall in this range. These cohorts are generally considered to be influential beings, so their behavior can be worth keeping an eye on. While the 10+ BTC group wouldn’t solely include these large investors, the trend in its holdings would still at least in part encapsulate what these key holders would be doing. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined holdings of investors carrying balance in this range over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by investors belonging to this group has been going up recently, suggesting that accumulation has been occurring from the large holders. According to Santiment, there has historically been a pattern between the price and the behavior of the investors falling in this range. “When they accumulate, cryptocurrencies rise. When they dump, extended bear markets come,” explains the analytics firm. Instances of this trend are also visible in the chart. The supply held by this cohort started rising in October 2019 and kept up the rise throughout the bull run that followed in 2021. In February 2022, the behavior of these Bitcoin investors changed, however, as their combined holdings started heading down instead. This led into the bear market. The decline stopped after the FTX crash back in November 2022 and the holdings of these investors took to sideways movement in 2023. At the end of the year, another shift finally happened as the metric gained an uptrend. This accumulation likely kicked off because of the imminent spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in January. These investors kept up this buying pressure post-approval as well, which all culminated into the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Is Mt. Gox A Worry For Bitcoin?

28689698,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610675,1717099203,"Ethereum Hovering Above $3,700 As Mega Whales Accumulate: $4,900 Incoming?","At spot rates, Ethereum prices have been edging lower, recently even retesting the immediate support at $3,700. Even though the coin is still hovering around this level, optimism is high that it will spike higher in the coming days. Ethereum Whales Are Now Accumulating Cementing this outlook, one analyst, citing on-chain events, notes that a bullish narrative may be unfolding. Pointing to the sharp increase in Ethereum addresses controlling over 10,000 ETH, the analyst is now convinced that investors are through with their distribution and are not accumulating, expecting more price gains. Glassnode data cited shows that the number of addresses controlling over 10,000 ETH has been on the uptrend since May 20. Notably, on this day, prices shot strongly, breaking above $3,300 and $3,700. Related Reading: MATIC In Consolidation: Key Price Levels To Watch After A Breakout The uptick boosted sentiment, possibly explaining why whales are now accumulating and not opting to liquidate, accepting to be shaken off from their position following the recent correction from $3,900. When writing, ETH is changing hands at around $3,700, up nearly 20% from May 2024 lows. From the daily chart, the coin is still within a bullish breakout formation after clearing two crucial resistances (now support) at $3,300 and $3,700. Therefore, despite the retracement from $3,900, the uptrend remains. The coin, reading from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, will likely ease above $4,100 as buyers set their eyes on $4,900 or 2021 highs. It is highly that these whales are institutions, most of whom are optimistic about what lies ahead and positioning themselves for the leg up. The sharp expansion in whale count means institutions are increasingly confident in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Continuous Development And Spot ETH ETF Hopes One reason for this positive outlook is the continuous development in the Ethereum network. After the successful activation of Dencun in March, platform developers are now focusing on the upcoming Pectra upgrade. This hard fork is expected to further enhance the network, making transaction processing more efficient and cost-effective. These continuous developments are positioning the network as the preferred host for decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme coin activities. Related Reading: Political Memecoin Mania: Super Trump Token Explodes With 200% Surge Beyond platform-related factors, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved the listing of all spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

42408108,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9oiP,1717095761,"Franklin Templeton's Jenny Johnson on Bitcoin ETFs, RWA Tokenization and Blockchain's Potential for TradFi","AUSTIN, TX — Franklin Templeton, the $1.6 trillion asset manager based in Silicon Valley, has been at the forefront of traditional finance heavyweights pushing into the digital asset space.  ""We have looked at blockchain tech [and found] this is going to be transformational and we better make sure we understand it,"" Jenny Johnson, president and CEO of Franklin Templeton, said during a Thursday panel discussion at Consensus 2024 in Austin.  Read more: Jenny Johnson Has 76-Year-Old Franklin Templeton Learning Blockchain Tricks  That's why the company is running about 30 validator nodes on 12 different blockchains, for example, on Ethereum {{ETH}}, Cardano {{ADA}}, Stellar {{XLM}} and Provenance, Johnson said on the panel. That's more than what the asset manager's website shows, which mentions six networks including the same four blockchains plus Polkadot {{DOT}} and Solana {{SOL}}.  RWA tokenization  A key allure of blockchain technology, she explained, is the efficiency to record and reconcile transactions and its potential for cost savings.  ""Franklin [Templeton] today has a huge number of people, a couple hundred, who just reconcile [data] between systems, then we have to reconcile with our counterparty and another firm,"" Johnson said.  Blockchains offer a single ""source of truth"" and record timing of transactions better than conventional processes, she said, which could help cut costs and decrease administrative workload.  ""We're in a business where we're constantly being pressured to drive down the costs of the delivery of what we do,"" she added.

28687760,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610645,1717095651,"Crypto Strategist Who Predicted Bitcoin Rejection At $70,000 Reveals Where Price Is Headed Next","A crypto strategist who accurately predicted the current Bitcoin downtrend has shown where the price is headed from here. If the analyst’s prediction is anything to go by, then the decline in the crypto market may only just be in its beginning stages. Bearish Indicators Pile Up For A Bitcoin Crash Earlier this week, when the crypto market was still euphoric with the Bitcoin climb above $70,000, crypto analyst Xanrox was one of the few who called a possible decline in price. The analyst took to the TradingView website to share this analysis, where he showed that indicators point to a Bitcoin price retrace. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Shows Unusually High Strength Against Dogecoin According to the analyst’s initial post, Bitcoin is going to crash in June and the reason lie in the price action that was seen in May. One of the indicators that Xanrox points to is the “FVGAP” that was created at $62,000, and as the analyst explains, this can signal a bullish trend for the digital asset. This is mainly because this gap that was created at $62,000 are filled out “sooner rather than later,” suggesting that the retrace could be happening soon. Another indicator that the analyst points to is the Elliott Wave perspective, pointing out that the Bitcoin price has finished the first impulsive Wave 1. Naturally, as the market moves in waves, the next wave, Wave 2, is expected to be bullish. But that is not all, as Xanrox points out the creation of a corrective ABC pattern from here. Last but not least, the analyst points out a small red trend line that has formed in the chart and is already breaking down. Such breakdowns in the trend line are bearish; add in the rising wedge pattern that the analyst sees in the chart, and it seems to be a perfect recipe for a decline. Xanrox initially posted his analysis on Wednesday, May 29, and since then, the Bitcoin price has broken down below $68,000, suggesting this prediction could come to pass. As a result, the analyst has now updated the post, showing where the price could be headed next. Next Steps For BTC In the follow-up posts, Xanrox points out that another red trend line is now breaking down after the first. With two in a row, it paints a very negative picture from the Bitcoin price from here. Additionally, the crypto analyst revealed that the BTC price has formed a symmetrical triangle, which he expected to break down. When this happens, the price is expected to fall. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Explodes 85% Amid 15% Price Jump, Why This Is Important As for how far Bitcoin can fall from here, the analyst’s original chart shows a breakdown toward the $62,000 level. This would mean an over 10% decline in the price, something that could shake prices all across the market. “Currently, I am bearish, so be careful during the summer as the price action is not the most volatile for Bitcoin during this season,” the analyst warned. As for Bitcoin, it is currently sitting just below $68,000, at the time of writing, with 2.7% losses in the last week. However, the monthly remains green for the pioneer cryptocurrency as it’s seeing 10.28% gains.

The expansion, announced at a panel discussion at Consensus 2024 in Austin, aims to help developers on Aptos to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the network.  The collaboration would make Aptos the first Move-based blockchain integrating Chainlink's services, the press release claims.  As the number of independent blockchains are proliferating, communication between the different networks is posing a challenge to the digital asset economy. Chainlink is one of the key projects working on connecting these systems streaming data between them and the outside world. For example, its CCIP software played a key role in Chainlink's partnership with SWIFT, a global closed banking messaging system.  Aptos, founded by former employees of Facebook parent company Meta, is a blockchain that focuses on low-cost transactions and high throughput. It was built with the Move programming language, the basis of Meta's shuttered crypto project Diem.  ""Joining the Chainlink SCALE program will empower developers on Aptos with new and increased access to Chainlink services, expanding the toolkit of resources on Aptos available to help them build secure, scalable, and fully-featured dApps” said Bashar Lazaar, grants and ecosystem lead at Aptos Foundation, the ecosystem development organization supporting Aptos.",POSITIVE,LINK | APT,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | APT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/30/aptos-integrates-chainlinks-ccip-and-data-feeds-to-boost-decentralized-app-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c7772791f11e009f8a25e4969a89df90dfe8885-1371x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408117,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9pCA,1717093371,Crypto Can't Be Regulated by Current US Regulators,"I’ve been speaking a lot the last two years about how the blockchain industry tends to misunderstand regulation. This goes beyond whether or a particular token is a security or a commodity. The problem we have is in defining tokens.  Alexandra Damsker is an attorney and strategic consultant, advising on legal and operational issues. She was previously an attorney with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Mayer Brown, and is an exited founder.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  It really doesn’t matter which agency regulates tokens, because all of them are premised on the same thing: the regulated item is static. A stock is a stock from the day it’s created until the day it is voided or the company is dissolved. Fiat is currency from the day it is minted until the day it is destroyed.  But not tokens. Tokens are dynamic – they can have multiple different functions to different holders, or even to the same holder, simultaneously. And there is no regulatory system in the world that can account for that.  Let’s look at some of the things tokens can do, and the regulatory consequences of each:  Move transactions along a chain. This is purely functional and unregulated.  Incentivize people who contribute effort to secure and manage the blockchain. This is an exchange for labor or services, and does not rely on any presumed value for the token, so is unregulated.  Represent value, either physical or digital. This is only regulated when the underlying represented thing is regulated (e.g., a token representing a television is not regulated, but a token representing a share of stock in Tesla is regulated).  Represent a physical or digital product or group of rights. This is just a product, and unregulated other than any intellectual property rights that may attach.  Payment for goods or services OTHER than transactional fees (i.e., gas fees). This is tricky: unless it’s a stablecoin, it’s similar to a currency, but not quite the same. (Remember that currencies are intended to be a store of value that stays within a narrow range to a key targeted or exchange rate. Assets, on the other hand, are designed to fluctuate in value – that’s how your tiny investment in something suddenly becomes worth so much, or your huge investment in something else plummets to nothing.) Currencies are regulated by the U.S. Department of Treasury, including FinCEN and the IRS.  Payment for transactional fees (gas fees). These are service fees, and generally unregulated.  Represent partial value. (This is great – you can’t own a partial stock or partial painting, but you can get fractional value of pretty much anything if you tokenize it.) This one is tricky, too: generally, If you break an asset into part-interests where everyone shares interest in the whole, it’s a security, regulated by the SEC. But if you break things up in a way that you own something distinct and individual, rather than a piece of a whole, it’s generally NOT a security. It could be a commodity, however, like bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Represent rewards for taking on risk or offering a good or service, like staking on chains without providing validation work, or payment for tokens loaned to a liquidity pool, borrower platform or application. This is regulated by a combination of securities and Treasury regulators.  Represent voting rights. Regulated by the SEC in public companies only.  Represent perceived or speculative market value. A security or commodity, and regulated by the SEC or CFTC, accordingly.  You can see how many things a token can be – and the buyer doesn’t know what a specific token will end up. If I buy ether {{ETH}} in January, February and March, then in June stake some with a validator, purchase a one-of-one NFT (a product) in July, and a meme coin (likely a security) in August, paying gas for each transaction, which ETH specifically was used for which transaction? I, the buyer, don’t even know – I won’t know which ETH was used to buy the meme coin until I apply my jurisdiction’s accounting method. So we only find out in retrospect which regulatory system to look at for any particular ETH until after I spend it and apply professional accounting methods.  Now we throw in the fact that there is a person on the other side of the transaction – who may then shift the ETH into something else, just like I did. I took ETH I purchased on the marketplace (likely a security) to buy a product (the NFT) and service fees (gas fees). The person who sold me the NFT could have taken the ETH (payment/ currency) and then placed some of it on the market (currency), voted on an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) with some (voting), and purchased an NFT in a major fine art piece (security) and paid service fees (gas fees).  See also: Is the House's FIT21 Bill Really the Legislation That Crypto Needs? | Opinion  Do we see how confusing this is, and artificial? The current regulatory structure assumes anything that falls within it will remain there permanently. But that is not only unlikely, it is impossible with respect to tokens. It does not work for dynamic systems.  Trying to squeeze tokens into old frameworks can only give us marginally useful protection at best, and limits incentive to innovate at worst. We can do better than this. And considering the fact that quantum computing and other technologies with greater likelihood of simultaneous shifting of character are coming into mass use faster and faster, we have no time to waste.

The newly launched memecoins have been criticized by crypto community members as the tokens have been launched with massive controversy. After a week or so of pumping and dumping, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Investor Alert. However, the SEC’s warning didn’t stop more musicians from joining the crypto festival of Q2. Related Reading: ‘Solana Is For Baddies’: Rapper Iggy Azalea Joins The Controversial Celebrity Token Frenzy SEC Warns About Celebrity Memecoins On Wednesday, the US SEC released an Investor Alert targeting memecoins. In the warning, the Commission alerted users about pump-and-dump and pre-sale schemes involving meme-based tokens. The SEC explained that “fraudsters may create a memecoin and then tout it on social media.” After pumping the price and selling to make a profit, investors see most of their money gone as the price rapidly decreases. The celebrity memecoins launch frenzy became a trend this past week. As a result, many mainstream media figures, influencers, musicians, and athletes have shown “interest” in the crypto space. In most cases, these celebrities start engaging with the crypto community right before promoting their soon-to-be-launched memecoins. Nonetheless, the recent trend has been particularly controversial since these figures have, for the most part, worked with an alleged serial scammer. Recently, celebrities and community members accused a man named Sahil Arora of allegedly orchestrating several pump-and-dump scams. Arora seemingly scammed investors and partners in every memecoin launch he’s been involved with. Australian rapper Iggy Azalea launched MOTHER two days ago and claimed to have created the token to stop Arora from using her image on his scams. Moreover, Rich the Kid and Caitlyn Jenner have come out stating that the alleged scammer lied to them. Now, more musicians have joined the crypto festival of memecoins while being accused of dumping their fans. More Musical Acts To Headline Memecoinchella On Wednesday, crypto sleuth ZachXBT accused famous rapper Lil Pump of participating in a pump-and-dump scam. According to the internet investigator, the rapper shared and quickly deleted a post promoting his memecoin after the token was dumped. The post stated “lil or big pump” and tagged one of Arora’s accounts. Lil Pump answered the allegations, claiming to never have made a token and accusing Arora of scamming him and his fans. Moreover, he seemingly sent “proof” to the crypto detective to prove his innocence. In the early hours of Thursday, the rapper claimed to have taken control of his accounts and the memecoin. Moreover, he distanced himself from the alleged serial scammer. However, ZachXBT shared some screenshots of a conversation between Lil Pump’s team and the person managing the memecoin launch. According to the images, Pump’s team was not aware of Arora’s track record, but as the investigator explained, he “still got partially paid for the scam.” Additionally, his team hid the paid promo tag, which is an X requirement. ZachXBT pointed out that the rapper also did the same in 2022. Throughout the night, the internet sleuth listed several other artists who joined the crypto scam headlines. The list includes American rapper MoneyBagg Yo, Trippie Redd, and Davido. Giving A Platform To Scammers American-Nigerian singer and producer Davido was, alongside Lil Pump, the biggest topic on Wednesday night. The singer promoted his Davido token alongside figures inside the crypto space. Crypto trader Ansem held an X Space session with the music producer to discuss his project. According to online reports, the singer dumped over half of his DAVIDO holdings while on the X session. Lookonchain revealed that Davido made over 2,783 SOL, worth around 473,000, after selling 121.8 million DAVIDO tokens. Per the post, the singer received 7.5 SOL as start-up capital, which he used to buy 20.3% of the memecoin’s total supply. Related Reading: Keeping Up With The Memecoins: Caitlyn Jenner’s New Token Surges 50,000% Amid Controversy The community wasn’t pleased with the crypto trader’s involvement in the incident. As a result, an important discussion was brought up by several community members.

I rate Bitcoin as a ""Strong Buy"" due to its potential to reach gold's market cap at $650,000 per BTC, but acknowledging significant opportunity risk. The bull case for Bitcoin involves it becoming a global reserve asset, while the bear case sees it stuck in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Most articles on Bitcoin tend to argue either in favor of a significant appreciation of the cryptocurrency or for it to fade into irrelevance. My thesis for Bitcoin is that it is an asymmetric bet on its adoption as a global reserve asset. The expected value of this bet, according to my assumptions and calculations, is for Bitcoin to trade within a $40,000 to $100,000 range. Despite this view, I rate Bitcoin as a ""Strong Buy"" because it is an asymmetric bet that I, personally, like, and I am willing to take. In other words, I believe in the bullish case of this asymmetric bet. Bitcoin is the single largest holding in my portfolio, but it comes with significant opportunity risk. Thesis: Bitcoin is an asymmetric bet with an expected value between $40,000 to $100,000 per Bitcoin. But I am still very bullish. Bitcoin is an asymmetric bet. The cryptocurrency has all the characteristics it needs to become a superior global reserve asset: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability and, most importantly in my view, scarcity. The real question is whether the world's institutions, such as central banks, governments, pension funds and large investment funds will actually adopt it as a global reserve asset. In this article, I will detail the bull and bear case for Bitcoin within three scenarios of probability. The expected value of these scenarios, from a statistical standpoint, is for Bitcoin to trade between $40,000 to $100,000 per Bitcoin. More details on this are available in the article. Beyond the statistical exercise, my bear case is for Bitcoin to get stuck in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears and keep trading at close to current price levels indefinitely. My bull case is for Bitcoin to at least match the market capitalization of gold, maturing as a global reserve asset. I like Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet and that's why I am recommending a Strong Buy. Assumptions behind the asymmetric bet Bitcoin might become a global reserve asset, or fall into irrelevance - these are the two possible outcomes from an asymmetric bet on Bitcoin. In the next two sections, I will outline what those two outcomes look like in my opinion, in terms of price per Bitcoin expressed in US dollars. Then, I will run the math and go over the statistically expected value of my asymmetric bet on Bitcoin. Selecting the bottom for my bearish case: Bitcoin Realized Price The most straightforward bottom to select for a Bitcoin bear case would be zero. After all, Bitcoin is not a cash-flow generating asset and therefore no intrinsic value can be calculated based on future cash flows. However, I don't think Bitcoin going to zero is a realistic outcome. Even in a bearish scenario, people I believe will keep trading BTC in the short- and mid-term to try to make money. There will also be people that will keep believing in Bitcoin and hold it longer term, no matter what. In a nutshell, I think that even in a bearish case Bitcoin will remain a sort of (somewhat regulated) 'online casino'. People will keep investing in the hope of gaining from trades that take advantage of the high volatility of the asset. What I am considering to establish my bottom is Bitcoin Realized Price. This is the value of all bitcoins at the price they were last transacted on the blockchain, divided by the number of all bitcoins in circulation. This number is a gauge of what on average people paid for their Bitcoins. The reason why I am selecting this metric is because of human behavior. I believe that people are less willing to sell below their unrealized price, as this would imply selling at a loss. This indicator is commonly used in Technical Analysis to establish Bitcoin's bottom. For my bearish case, I am using 2 figures related to Bitcoin Realized Price: Short-Term (155 days) Realized Bitcoin Price, at $62,000 at the time of writing. Total Realized Bitcoin Price, at $29,500 at the time of writing. The average between these two figures is $45,000. I am rounding up this figure to $50,000 for my bear case. Selecting the top for my bullish case: Bitcoin to match gold Selecting a target BTC price in USD for my bullish case is an easier exercise and I won't use technical analysis indicators for this purpose. If Bitcoin matures as a global reserve asset, I believe it will at least match the market capitalization of gold, the current prime global reserve asset. Gold currently has a market cap of around $15 Trillion, while Bitcoin is at roughly $1.3 Trillion. Bitcoin matching gold's market capitalization would put the price of one Bitcoin at $650,000. This is the figure I am using for my bullish case. In reality, I believe that Bitcoin could go way beyond that amount if it matures into a reserve asset. The reason is that in a bullish case, I see Bitcoin replacing not only gold, but also fiat currencies in the measure they are used as reserves. To clarify - I do not believe most people will ever buy groceries using Bitcoin and I do not see Bitcoin replacing fiat currency for daily use on a mass scale. I do see however how, in a bullish case, central banks might decide to hold Bitcoin instead of US dollars, Euros, British Pounds or Swiss Francs. For simplicity, however, I am using Bitcoin matching gold in market capitalization as my bull case scenario. The expected payoff of my asymmetric bet is between $40,000 and $100,000 per BTC I have defined my targets for the asymmetric bet as $650,000 per BTC for the Bullish case, and $50,000 per BTC for the Bearish case. I am now going to provide 3 different scenarios related to the probability the bull and bear cases pay off: Scenario A assigns a 5% chance that Bitcoin reaches my bull target level. Scenario B assigns a 20% chance that Bitcoin reaches my bull target level. Scenario C assigns a 25% chance that Bitcoin reaches my bull target level. Bullish vs. Bearish case for BTC (My own work) To calculate the expected payoff of this bet in the three different scenarios, I multiply the probability of each of the three scenarios by the target price of the two cases. As outlined in the above table and in the thesis summary, this gives an expected payoff between $40,000 to $100,000 per Bitcoin. How this asymmetric bet might play out in the real world My calculations so far are a theoretical exercise. An ""expected payoff"" can be used to assess whether an investment is interesting at current prices. With Bitcoin currently sitting at around $67,000 per Bitcoin, entering Bitcoin seems a good deal in two out of the three scenarios. Different probability scenarios will change the expected value of this bet. Readers can assign their own probabilities and decide by their own whether Bitcoin at these levels represents an interesting investment. In reality, my asymmetric bet on Bitcoin will result in either of two outcomes. Bitcoin might go up and mature into a global reserve currency. Or it might fall into irrelevance and trade close to current levels indefinitely. The bull case: Bitcoin as a reserve asset, not a currency I believe Bitcoin is not a viable alternative to replace currencies for daily use. The basic principles of macroeconomics teach that deflation is worse than inflation. That's because when consumers expect their currency to appreciate in value, they tend to refrain from consumption. Therefore, a deflationary currency would not be good because it would drastically decrease consumer demand, which is a key component of GDP. This would result in a deep and prolonged economic crisis. In other terms, it is reasonable to assume, based on basic macroeconomics theory, that few would be willing to spend their Bitcoin to buy groceries, if they expect the value of said Bitcoin to rise significantly in the future. That's why my bull case sees Bitcoin as a global reserve asset, not as a replacement for everyday currency. A global reserve asset does not need to be inflationary - on the contrary, it needs to be deflationary or at least experience low inflation. Bitcoin is excellent in that it has a predetermined supply, rendering it very scarce. It is also highly transparent, with transactions verifiable on the blockchain. Other characteristics of Bitcoin that make it a great reserve asset on paper include how easy and cheap it is to transfer, and its divisibility and fungibility. Of course, that's not enough. For Bitcoin to mature into a global reserve asset, it needs to be adopted by an increasing amount of institutional and retail investors. I believe Bitcoin has already shown significant progress in terms of institutional adoption. The last four years have seen Bitcoin being adopted by an increasing number of investors. El Salvador adopted it as a currency, several Bitcoin ETFs were launched under the SEC's rule, and even a pension fund has recently decided to expose itself to Bitcoin. The next steps for my bull case to run its course would include governments and central banks. The rate of Bitcoin adoption for a possible bull case is pure speculation, and I prefer to refrain from giving an exact target in terms of when I expect this bet to run its course. I will limit myself to listing some recent events which, I believe, are indicating a further, increased adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors. These include Argentina reportedly in talks with El Salvador's regulators to discuss Bitcoin as legal tender, a rumor that Qatar's sovereign fund might buy Bitcoin and the impressive growth of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. The bear case: Bitcoin stuck in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears The way that I see a bear case play out, is for Bitcoin to be stuck between bulls and bears in an indefinite tug-of-war. I believe people will keep trading Bitcoin even if it weren't to mature into a global reserve asset. My belief is rooted in the functionality that Bitcoin offers today. These include: International money transfers between sanctioned countries or generally to avoid government oversight. Active trading by people that want to profit from Bitcoin's high volatility. Illicit transactions. Demand driven by the small countries that adopted Bitcoin as a currency so far. I define my bear case as an 'online casino' scenario, in that Bitcoin will be used to try to make money or for borderline-illicit transactions by its users. Risks to my thesis The first risk to my thesis concerns my target price for Bitcoin. I have assumed Bitcoin, in a bull case, will at least match gold's market capitalization. In reality, Bitcoin might never mature to those levels, even in a bull case. In a ""mild bull"" case, Bitcoin might simply become one of the alternatives to gold and reserve currencies, without ever taking over from them in full. In that scenario, Bitcoin might be stuck at significantly below my $650,000 per BTC target price. The second risk to my thesis concerns the probability I assigned to my three scenarios. My assumptions might be off - someone could argue that there is less than a 1% chance that institutions adopt what is still seen as a highly volatile, high risk asset. Assigning a 1% probability that Bitcoin matures into a global reserve asset would provide a very different expected value for my asymmetric bet. There is also a risk related to opportunity cost. If my bear case were to materialize, investors could lose money when compared to having invested in other assets. For example, Bitcoin has overperformed equity markets so far, but that might change in the future. Finally, there is a risk linked to high volatility. Bitcoin is historically a highly volatile asset, and I do not see this changing for the foreseeable future. Any investor entering Bitcoin at these levels should be aware of and able to handle high volatility. Overall, my bet on Bitcoin has a high risk - high reward investment profile. When I invest in single stocks or single positions, I try to identify possible asymmetric bets. But asymmetric bets are very risky by definition, since they tend to either pay disproportionate returns or heavily underperform the market. Conclusion My bear case for Bitcoin sees the cryptocurrency trading at around $50,000 per Bitcoin. My bull case for Bitcoin sees it growing up to $650,000 per Bitcoin. The expected payoff of this asymmetric bet is, in my opinion, between $40,000 to $100,000 per Bitcoin. With the current price at roughly $67,000 per Bitcoin at the time of writing, I see this as a good entry point for investors interested in the cryptocurrency. Ultimately though, investing in Bitcoin still comes with a high risk that the asymmetric bet does not pay off. Therefore, my final recommendation is for investors to enter this bet only if they understand Bitcoin and are overall bullish on the chance it pays off. My recommendation of a STRONG BUY is rooted in that personal belief.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696482-what-if-bitcoin-stays-at-current-prices-indefinitely?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28682659.jpeg

Terra’s LUNA token surged as much as 38% after news of the agreement became public.  Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon have reached a ""settlement in principle"" with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a civil case alleging fraud, according to a court filing Thursday.  Terraform’s LUNA token climbed as much as 38% to the highest since April 12 after news of the agreement became public, according to data on charting platform TradingView.  A listing for the District Court for the Southern District of New York refers to a May 29 telephone conference, ""without transcription or recording."" Counsels for all the parties were present. The scheduled oral arguments were ""cancelled because the parties have informed the Court that they reached a settlement in principle."" The parties must file documentation in support of the settlement in front of Judge Jed S. Rakoff by June 12.  The development comes less than two months after a Manhattan jury delivered a 'liable' verdict after a nine-day trial. The SEC had accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of its products. The $40 billion ecosystem based around the algorithmic stablecoin UST and an earlier version of LUNA collapsed in May 2022, triggering an industry-wide contagion.  Later that month, the SEC said it was looking to impose a $5.3 billion penalty to settle the case, its steepest fine yet on a cryptocurrency project. Terraform replied in court that only an “appropriate civil penalty” per violation should be imposed. During the trial, CEO Chris Amani had said the company was undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and had only approximately $150 million in assets remaining. Lawyers of Do Kwon said Kwon has “no illegal profits … to disgorge.”  Do Kwon is currently on bail in Montenegro, awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea. He also faces criminal charges in New York, as well as in South Korea.

28681881,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610664,1717084823,BlackRock Overtakes Grayscale To Become The Largest Bitcoin Fund In The World With $20 Billion AUM,"American multinational investment company BlackRock, has recently achieved a monumental milestone, recording over $20 billion in total assets. The BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF has successfully surpassed Grayscale to become the largest Bitcoin fund in the world. BlackRock Overtakes Grayscale BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust has recently become the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, overtaking its primary rival, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Explodes 85% Amid 15% Price Jump, Why This Is Important As of Tuesday, May 28, BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF held around $19.68 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), overthrowing Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF with $19.65 billion and surpassing the third largest, Fidelity Investments, which recorded $11.1 billion in AUM. Over the past two days, BlackRock has recorded more inflows, pushing its AUM to more than $20 billion presently. Following the launch of its Spot Bitcoin ETF on January 11, Grayscale has consistently recorded massive outflows worth billions of dollars. For years, the asset management company was the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, reaching a peak of about $44 billion in 2021. However, since its conversion into an ETF at the beginning of 2024, investors have pulled out almost $18 billion from Grayscale’s Bitcoin fund. On May 3, GBTC recorded its first inflow, receiving approximately $63 million, and effectively ending its 82-day streak of outflows. Its previous outflows had already significantly weakened Grayscale’s position as the largest Bitcoin ETF. In contrast, BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has been recording millions of inflows since its launch, making it unsurprising that IBIT has eventually surpassed Grayscale’s GBTC. BlackRock has only recorded a handful of outflows and minimal zero flows. Its highest recorded inflow occurred on March 12, with IBIT gathering approximately $849 million in a single day. Additionally, BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF witnessed its first outflow on May 1, losing about $36.9 million. On the same day, Grayscale had reported outflows of more than $167 million. Investors are likely favoring BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF due to its relatively affordable ETF management fees, which decreased from 0.30% to 0.25%. On the other hand, Grayscale has the highest ETF management fees among all the 11 approved United States Spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the asset management company has promised to slash fees, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust’s current ETF management fees remain as high as 1.5% annually. Still Leading Spot Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows According to Farside data, for the past week, BlackRock has been leading the Spot Bitcoin ETF race, recording the most inflows out of the 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Shows Unusually High Strength Against Dogecoin Excluding May 27, when all United States Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw zero flows, BlackRock recorded a total of $127.1 million for the first two days.

Currently, Grayscale is still recording more outflows, losing $31.1 million as of writing.

42408111,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9p2F,1717084800,Crypto for Advisors: The Evolution of Crypto and TradFi,"This week, we are at Consensus, and today is FA day - please say hi if you are around!  Last week was a big week in the U.S. regarding regulatory movement; the House of Representatives voted in favour of a new crypto bill, and the SEC made an approval that moved the spot ether ETF listings forward.  In today’s newsletter, Benjamin Dean from Wisdom Tree examines bitcoin’s evolution since its inception, its performance as an asset, and its integration into traditional finance.  In Ask an Expert, Kevin Tam from Raymond James provides an overview of the SEC 13F filings and what they show us about which institutions have invested in bitcoin ETFs.  And as always, there’s more information in the Keep Reading section.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Digital Assets Meet Trad-fi, Ironic – Isn’t It?  It has been 15 years since the Bitcoin source code was distributed online. The idea was to provide a way for people to exchange value without an intermediary having to approve said exchange. A lot has changed over the past 15 years as many other distributed database networks have been created (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Each brings its own functionality and potential use cases.  Our research reveals several interesting points that have remained surprisingly constant over the years – even though one typically thinks of digital assets as a fast-moving and ever-changing space:  Bitcoin outperformed large-cap and small-cap equities, treasury, investment-grade, and high-yield bonds, as well as gold, REITS, or infrastructure, in nine out of the last twelve years.  The correlation of bitcoin, calculated over the last 11 or 2 years, with all the asset classes above was lower than 25%.  The asset's volatility is 69%, but thanks to its low correlation, adding 1% of it to a 60/40 portfolio (60% MSCI All Country World, 40% Bloomberg Multiverse) would have added only 0.07% of volatility and 0.5% of max drawdown.  This 1% position would have improved returns over the last 11 years by 0.67% per year, which is an information ratio of 0.96.  Similar statistical findings apply to digital assets as a whole (i.e. beyond bitcoin). The implication for investors is that they do not need to take an active view on the asset; they can allocate as a neutral investor. A good assessment of the neutral positioning of an asset in a multi-asset portfolio is to look at the market portfolio, i.e. the portfolio that simulates the totality of all liquid assets accessible to investors.  The total market cap of liquid assets is around $197 trillion. With a market Cap of $2.4 trillion, cryptocurrencies represent almost 1.2% of that. This market is now similar in size to high-yield bonds, inflation-linked bonds, or emerging markets small caps.  Looking purely at the characteristics of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, it is clear that they can bring value to a multi-asset portfolio. With their growth potential, diversification credentials and ease of investment through regulated investment vehicles, it is becoming increasingly hard for investors to ignore them. With a 1-2% investment, investors would be taking a neutral stance on the space, ready to benefit from potential upside and manage the risk by limiting the downside risk to a single percent.  It is now easier than ever to do this. 2024 has seen the launch of many global bitcoin and other digital asset exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have seen some of the largest inflows of any ETF launch in history. Spot ether products are likely the next step. Hong Kong has approved the listing of exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to bitcoin and ether. The London Stock Exchange is doing the same thing, though initially for professional investors.  Some might become wistful to watch the digital asset space merge with traditional finance. However, this is a normal part of a new industry growing and maturing. Sure - we end up with an ironic outcome: for this new asset class, one of the safest/most accessible/most transparent ways to gain exposure is via ETF/ETP. At the same time, with the statistical evidence now established and the investment case for allocation difficult to ignore, expect to see digital assets increasingly resembling the traditional financial system that this novel technology was built to improve upon.  - Benjamin Dean, director, Digital Assets Strategy, WisdomTree  Ask an Expert  Q: What do the SEC 13-F filings tell us about bitcoin or ETF adoption?  A 13F is a report of stock holdings filed by an institutional investment manager with assets over $100 million. Canada’s five largest banks, TD Bank, RBC, BMO, CIBC and Scotiabank, have added an allocation of bitcoin ETF to their institutional holdings. The total exposure from the Canadian banks is over $19.9 million.  Q: Why do these ETFs matter, what does this mean?  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the spot bitcoin ETF for listing and trading in January 2024, which has attracted more participants and further enhanced liquidity in the crypto market.  Institutional and retail investors can now purchase securities representing direct exposure to the spot bitcoin market without self-custody of bitcoin.  The spot bitcoin ETFs are backed by bitcoin holdings held at regulated custodians. This arrangement relieves individual investors of the responsibility of sourcing a custodian themselves or managing self-custody, which could expose them to risks such as hacking or loss of custodian keys due to inadequate technology security measures.  Q: Owning bitcoin is risky, so why is the bank integrating this?  We are seeing the adoption of bitcoin as a legitimate asset class with large institutional investors purchasing bitcoin as an alternative investment, looking for ways to diversify their portfolio and seek returns that hedge against market volatility, all within an approved regulatory framework.  - Kevin Tam, Digital Asset Research Specialist & Senior Branch Compliance Supervisor, Raymond James Ltd.  Keep Reading  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved applications from several exchanges to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of ether.  According to SEC filings, Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF attracted 414 institutional investors in Q1 of 2024.

The political action committee's has so far supported several crypto-friendly winners in congressional primaries, often flooding the local markets with significant advertising dollars.  A $25 million donation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) hit the campaign coffers of the industry's U.S. political action committee (PAC), according to a Thursday announcement from the firm, putting the amount raised by some of crypto's biggest names at about $136 million and potentially elevating the sector to the upper echelon of campaign donors.  As Chris Dixon, the leader of a16z Crypto, was set to take the stage at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 event, his firm announced the latest donation to the Fairshake PAC. This puts a16z and Ripple at comparable levels as the leading backers of Fairshake and its affiliates. The companies have each kicked in nearly $50 million, with the next leading contributor being Coinbase Inc.  ""That's one of our many policy efforts, and we see this as a very longterm effort,"" Dixon said at the conference. ""We will be – for many years – involved in this policy. I think this is the new normal.""  If a16z's Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz are viewed as individuals – as they are in Federal Election Commission filings – their donations would land them in the current top-10 list of individual U.S. campaign contributors, according to a ranking maintained by OpenSecrets.org.  Fairshake – along with related PACs Defend American Jobs (for Republican recipients) and Protect Progress (for Democrats) – have already weighed in with millions for targeted congressional campaigns, with favored candidates from both political parties. The giving, which has frequently flooded a particular candidate with much more support than his or her opponents, has shown results in primary voting, with several crypto-friendly candidates winning those preliminary contests.  Most of the cash at Fairshake still remains on hand, according to its most recent federal filings, though the specific intentions for spending it remain undisclosed. Because the committees are so-called super PACs, they give indirectly to campaigns through ""independent expenditures"" – typically devoted to the purchase of advertising without getting clearance from the candidates. In Fairshake's case, the most significant deployment of cash was to oppose Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), who lost in California's primary.  At $136 million, the level of money being devoted to the 2024 election – so far focused only on congressional races – rivals many other major industries, including oil and gas producers and healthcare companies, and in its broader category of investment firms, the biggest crypto contributors are easily among the top 10, according to OpenSecrets.org.

42408114,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9oyw,1717081950,NYDFS Issues New Crypto Firm Guidance for Consumer Complaints,"The New York State Department of Financial Services now requires cryptocurrency service providers to implement complaint resolution mechanisms.  The regulator will assess the application and efficacy of these policies around resolving customer service requests.  New York’s top financial regulator has issued new guidance which requires cryptocurrency service providers collect relevant data to assess whether they are resolving customer service requests and complaints in a timely and fair manner, it announced Thursday.  The guidance by The New York State Department of Financial Services reflects ""expectations"" of cryptocurrency service providers to include policies which cover response and resolution monitoring, and reporting. The guidance specifically requires that service providers maintain policy records, including ""quarterly analysis of requests and complaints they receive."" The guidance also requires crypto companies to provide customers with both a phone and electronic text mechanism to submit requests and complaints.  “Consumers have a right to a transparent and timely process for resolving complaints and answering questions, irrespective of the company or product in question,” said NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris. “This guidance outlines clear expectations for a positive customer experience, which benefits both consumers and business.”  The adoption of this policy came after in-depth research which included meetings with key stakeholders, the NYDFS said.  Crypto companies must be regulated by the NYDFS to do business in New York. Harris has previously dismissed theories alleging a coordinated effort among U.S. regulators to cut the crypto industry off from the banking system, dubbed Operation Choke Point 2.0, as ""ludicrous"" and ""silly."" Last year, the NYDFS rolled out stricter guidelines for cryptocurrency listing and de-listings, requiring crypto companies to submit their coin listing and delisting policies for approval.  As of now, the NYDFS has levied over $177 million in penalties against cryptocurrency companies that did not comply with different aspects of the law, the DFS said on Thursday.

42408124,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9uqe,1717079601,"Ether Spot ETFs to See Much Lower Demand Than Bitcoin Versions, JPMorgan Says","Spot ether exchange-traded funds are likely to see much lower demand than the bitcoin ETFs, the bank said.  JPMorgan said bitcoin had the first mover advantage.  The ether funds could see inflows of as much as $3 billion this year, the report said.  The demand for spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be a lot lower than for their bitcoin {{BTC}} equivalents for a number of reasons, JPMorgan said in a research report on Thursday.  JPMorgan said it expects spot ether ETFs to attract as much as $3 billion of net inflows for the rest of this year. If staking is permitted, the figure could rise as high as $6 billion, it said.  “Bitcoin had the first mover advantage, potentially saturating the overall demand for crypto assets in response to spot ETF approvals,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  Ether ETFs are close to becoming available in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings from applicants last week. They are not yet cleared to trade because the regulator must also approve their S-1 filings before that can occur. Bitcoin ETFs began trading in January.  The bitcoin reward halving in April was an additional demand catalyst for spot bitcoin ETFs, the report said, noting that there is no similar impetus for ether in the future. The lack of staking for approved spot ether ETFs also makes these products less attractive compared with other platforms that offer staking yields, the bank said.  Ether as an application token, “differs from bitcoin in its value proposition for investors with bitcoin having a broader appeal by competing with gold in portfolio allocations,” the authors wrote.  The bank noted that less liquidity and lower assets under management (AUM) would make ether's spot ETFs less appealing to institutional investors than those of its larger rival.  The market’s initial reaction to the launch of spot ether ETFs is likely to be negative, as speculative investors who bought the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) in expectation of it being converted to an ETF are likely to take profit. ETHE could see $1 billion of outflows, putting downward pressure on ether prices, the report said.

28679009,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610612,1717079458,Crypto Analyst Predicts Top Altcoins To Make A 10x Return In 90 Days,"In his latest YouTube video titled “If I Had To 10X My Money In 90 Days, I’d Buy This Crypto Altcoin”, Miles Deutscher, renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher presented a refined outlook on altcoins he believes are positioned for significant gains in the next 90 days. Originally aiming to spotlight altcoins capable of a 20x return by the cycle’s end, Deutscher adjusted expectations based on realistic market analysis, highlighting those with the potential for a 10x increase. Altcoins With A 10x Potential Deutscher began his analysis by addressing the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the crypto markets, particularly within the altcoin sector. “A 20X return is not easy,” he explained, detailing the necessity of venturing deep into the risk curve and focusing on altcoins with smaller market caps to achieve such high returns. “You’re gonna need to go for coins in the one to $200 million market cap region, maybe $500 million to a billion,” he added. Related Reading: Mastercard Expands Crypto Reach With P2P Platform Launch Across 13 Countries Recognizing the often unpredictable nature of the crypto market, Deutscher revised his approach: “So I’m actually going to reduce this question to 10x. I think 10x is much more realistic for many alts. I like the risk reward on a 10x more, than a 20x.” Deutscher highlighted several altcoins he believes hold the potential for substantial gains: Dogwifhat (WIF): Positioned as the premier meme coin on the Solana blockchain, WIF was discussed with particular enthusiasm by the analyst. With a current market cap of around $3.7 billion, Deutscher forecasted a possible climb to $37 billion, supported by strong community backing and favorable market conditions. He cited recent price movements and community engagement as indicators of an imminent rise, “WIF is starting to break out past this level [at around $3.60] on the daily, which is super bullish.” Pepe (PEPE): Another meme coin, Pepe, was noted for its volatility and high-risk, high-reward nature by Deutscher. Despite achieving a 70x return personally, Deutscher still foresees a lot of potential. However, he also advised viewers on the strategy of taking profits progressively, underscoring the necessity to secure gains in a high-volatility environment. Prime (Gaming Sector): Turning to the gaming niche, PRIME was mentioned by the crypto analysis as a promising candidate for a 10x increase, leveraging the growing popularity and investment flowing into blockchain-based gaming. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says Market Has Begun A Macro Bullish Expansion – What This Means For Bitcoin And Altcoin Prices Fantom (Infrastructure) and AIOZ (DePin/AI): Both Fantom and AIOZ were recognized for their technological innovations and potential market growth, with Deutscher predicting feasible 10x gains due to their solid technological foundations and market positions. “Fantom (FTM) can 10x. AIOZ can 10x,” he stated. Risk Management In Crypto Importantly, Deutscher emphasized the differentiation in investment strategies based on coin type and market position. While coins like Solana and Ondo Finance might not present a 10x gain, their market leadership and stability offer lower yet significant returns, which can be crucial for maintaining balance within a diversified portfolio. “Can Solana and Ondo Finance (ONDO) 10x? Maybe not, but they’re leaders in their respective sectors. So you may be happy with a 3, 4x there. Not everything needs to be a 10x. This is what you also have to understand. Certain coins in your portfolio have a different purpose. You go in with bigger size, they’re safer. So you’re not taking on as much risk,” Deutscher explained. He also discussed riskier ventures such as Astroport, which, due to its lower market cap, presents a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. “The lower the market cap, the easier it is to pump because the less liquidity it takes to impact the price,” Deutscher noted, highlighting the speculative nature of such altcoins. At press time, WIF traded at $3.46.

Related Reading: Are Whales Sniffing Out A Deal? Ethereum Holdings Balloon To 30% – Details The most notable gainer has been the “Super Trump” (STRUMP) token, which rallied by over 200% on May 29th alone, making it one of the top trending cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. The memecoin, which first debuted on Ethereum in March, has seen its fortunes change dramatically since launching on the Solana blockchain just last weekend. Crypto analyst Tyler, who has been closely watching the space, noted: “We are not even 24 hours past the #SUPERTRUMP launch on #SOLANA and already have great support around 4 million MC. Almost 1 million in volume and up 485.970%!” Political meme coins stay hot 🔥🔥 In the past day:$TRUMP +20% to $680M$MAGA +20% to $220M$BODEN +25% to $230M$STRUMP (Super Trump) +186% to $31M The TRUMP coin on ETH is clearly leading the way and is now the 8th biggest meme coin by mc. Polifi has become too big to fade pic.twitter.com/J6onV5W9Vg — TylerD 🧙‍♂️ (@Tyler_Did_It) May 29, 2024 Trump Memecoin And The ‘PoliFi’ Phenomenon The STRUMP surge appears to be part of a broader trend within the so-called “PoliFi” (political finance) ecosystem, where tokens tied to prominent political figures and ideologies have gained significant traction among crypto investors. Other Trump-linked memecoins, such as TRUMP, MAGA, and BODEN, have also recorded massive price spikes in recent days, with gains ranging from 20% to 350%. This rally has catapulted the original TRUMP coin to become the 8th largest memecoin by market capitalization. The STRUMP project itself has emphasized its community’s deep dedication to the former president, claiming that 0.8% of its wallet is reserved for Trump. This signal of support seems to have resonated with the crypto crowd, many of whom view Trump’s pro-crypto stance as a positive driver for these types of digital assets. STRUMP Loses Steam However, the euphoria surrounding STRUMP and its peers has been short-lived, as the memecoins have since lost steam following their recent record highs. As of press time, STRUMP was trading around $0.006, roughly 50% below its peak price of $0.012 reached earlier this week. This volatility underscores the inherent risks and speculative nature of the memecoin market, where prices can fluctuate wildly based on social media trends, influencer endorsements, and other ephemeral factors. The long-term viability of these tokens remains uncertain, as regulatory scrutiny and broader market conditions could significantly impact their performance. Related Reading: Time To Stack Stellar (XLM)? Analyst Calls For Epic 500% Price Breakout Investors Bring Ideologies To The Blockchain The resurgence of Trump-linked memecoins reflects the continued fascination with the former president’s brand and the growing influence of politically-motivated investors in the cryptocurrency space.

The uptick signals a bullish outlook, Wintermute said.  Ether’s {{ETH}} price rally has stalled since Monday. Still, a popular options market gauge continues to exhibit a bullish bias.  The token's price has pulled back to $3,730 from the two-month high of $3,973 reached Monday, CoinDesk data show. Prices were on a tear last week after the U.S. SEC moved closer to approving the highly-anticipated spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Ether’s put-call open interest ratio, which compares the number of active put or bearish contracts versus bullish or call options, rose to 0.61 on Deribit early Thursday, the highest in at least a year, according to data source Glassnode.  An uptick in the ratio is said to reflect a bullish bias, although movements in the ratio are subject to interpretations.  “Ethereum’s put-call ratio has reached 0.6, signaling a bullish outlook following spot ETH ETF approvals,” algorithmic trading firm Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  A put option gives the option buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at a specific price by a stated date. Savvy traders and investors typically use options to hedge spot market positions and collect additional yield on top of coin holdings. A relatively higher number of active put options can stem from traders adding puts to protect their coin holdings (bullish spot market position) from a sudden price drop.  Another possibility is traders selling put options in a rising market to generate additional income in addition to their spot market holdings. A put option seller receives a premium as compensation for offering insurance against price drops.  The bullish interpretation of the rising ratio is consistent with positive call-put skews across time frames. As of writing, the seven-day skew stood at 2% while the 30-, 60-, 90- and 180-day skews returned a value of over 5%, according to Amberdata. That’s a sign of the relative richness of calls or bullish bets.  That said, traders should be mindful of a continued rise in the put-call open interest ratio. A very high ratio, above 1, indicates extreme bullishness and is taken to represent an impending market top by contrarian investors. Readings below 0.20 and lower indicate extreme bearishness, traditionally seen at bear market bottoms.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/30/ether-put-call-ratio-hits-one-year-high-hints-at-bullish-bias-despite-pause-in-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af5533562893e00a029eaace0996b96eacade301-1905x1072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) held its own below $68,000 during the European morning while several altcoins lost as much as 5%. BTC is priced just under $67,800 at the time of writing, practically unchanged over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) lost nearly 2%, with meme coins SHIB and DOGE leading the declines, down 5.2% and 3.7% respectively. Traders are looking toward Friday's U.S. PCE announcement, which Japanese crypto exchange bitBank warned could spell further losses. ""If the inflation data comes in hotter than expected, bitcoin could give up about a half of its gain in the past two weeks and decline to around $65,000,"" bitBank said in an email to CoinDesk.  The listing of a spot ether ETF by the end of June is ""a legit possibility,"" Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said after BlackRock filed an amended S-1 form, revealing a ""seed capital investor"" had purchased the initial shares for the proposed product. ""On May 21, 2024, the Seed Capital Investor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, subject to conditions, purchased the Seed Creation Baskets, comprising 400,000 Shares at a per-Share price equal to $25.00,"" the S-1 form showed.

The iShares Ethereum Trust ether ETF will list and trade under ""ETHA.""  The New York Stock Exchange would consider offering crypto trading if the regulatory status was clearer, the company's president said at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. Lynn Martin referred to cryptocurrency trading as ""an opportunity to look at,"" in a panel discussion on Wednesday. ""The fact that you've seen $58 billion or so come to the ETFs has been a strong sign that the market is looking for regulation in traditional structures,"" Martin said. ""So, hopefully, the [SEC] saw the inflows and said, 'Hey, this makes a lot of sense,' considering bitcoin ETFs have been a tremendous success."" NYSE's U.S.-based rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is planning to launch spot crypto trading to clients, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the yield on the U.S. two-year note is again knocking on the 5% level.  The opportunity to lock in a 5% yield and hedge against a potential U.S. economic slowdown might see investors rotate money out of risk assets and into bonds.

28674015,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610594,1717068623,MATIC In Consolidation: Key Price Levels To Watch After A Breakout,"For a while now, the price of MATIC has been in a consolidation zone, moving between $0.7730 and $0.6233, forming a bearing triangle flag in the process. This is a result of the drop from its high of $0.9288 that happened days ago which led to MATIC dropping by over 25%. Although the price of MATIC is still consolidating, it is building up momentum for a potential breakout. So taking a trade at this point is not advisable until a breakout occurs which can be either above the consolidation zone or below it. In this article, we will dive into the possible price actions when a potential breakout from the consolidation occurs. Lately, MATIC’s price and market cap have dropped, suggesting that the bulls may be waiting out this spike. As of the time of writing, MATIC’s price was down by 2.97%, trading around $0,6926 below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has decreased by over 5% in the past day to $6.91 billion. Meanwhile, its trading volume has risen to $374 million, indicating a more than 1% increase in the past day. MATIC On The 4-hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe chart, MATIC is attempting to break below the 100-day moving average, suggesting that prices might break below the consolidation zone and move bearishly. Also, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to analyze the price action in the 4-hour timeframe, we can see that the RSI line has crossed below the 50% level, heading toward the oversold zone, suggesting that the price might break below the consolidation zone. Meanwhile, in the daily time frame, it can also be observed that the price attempts to break below the bearish triangle out of the consolidation zone below the 100-day simple moving average. The 1-day RSI also suggests that the price of MATIC might break below the consolidation as the RSI signal line has broken below the 50% level and is heading toward the oversold zone. Specifically, this indicates that sellers weaken buyers in the market. With this strength of the sellers in the market, MATIC will continue to move downward when there is a break out below the consolidation zone. Potential Price Actions In The Event Of A Breakout Conclusively, if there is a break out above the consolidation zone, MATIC will continue to move upward toward the $0.9488 resistance level. If the price breaks this resistance level, it could rise even higher to test the resistance level of $1.0968. On the contrary, should MATIC’s price break below the consolidation zone, in continuation of its downtrend the price might begin to move toward the $0.5030 support level. It might continue to move downward toward the 0.3132 support level if the price breaks below this level.

The market is looking toward Friday's U.S. PCE inflation data for guidance on bitcoin's direction, with some analysts predicting a drop to as low as $60,000.  Some of the largest cryptocurrencies lost as much as 5% in 24 hours as traders looked toward Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation report in the U.S. and warned of further declines in the price of bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Meme coins shiba inu {{SHIB}} and dogecoin {{DOGE}} led the market lower, each losing about 5%. XRP, Solana’s SOL and BNB Chain’s BNB fell 2%, while the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index of the largest tokens minus stablecoins, slipped 1.6%.  Bitcoin has been testing support at $67,000 after briefly recovering to $70,000 at the start of the week. Ether {{ETH}}, which was among the biggest advancers last week after favorable regulatory decisions, has dropped over 5% since Monday.  According to the trading desk of Japanese crypto exchange bitBank, stronger-than-expected consumer sentiment and weak Treasury sales are adding to the pressure on the price of bitcoin.  “The price will likely show no clear direction until Friday’s U.S. PCE announcement, and it could be a make-or-break event for bitcoin,” bitBank said in an email. “If the inflation data comes in hotter than expected, bitcoin could give up about a half of its gain in the past two weeks and decline to around $65,000.”  FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich echoed the sentiment: “In the most bearish scenario, the price could roll back to $60,000. A more optimistic scenario suggests a decline to the $65K area, where the 50-day moving average lies,” he said in a Telegram interview.  The March figure rose 2.7% year-on-year. The April reading is due at 12:30 UTC tomorrow.  Elsewhere, on-chain analytics Glassnode recorded signs of a recovery in buyer interest in bitcoin. Long-term BTC holders, defined as those holding the asset for more than 155 days, have resumed accumulation for the first time since December 2023 after months of selling.  Traditional stock indices showed signs of weakness ahead of the inflation figure, which could provide clues on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate trajectory.

Ethereum Holdings Balloon To 30% – Details,"The past few months have seen Ethereum whales, the cryptocurrency world’s Goliaths, flexing their financial muscles. According to a recent report by Santiment, on-chain data reveals a surge in whale activity, possibly fueled by the green light for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This heightened involvement from large investors adds an additional layer of intrigue to Ethereum’s bullish momentum, suggesting growing confidence and anticipation within the market. Related Reading: Time To Stack Stellar (XLM)? Analyst Calls For Epic 500% Price Breakout A Whale Of A Time: Accumulation Anchors Ahead The SEC’s surprise approval on May 23rd of 19b-4 forms for ETF applications from heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity stirred the cryptoverse nest. This long-awaited decision, following months of radio silence from regulators, seems to have been the harbinger of a buying spree for Ethereum’s biggest players. Santiment’s report dives deep, revealing a nearly 30% increase in holdings by wallets containing at least 10,000 ETH over the past 14 months. This translates to a staggering 21 million ETH, currently valued at a cool $83 billion, scooped up by these deep-pocketed investors. With Ethereum even surpassing Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains last month, it’s no surprise that the accumulation party shows no signs of stopping. Profit Feast Before The Main Course? The data suggests a recent uptick in whale transactions exceeding $100,000 and a whopping $1 million, reaching year-to-date highs after the ETF approval. This surge in activity could be interpreted as whales taking advantage of the bullish sentiment to lock in some profits. However, Santiment suggests this might be a strategic pit stop before diving back into the buying pool. As long as these “10K+ ETH wallets are still moving north,” the report argues, Ethereum’s price has the potential to continue outperforming its bigger brother, Bitcoin, even amidst market volatility. Profitable Seas For Ethereum Sailors The good news extends beyond whale activity. An analysis by NewsBTC revealed a positive trend in daily Ethereum transactions. Measured over a seven-day moving average, the ratio of profitable transactions to those ending in a loss sits at a healthy 1.87. This indicates that for every losing trade, there are nearly two winning ones, suggesting a wave of optimism among Ethereum investors. Ethereum Price Prediction Meanwhile, the predicted yearly low Ethereum price projection for 2025 is $ 3,716, based on the historical price patterns of Ethereum and the BTC halving phases. According to predictions, Ethereum’s price could rise to $6,722 in the upcoming year. Related Reading: Dogwifhat Unstoppable: Bullish Sentiment To Propel WIF Towards $6.7 – Analyst At the moment, the price projection for Ethereum in 2025 ranges from $3,716 on the low end to $6,722 on the high side. If ETH hits the higher price objective, Ethereum’s value might increase by 80% by 2025 compared to its current value. Ethereum has surged by 100% over the past year, outpacing 50% of the top 100 crypto assets. Trading above its 200-day simple moving average, it exhibits a bullish momentum, supported by 17 green days in the last 30, representing 57% of recent trading sessions. This performance underscores Ethereum’s resilience and attractiveness to investors, bolstered by its high liquidity and negative yearly inflation rate of -0.24%, signaling potential scarcity and value appreciation.

The address has already made $200 million from its ether holdings.  DBS, the largest bank in Singapore, is an ether {{ETH}} whale, according to on-chain analytics firm Nansen.  The blockchain address – 0x9e927c02c9eadae63f5efb0dd818943c7262fb8e – supposedly owned by DBS held 173,753 ETH, worth $647 million at press time. At the time of writing, Ether changed hands at $3,730.  Nansen said that the address has made over $200 million from its ether holdings.  “In relation to the post, DBS does not have this position on our books,” a spokesperson said.  Ether is the native token of Ethereum, the world’s leading distributed computing platform for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Over the years, Ethereum has become a go-to technology for investment banks to tokenize capital markets.  The bank is not new to crypto and offers a range of services, including digital asset custody, a trading exchange for security tokens, and a portfolio management app for both traditional and crypto assets.  A recent report by the bank highlighted the growing interest in the crypto market from retail investors, high-frequency traders, and hedge funds.  Nansen's revelations of DBS' ether holdings come as the crypto market patiently awaits the debut of spot ether exchange-traded funds in the U.S., which are expected to boost the cryptocurrency's mainstream institutional adoption.

Related Reading: Time To Stack Stellar (XLM)? Analyst Calls For Epic 500% Price Breakout Dogwifhat: Recent Performance Ignites Bullish Momentum WIF has defied the odds in recent weeks, leaving its competitors in the doghouse. Over the past seven days alone, the price has shot up nearly 20%, and the past month has seen an even more remarkable 30% growth. This upward trajectory has fueled optimism within the crypto community, with many investors wagging their tails in anticipation of further gains. Breaking Through Key Barriers Renowned crypto analyst Alex Clay isn’t shy about his bullish stance on WIF. According to Clay, the recent surge signifies a potential turning point for the meme coin. WIF successfully breached a crucial resistance level, dubbed the “Key Zone” by Clay, after a strategic accumulation phase lasting 43 days. This breakthrough, Clay argues, suggests a shift in market sentiment and investor confidence. $WIF broke above the Key Zone around $3.3 after 43 Days of Accumulation🧐 Looking for a retest of the $4.4 Major Supply Zone and more upside if we do break out🚀 🎯 Target: 6.7$#dogwifhat #wif pic.twitter.com/3yLks3ycBJ — Alex Clay (@cryptclay) May 28, 2024 Clay envisions this newfound bullish momentum propelling WIF towards a “retest of the $4.4 Major Supply Zone.” Should WIF manage to conquer this resistance level, Clay boldly predicts a further ascent to a price target of a staggering $6.7. Meme Coin Frenzy: A Word Of Caution While Clay’s predictions paint a rosy picture for WIF, it’s important to remember the inherent volatility associated with meme coins. Unlike established cryptocurrencies with strong underlying utility, meme coins often rely heavily on hype and social media trends. This dependence can lead to unpredictable price swings, making them riskier investments compared to their more grounded counterparts. At the time of writing, WIF was trading at $3.52, down 10% in the last 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. WIF Price Prediction Meanwhile, based on the current analysis, Dogwifhat appears to be in a bullish trend, with a predicted price increase of 230% to reach $12.37 by June 29, 2024. The technical indicators suggest a positive sentiment among investors, supported by a Fear & Greed Index reading of 73, indicating greed in the market. Related Reading: Crystal Ball Or Crazy Talk? Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025 Despite a moderate level of price volatility at 9.90% over the last 30 days, Dogwifhat has recorded 14 out of 30 green days, indicating intermittent but overall positive price movements. This suggests that investor confidence in Dogwifhat is growing, potentially driving further price gains in the near term.

42408137,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9veF,1717052500,Chiliz's CHZ Token Pre-UEFA Euro Price Surge Revives FIFA Memories,"CHZ, the native token of the Chiliz blockchain, which powers sports token fan creator Socios.com, surges as the UEFA football championship nears.  The token doubled in value in the months before the 2022 FIFA World Cup, only to slide later.  10X Research expects the FIFA scenario to repeat itself.  A cryptocurrency, representing an intersection of blockchain and sports, has recently emerged as a source of excitement to crypto markets as major digital assets trade listless.  CHZ, the native token of the Chiliz blockchain (CHZ), which powers the largest sports fan token creator platform, Socios.com, has risen 25% in seven days, reaching a two-month high of over 15 cents. Prices hit a three-week high of 16 cents early today, according to data source Coingecko.  The double-digit price surge is the third largest among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value, including bitcoin and ether. (Notcoin and dogwifwhat are best performers).  Excitement about the upcoming 24-country Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Euro, which will be held from June 14 to July 14, seems to have amplified CHZ’s valuations. Most fan tokens are procured on Socios.com utilizing CHZ. Thus, the cryptocurrency represents the degree of interaction between fans and their favorite sports teams.  A much bigger rally unfolded in the lead-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The token doubled in value to nearly 30 cents through the summer of 2022, topping out a day before the global sporting event, which kicked off on November 20, 2022. Prices tanked nearly 40% in December that year.  10X Research expects the FIFA scenario to repeat itself, ensuring more gains for CHZ by mid-June and a potential sell-off afterward.  “The Chiliz (CHZ) token rallied over 100% from the summer of 2022 until one day before the FIFA World Cup started on November 20, 2022 (lasted until December 18, 2022). Only to then decline by -60% one day before the start of the FIFA Soccer World Cup (from November 19, 2022). Markus Thielen, founder of 10X, said in a note to clients.  “This scenario might repeat itself. A slightly smaller version than the World Cup of 2022, the UEFA European Football Championship will be held from June 14, 2024, to July 14, 2024, with teams from 24 countries competing,” Thielen noted, adding that the company usually promotes its token around these events.  In general, sports tokens are vulnerable to “buy the rumor, sell the news” tendencies, representing a pre-event period of optimism and price rallies and subsequent price declines, a recent study titled “Anticipatory Gains and Event-Driven Losses in Blockchain-Based Fan Tokens: Evidence from the FIFA World Cup,” published in Research in International Business and Finance, revealed.  Football events are known to boost consumption and economic activity in Europe. A 2019 paper found a relevant direct statistical link between the market value of regional football clubs in Europe and the economic performance of the respective regions.  The availability of fan tokens and blockchains like Chiliz has made it easier to price in and measure sporting events' financial and economic impact.",POSITIVE,CHZ,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | CHZ,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/30/chilizs-chz-token-pre-uefa-euro-price-surge-revives-fifa-memories,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65d822f9f7bf53d8c6e053970c850ef6b21d07dc-1682x1122.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28665323,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610547,1717052102,"Eye On $91,500: Key Bitcoin Level Could Trigger Massive Surge, Analyst Warns","In a technical analysis shared by noted crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz on the social platform X, there appears to be a significant bullish sentiment building around Bitcoin, particularly if it surpasses the crucial $72,000 mark. Olszewicz, leveraging both the Ichimoku Cloud and Fibonacci extensions, illustrates a scenario where breaking this key resistance level could catapult Bitcoin towards a target of $91,500. Here’s How Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $91,500 The analysis utilizes the Ichimoku Cloud, a complex technical indicator that provides insights into the market’s momentum, trend direction, and potential areas of support and resistance over different time frames. Currently, Bitcoin’s price action is depicted as being in a bullish phase, situated above the cloud. This positioning above the cloud is traditionally viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting a strong uptrend with robust support levels formed by the cloud’s lower boundaries. In the Ichimoku setup, the conversion line (Tenkan-sen) and the baseline (Kijun-sen) cross occasionally, providing buy or sell signals based on their intersection relative to the cloud. As of the latest chart, the conversion line recently crossed above the baseline, reinforcing the bullish outlook depicted by the cloud’s positioning. Related Reading: Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfer: CryptoQuant Analyzes Potential Market Effects Of The $9.4B Movement Adding another layer to the technical narrative, Fibonacci extension levels have been plotted from a significant low at $56,485.87 up to a high, providing potential targets and resistance levels. The 0.5 Fibonacci extension level is marked at $63,727.40, already surpassed by the current price trajectory. The 1.0 extension finds itself at $71,897.29, closely aligning with the analyst’s noted pivotal level of $72,000. Beyond this, the 1.618 extension at $83,456.87 represents a lucrative first price target, while the ultimate 2.0 extension looms at $91,513.53. A key observation is the volume profile, which shows a declining trend in trading volume. This decreasing volume can often indicate a period of accumulation, as less selling pressure allows prices to stabilize and potentially build a base for an upward breakout. The declining volume trend line underpins the consolidation phase seen in recent months, suggesting that a sharp movement could be imminent once accumulation concludes. Related Reading: Whales Push Bitcoin Into Narrow Consolidation Range: What To Expect Next Olszewicz’s emphatic remark, “BTC: when this baby hits $72k you’re going to see some serious shit,” underscores the high stakes associated with this resistance level. This is not merely a technical observation but a signal to the market that once $72,000 is decisively broken, the path to much higher levels becomes increasingly probable. Such a breakout would likely activate a flurry of trading activity, as both retail and institutional investors might see it as a confirmation of a sustained upward trend, potentially pushing the price towards the $91,500 mark indicated by the 2.0 Fibonacci extension. At press time, BTC traded at $67,783.

28657449,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610522,1717036214,Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfer: CryptoQuant Analyzes Potential Market Effects Of The $9.4B Movement,"Mt. Gox, the defunct Bitcoin (BTC) exchange that suffered a major collapse in 2014 has recently initiated payout distribution to creditors waiting for it. The release of a substantial amount of BTC, equivalent to $9.4 billion, on May 27th has raised concerns about potential market liquidity and price stability. In response, the on-chain market intelligence platform CryptoQuant has provided an analysis of the potential impacts of this development. Potential Market Effects According to the firm’s analysis, 138,000 Bitcoin moved significantly from Mt. Gox in seven transactions, each worth 4,000 to 32,000 Bitcoin. Initially, these funds were transferred to a single address and distributed to three separate addresses, each holding 47,400 Bitcoin. It is important to note that these addresses remain under the control of Mt. Gox’s Rehabilitation Trustee, and no repayments to creditors have been made as of yet. The consolidation of these funds suggests that the Trustee is actively preparing for future repayments by the Rehabilitation Plan. Related Reading: ‘Solana Is For Baddies’: Rapper Iggy Azalea Joins The Controversial Celebrity Token Frenzy At present, transfers within the Trustee-controlled addresses have not impacted the market immediately. However, the firm notes that eventual repayment to creditors, targeted for completion by October 31, 2024, could influence Bitcoin’s market dynamics. For CryptoQuant, the market impact will depend on various factors, including the timing, size, and manner of the repayments. If and when the Trustee begins repaying creditors, it could introduce a substantial amount of Bitcoin into the market, influencing liquidity and price stability. The firm concluded by stating: There is no immediate selling pressure for Bitcoin from these movements as the transfers have occurred within the addresses of the same entity (Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Trustee) and are not still available to the open market. Bitcoin Price Gravitates Towards ‘Level 3’ At $91,000 As concerns grow over the potential downside impact on Bitcoin’s price due to Mt. Gox’s repayment plan, analyst Crypto Con offers insights into the current state of Bitcoin price bands. Bitcoin price bands refer to specific price ranges that analysts closely monitor to gauge potential market movements. These bands act as magnets, attracting the price to specific levels. In particular, as seen in the chart above, “Level 3” at $91,539 has emerged as a significant price target. Despite the ongoing consolidation at Level 2.5, the analyst believes the market is showing signs of gravitating towards Level 3. Additionally, Crypto Con notes that historical data suggests that the cycle top band, priced at $123,000, will likely be reached with precision during the final “Bitcoin parabola.” Related Reading: Solana Remains Institutional Investors’ Favorite, YTD Flows Ramp Up To $29 Milion At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency in the market was trading at $67,400, slowly losing ground after continued failed attempts to consolidate above the ley $70,000 level, which is seen as the last hurdle before a potential retest of its current all-time high of $73,700 reached on March 14.

With several growth initiatives and an impressive CEO, I am looking to add to my position on material pullbacks. The Company is investing in the manufacture of its own mining rigs and mining chips, among other investments. Not being a pure play crypto miner, the Company faces material execution risks as it tries to implement its various growth initiatives. Introduction Continuing my coverage of the Bitcoin miners, in this article I am reviewing Bitdeer Technologies Group ( BTDR ) ("" Bitdeer "" or the "" Company ""). Up approximately 40% over the last six months (as of May 28th), I believe the Company is currently a HOLD. I initiated a small position in Bitdeer at the end of April (just below $5.50) as part of an ""invest and investigate"" strategy. In this regard, I like a lot of what I see in Bitdeer; in particular: 1) growing earnings and a growing crypto portfolio, 2) growing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ("" Bitcoin "") production, 3) growth initiatives and expansion plans, 4) increasing shareholder equity with very modest shareholder dilution, and 5) a CEO with a good track record, as well as a commitment to the success of Bitcoin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following factors are keeping me on the sideline for the moment: (1) the recent increase in the Bitdeer share price, (2) the increased costs associated with the recent Bitcoin Halving (the effects of which will be reflected in the second quarter earnings report) (the "" Halving ""), and (3) the execution risks associated with the Company's ambitious growth plans. Should Bitdeer pullback materially, however, I am likely to add to my position as I continue to investigate the company -- the Company being a lot more complex than pure play crypto miners. Background Per the ""Investor Relations"" section of its website , Bitdeer is ""a world-leading technology company for blockchain and high-performance computing."" According to the website, the Company provides comprehensive computing solutions for its customers, including equipment procurement, transport logistics, datacenter design and construction, equipment management and daily operations. The Company also offers advanced cloud capabilities to customers with high demand for artificial intelligence. Finally, the company is investing in the manufacture of its own crypto mining machines (or rigs), as well as the semiconductor chips for use in such machines, for its own use and for sale and lease to third parties. Founded in 2018, the Company is headquartered in Singapore. Its datacenters can be found in the United States, Norway and Bhutan. The Company's Founder and Chairman is Jihan Wu. A Chinese Billionaire , Mr. Wu is the co-founder of Bitmain, a privately owned company headquartered in Beijing, China. Bitmain designs application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips for bitcoin mining. When Bitmain was thought to be going public in 2021, it was speculated that Bitmain would fetch a valuation of up to $50 Billion . Notably, Mr. Wu is also a translator of the Bitcoin whitepaper into Chinese. The Company has a workforce of approximately 200 employees, roughly a quarter of whom pursue Bitdeer's R&D efforts. Per its third quarter 2023 financial report , the majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from its three business lines: 1) Self-mining refers to cryptocurrency mining for the Company’s own balance sheet, allowing it to capture the appreciation potential of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin. 2) Hash Rate Sharing , including the Cloud Hash Rate business. For this business line, the Company offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers under certain contractual arrangements. 3) Hosting business is the Company's one-stop mining machine hosting solution for third party mining customers, including deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining. The business line first started generating revenue in the second half of 2022. By the Numbers Stock Performance As the chart below shows, since going public on the NASDAQ in April 2023 (through May 28, 2024), Bitdeer's stock performance has severely lagged the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) (the "" Miners Index ""). Seeking Alpha Over the past six months (as of May 28, 2024), however, as shown in the chart below, Bitdeer's stock has performed well, although it has still trailed the Miners Index. Seeking Alpha Notably, Bitdeer is included in the Miners Index , with a robust 6.06% weighting therein (full disclosure: I use the Miners Index as a trading vehicle, but sold my entire position the Friday before the Memorial Day holiday weekend). Revenue and Earnings Trends For the year ended December 31, 2023, Bitdeer reported results which compared favorably to its results for 2022. BITDEER Q1/24 2023 2022 Revenue (millions) 119.5 368.6 333.3 GAAP Net Earnings (millions) 0.6 (56.6) (60.3) Bitcoin Mined (self mining) 911 3,694 2,113 Source: Full Year Financial Report (the "" 2023 Annual Report "") and Q1/24 Quarterly Report (the "" Q1 2024 Report "") For 2024, revenues are tracking at a $378 million pace based on first quarter numbers, a few percent above 2023's tally. Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 did turn positive (on a GAAP basis), which is a very good development for Bitdeer. Bitcoin mined is tracking about even with 2023, which is not necessarily a bad thing given the increase in the Bitcoin price since the start 2024. That said the effects of the Halving were not felt in Q1 2024 numbers, and those effects, which will be included in the financial reporting going forward, could be material. See the Risks section of this article below for more about the Halving. Of its three major business lines, on a year over year basis (fiscal year end 2023 compared to 2022), (1) self mining revenue increased 79.1%, due in part to the company's Gedu, Bhuatan datacenter being brought on-line in the second half of 2023; (2) membership hosting revenue increased by over 200% due to capacity only starting to come on-line in the second half of 2022 (i.e., 2023 was a full year and 2022 was only a partial year so the comparison is not apples to apples); and (3) cloud hash rate revenue declined 44.1% due to a decline in subscriptions. Source: 2023 Annual Report (linked earlier) . Q1 2024 Financial Highlights Per the Q1 2024 Report (linked earlier): Total revenue was US$119.5 million for Q1 2024, compared to US$72.6 million in Q1 2023. Net income was US$0.6 million for Q1 2024, compared to a net loss of US$9.5 million in Q1 2023. Adjusted profit was US$8.4 million for Q1 2024, compared to US$2.8 million in Q1 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was US$26.0 million for Q1 2024, compared to US$18.5 million in Q1 2023. Overall, Bitdeer's revenue and earnings trends are favorable, but they might be hard to maintain and like many of the other crypto miners, the Company still has a lot to prove. Summarizing the first quarter results, Linghui Kong, Chief Business Officer of Bitdeer, commented, We sustained our growth momentum in the first quarter of 2024, as we increased our total revenue by 64.6% on an annual basis and generated a net income of US$0.6 million, despite incurring a US$14.1 million one-off incremental development expense related to our SEAL01 chip . During the first quarter we mined 911 Bitcoins, representing an increase of 65.0% from a year ago. Our strategic plan to expand our hash rate by approximately 3.4EH/s by the end of this year remains on course, and we are making steady progress with the manufacturing of our SEALMINER A1 rigs. We expect that trial production will start in May 2024.... Designs for the second-generation machines are advancing, with [roll] out potentially commencing in the second quarter of this year and wafer ordering for mass production potentially beginning in the third quarter of this year. We anticipate that these next generation miners will deliver even greater efficiency than their predecessors. In the meantime, we continue to develop our AI cloud service . The significant interest we are observing in the space reaffirms our confidence in its potential for growth. In terms of our infrastructure, construction of our Jigmeling datacenter in Bhutan started during the first quarter of 2024 . Notably, we remain on track to complete expansion of our mining facilities in Norway, the United States, and Bhutan in 2025."" [Source: Q1 2024 Report. Bold emphasis added in order to highlight the Company's various growth initiatives.] Liquidity and Liabilities As is shown in the table below, as of March 31, 2024, Bitdeer has over $118 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, along with a growing digital assets portfolio (valued at more than $25 million). Meanwhile, total liabilities of the Company have declined roughly 10% over the 15-month period ending March 31, 2024. While Bitdeer's cash position has been reduced materially since the end of 2022, I am encouraged that the company is pursuing several growth initiatives with that cash, as was highlighted in the quote from the Chief Business Officer earlier in the article. Of course, those growth opportunities do come with risks. (in millions) BITDEER Cash & Equivalents (March 31, 2024) 118.5 Cash & Equivalents (December 31, 2023) 144.7 Cash & Equivalents (December 31, 2022) 231.3 Bitcoin/Digital Assets (March 31, 2024) 26.1 Bitcoin/Digital Assets (Dec. 31, 2023) 15.3 Bitcoin/Digital Assets (Dec. 31, 2022) 2.1 Total Liabilities (March 31, 2024) 299.6 Total Liabilities (December 31, 2023) 306.8 Total Liabilities (December 31, 2022) 330.1 Bitdeer Source: 2023 Annual Report and Bitdeer Quarterly Results Filings Shareholder Equity In the table below, we can see that Bitdeer is slowly but surely creating shareholder value, and that trajectory accelerated in the first quarter of 2024 (as the price of Bitcoin rose). Period Total Equity March 31, 2024 (millions) $391.35 December 31, 2023 (millions) $332.57 December 31, 2022 (millions) $318.34 Source Bitdeer: Q1 2024 Report and 2023 Annual Report Shareholder Dilution Compared to many of the other Bitcoin miners I follow, Bitdeer, with its modest increase in shares outstanding, is shareholder friendly on a relative basis. Date No. of Common Shares Outstanding (Company) 12/31/2021 108,681,000 12/31/2022 108,681,000 12/31/2023 110,494,000 Source: 2023 Annual Report Filing (Foreign Issuer) Risks Risks of investing in Bitdeer are included in the 2023 Annual Report (linked above). Moreover, the crypto mining industry is a highly competitive industry, highly dependent on the prices of Bitcoin and electricity, and subject to anti-crypto policies and sentiment of powerful politicians, including Elizabeth Warren . The Halving has occurred and it has had the effect of (1) reducing Bitcoin's mining rewards from approximately 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC and (2) causing a lower hash rate, in each case, making it more difficult for the miners to generate revenue (unless the price of Bitcoin and the price of mining transaction fees rise from here); however, we will not see the true effects of the Halving until the company reports its second quarter of 2024 results. Bitdeer, as a foreign company, brings with it certain risks, including different reporting requirements than U.S. companies. In this regard, I prefer analyzing U.S. crypto miners because it is easier to track the financial data. With respect to Bitdeer, one also wonders whether its Chinese CEO needs to stay in the good graces of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been known to be unfriendly to both billionaires (e.g., Jack Ma, former CEO of Alibaba ( BABA )) and the crypto industry . With its cash and crypto portfolio, Bitdeer is not currently reliant on capital markets, but that could change pretty quickly should the price of Bitcoin decline materially, which it is known to do with dramatic flair from time to time. There is no guarantee that Bitdeer will be able to raise money in the capital markets should it need to do so. Bitdeer is a capital intensive business and depreciation of its mining machines is one of largest costs incurred by Bitdeer each year. Depreciation of mining machines is directly tied to the purchase price of these machines, the costs of which have been rising materially, particularly for the most efficient machines. As was highlighted above, Bitdeer is advancing several growth initiatives, and there is no guarantee that the Company will execute according to plan or otherwise earn an acceptable return on investment with regard to these initiatives. Conclusions Bitdeer is a complicated company, but it is executing reasonably well as witnessed by GAAP profitability in the first quarter of 2024. Moreover, from my vantage point, its growing shareholder equity without material dilution point to a company that is shareholder friendly. Nonetheless, at this juncture, I need to see the success of some the Company's growth initiatives, or for there to be a material pullback in the stock price (or some combination thereof), before I add to my position. As such, and for the reasons set forth in this article, Bitdeer is a HOLD in my view.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696338-keeping-a-close-watch-on-bitdeer-technologies?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28655189.jpeg

28654492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610499,1717030838,Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Resist Selling Amid Recent Highs — What This Signals,"As Bitcoin flirts with its previous all-time highs, the celebrated ‘diamond hands’—a term in crypto parlance denoting long-term holders (LTHs)—are demonstrating notable restraint, selling their holdings at a rate notably lower than in previous bull markets. According to a recent analysis by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, despite the near $70,000 valuation, the selling pressure from these seasoned investors remains subdued. Related Reading: Crystal Ball Or Crazy Talk? Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025 Bitcoin Diamond Hands Loyalty Amid Highs The phenomenon of ‘diamond hands’ holding firm as Bitcoin reaches significant price levels is not new but remains a cornerstone of market stability. These LTHs, defined by Glassnode as wallets holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, display investment maturity that underpins the market’s resilience. Even with Bitcoin’s price hovering around $67,722—down 3.5% over the past week but still up slightly by 0.6% in the last 24 hours—these investors are not rushing to cash out. Additionally, Glassnode’s report highlights that long-term holders are yet to reach the point of selling that typically precedes a market downturn. The market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, a reliable metric to gauge the profitability of long-held Bitcoins, indicates that many LTHs are sitting on substantial unrealized profits. Historically, LTHs begin to sell once this ratio hits particular highs, which has not yet occurred despite the recent peak. Interestingly, during the surge to $73,800 in March—the latest all-time high—long-term holders were not the primary sellers. Glassnode pointed out that only a modest 519k BTC was sold by LTHs during this period, considerably less than in previous bull runs, where monthly sales approached nearly one million BTC. Of this, 519k BTC sold, “20% originated from Grayscale ETF holders,” as reported by Glassnode. This restrained selling behavior is significant, suggesting a strategic approach to holding and a belief in further price appreciation. The Future Holds Optimism Moving forward, Glassnode anticipates that LTHs will continue to play a pivotal role in the market dynamics. Their recent behavior indicates a shift towards re-accumulation following significant distribution around the $73k all-time high. Such patterns underscore a sophisticated strategy: Bitcoin’s most steadfast supporters may be gearing up for another run, anticipating higher peaks beyond current levels.

The analyst suggested that the second-largest meme coin by market cap could be coming for Dogecoin’s position soon enough, given its recent bullish strength. Shiba Inu Is Poised To Rip Through The Charts Cold Blooded Shiller mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he believes Shiba Inu will soon “send,” meaning that the meme coin will soon experience a parabolic move to the upside. He noted that Shiba Inu’s performance has been “unusual” over the last few days. Based on his technical analysis, he claimed that Shiba Inu is “positioned very well” on the higher time frame (HTF). Related Reading: $2.9 Billion In Mt. Gox Bitcoin On The Move For The First Time In 5 Years, Where Is It Headed? On the lower time frame, the crypto analyst added that Shiba Inu has “been very strong” compared to Dogecoin, which he noted isn’t “typical.” Cold Blooded Shiller also remarked that Shiba Inu has had one of the quickest and strongest market recoveries in the last 24 hours. Indeed, Shiba Inu’s performance in the last 24 hours has been impressive. The meme coin has experienced a price gain of over 13% in the last 24 hours, which has caused it to overtake Cardano and climb into the tenth spot among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Crypto analyst and influencer Ansem also suggested that this is just the beginning of Shiba Inu’s price rally, stating that the meme coin is about to get “jiggy” while sharing a chart that hinted at an imminent price breakout for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu’s rise is believed to be due to several factors, including the sentiment around the Ethereum Spot ETFs. Ethereum-based tokens are bound to benefit from the hype around these funds. Coinbase International Exchange also recently announced that it will add support for Shiba Inu perpetual on its platform starting May 30th. The recent market trend has also contributed to Shiba Inu’s double-digit rally, with meme coins arguably the leading narrative at the moment. This is why other meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) have also recorded significant price gains lately, up 9% and 33%, respectively, in the last seven days. SHIB Team Reacts To Price Gain Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie, reacted to Shiba Inu flipping Cardano. She attributed the meme coin’s success largely to the SHIB community, noting that the “incredible milestone wouldn’t be possible without the amazing support from our community.” Lucie also highlighted the developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem as another factor that has helped the meme coin rise to become the 10th-largest crypto token by market cap.
