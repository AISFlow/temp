42379321,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SPB,1490047813,"After New Highs, Ethereum Returns to Rangebound Trading","Following a string of new all-time highs last week, the price of ether has returned to a tighter trading range to begin the week.  The price of ether, which powers the smart contract-based blockchain ethereum, reached an all-time high of $55.11 on 17th March, nearly 100% higher than its price of roughly $28 on 14th March, according to CoinMarketCap.  Yet, since then, its price has changed direction, falling more than 40% to $31.70 the following day and then rallying nearly 50% to $47 yesterday.  According to analysts, the boost has been largely driven by the growing fears that the bitcoin network could split into two separate blockchains, resulting in two different bitcoin tokens that would be independently traded.  ""This is not really about ethereum, which has had little news recently,"" cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""It's all about the bitcoin train wreck, and the growing awareness among investors about ether as an alternative.""  Eliosoff was not the only market observer to point to bitcoin’s challenges.  Vinny Lingham, an investor and entrepreneur, stated that ""concern over a hard fork"" in bitcoin is one factor that has led to an increase in ether prices.  Rush the exit  Yet, not everyone believes that ether is winning all of the funds exiting bitcoin's more bearish market.  Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment firm Binary Financial, noted that while ether may be winning funds from traders who would otherwise withdraw into fiat currencies, traders are taking this option as well.  ""When bitcoin bounced, there was a lot more ether selling and bitcoin buying,"" Yeh noted.  Now, he said most money is exiting the crypto market to more traditional assets.  Martin Garcia, vice president of Genesis Trading, also emphasized that ether's lack of liquidity could have very easily fueled the digital currency's recent volatility.  He told CoinDesk that:  ""You have very little liquidity so the price fluctuations tend be severe.""

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) published an ""information sheet"" today that offers a way for businesses and startups to assess whether their uses of distributed ledgers would bring them under the agency's jurisdiction.  Information Sheet 219  's purpose, according to ASIC, is to spark additional dialogue between regulators and the private sector, in a bid to ""fast track any discussions those entities choose to have with ASIC about their potential regulatory obligations"".  The agency said in an explainer released alongside the documentation:  ""Although DLT is still an emerging technology, we have given, and will continue to give, considerable thought to regulatory issues that may arise if you are contemplating using DLT for your business. This information sheet is designed to help you better understand the regulatory considerations we have identified.""  Additionally, ASIC detailed a 12-month exemption for eligible small businesses that serve up to 100 retail clients. These businesses will not be required to apply or hold any Australian Financial Services (AFS) license during those early stages of operation, the agency said.  The release is perhaps unsurprising, as it comes more than a year after ASIC chief Greg Medcraft remarked that blockchain ""will have profound implications for how we regulate"".  ""As regulators and policy makers, we need to ensure what we do is about harnessing the opportunities and the broader economic benefits – not standing in the way of innovation and development,"" Medcraft said at the time.

42379309,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87S8p,1490029599,Coinbase Targets Institutional Traders With Margin Feature Launch,"Coinbase's GDAX digital asset exchange has added a new margin trading feature.  The startup announced today that eligible customers can now trade with up to three times leverage in markets for bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin. According to Coinbase, the addition arose in light of rising institutional interest for such features.  With the launch, GDAX becomes the second US-based exchange to offered leveraged trading services after Kraken – though Coinbase said that residents in Wyoming, Hawaii and Minnesota won't be able to use them. Further, the exchange is limiting access to leveraged trading to select participants.  Adam White, head of GDAX, said in a statement:  ""We are excited to launch a margin feature that meets the high demands of professional traders while addressing federal and state regulatory requirements. We believe this feature will attract a new wave of institutional clients, ultimately reducing volatility and supporting growth of the digital asset industry.""  Access to ether-denominated margin trading won't be immediately available for traders in New York, but the company said that this support would be extended in the future. Further, each leveraged market will have a margin funding limit, capping the potential size of each trade.  The launch comes more than two years after GDAX first opened.

A moderator for AlphaBay – one of the world's most popular dark markets, according to data from DeepDotWeb – took to Reddit over the weekend to announce that it would integrate ether payments beginning on 1st May.  According to a PGP-signed moderator post on the AlphaBayMarket subreddit, recent price increases drove the integration decision.  The moderator wrote:  ""We are currently laying out the framework to make ETH acceptance possible, and we will enable ethereum deposits and withdrawals starting May 1st, 2017. Vendors wishing to accept ethereum can edit their listings and set the 'Accept ETH' to 'On' in order to be able to be paid in ethereum.""  It's not the first time the market has looked to digital currencies beyond bitcoin for listing. AlphaBay previously made waves in August 2016 when the market announced the integration of privacy-centric digital currency monero as a payment.  The moderator indicated that other platform upgrades are pending.  ""We have plenty of new stuff in the works, so expect more updates in the near future,"" they said.

42379310,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SA5,1490021798,Bitcoin Exchange Trial Ends With Two Convictions,"Two individuals connected to the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx have been convicted following a trial in New York.  A Manhattan jury sided with the prosecution in convicting Coin.mx operator Yuri Lebedev and Pastor Trevon Gross. Both Lebedev and Gross had been charged with bribery and conspiracy charges, while Lebedev was also tried on bank fraud and wire fraud charges. No sentencing date has yet been set, according to a report from Reuters.  Lebedev and Coin.mx operator Anthony Murgio were arrested and charged in 2015 after the exchange's closure, which operated in Florida and allegedly served as a conduit for cybercrime funds. The exchange was also connected to a string of cybercrimes, including a 2014 data breach at JPMorgan Chase which exposed the personal data of tens of millions of customers.  Pastor Trevon Gross was accused of taking $150k in bribes for his role in using a New Jersey credit union to help the exchange process payments. Regulators later moved to shutter that exchange.  Defense attorneys for Gross and Lebedev claimed during the trial that their clients did not know that Coin.mx was running an illegal operation.  Murgio, who plead guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January, is scheduled to be sentenced in June.

42379306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87S53,1490013015,Bitcoin Unlimited: Mining Power Should Determine Hard Fork,"Despite escalating fears that bitcoin could soon undergo a long and messy software upgrade, a developer group at the center of the debate took steps today to allay fears that such an event would be disruptive to the market.  In statements to CoinDesk, the Bitcoin Unlimited software development team, one of several groups seeking to introduce alternative software to the network, said today that it is encouraging bitcoin exchanges to list whichever blockchain is backed by most proof of work as 'BTC', the common designation for bitcoin.  ""We at Bitcoin Unlimited are promoting ... improvements to bitcoin's anti-fragility qualities through further decentralization. One aspect of this is removing central planning from block size economics,"" the statement reads.  It continues:  ""In the unlikely case of a blockchain split, we are not terribly concerned what exchanges decide to list the two tickers as in terms of name, however we strongly advise that exchanges observe Nakamoto Consensus: the chain with most proof-of-work IS the bitcoin currency unit (currently known as BTC or XBT). We are encouraged that exchanges are well prepared for the event of a blockchain split and that this will result in the market deciding which bitcoin will be the most useful and thus valuable in the long term.""  The statements follow a decision by nearly 20 bitcoin exchanges last week to clarify how they would handle listings in the event new software was introduced that created two competing bitcoin assets trading on two divergent blockchains (or versions of its transaction history).  The exchanges indicated at the time that they could not ""wait for a winner to emerge"" given the pressures of a 24-hour market.  In their statement, the companies, which provide buy and sell functionality for bitcoin, indicated they would designate the software versions powered by Bitcoin Core as 'BTC' even if Bitcoin Unlimited had garnered more hashing power from miners (the entities that add transactions to the network and enforce transaction history).  While exchanges said the statement was meant to position the industry sector as one that is open to a free-market decision on how to define bitcoin, it is not been seen by all as neutral.  Defining bitcoin?  At issue in the escalating debate is not only a technical disagreement about how best to increase the software's transaction capacity, but the ideological merits underlying such a decision.  As evidenced by the letter and response, this includes disagreement over who has the authority to enforce any consensus on project parameters (including which project would win designation as 'bitcoin', if any).  Bitcoin Unlimited is arguing that, since miners provide security to the blockchain, these entities should determine the outcome of the decision.  ""Bitcoin is defined by the chain of valid transactions with the most proof-of-work,"" Bitcoin Unlimited developer Peter Rizun said.  Still, others associated with the group suggested that they believe such measures are unlikely. Should most major miners migrate to a new blockchain, wallets, exchanges and users would follow suit, argued bitcoin investor and Bitcoin Unlimited backer Roger Ver.  ""The first block that is bigger than 1MB is likely to be a non-event,"" Ver said.  Culture clash  The comments put Bitcoin Unlimited at odds with statements from members within Bitcoin Core, the software program's long-time developer group.  In recent days, some members of this community have stated their position that it is the so-called 'bitcoin economy', made up of users, exchanges and wallets that add value to a blockchain.  Miners, they contend, were originally envisioned as mere desktop computers and never meant to be actors that forced decision-making or dictate the technology's direction.  As for how miners see the events, that consensus is less clear. In statements, ViaBTC chief executive Haipo Yang told CoinDesk that major miners are still in wait-and-see mode, but that most are now considering alternative softwares.  To date, major mining firms, including Bitmain's Antpool, have expressed a desire to run software that would signal for larger blocks. This has, in turn, put pressure on other China-based miners, as Bitmain remains one of the largest providers of hashing power in an industry that has seen rapid consolidation.  Adding to the drama is that, since launching their campaign, Bitcoin Unlimited has suffered two notable software bugs, prompting discussion on the ability of the software to meet market needs.

42379320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SLP,1490009457,"G20 Should Create Central Bank Blockchain Consortium, Report Says","Blockchain is key for an inclusive, transparent and accountable digital economy in G20 countries, according to a new report published by the international economic forum.  Notably, the work's author raises the possibility of G20 creating a ""central banks blockchain consortium"", intended to study possible blockchain-based national fiat currencies.  Penned by Julie Maupin, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), the report was featured as part of the organization's 'Policy Briefs', which feature recommendations on areas of interest to G20 policymakers.  Overall, the eight-page report contends that by harnessing blockchain, G20 countries can provide solutions to two geopolitical challenges:  The first is negativity surrounding cross-border trade and the general distrust in institutions that structure the global economy.  The second is the risk of increasing fragmentation of the global economy caused by anti-globalization sentiments.  Maupin writes:  ""Blockchain usage tends toward a more decentralized and democratic order which empowers individuals to participate in the global economy directly through systemically embedded transparency, accountability and inclusiveness mechanisms.""  Blockchain use cases  To make this a reality, Maupin argues the G20 should organize a research group to identify which regulatory regimes can be made more efficient through the use of blockchain, and promote a 'sandbox' to test the most promising concepts related to blockchain use cases.  Recommended use cases include financial services for the unbanked, global supply integration for women-owned businesses, alternative clean energy financing and digital identity privacy and management services.  Finally, the report proposes a plan of action including a G20 partnership with other transnational regulatory bodies focused on blockchain related issues of global concern, including the International Standards Organization (ISO), the International Law Association, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

42379308,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87S7Z,1490000476,"China, Blockchain & The Holy Grail of Marketplace Lending","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  When one of the world's largest corporations gets together with one of its largest peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders, you can almost hear the market sit up.  That's what happened last week, when Chinese conglomerate Foxconn joined forces with P2P lender Dianrong to launch a blockchain platform for working capital. The benefits to supply chains are clear: smoother cash flows for suppliers will strengthen their liquidity, lower their costs and avoid delays in delivery due to lack of funding.  What is being largely overlooked, however, is the huge impact this development could have on a different sector: finance.  According to Dianrong, millions of small suppliers do not have access to bank finance, meaning they have had to rely on invoice payments or private loans to fund working capital. The massive, latent demand for alternative financing (combined with investors' hunger for returns) partially explains the country's explosive growth in marketplace lending. (Today, China has the largest P2P sector in the world, with more than 2,400 platforms.)  But, the industry is currently undergoing a shake-up.  A combination of high-profile scandals, intensifying regulation and an increasing default rate is encouraging a contraction in the number of platforms. A multi-agency government report released last month went so far as to warn that as many as 90% are likely to close over the coming months.  Changing outlook  Should this change occur as projected, investment is likely to migrate to the stronger P2P lenders, shrinking the pool of potential borrowers.  Unlike most of their younger and smaller peers, reputable marketplace finance providers rely on credit scores, a practice that tends to exclude small businesses with little data and no collateral. More funds chasing fewer opportunities will lower the potential returns and weaken the profitability of the sector as a whole.  Introduce a new segment of borrowers, though, and the outlook changes.  The opportunity to lend to entities with a better-than-average risk profile at a reasonable return is the 'holy grail' of marketplace lending.  Businesses are generally safer bets than individuals, especially if they have validated invoices in hand. As such, the appearance of a platform that not only gathers these borrowers, but can also verify their activity and projected income could open up new opportunities for lenders.  In addition, the effects of smoothing cash flows all along a supply chain are bound to boost performance and production, which should increase demand for financing.  Ripple effects  The result will probably be an even greater inflow of funds into the sector as its reputation improves.  Furthermore, a greater concentration of marketplace lending activity and a more reliable flow of available data would make it easier for regulators to shine a light on 'shadow banking'. This could accelerate the shift away from traditional finance and blur the boundaries between the two.  The emergence of a new outlet for funds could even end up affecting international capital flows.  As bitcoin exchanges have learned, China's central bank has long been struggling to stem the tide of money moving outside of the country in search of better returns. An appealing domestic alternative that has the added benefit of boosting manufacturing is likely to attract the support of the authorities, ushering financial and strategic incentives for platforms and borrowers.  And, of course, there's the impact on blockchain development.  The alternative lending sector is still a tiny part of the overall economy, and blockchain is today a minuscule part of that. But, there are no small numbers in Chinese finance.  Although the project was designed for supply chains, its eventual effects could follow the law of unintended consequences, shaping trends in finance and beyond.

42379305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87S3n,1489982559,IBM Goes Live With First Commercial Blockchains,"Tech giant IBM is set to unveil what it's calling the first ""commercial application"" of Hyperledger’s open-source Fabric codebase.  Previously released in beta and scheduled for official release today, the offering – dubbed ""IBM Blockchain"" – is formally debuting in front of a group of 20,000 developers at the Interconnect conference. There, its first two major deployments will also be detailed.  One of those is a blockchain identity solution built with SecureKey, in which it will power a public-private partnership that saw six Canadian banks invest $27m. In addition, it will be revealed that a Chinese energy company is using the IBM Blockchain to create an exchange for trading carbon credits.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice-president of blockchain technologies, described how the company used Hyperledger's open-source code to create a series of new features, which are now in use as part of its IBM Blockchain product.  Cuomo said:  ""Hyperledger Fabric is the operating system for IBM Blockchain, and the IBM Blockchain built an environment to develop, govern and operate a production, permissioned blockchain.""  Currently available on IBM's BlueMix cloud computing store, the commercial blockchain application will be available on a graded price scale based on the size of the implementation, with startups being charged less than enterprise builders.  The announcement comes after Fabric became the first of several open-source projects to emerge from the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger's ""incubation"" period into ""active"" status.  Secured using IBM hardware security modules that cost on average about $10,000 per month for four nodes, IBM Blockchain gives users the ability to spin up blockchain networks with tailored governance models for onboarding new customers, supporting about 1,000 transactions per second, according to a statement.  Previously revealed clients that we now know are also using IBM Blockchain include the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Everledger, Maersk, Northern Trust and Walmart.  Identity for banks  At the conference, Toronto-based SecureKey will discuss an identity network built in partnership with Canadian banks BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, RBC, Scotiabank and TD Bank.  Using the platform, the banks will be able to share information about onboarding clients with one another – for a fee – while potentially also saving money by paying one another less than they currently pay credit agencies for the same information.  The idea, according to Cuomo, is to create a blockchain identity solution that would make it simpler to verify identities while also reducing the amount of data shared.  To develop the identity network, a group of regulators, including the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), the Command Control and a research center funded by the US Department of Homeland Security, took part in the project.  Notably, Cuomo said the group has solved the problem of adhering to the ""right to be forgotten"" requirements of some governments that don’t want their citizens permanently recorded, while still using the immutable Fabric blockchain.  ""We do have a patent pending, so I don’t want to go into too much detail,"" said Cuomo. ""But we solved it without deleting from the blockchain, which is pretty cool.""  Carbon credits  The second commercial-scale deployment revealed today involves Beijing-based Energy-Blockchain Labs Limited.  The firm announced what it described as the ""world’s first blockchain-based green assets trading platform,"" built with Hyperledger Fabric and deployed using IBM Blockchain.  The so-called ""cap-and-trade"" system allows companies a certain amount of carbon emissions, and lets them exchange those allowances with one another to incentivize the creation of policies and technologies that minimize emissions. But a lack of transparency in the system has resulted in fraud concerns, both in China and elsewhere.  Cuomo told CoinDesk the blockchain-based carbon credits exchange is designed to make it easier for companies that generate pollution to trade credits as part of the build-up to China’s transfer to a unified national market later this year.  It's an application that has won the support of the Chinese government as well.  The director of China’s National Climate Change Strategy Research and International Cooperation Center, Li Junfeng, said in a statement:  ""We must work to limit high energy consumption and high emission industries, encourage clean energy development and further promote energy saving and emission reduction. These tasks are not only necessary for China’s own sustainable development, but for the welfare of the entire human family.""
