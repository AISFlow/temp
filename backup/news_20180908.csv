Software licensed under open source licenses (OSS) is fundamental to the success of blockchain projects. Such licenses permit collaborative, decentralized development, encourage swift adoption by users and enable the community to ""fork"" the project to resolve strategic disputes.  In fact, OSS licenses are used by both of the two major public blockchains, ethereum and bitcoin, as well as many other major blockchain projects, including the HyperLedger programs and R3's Corda.  However, OSS licenses are generally quite different from traditional proprietary software licenses. The importance of selecting the right OSS license and complying with the terms of that license is rarely discussed by the blockchain community.  If blockchain projects seek adoption by enterprises, the OSS license for the project will have a material impact on the rate of adoption. Even for established projects like ethereum, potential enterprise users carefully consider the OSS licenses that may be used.  For example, Jerry Cuomo of IBM recently noted on Frederick Munawa's Blockchain Innovation podcast that the complexity of the OSS licenses for ethereum was one of the reasons IBM decided to shift from ethereum to its own blockchain project, which eventually became part of the HyperLedger project.  Prospective enterprise users of a blockchain project will decide which blockchain project to adopt by applying the same criteria that they use for adopting other OSS licensed projects: (1) the complexity of the OSS project license or licenses; (2) the potential difficulty of complying with the obligations of such OSS license; and (3) the potential challenges of integrating a blockchain project with other software projects.  OSS licenses vary dramatically in their terms. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has approved 83 licenses as ""open source.""  However, the full complexity of OSS licensing is suggested by the SPDX project, managed by the Linux Foundation, which has identified 345 ""major"" licenses; Black Duck Software lists 2,500 versions of OSS type licenses in its Knowledge Base, which covers more than 530 billion lines of OSS code from over 9,000 forges and repositories of open source projects. Black Duck notes that 94 percent of OSS projects are licensed under the top 10 OSS licenses.  The two major types of OSS licenses are ""copyleft"" and ""permissive."" Ethereum is primarily licensed under two copyleft licenses: the Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPLv3) and the General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). On the other hand, Bitcoin Core is licensed under the MIT license, the most popular permissive license.  Copyleft licenses  Copyleft licenses impose the most restrictive terms on the use of the OSS. The best-known example of a copyleft license is the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2), which is used for Linux operating system program.  According to Black Duck Knowledge Base, the GPLv2 is the second most popular license, adopted by 14 percent of OSS projects. The GPLv3 used by Ethereum is the updated version of the GPLv2, published in 2007. The most fundamental characteristic of a copyleft license is its ""reciprocal"" provision: the legal requirement that both the original OSS and all ""derivative works"" of the original OSS be distributed solely under the terms of the copyleft license. ""Derivative work"" is a technical term under U.S. copyright law, describing work based on one or more preexisting works that represent an original work of authorship.  Copyright law was originally designed to protect books, songs and films, but also protects software. One example is the series Game of Thrones which is a derivative work based on the novel series of the same name. Although derivative work generally means a modification of the software, a derivative work may be created in other ways: for example, two programs that are compiled together are frequently considered a derivative work.  However, the application of copyright law to software continues to be uncertain. Consequently, the integration of copyleft licensed projects with projects licensed under other OSS licenses or proprietary licenses involves a complex legal analysis.  Compliance with copyleft license is significantly more challenging than compliance with permissive licenses: copyleft licenses have more complex obligations, and the lack of clarity of copyright law as applied to software creates other problems. The OSS community that supports copyleft licenses is very concerned about misuse of OSS by proprietary vendors.  This community is quite aggressive in seeking compliance with such licenses from users. Virtually all of the litigation concerning OSS licenses has been brought over enforcement of copyleft licenses.  Permissive licenses  ""Permissive"" licenses impose very few terms on the use of the OSS, generally only requiring a user to include notices and a copy of the license. Unlike copyleft licenses, they do not include ""reciprocal"" obligations.  The OSS community that supports permissive licenses generally believes that permissive licenses encourage more rapid adoption of an OSS project and that the ""reciprocal"" terms of copyleft licenses are not necessary for the successful development of a blockchain project.  The best-known example of a permissive license is the MIT license used by bitcoin. According to Black Duck Knowledge Base, 38 percent of OSS projects have adopted the MIT license, making it the most popular OSS license.  Most blockchain projects have not historically focused on the importance of an OSS license choice. However, carefully considering the choice of license and taking the time to understand the differences in compliance requirements and approach to enforcement should allow projects to reap long-term benefits.  Not only will the license choice affect the willingness of enterprises to adopt the project but the chosen license will also dictate the compliance philosophy and community culture of the project.

42381161,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94EAL,1536399048,This Tech Lets You Send Any Cryptocurrency to the Lightning Network,"Did you know? Lightning addresses and bitcoin addresses are not compatible.  What that means is that a user can't send money from their lightning address directly to a recipient bitcoin address, or vice versa, without going through an additional step to transferring their lightning funds into a bitcoin account of their own.  Seems counterintuitive, especially since the layer-two technology for transacting off-chain, is touted as a way to revolutionize the protocol to scale – more users and more transactions. And yet, there's this incompatibility between new off-chain lightning transactions and old-school on-chain bitcoin ones.  One developer, though, has been working on a possible solution, and it was inspired by an interoperability technology that's been slowly gaining steam – atomic swaps.  Lightning Labs developer Alex Bosworth was looking into atomic swaps, a technology that allows the native cryptocurrency of one blockchain to be traded with another with no middleman when it hit him that it could be used to swap lightning for old-style on-chain bitcoins.  Called ""submarine swaps,"" that technology is now being tested on the live lightning network.  Although, trying it out might actually be dangerous. Much like even transacting on the still-nascent lightning network, Bosworth admitted when he announced the project's mainnet launch that using submarine swaps at this stage is a risky venture.  ""There's still lots to build, but it's more fun to try on mainnet,"" he tweeted, using the ""reckless"" hashtag, what's become a rallying cry for developers utilizing the experimental technology with real money.  For his work, Bosworth has set up a connection between the bitcoin blockchain and the lightning network with the technology. Currently, the tech only supports funds being sent from a blockchain to the lightning network, and not yet the other way around.  But swapping lightning network payments for on-chain coins should be possible one day as well.  And, far beyond that, Bosworth envisions a future when every bitcoin or cryptocurrency wallet someday supports the technology, and as such, it would be just as easy to send litecoin, dogecoin or any coin to a lightning address.  An ethereum test  Meanwhile, this multi-coin world Bosworth is itching for is already being tested.  Jason Wong, an aviation software developer also interested in cryptocurrency, started playing with submarine swaps not long ago, starting by showing something priced on the lightning network can be bought using litecoin.  ""Same chain swap is good but cross-chain swap is even better,"" as Wong put it in a recent blog post.  But Wong told CoinDesk he wanted to go even further.  ""It will reach ... more users if submarine can support ethereum,"" he said.  So, a couple weeks ago he implemented another version of the technology, allowing items priced on lightning to be purchased with ether, the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain, the second largest by market cap. And with Bosworth's help, Wong showed that the trade can be executed.  While the technology is novel, there are serious use cases for it as well.  One is ""refilling"" lightning channels, which will very likely be a common need.  That's because one tricky thing about lightning is that users need to set up channels with a set amount of money in them. This process of setting up a channel costs on-chain transaction fees, and those have been known to surge when more people are using the cryptocurrency.  Say you open a lightning channel for $20 dollars worth of bitcoin. But then you quickly use up those funds transacting with others.  Instead of opening a completely new channel – and incurring more transaction fees – a slightly cheaper route would be topping up the existing channel by using a submarine swap to trade on-chain funds for extra off-chain funds.  At sites like Satoshis.place, made solely for lightning payments, with submarine swaps users could then potentially pay in whatever coin they want, be it on-chain bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and many more.  Perhaps, though, one of the more interesting use cases for submarine swaps is crypto-to-crypto exchange. While atomic swaps are usually seen as the main technology working toward this goal (allowing users to transfer bitcoin to litecoin or dogecoin to ethereum), in some ways submarine swaps could do the job even better.  That's because in order to make an atomic swap, lightning needs to be enabled on both cryptocurrencies, and for right now, only a handful of cryptocurrencies have a functioning lightning network.  But with submarine swaps, only one side of the trade needs lightning.  This type of swap then, according to Bosworth, requires less work from developers who want to support a variety of different coins, without having to go through the time-consuming process of integrating each one individually.  Speaking from a developer's perspective, Bosworth told CoinDesk:  ""I want to support your choice of coin spends, but I don't want to add support for lots of different coins.""  'Utopian swap future'  Bosworth's ambitions for swaps go beyond these uses, though.  In a lecture describing his vision for the tech a couple months back, Bosworth went as far as to envision a ""utopian swap future"" – highlighting a variety of swap types.  Beyond submarine swaps, for instance, HTLCswaps could allow users to trade lightning payments trustlessly for data.  Still, there's a long way to go before that future comes to pass, even as it relates specifically to submarine swaps. For instance, through testing Bosworth has uncovered ""a lot of challenges.""  ""My concept was that swaps could be something that were very cheap to provide, like that a mobile phone could do,"" he said, outlining that one problem with that particular notion is that submarine swaps are more challenging to execute when a blockchain is seeing higher transaction volume.  Since the bitcoin testnet is currently being blasted with transaction spam, clogging up the network, Bosworth found that out the hard way when he was experimenting with the technology there.  Yet, it hasn't stopped his pursuit. Instead, Bosworth's short-term goal is to figure out a way to scan through this spam efficiently, in hopes of ensuring smartphones could always handle a submarine swap.
