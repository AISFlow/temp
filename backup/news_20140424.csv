42397585,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5S7,1398380213,Google Pulls Five Mobile Wallpaper Apps Due to Bitcoin Mining Malware,"Lookout, a mobile security startup based in San Francisco, has identified a new type of bitcoin mining malware that targets mobile devices. Dubbed 'BadLepricon', the malware represents a more sophisticated type of mining malware attack than previously seen.  The malware was designed to be delivered via a wallpaper app. Lookout identified five separate apps that contained BadLepricon, and Google removed the apps soon after being contacted by the mobile security firm.  The company announced the discovery in a 24th April blog post, citing the specifics of the malware.  CoinDesk spoke with Michael Bentley, head of Lookout’s research and response team, who said that the malware presents a new level of sophistication not normally seen in this type of cyberattack, adding that the malware writer knew what he or she was doing.  Said Bentley:  “When [malware authors] are looking into protecting the phone, making sure certain conditions exist, and making sure you’re participating in a pool, it tells us that they are a more experienced developer.”  Botnet development  The writer of BadLepricon used a stratum mining proxy that lets the botnet operator control where bitcoins are being sent and which nodes are being mined.  Additionally, BadLepricon is designed to maximize mining output from a single device. The mining program only runs when the display is off and when the battery life is greater than 50%. This also acts to protect the phone from heat damage, which masks one of the major symptoms of a mobile-based mining malware attack. It appears that some users may have been affected.  According to Lookout, the apps had an average of 100-500 downloads before the malware was discovered.  Bentley remarked that, ultimately, these types of attacks don’t produce enough hashing power to actually solve a block or produce bitcoins. However, he expects program authors to develop more botnet-style mining malware in the future.  He said:  “As cellphone power increases, and as devices are [more] available, it’s a logical next step.”  Recent attacks  While the majority of bitcoin malware programs are focused on hacking wallets, mining malware attacks do present a threat to computer systems that can be exploited for hashing power. This was shown in a recent study published by Kapersky Labs.  Iowa State University  announced this week that it had discovered a server breach that compromised student data. The school stated that the malware was designed to mine bitcoins, although it is unclear if the effort was successful.  BadLepricon is also not the first type of malware to disguise itself on the Google Play store. Earlier this year, two malicious apps were discovered that turned affected mobile devices into dogecoin and litecoin miners.

42397581,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5Q9,1398374150,"Bitcoin Startup Incubator Seedcoin Raises 2,000 BTC for Second Funding Round","Virtual bitcoin incubator Seedcoin has announced its latest funding round for bitcoin startups – and the participants are more diverse than ever.  The funding round, which follows a first launched in December, will also be listed with Havelock Investments, an investment fund for bitcoin startups.  There are seven firms in this round, which the company has labelled Seedcoin Fund 2 (SF2).  One of the firms, the Bitcoin Transaction Network, is compiling a range of transaction services into an end-to-end financial transaction network for the digital currency. It will provide ATM, wallet and prepaid card services, in addition to transaction processing and exchange facilities. It wants to do this on a global basis, with a network of partners.  Quantave  will provide market data to institutional traders from exchanges via an API. The company, now in stealth mode, will also offer quantitative analysis and a free trading platform.  Currently in the alpha stage, Global Coin FX is a UK-based virtual currency exchange, while Ignite Financing is a leasing firm for bitcoin ATMs, described as a 'bolt-on provider' for ATM manufacturers.  BTCTrip  is a travel and leisure platform providing travel bookings in return for bitcoin rather than fiat payments, including flight and hotel reservations. In addition, BiTnews Media is a video news platform focused on decentralized technologies, ranging from digital currencies to 3D printing to peer-to-peer energy grids.  These six companies received 250 BTC each, while the seventh – TagPesa – will receive 150 BTC. TagPesa is an exchange and remittance firm, focused on remittances in Africa and further afield.  A more diverse offering  One thing that stands out about SF2 is the increased diversity of business models and companies. The last round didn't have financing or video news firms, and no one in that cohort was tackling established sectors such as travel.  ""When we started Seedcoin last July, most of the startups contacting us were exchanges, payment processors and wallets,"" said Hong Kong-based Eddy Travia, co-founder of Seedcoin, who is operating the company with UK-based CTO Hakim Mamoni, and chief funding officer Alexis Nicosia, located in Singapore.  Travia added:  ""We were pleased to help these essential elements of the bitcoin ecosystem infrastructure, but now we are approached by entrepreneurs not necessarily from a crypto or tech background.""  SF2 is worth 2,000 BTC ($982,500 at the time of writing), which will be sold off in four chunks of 500 BTC each, starting on Tuesday, and ending on 22nd June. These bitcoins will be divided into 2 million units, worth a thousandth of a bitcoin (0.001 BTC) each.  Seedcoin takes a 10% cut of the funding, and holds back another 10% for follow-up investment in the startups that are participating in SF2.  Like SF1, participants may see future dividends, according to the prospectus, but any companies that pay out will do so directly to unit holders, rather than via SF2, and each company will have its own policy on this.  Travia wasn't fazed by the relatively flat performance of SF1, which opened at the same price (0.001 BTC) on 9th December, and closed at 0.0008 yesterday.    Said Travia, who signed the seventh participant for SF1 – BTC.sx – at the start of this month:    ""We have been mainly dealing with the investment logistics, but are now more active with new investors looking at the startups, potential partnerships and so forth.""  SF2 was meant to have been launched in March, but Seedcoin experienced delays. Explained Travia:  ""There are many elements to our involvement with the startups. We prefer to confirm and make sure all parties are in agreement before listing. Dealing with seven new startups is not a small task, even for the three of us.""  Unlike SF1, the startup companies listed at launch will be the final list of participants. No more will be added later.

42397588,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5V4,1398369026,"Experts to CNBC: US Dollar, Not Bitcoin, is the Future Digital Currency","The world already has a digital currency, a group of experts told CNBC: the US dollar.  CNBC sought comments and opinions from market analysts such as ConvergEx’s chief market strategist, Nicholas Colas, as part of a CNBC 25 special report on the future of money.  In the piece, authored by Ted Kemp, Colas and others argued that the USD possesses many of the strengths associated with bitcoin.  He said:  ""The $100 bill is the world's bitcoin. It's anonymous. It's easy to use. It's actually easier than bitcoin, because you don't need a computer or even power.""  Money is already digital  One of the reasons merchants are drawn to digital currencies compared to current methods of payment acceptance is the lower transaction fees. Businesses that take BTC as a form of payment typically pay around 1% per transaction.  The experts told CNBC that digitized money can reduce cost barriers in a big way. However, for them, it doesn’t require a big shift in technology.  Christopher Vecchio  , a currency analyst for the DailyFX trading news site, said that for many, money is already digital.  Said Vecchio:  ""The bank isn't holding a lot of money in there. The money in your account is data. It's a set of zeros and ones.""  Bitcoin’s role in reducing transaction costs is noteworthy, but for Vecchio, this shift is part of a broader evolution in use of money worldwide.  He said:  ""The future of money will really be on finding ways to transact in a lower-cost way, and that's a societal trend, not just bitcoin.”  Competition will cut costs  Another prediction focused on how, eventually, the resistance by banks to a low-cost payment environment will begin to shift as tools like PayPal and Square broaden their customer bases.  Even social media platforms could one day serve as a means to cheaply move dollars between parties, experts told CNBC.

42397595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5cw,1398362419,Inside the Film Festival Premiere of 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin',"The hotly anticipated film 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin' premiered last night (23rd April) at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.  The documentary, directed by Nicholas Mross, follows his brother, software developer and former bitcoin miner Daniel Mross, as he traces the short but momentous history of bitcoin, traveling everywhere from Tokyo to Seattle to Panama to speak with the industry’s pioneers.  The film covers all of bitcoin’s high-profile twists and turns since 2011, when Daniel first became involved with the community.  Many at the screening were bitcoiners, but the events portrayed were such that more mainstream viewers would have been familiar with most of the content.  The plot  The movie begins with its underpinning – mining – describing in most basic terms how bitcoins are released and circulated; and ends with Newsweek’s controversial exposé on Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, the man they likely falsely identified as the creator of the Bitcoin protocol.  The narrative grows slowly, and then suddenly and tremendously, in a way that reflects the real-world rise of the bitcoin phenomenon.  Near the end of the film, Daniel remarks:  “Over the past several months, the mining landscape has changed significantly. When I first started, mining was for geeks. Now, it's big business.”  In the demonstrably pro-bitcoin production, price volatility, the failure of Mt Gox, bitcoin’s connection to digital black market Silk Road and the arrest of former BitInstant CEO and Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman Charlie Shrem are presented as events of little consequence to the bigger picture; events that many bitcoiners believed to be necessary for the technology and currency to mature.  More important are the smaller and increasingly frequent events that lead to wider bitcoin adoption – businesses beginning to accept bitcoin and regulators becoming open to learning about it.  In a talk following the screening, Nicholas said:  ""It’s still sort of early … a lot of these companies, a lot of these startups helped pave the way to kind of smooth out some of the bumps, and we're seeing now a shift into the more established financial companies in the world of finance, so I think it’s just gonna get better as we move forward.""  Daniel added that he thinks these uncertainties are actually opportunities for a lot of startups and existing businesses.  Complications  These opportunities are not without complications, though. For example, bitcoin has such a vast range of uses and it is increasing in popularity.  For the bitcoin rookie, the film gives a sufficient introduction to its role in technology, business and finance. While the technology may be alive and well, regulators will likely debate bitcoin as a currency for some time if it wants to gain wider adoption.  Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), says in the film that the innovation around bitcoin and the virtual economy is “interesting” and continues:  “The flip side is that being part of the global system and financial system comes with the responsibility that your organisation will not be used by organised terror groups.”  But, the film emphasizes that the regulatory battles will play out as feats in the greater endeavor to make Main Street comfortable with bitcoin, and that regulatory setbacks and scandals tied to shady players like Mt Gox and Silk Road shouldn’t blind anyone to the advantages, potential and fundamentals of the technology.  Daniel said in the panel following: “We wanted to stress, too, that bitcoin is a piece of software and it’s public domain. So anything that you tie to it, any externalities, don’t actually have to do with it.  It’s just a computer program. People are using it a lot of different ways, and that’s what we tried to show, that there’s a lot of different ways people are using it. So, to tie it to just one-particular-use cases, is a little bit short-sighted, I think.”  Among the more prominent members of the cast are Shrem; CEO of former exchange TradeHill Jered Kenna; developer Gavin Andresen; bitcoin evangelist and Coinapult co-founder Erik Voorhees; Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles; and bitcoin angel investor and evangelist Roger Ver.  Additional appearances are made by Yifu Guo, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Ryan Singer, Brian Armstrong, Fred Ehrsam, Tony Gallippi, Stephen Pair and Vitalik Buterin.  Panel discussion  The panel following the show included Shrem and the Mross brothers, and was moderated by New York Times financial markets reporter Nathaniel Popper.  The evening seemed as much an entrance for bitcoin as it was for Shrem, who has been held under house arrest since January. He was given temporary reprieve to attend the screening.  Shrem was indicted last week on money laundering charges tied to Silk Road. Having made it clear throughout the film that the case doesn’t mean the end for him and bitcoin, he said in the panel:  ""Bitcoin belongs to everyone, there’s a place for bitcoin in the heart of every person. Someday – 10 years from now, 20 years from now – bitcoin will be powering underlying infrastructure of our banking system, or the way I send money to you, or to me, or from one person in China to pay for a surgery that needs to happen at 2:00 in the morning on a Saturday night, or for anything.""  He added: ""I think involvement can be you sitting at your computer or it can be you running a multi-billion dollar company. Everyone’s involved ... So really, I hate to call it the people’s currency, because I’ll be called a communist, but it is the people’s currency, at the end of the day.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/24/inside-the-film-festival-premiere-of-the-rise-and-rise-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76d639fbec6c0d1cf7b26ebae2c31b904c838377-1024x796.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397584,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5T6,1398358811,"GoCoin's Steve Beauregard Talks Altcoins, Asia and Merchant Adoption","Steve Beauregard is the CEO and founder of GoCoin, a merchant-focused digital currency gateway that offers businesses the ability to accept digital currencies such as BTC, LTC and DOGE.  GoCoin raised $1.5m in funding led by Bitcoin Shop this March to further its goal of expanding the use of digital currencies around the world, and in particular, in emerging markets.  Beauregard recently spoke about his work during the ""Bitcoin Merchant On-Ramp"" panel at Inside Bitcoins NYC on 7th April as part of a discussion that addressed digital marketing techniques, among other topics. There, CoinDesk sat down with Beauregard for a conversation that touched on his company's interest in altcoins, its assessment of the international digital currency market and more.  CoinDesk: There's a number of bitcoin companies competing in the merchant space. GoCoin was a bit of a latecomer, as it was founded in July of last year. Why did you believe GoCoin could compete in the space?  Steve Beauregard: I think within a couple of years there will be five to 10 companies like ours. There's plenty of space at this point. You're also going to start to see payment processors vertically align with which verticals they'll serve.  So, like political campaigns are their own angle. We've done some political fundraisers with bitcoin. There's specific needs, they need to collect certain information, they need to be able to verify who the donor is, and so that's sort of a niche that we've started to carve out that's more specific.  I think that where you focus your sales efforts is where you're going to have your most success. We're looking at international businesses, we've got ourselves organized as an international company that's serving Europe, Southeast Asia and then also the Americas.  Looking beyond digital currencies, which company or companies do you hold up as an ideal for where you want your company to be in the space?  Steve Beauregard: I definitely think of PayPal, that's sort of the obvious one. That said, I think that we've taken more of a laser-focus on serving merchants, we're not trying to be all things to all people.  I think Coinbase serves many masters if you will. They're taking the wallet, they're doing cold storage, they're more in my mind a consumer play, and 'Oh by the way, we also serve merchants.'  We take more of a 'Hey, we're going to be high-service for merchants, provide solutions for high-volume online operators.'  Your company has also been one of the more high-profile supports of altcoins, adding LTC and DOGE support. Can you speak to the business case for altcoins and why they make sense as part of GoCoin's strategy?  Steve Beauregard: I think that what's unique about the other coins is the characteristics of the people who own those coins are different than bitcoin. Bitcoin has a very tech roots, but I see dogecoin skews a bit younger.  Litecoin  sort of became, the miners that are mining litecoin are the ones that missed out on the early days of bitcoin, and so, there's a lot of people who started mining litecoin because they could make a lot more money mining litecoin than mining bitcoin.  They see their money a bit differently, and I think they're more willing to transact with litecoin in many cases than they are with bitcoin.  Why do you believe other bitcoin businesses have been hesitant to reach out to or otherwise embrace some of the more prominent altcoin communities?  Steve Beauregard: First of all, some people believe that there's already enough education you have to do to get people to understand bitcoin, and when you get into litecoin it becomes sort of dilutive.  I think that's one thing, I also think that we're probably the first company to look at coins as being just another currency and we designed our system from the ground up to be able to bolt on other currencies as we see fit.  So, I think that from our standpoint we've designed the system in such a way that is very flexible. I doubt that the first movers in the space designed their systems with the same considerations. I think they built their platforms for bitcoin, while they could take on others, i think it would be very disruptive to their existing base.  Do you see bitcoin as the long-term frontrunner in the space?  Steve Beauregard: I'm agnostic about it. I'm a believer in digital currencies, and i think that each has a characteristic that gives it value.  I like that litecoin is sort of more fair, you don't need a ton of money to be able to mine litecoin. It doesn't take as much power and as much electricity. Some of the other coins that are proof of stake have interesting characteristics.  Obviously, bitcoin is the gold standard at this point, but I remember Napster.  Speaking about international markets, there's been a lot of discussion about how underbanked consumers can benefit from digital currencies. But, there's also the awareness that these same individuals might not have the tech-savvy to embrace these solutions. What's your assessment of this gap?  Steve Beauregard: I still think it's substantial. I don't really worry about remittances per se, but what's more interesting to me is the onramp for shoppers.  People who live in Southeast Asia, they can't shop on Western websites because they don't have a credit card. I would like to see these tools get to the point where they can shop on these sites, and that there's enough sites that they want to shop on. The tipping point is the onramp of getting coins in their hands.  I think ATMs will make a big dent, the ability to put cash in and get coins and be able to go shop. I think that's going to do quite well in Singapore and some of the other more technical countries.  Since your business has a focus on serving Asian markets, can you speak to the situation in this region given the uncertainty with which these regulators are approaching the issue?  Steve Beauregard: I'll speak more to Singapore. The monetary authority there has been very receptive. They've given the same buyer beware warnings, and the tax regulators have given pretty clear guidance there as well.  I think China is the wild card. Thailand's interesting since they did a reversal, since they're central bank called bitcoin illegal and they've since reversed on that.  Some of the other markets, I haven't spent as much time analyzing, since they haven't developed as quickly as I thought they might.  This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

42397599,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbD5eu,1398351639,Xapo Announces New Bitcoin Debit Card Offering,"UPDATE (25th April 02:00 BST): MasterCard has contacted CoinDesk to reiterate that it does not have a relationship with Xapo, and that it had no knowledge of the company's planned product launch.  The company added: ""MasterCard does not have a relationship with Xapo. There is no card program currently available.""  UPDATE (25th April 02:30 BST): Xapo CEO Wences Casares spoke to CoinDesk to clarify the situation, stating that the company is currently working with an undisclosed bank to launch the open-loop debit card product, but it has yet to select a credit card network with which to power the offering. However, it was originally planning to use the MasterCard network.      Casares explained:  ""If you were to ask me yesterday, I would have said it would definitely be MasterCard, because the cards we have been testing are MasterCard. The cards that we have need a network. If it's not MasterCard, it's going to be Visa or Discover, but it will have a network.""  He continued, elaborating on the nature of the agreements underlying the card product:  ""The only people who are allowed to issue cards are banks, if you want to issue a prepaid card, you go and work with a bank, and they have a MasterCard or Visa license to issue the cards. They are the ones who have the contract, and have the burden of making sure the program complies to all the regulatory [responsibilities].""  Casares indicated that he is still in talks with MasterCard about the Xapo Debit Card product.    _________________________________________________________________      California-based bitcoin wallet provider Xapo has announced the launch of a bitcoin debit card – a new product it is lauding as the first to allow bitcoin users similar spending freedoms to traditional debit cards.      The Xapo Debit Card debits BTC directly from users' hot wallets, and can be used anywhere MasterCard is accepted, both online and at physical locations, though it does not represent a partnership between the companies.    Xapo  founder Wences Casares explained that the card is designed to appeal to Xapo users frustrated by the inability to spend their bitcoins at most locations, telling CoinDesk:  ""You can use it anywhere you would pay with MasterCard, you can use it online, you can use physically at any place you can pay with MasterCard. It makes it very, very easy for you to access your coins.""  The offering is immediately available in both a digital and physical version to existing Xapo customers. The digital version of the card is free, while the physical version comes with a $15 one-time fee that the company indicates covers shipping and handling.  New Xapo customers can also sign up to take advantage of the release. Shipping for all physical cards is expected to begin in two months, the company said.  Customer demand  As of its launch, the Xapo Debit Card is limited to one card per wallet account.  Casares explained that Xapo added the product due to demand from current customers who have wanted a way to spend the roughly 10% of their funds (on average) they keep in the company's hot wallets. The remainder is stored securely in cold storage.  Said Casares:  ""I think that this product is for existing customers who are asking for it. I expect a lot of the current customers to be using it.""  Casares indicated that the ability for users to connect multiple cards to accounts may be added in the future, should customers request the feature.  How it works  Casares said that Xapo receives all transactions when they are initiated by card users at the point of sale.  From there, the company analyzes the account to determine whether there are enough funds to support the transaction. If so, the company authorizes the purchase immediately and sells the requisite amount of BTC via bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  Merchants receive their payment in local currency and, to MasterCard, Casares said, the transaction appears just like any other local transaction.  Casares went on to explain that the offering is different than the available prepaid options from Coincard and Cryptex, which need to be preloaded with bitcoins and that, he said, require users to manually convert bitcoins to local currency before purchase.  Explained Casares:  ""This one is just like a debit card, because it debits from the wallet directly. You don't have to be thinking about funding it and how much and when the conversion happens.""  Xapo users, by comparison, only need to move bitcoin from their cold storage vaults to their company-issued hot wallets when more funds are required.  Consumer focus  Though best known for its secure bitcoin vault storage product, Casares told CoinDesk that the Xapo Debit Card is consistent with his company's mission of becoming a viable, consumer-focused bitcoin bank.  Said Casares:  ""We're not a wallet company or a payment company. We are a bitcoin wallet, we are a bitcoin bank. Consumers need convenience and that's why we provide our MasterCard debit card and why we will keep adding products based on our customers want.""  Casares went on to stress Xapo's commitment to consumers, stating that the company will never have merchant customers or offer merchant services.  The launch follows Xapo's 13th March announcement that it raised $20m in funding from Benchmark, Fortress Investment Group and Ribbit Capital.

Much has happened since CoinDesk released its first State of Bitcoin report earlier this year and today we are publishing an update featuring brand new data and analysis.  We were blown away by the success of the first report, which, at the time of writing, had over 110,000 views on SlideShare. So thank you for taking the time to read and share it across your networks.  The new report focuses on data and events in the first quarter of 2014 through to the present day.  2014 Q1 report highlights  Venture capital investment takes off  One of the more significant developments since the last report is the growing sum of venture capital that has been invested in bitcoin startups. So far this year, we have seen a total of $64.2m invested, with Xapo, Circle and OKCoin all securing eight-digit investment rounds.  Venture capitalists such as Marc Andreessen have compared bitcoin’s overall potential, as well as its current stage of development, to the Internet circa 1993. So how does VC investment in bitcoin compare to the early Internet?  In short, VCs appear to be walking the talk (Table 1).  *Note: Only includes first sequence venture deals; late-stage 1995 Internet investments totalling $257.6m are excluded.  The 2014 run rate for the publicly disclosed VC investment in bitcoin startups is just over $200m. This would double the investment VCs made in bitcoin startups in 2013, and it isn't far below the total for first sequence investments in 1998 Internet companies.1  Overall, this ‘wall of money’ flowing towards cryptocurrency startups should certainly have a positive impact on the industry’s prospects.  Bitcoin commerce continues to expand  CoinDesk now estimates that approximately 60,000 merchants around the globe accept bitcoin. In 2014 there has also been greater bitcoin adoption by major brands, including Zynga, Square and Overstock. Even eBay has added a 'virtual currency' category to its US and UK sites.  In the offline world, there are approximately 4,000 premises where bitcoin can be used in person and, of these, food establishments are by far the most common type of business accepting the cryptocurrency (Figure 1).  Emerging signs of industry consolidation  One theme, which was touched on in our earlier State of Bitcoin report, was the emerging signs of bitcoin industry consolidation, and recently we have seen further evidence of this trend.  For example, in recent months exchange trading volumes have been concentrating in the very largest exchanges. We have also seen the rise of what we refer to as the ‘universal’ bitcoin business model.  This universal model definition would include any bitcoin company that is aiming to house multiple components of the bitcoin value chain (ie: wallet, exchange, payment processor) under one corporate roof.  Examples here include Coinbase, Circle and Coinplug. These companies are seeking to establish trusted brands and a convenient one-stop shop for all their customers' bitcoin needs.  Looking ahead  Our intention is to publish a new State of Bitcoin report every quarter and we very much welcome your feedback and ideas on how we can make it better.  Given bitcoin’s open nature, there is a tremendous amount of information and data on the bitcoin economy already publicly available. A number of forward-thinking companies are also actively working to increase transparency.  There is still more that can be done, however, and we believe greater data transparency represents a significant opportunity for the bitcoin industry for several reasons.  Right now, important information about the industry’s performance is lacking, such as how much total bitcoin commerce is taking place, or how many people are using bitcoin ATMs, and how often. It is in every bitcoin company’s interest to help the general public develop confidence in the bitcoin industry, and greater data transparency can help this cause.  In addition, it is not uncommon for companies outside the bitcoin sphere to work confidentially with firms in industries, such as insurance, to aggregate useful sector data in a way that protects individual company data from being publicly revealed. In this way, bitcoin companies could also directly benefit from more data transparency through a better understanding of their sector.  Individual bitcoin companies understandably want to keep confidential customer information and sensitive operational data that could be used by competitors to their advantage. However, there is room to continue to meet this objective, while also making more sector data accessible.  CoinDesk aims to work with the bitcoin industry on developing additional publicly available data. Do contact us if you would like to be involved and help support this initiative.  We hope you enjoy the State of Bitcoin Q1 2014 report and would like to thank our readers for making CoinDesk the world’s leading source of bitcoin news, analysis and perspective.

42425611,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcg3h,1398343825,From Gold to Cash to Decentralized Data: The Money Revolution Continues,"As technology has become an all-encompassing fixture in our lives, the way that money moves around has changed radically. What's interesting is that most people haven't even noticed.  Over time, money has ranged from shells to bracelets, from shiny coins to paper-like bills. Then, of course, credit cards came along – shards of plastic we all now tote containing precious personal information that can be taken with a simple snatch and swipe.  We've gone from commodities as money, commodity-backed money and government-backed fiat currencies to distributed, database money. And now decentralization will make it known to all.  Commodities as money  Before currencies were around, people simply used forms of value to barter for the things they desired.  Since it was impossible to trade, say, a cow for a chicken without one side being left with less value and the other with more, precious pieces of value were necessary.  An example of value-backed money from a time long gone are Russia's glass trade beads. These strings of cobalt blue pieces of glass were used in the late 1700s in order to facilitate trade between the Russians and the native people living in what is now known as Alaska.  The trade beads, which are said to have originated in the modern-day Czech Republic, were eventually used around the world to as a method of exchange.  Of course, glass as monetary value is more about beauty than practicality, as the material is fragile and susceptible to breakage.  The example shows, however, that anything with a generally accepted value can be considered as money in the absence of a legal tender.  Commodity-backed money  How could a person receive a completely fair value for exchange with the use of, say, a glass bracelet, or something more valuable like a jewel?  While some commodities could be subdivided – in the case of precious metal coins, for example – other commodities did not allow this. Furthermore, constantly moving valuable and heavy gold around wasn't at all efficient.  In hindsight, it was just too difficult to advance global economic trade using commodities alone.  Money that represented the value of a commodity was a much more practical instrument than the use of precious objects. It just took time for that revolution to materialize across the world.  Thus, commodity-backed money was formed with the use of tokens – non-precious coins or bills. This way an easily divisible instrument could be used, yet still have value in the form of a commodity. In most cases this was gold, especially after Bretton Woods allowed global convertibility of United States dollars to the precious metal.  Gold had long been a stable and resilient form of value. And some countries, such as India, have always valued it for cultural purposes – increasing its global worth. Gold's scarcity also allowed it to be a great commodity to back money, at least during that time.  The US dollar was famous for being backed by gold – the gold standard, as it is known – and at one point in the 20th century America was one of the biggest holders of the metal. However, things things changed over time, and, in 1971, the US made a decision that drastically changed the concept of money.  Government-backed money  Germany was one of the first to leave the gold standard – a move that ended up helping its economy at the time.  When the US opted to do so in 1971, it was to protect its own interests after countries started redeeming dollars for America's gold reserves, thus reducing its stockpile of the metal. To avoid a devaluation of the dollar, the government broke the relationship between the two.  Departing from the gold standard was seen as risky at the time, but looking back it was a necessary move. It also brought forth the idea that fiat money, also known as government-based currency, could thrive simply by being backed by an economy and not a commodity.  Over time, however, this created a brand-new policy mindset.  Fiat was originally understood as a currency being backed by an economy, but it is now clear that when an economy tanks, governments can use fiat money as a lever – for example using central bank bond purchases to produce more money.  So, fiat is essentially government-backed money. In some regions, like perhaps the US or the EU nations, governments are seen as institutions that won't fail. However, it is important to remember there are no guarantees, and this situation really can mean that governments have more control than they, perhaps, should.  Database-backed money  Do you carry cash around anymore? If not, where does it come from? It comes from a computer, a system of account. In today's incumbent financial systems, cash never really moves from one back to another; it's just a big database.  And decentralized virtual currencies are like an upgrade from the banking accounting systems that exist today.  The biggest problem with today's banking system is that is so centralized and concentrated, it has effectively left a large part of the global population out of the loop. It's amazing to think that with all the technological innovations in our time, so many people still don't have access to something many take for granted, such as a bank.  Virtual money in the form of bitcoin takes the equivalent of a bank's accounting database and flips it outwards, in the form of the block chain, for everyone to see and for other numerous benefits.  And that may be the most ingenious part of this paradigm shift. Because what's wrong, then, with taking databases of value and allowing everyone access so as to more easily move money?  People know value when they see it  Bitcoin's perceived sordid past as the engine of digital drug trade at Silk Road is really no different than the power that commodities like gold or government-backed money have wielded to fund wars all over the world for centuries.  The point is this: monetary forms simply arise from what people perceive as a thing of value. And over time, bitcoin has become a thing of value. What is also clear is that communities have formed behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that will not let them simply fade away.  So, this opens up a new world where decentralization can become a means of access to financial services for billions people who still are using forms of money from the past: the bartering of commodities and government-backed money.  Remember, most people today have lived during a time where a cash-based systems have value largely because the issuing government accepts that money, and only that money, as payment for taxes and fees.  This idea, though, is ageing fast, and even the financial industry accepts that it needs to adapt or die.  This, in the end, should mean more financial accessibility for everyone, even those to whom the bank currently says 'no' – maybe not explicitly, but through exclusion.

Attorney at law Nobuaki Kobayashi has been appointed as the bankruptcy trustee.  The troubled bitcoin exchange filed for liquidation in a Tokyo court earlier this month, dropping its plans for civil rehabilitation. There was still some hope that outside investors could muscle in and save the exchange from liquidation, but the deal never materialised.  Impact on customers still unclear  Bankruptcy trustee Kobayashi issued a brief statement on Thursday, stating that he has the exclusive power to administer and dispose of Mt. Gox assets. He declared in a statement:  “The bankruptcy trustee will implement the bankruptcy proceedings, such as the administration and realization of the Company’s assets and the investigation of the claims. We kindly ask for your understanding and cooperation.”  Kobayashi expects a lot of inquires from interested parties, so in the interest of sharing as much information as possible his team compiled a document that will answer a wide range frequently asked questions.  In addition, a call centre has been set up and it can be contacted by telephone, but for the time being the scope of the responses will be limited.  Additional information coming soon  The five-page document answers some questions, but many more remain unanswered. The document stresses that the number of interested parties is “extremely large” and asks clients to refrain from calling the trustee directly.  A creditor meeting is being organised and it is scheduled for 23rd July. Creditors are not obliged to attend, as it would be impractical in many cases. Instead, the bankruptcy trustee is planning to publish the content of the meeting on Mt. Gox's website.  The process of filing proofs of claims will be disclosed through the Company’s website at a later date.

42425599,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfhh,1398335980,BitVendo Launches 'Nuke Proof' Bitcoin Cold Storage Service,"Ireland's first bitcoin ATM operator BitVendo has teamed up with Merrion Vaults – a Dublin-based safe deposit box facility – to offer an ""ultra-secure"" bitcoin cold storage service.  BitVendo  is planning to offer three different cold storage packages, starting at €70 per year. The entry-level tier is designed for consumers with less than €5,000 worth of bitcoin holdings.  The company told CoinDesk:  “Our top package works off 2% of the insured bitcoin holdings. It comes with encrypted phone support, express withdrawal service, private meeting rooms, anti-tiger kidnapping measures and some other cool features, like being able to withdraw your bitcoin straight into cash or gold which can be held inside Merrion Vaults on behalf of the customer.”  Customers will also be able to pick and choose various add-ons to meet different needs, the company added.  Doomsday-proof services  BitVendo is hoping to differentiate itself from the competition by offering more transparency and ingenuity at a lower price point.  The company explained that it likes the GoldMoney Group/Netagio approach that offers gold deposits on top of bitcoin cold storage. Since Merrion Vaults already stores gold in its vaults, BitVendo says it can easily offer a similar service.  The biggest differentiator is security. BitVendo offers video-call verification, encrypted phone support, custom encrypted hard drives and bitcoin storage in multiple safe deposit boxes using three different methods.  BitVendo explained:  “Every possible scenario such as tiger-kidnapping to nuclear strikes and EMP blasts has been accounted for. In the event that all our staff die, clients can expect to receive their coins back inside of 14 days, and we do apologize for that delay in advance.”  This may sound like overkill (quite literally), but BitVendo wants its clients to sleep easy and know for a fact that their bitcoins are truly safe.  Lloyds of London  is currently reviewing the two firms’ bitcoin storage practices and BitVendo said it has already received positive feedback.  Lloyds already offers €10,000 in complementary insurance on all gold holdings at Merrion Vaults and the bitcoin insurance policy will be made available as soon as it is approved. BitVendo insisted that its customers won’t ever need insurance, however.  The company says its new bitcoin storage service is scheduled to go live on 1st May and all relevant updates will be made available via BitVendo’s twitter feed.  Bitcoin debit cards  When asked whether it sees a competitive threat in the form of bitcoin-funded debit cards, BitVendo told us that it ""loves"" the new cards:  “Anything ‘new’ with bitcoin is always a good thing, it shows the media and regulators that a lot of innovation is going into bitcoin and that the future is very bright. Debit cards are an important part of the future altcoin infrastructure.”  The company acknowledged that the bitcoin industry is constantly evolving and that every new service that fills a void is welcome.  About the companies  Merrion Vaults  is Ireland’s only purpose-built independent deposit box facility, offering safe deposit boxes from €199 per year. All boxes are located in Dublin and are individually insured by Lloyds of London to the tune of €10,000.  BitVendo  is Ireland’s first bitcoin ATM provider. It currently operates a single Lamassu ATM on Upper Abbey Street, Dublin.  BitVendo’s mission statement is simple: the company wants to make bitcoin more accessible to people and it wants to start by simplifying the process of buying bitcoins.  That’s where the ATMs come into play, as BitVendo maintains that personal wire transfers to traditional bitcoin exchanges are simply too cumbersome and slow for many consumers.

""Если биткоин это деньги, тогда и бутылка водки - валюта"" #bitcoinconf #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/wNsrcJ5HeT      — Bitcoin Conference (@BitcoinConfRu) April 23, 2014    There had been some confusion over whether the conference was actually going ahead, thanks to a prohibitive regulatory climate surrounding digital currency in Russia, and the earlier 'indefinite postponement' of a rival conference, Moscow Bitcoins, that was scheduled for last month.  A highlight of the conference came when one speaker was asked whether bitcoin was banned in Russia. The reply was: ""Nobody knows, and nobody cares.""  International speakers at the event included the well-known Roger Ver, as well as George Basiladze of UK payment processor Cryptopay and Dr Bastian Brand, Investment Manager of the Pathfinder Cryptocurrency Fund (PCF) at Pathfinder Capital in Germany.  A top Russian Bitcoin news source: @CoinSpot has brought one of the first Bitcoin ATM machines to Moscow! pic.twitter.com/9cCndiktcI – Roger Ver (@rogerkver) 23 April 2014  Local startup and bitcoin news service CoinSpot even brought a Lamassu bitcoin ATM/vending kiosk to demonstrate at the event.  Current legal status  As in neighboring China, rumors of a government ban remain just that – a rumour – and there has been no official statement other than denials of a ban by the authorities themselves.  A recent request for clarification received the response that authorities were mainly interested in “combating crimes in the sphere of the economy"".  That said, it appears the government is discouraging bitcoin use from becoming widespread, with blocks on some deposits and withdrawals from exchanges. Funding of Russian rouble accounts on the region's most popular exchange, BTC-e, was stopped in February.  Other options  Technically, Russians are still not allowed to fund BTC-e rouble accounts via the most popular method, payment processor OKPAY.  Russian sources tell us, however, it is still possible to fund accounts indirectly by depositing funds into an OKPAY rouble account and transferring for free to Payeer, another processor, and forwarding those funds to BTC-e.  Since 19th March, it has also been possible to transfer to BTC-e via Yandex Money at no charge, though there is a two-day waiting period for funds to clear. Withdrawals are also indirect.  Users can move their funds to Yandex Money for a 2.5-5% fee and a 12-hour waiting period, or move funds first back to Payeer and then into a Yandex/QIWI Visa debit card.  There's also the option to withdraw US dollars to a Visa or Mastercard account, but the $1,000 minimum is higher than the average monthly salary in Russia. There are also options to transfer money to OKPAY and that company's payment cards via US dollar or Euro accounts, but this must also be done indirectly.
