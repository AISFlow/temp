42379497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888J5,1495143910,Cryptocurrency Market Cap Tops $60 Billion to Hit All-Time High,"The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high today, passing $60bn as the innovative assets continued to draw robust inflows.  This figure reached $63.6bn at one point during the day's trading, according to online data service CoinMarketCap, which represented a weekly, monthly and quarterly increase of roughly 18%, 115% and 220%, respectively.  While analysts cited different variables as fueling these gains, one factor they noted was growing awareness of cryptocurrencies, one that is finding them emerge as a more diverse set of investments than observed previously.  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, spoke to this development, stating:  ""Cryptocurrencies are finally hitting the general consciousness whereas before they were marginal, with the possible exception of bitcoin.""  As the assets draw ""increased media coverage,"" Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, told CoinDesk new investors are coming to the space. The growing interest in the space is also being felt at his over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, which has been seeing a rise in business activity.  ""Our onboarding rates have experienced a massive spike and our trading volumes, at mid-month, have already increased exponentially compared on a month-to-month basis. We do not see this quieting any time soon,"" he said.  When asked whether his company has experienced an increase in this activity amid the recent rally in cryptocurrency prices, Harry Yeh, managing partner of Binary Financial, told CoinDesk:  ""There's definitely a larger demand, not just for bitcoin, but [for] everything across the board.""  Where next?  As for where cryptocurrency prices (and therefore total market cap) will go next, analysts offered mixed views. While the total value (and number) of assets in this space has surged in recent months, it is difficult to tell how much further they can climb without developing compelling value propositions.  Yeh offered an optimistic point of view, telling CoinDesk that ""we are just getting started"".  ""People still don't really understand that there is a lot more room for this to move because it's a global phenomenon now. Expect more moves up but also some pullbacks like in the last week,"" he said.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, offered a more cautious stance, telling CoinDesk that the market was ""reaching the frenzy point"". He expressed doubt as to how much longer these values would hold, noting that while nobody knows for sure when a bubble will pop, there are always warning signs.  Eliosoff stated that in this case, a ""crackdown"" on initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which developers create new cryptocurrencies to fund projects, would likely spur a downturn.  He also asserted that should bitcoin prices see a downturn, the cryptocurrency space could see diminished confidence.

42379489,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8881T,1495136707,Congress Seeks Answers From IRS About Its Bitcoin Tax Investigation,"Congressional leaders want answers about the Internal Revenue Service's ongoing effort to obtain user records from digital currency exchange startup Coinbase.  In a letterhttps://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.05.17-Coinbase-Letter-Hatch-Brady-Buchanan.pdf dated 17th March, Senator Orrin Hatch, along with Reps. Kevin Brady and Vern Buchanan, took aim at the IRS, questioning the basis of its investigation and requesting information about its broader strategy on digital currencies. The letter was addressed to IRS commissioner John Koskinen.  Hatch is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Brady is the chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, while Buchanan leads that body's Oversight Subcommittee.  The three wrote:  ""...we strongly question whether the IRS has actually established a reasonable basis to support the mass production of records for half of a million people, the vast majority of whom appear to not be conducting the volume of transactions needed to report them to the IRS. Based on the information before us, this summons seems overly broad, extremely burdensome, and highly intrusive to a large population of individuals.""  The move comes months after the IRS sough to to compel Coinbase to produce the records, a court effort that began in November. At the time, the IRS said it was seeking information about the startup's bitcoin customers as part of an effort to prevent potential tax avoidance. The IRS declared digital currencies a taxable form of property in 2014.  Since the IRS first went to court, both Coinbase and one of its customers moved to stifle the effort. The tax agency later asked another judge to approve its initial summons, and earlier this week, a pair of Coinbase customers (who are seeking anonymity) asked a federal judge in California to halt the tax agency's summons.  According to the letter, the three members of Congress are seeking info about the IRS strategy on digital currencies – which its own watchdog has criticized as deficient and in need of an overhaul – as well as the justifications for its effort against Coinbase. The group said it wants answers before 7th June.  Notably, the three also asked whether the IRS would take a more hands-off approach to digital currencies in order to facilitate adoption.  ""Will the IRS consider a de minimis exemption or other action to remove practical obstacles to such moderate, transactional use of digital currencies?"" the letter stated.

In a new blog post, the company said it was appealing to firms that want to test the tech for possible applications in a more timely fashion, estimating that existing conditions could mean as much as $300k in expenses and development times as long as a year.  According to Microsoft, the framework entails the prototype blockchain network, relevant APIs, as well as a Hashing Service and a Signing Service to support the testing. Microsoft's Azure cloud service – one of the central planks of the company's blockchain strategy – sits at the heart of the framework.  Microsoft added that it intends to demo the new framework during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference, which is being held next week in New York.  ""With the framework, customers and partners can focus on creating truly innovative applications that demonstrate the potential of blockchain, and spend less time and resources on integration tasks that required to get even a basic PoC up and running,"" the company said.

42379492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888Cn,1495115999,More Live Blockchains? IBM Launches New Enterprise Accelerator Effort,"After more than a year of working intensely on blockchain R&D, global tech giant IBM hasn't seen many of its projects go live.  Of 400 clients enrolled since it first began its blockchain projects last February, just a dozen active networks are operational, according to the company's VP of blockchain technologies, Jerry Cuomo.  But, today, the company is hoping to change that with the launch of its IBM Blockchain Founder Accelerator.  Described broadly, the founder accelerator is an outgrowth of a problem perhaps not unique to emerging technologies. As explained by Cuomo, there are simply too many companies casually interested in blockchain technology, and only a limited number of somewhat veteran professionals who can help assist in the launch of real live networks.  Cuomo told CoinDesk:  ""There's more interest than there's people to go around. The best thing we can do for our community is to have more live networks. Graduating them through quicker will make sure the practices will get reflected back to everyone.""  Cuomo went on to describe the offering as one that would sit on top of IBM's Bluemix Garage, an effort that has seen the firm open in-person facilities for client engagement on distributed ledger tech. The IBM Blockchain Founder Accelerator will go a step further, pairing serious builders with more specialized support.  ""The program provides one-on-one mentorship and support by network founders and technologists across a range of needs such as business case development, network membership incentives, technical development, governance and legal issues,"" IBM wrote in its official press release.  In total, eight founders will be selected for the program, who will gain access to workshops and bootcamps, its founder mentors and specific blockchain technology solutions that IBM has built with partners over the last year. These include a document storage solution, an asset provenance tracker and an identity onboarding tool.  Still, the paid program aims to be selective, according to Cuomo, who framed the effort as one that will ensure projects with the ""most likelihood of succeeding"" are able to access code and legal reviews, as well as its other support offerings.  Cuomo also said that scholarships and financial support may be made available to select candidates, and that the program would offer tiered access that makes pricing more flexible.

42379505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88891,1495112411,"Bitcoin Startup Blockchain Adds Uber, UBS Execs to Leadership Team","Bitcoin wallet and data company Blockchain has expanded its leadership team with two new executive hires.  Perhaps most notably is the addition of Sarah Maxwell, a former communications lead at Uber, who left the ridesharing giant in 2016 to join the staff of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Maxwell has been appointed to lead Blockchain's global communications team.  Before joining Uber in May 2014, Maxwell had been working as a White House staffer since 2010, and, prior to that, served as a senior account executive at the San Francisco-based BergDavis Public Affairs, according to her LinkedIn bio.  Blockchain’s second new exec is Xen Baynham-Herd, who has been brought on to become the company's lead economist, focusing on new initiatives for the brand. Baynham-Herd previously worked as a director at the London office of Swiss investment bank UBS.  The new appointments demonstrate Blockchain's continued interest in tapping premier executive talent for its operations, following the addition of former Barclays Bank group chief executive Antony Jenkins to its board of directors last December.  Founded in 2011, Blockchain is the largest provider of software wallets for the bitcoin network. Headquartered in Luxembourg, the startup has so far raised $30m from backers including Lightspeed Venture Partners and FuturePerfect Ventures.

42379499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888Lb,1495108775,Decentralized Ethereum Token Trading Goes Live With 0x Launch,"Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol 0x has gone from white paper to functioning early-stage application in three months – all without leveraging an initial coin offering (ICO) to raise funds (so far).  Revealed today, the early stage over-the-counter (OTC) platform for exchanging ethereum-based tokens is expected to start settling trades soon after the publication of this article.  But what’s going on under the hood of the application, called 0x OTC, is about more than just creating a new way for token owners to trade, according to 0x advisor and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Ehrsam explained how the manual process launched today is just the beginning of a larger plan to automate the trading process, creating a cryptocurrency switchboard that could someday power a network of decentralized applications.  He said:  ""If you’re running a truly decentralized application, you ideally do not want to be calling a centralized exchange for what is really just critical infrastructure to run your application. You are ideally going to want to do things that are native to the blockchain.""  What it does  0x OTC is designed to let counterparties exchange tokens built using the ERC20 token standard without the assistance of a centralized exchange. Users can generate and cryptographically sign and share orders using a variety of off-chain communication channels and execute the trades directly on the blockchain.  At launch, users will be able to trade ERC20 ether tokens, MakerDao tokens, Melon tokens, 0x protocol tokens, Augur tokens, Digix DAO tokens and Golem Network tokens.  Initially, the open-source smart contracts powering the free trades will be deployed on the Kovan network co-developed by Digix, Etherscan, Parity, Maker, MelonPort and several others.  The exchange, backed by investors including Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital, is not a real-time public order book, according to a statement provided to CoinDesk. Instead the platform, which will host an ICO later this year, was designed to make it easier for entrepreneurs to build decentralized exchanges that can charge increasingly competitive fees.  0x co-founder Will Warren said:  ""We believe the quickest path towards realizing our vision is by developing free tools that massively lower the barrier to entry for new for-profit exchanges and their respective markets.""  The need for interoperability  The release of 0x OTC marks an advance towards a more decentralized infrastructure for building cryptocurrency applications, according to Ehrsam.  Last month, Ehrsam penned an article about why he believes the decentralized application market stalled in 2014, just when he was expecting it would explode.  Unlike in 2014, when decentralized app builders had few tools, he now paints a picture of an increasingly mature developer stack in the form of file storage provided by firms such as IPFS and Storj, for example; external data from oracles including Augur; and a monetization model in the form of token sales.  But each of those tools is powered by a native token, and to interact with each other, they will require a seamless means of exchange, perhaps similar to what 0x launched today.  Ehrsam concluded:  ""The real vision in the future is that all of this is being done programmatically in the background as decentralized applications are running and using these pipes that you can use right now in a manual demo.""

42379486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8885F,1495105220,The World Is Watching: Can WannaCry's Creators Cash Out Their Bitcoin Ransom?,"The hackers behind the infamous WannaCry ransomware have had a lucrative week. So far, they have racked up almost $80,000 in bitcoins. But their next step may be more difficult – they still have to figure out how to move that money, without giving themselves away to authorities.  The well-publicized cyber-attack, which began in Asia, has locked up hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Once a computer gets infected, a tab pops up demanding a $300 payment in bitcoin to unfreeze the data.  Shockingly, despite no clear evidence that anyone who pays the ransom actually receives the promised decryption keys to unlock their encrypted files, some people have been putting up the funds, sending their bitcoin off to one of the hacker's three bitcoin wallet addresses.  But now, with the world's cybercrime teams watching those bitcoin addresses, the question is: Will the hackers be able to launder that money and spend it? Or, is the money tainted, traceable, and therefore worthless to the thieves?    Follow the coins        Originally bitcoin was touted as an anonymous payment vehicle. But over the years it has become clear that bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than truly anonymous.  Bitcoin addresses, payments and transactions are all visible on the blockchain. And by analyzing transaction patterns, it is possible to trace money and find the actual parties behind the public keys – strings of numbers bitcoin uses to identify its participants.  As WannaCry is the most widespread bitcoin ransomware attack in history, the criminals behind it have garnered a lot of attention. So, if they want to actually spend their funds, they will have to find a clever way to remove all links from the original bitcoin addresses.  As of right now, though, the bitcoins are still sitting untouched, and the trail is cold.  Hiding their tracks  So what are the options for the bad actor(s) behind the ransomware attack?  Laundering bitcoin is a little different from laundering fiat money, but is just a matter of applying the right tools, according to Emin Gün Sirer, a professor at Cornell University. According to him, technologies already exist for shedding so called ‘tainted’ bitcoins – they just require a little technical know-how.  One of the simplest processes is ‘chain hopping', where bitcoins are converted into other digital currencies, usually at offshore exchanges. “Following the trail gets quite difficult as the coins cross jurisdictions and change shape,” Sirer told CoinDesk.  Another technique known as ‘tumbling’ would allow the hackers to pool their ill-begotten bitcoins with other people's coins.  In a bitcoin tumbling service, coins from different sources are mixed together and then re-disbursed. Conceivably, the hackers could repeatedly mix their coins until the coins were diluted enough to throw law officials off their path.  But Ethan Heilman, the Boston University researcher behind TumbleBit, a proposed bitcoin tumbler, indicated that mixing bitcoin is risky business, especially when dealing with larger sums of money. As he pointed out, one of the problems the hackers may run into is finding a large enough number of bitcoins to adequately mix with.  ""Even if they mix the coins such that they will be hard to follow, if the WannaCry hackers make a mistake and join the coins back together, those coins could become vulnerable to clustering and other blockchain analysis techniques,"" he said.  Further, it is unclear how effective most mixers actually are, Heilman added.  Newbie mistakes?  Notably, the fact that the hackers used only three bitcoin addresses to collect their money suggests they don't know much about bitcoin privacy. Had they used a unique bitcoin address for each computer WannaCry infected, the money would have been a lot more difficult to trace.  In a LinkedIn post, Neil Walsh, the UN’s head of global cybercrime, pointed to that and other shortcomings in the ransomware to suggest the hackers are likely in over their heads.  He wrote:  “We estimate that the attackers are relatively unskilled, and are probably unprepared for the impact their malware turned out to have. It is quite possible that they are unsure how to launder the bitcoin funds safely.”  However, as Sirer pointed out, hacking is a rich, stratified ecosystem, and the people who put together the exploit may now be looking for an expert at laundering coins. Or, they may simply be biding their time before attempting to retrieve the funds.  He concluded:  ""The authorities are revved up right now, and time will help dilute their focus. The hackers can probably afford to wait, potentially for a long time.""

42379501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888PN,1495098058,Meet the 5 Finalists for CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 Startup Contest,"After sorting through hundreds of applications, we're down to the final five.  CoinDesk's second annual ""Proof-of-Work"" startup competition is gearing up to take place in New York at Consensus 2017 next week. There, a select group of up-and-coming blockchain startups will compete for the admiration of our all-star investor board – and $10,000 of no-strings-attached prize money.  For those who can't make the event, we're giving a sneak preview of our selections, which, while different in design and implementation, showcase the breadth of the big ideas dominating the sector.  Here are the five startups competing in this year's event:  1. Livepeer  Describing Livepeer as a crypto-token protocol for peer-to-peer live video broadcasting, Doug Petkanics, the startup's co-founder, believes the startup could be the ""media layer"" of a decentralized internet stack.  Using smart contracts and the ethereum blockchain, Livepeer envisions itself as a peer-to-peer video platform that uses incentives newly developed with blockchain tech.  ""Any broadcaster can send a live video stream into Livepeer, and the nodes on the network will take care of transcoding it into the different bitrates and formats necessary to be playable on the majority of devices on the planet, at various connection speeds,"" Petkanics told CoinDesk.  According to its co-founder, the main advantage is that users who run Livepeer nodes will be able to earn tokens for contributing their computing power in exchange for hosting and distributing videos.  2. Health Wizz  Health Wizz is a mobile app, allowing its users to aggregate health data from wearables and electronic health records systems.  ""Your health data is scattered all over the place, and there is nothing that brings one's health records from different sources under the control of the user,"" Raj Sharma, CEO of Health Wizz, told CoinDesk.  He continued:  ""Once users aggregate their health records on their mobile device, they are able to share this data on blockchain with their doctors and make it available for research or creating personalized medicine for themselves.""  Developed by a team of physicians, software engineers and developers, Health Wizz uses a number of physical and mental health parameters based on standardized medical literature, according to its website.  ""Having talked to hundreds of users and their doctors, we realized that if we make this available to users, the quality of care they receive can improve dramatically, and it would also eliminate the waste associated with duplicate tests,"" Sharma said.  3. Credit Dream  Credit Dream is a blockchain-based decentralized application with the aim of ensuring universal access to credit by connecting investors and borrowers.  Developed by a Brazil-based team, Credit Dream offers both Meu Crédito, a mobile app for last mile origination of the loans, and Swapy, an ethereum-based exchange that enables investors to buy and sell securities related to the performance of the loans.  Credit Dream's CEO Edmilson Rodrigues told CoinDesk: ""As the founders are Brazilians, we felt the problem of the access and cost of credit in our own skin. In our country, 40% of the population is unbanked and the average loan costs 145% per year.""  Credit Dream offers a two-fold solution with its two apps, as one creates loan origination and a credit scoring model, and the other connects international investors with local credit companies.  At the event, Credit Dream will give a live demo of its technology, enabling audience members to invest in digital currency contracts.  4. Øx  Øx, an open protocol designed to facilitate the low friction peer-to-peer exchange of ethereum assets, has already secured the backing of Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital and Blockchain Capital, among others.  Yet, it's still in startup mode.  Will Warren, the startup's co-founder and CEO, said, in the two years that have passed since ethereum's genesis-block, numerous decentralized applications have created smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange, but that few have risen to the level of disrupting existing regulated exchanges.  ""Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations,"" he explained.  However, Øx believes it will offer improved functionality on such services.  5. Oaken Innovations  An early-stage startup focused on the intersection of blockchain and the Internet of Things, Project Oaken has already won at least one award for its efforts so far this year.  Speaking broadly Project Oaken seeks to unite hardware devices (known as 'ACORNs', short for IoT Machines with Autonomous Communication Over Redundant Nodes) in a network that are connected via a software platform based on ethereum. The idea is that these networked machines can then participate in applications that require smart contract-powered automation or value transfer.  ""It is apparent that IoT on traditional cloud based server stack infrastructure has many flaws, namely the lack of security, privacy, decentralization and value transfer,"" the company said in a statement.  Project Oaken is now looking to deploy its solution in specific verticals with select partners.
