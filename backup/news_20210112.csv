The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday the two companies have officially called off their planned merger in the wake of the DOJ's lawsuit last year that sought to block the deal.  The DOJ filed a civil antitrust suit on Nov. 5, 2020, to stop the merger, claiming Visa is a monopolist in online debit, charging both consumers and merchants billions of dollars in fees each year to process online payments.  ""Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visa's online debit services,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. ""With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services.""

42405698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedtOs,1610489254,Multiple Tokens See Rally Amid Looming ‘Alt Season’,"As prices for bitcoin and ether retreat from their recent highs, the strong performance of other cryptocurrencies indicate traders and investors may now be turning to alternative coins (altcoins) for potential high returns.      Data compiled by CoinDesk Research shows that as of Jan. 11, prices for both bitcoin and ether were about 87% and 78%, respectively, of their all-time highs. Yet, other CoinDesk 20 assets were still far from their highest prices on record. One possible implication is that these tokens may still have potentials to reach higher price levels amid the latest bitcoin’s bull run.      “We have seen [altcoins] pump – both before and after [Monday’s] correction – in ways that we have not really seen since 2017,"" Andrew Tu, an executive at quant firm Efficient Frontier, said.      Bitcoin's market capitalization hit a new record high on Jan. 8 but has dropped since then, evidence that some traders may be taking some profits from bitcoin and plowing them into altcoins, according to Tu.      As CoinDesk reported previously, following the institution-driven 2020 bitcoin bull run, retail investors and traders have joined the rally for “fear of missing out.” Some entry-level investors viewing the high-numbered trading price of bitcoin – unaware that it can be bought in minute fractions – take to altcoins because their relatively low price make them appear affordable      One example appears to be the recent double-digit gains in XRP. A seemingly inexplicable rally happened shortly after its price crashed on the news the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Inc., claiming the company sold the token as a security.      Tu said tokens that in the popular decentralized finance sub-sector of the crypto space have logged particularly strong performance.      Prices for synthetix (SNX), a token for a decentralized trading platform for minting and exchanging synthetic tokens mirroring the price of other assets, logged a new all-time high on Tuesday at around $16.01. As of press time,it traded at $14,78, up 28.54% over 24 hours, according to data from Messari.

42405702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedtSo,1610488272,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hovers Around $34.2K While Options Traders Pay Up for Possible ETH Upside,"After a record day in spot volume, bitcoin’s price went up, down and back up. Meanwhile, most ether options traders are bearish, some are paying up in case it gets close to record highs.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $34,278 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $32,528-$36,605 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below the 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price had an up-and-down day, going as high as $36,605 at around 08:00 UTC (3 a.m. ET), falling to $32,528 at around 14:30 UTC (9 a.m. ET) and then going back up to $34,278 as of press time.      Andrew Tu, an executive for quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, sees the $36,000 price level as “resistance,” an area where bearish traders seem primed to hit the sell button on bitcoin. “Right now bulls are challenging the $36,000 resistance. It failed to get past $36,600 earlier during the afternoon Asia hours,” Tu told CoinDesk. “When the U.S. East Coast woke up, the market started bidding the price upwards again.”      Monday’s bitcoin spot volumes were the highest ever seen since CoinDesk 20 data on eight major spot exchanges began being recorded. An astounding $13.3 billion in volume was traded Monday, the highest since Dec. 22, 2017, when volumes hit $9.7 billion.      Yet, spot volumes were much lower Tuesday, at $5.1 billion as of press time.      “There will likely be a battle to bring this past that $36,000-$36,600 range,” said Efficient Frontier’s Andrew Tu.      Volume will likely play a factor in that battle given the blockbuster spot exchange activity at the week’s open. However, that was due to large amounts of selling, which caused the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to dump 20% within 24 hours.      Read More: Bitcoin Whales Kept Accumulating During Monday’s Crash      “Bitcoin peaked at $42,000 immediately before a weekend,” said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at trading technology firm TradeStation. “Volume dries up when institutional investors are away and other markets are closed. That left bitcoin hanging out in the middle of thin air, with no buyers to support it.”      In the bitcoin options market, traders seem to like their chances of a $30,000 price per 1 BTC at Jan. 21 expiration. The probabilities based on the market have a 62% chance of bitcoin over $30,000 by that date, a 55% chance of $32,000 and a 47% expect the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to be $34,000 closer to the end of the month.      “Bitcoin is a volatile asset,” said TradeStation’s Russell. “You cannot expect anything to double in a few weeks and not pull back.”      Read More: As Bitcoin Regains, Options Traders Bet on $52K Move by Late January      Michael Gord, chief executive officer of trading firm Global Digital Asset, said he expects institutions to continue scooping up bitcoin, which might help support the asset at a $30,000 price point and above. “I think we’re going to see a huge resurgence as big brands start to collateralize their treasury on the blockchain.” he said.    Bets are being placed on potential ether FOMO    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $1,085 and climbing 6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      On Monday, the amount of premium traded on Deribit’s ether options market heavily favored calls, which give owners the right, but not not the obligation, to buy an asset at a particular price. Ether’s all-time spot price high sits at $1,448, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      While the ether options market heavily favors strikes below the $800 spot ETH price point, 68% of call premiums paid Monday are apparently from traders looking to hedge out any risk of another parabolic rise in ether, according to data aggregator Genesis Volatility’s Tuesday investor note.      “Option traders are willing to pay up much more for ETH upside option exposure than they are for downside exposure,” Genesis wrote. “This activity indicates traders see an asymmetry in price action volatility, also known as ‘crash up risk’ and FOMO sentiment.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Tuesday.

42385591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2OeD,1610486650,How the OCC Is Building Crypto America (and Saving Banks From Extinction),"Over the last 12 years, $1 trillion of value has appreciated into existence. It may be a little more or a little less tomorrow, give a few $100 billion. It may one day reach $10 trillion or $100 trillion or stay at $1 trillion forever. It may even go to $0. But regardless of all that, $1 trillion of value has indeed materialized and grown on blockchain-based financial networks since 2008.      If you are a financial advisor or a trust company, you have missed out on $1 trillion in capital appreciation for your customers. Regardless of how we spin it, the core fact is that crypto assets have largely been un-advised. They have not been distributed by fiduciaries to the mass market. Instead, they have either (1) been directly owned by retail investors through crypto exchanges or decentralized apps or (2) been packaged and secured for safe handling by newly buy-side funds for the largest endowments and family offices in the world. That means retail and mass affluent investors are doing it for themselves at Coinbase or Binance or MetaMask.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    This pattern joins a similar fact base for stock trading. Passive exchange-traded fund asset allocation assets have gone through the roof, in part because they are the choice of fee-based financial advisors and wire houses that now control about $10 trillion in assets under management. Selling a diversified, cheap asset allocation as your core investment is a stable market equilibrium. It is logic. It is statistics. It is math incarnate. Who will argue with Bill Sharpe?      But the animal spirits (John Maynard Keynes’ term for what drives investors) are emotion and feeling. The animal spirits are narrative and story. The animal spirits are inequity, wealth redistribution, billionaire witch hunts and revolution. The animal spirits are a cry for help from under a massive, endless pile of useless, unavoidable debt.      Instead of financial advisors or other CFAs guiding the retail market in good decision-making, a newsfeed of what’s popular has driven Apple, Google, Tesla and the other John Galt hallucinations to the stratosphere. Don’t get us wrong. We love the robot as much as the next fintech commentator. But it is clear to us that “the masses” are not being “advised.” And that the capital appreciation that matters – cementing the next trillion-dollar networks for global future generations in work yet to emerge – is misunderstood and misrepresented by most financial professionals to their clients.      Your clients won’t be your clients if crypto hits $10 trillion. As a reminder, total U.S. M1 (money supply) is about $7 trillion, the tech market caps on the Nasdaq during the dot-com bubble were $3 trillion, all gold ever mined is $8 trillion, global FX reserves are $10 trillion, total equities are around $100 trillion and all asset classes (including real estate, art and pork bellies) add up to $500 trillion. So the crazies are not crazy for being crazy.    The OCC white knight    It is in this context that we want you to understand the recent “interpretive letters” from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. But first the background.      American financial regulation is an alphabet soup and has grown out of politics and crises. It looks to the past, taking the fact patterns in mistakes underlying market crashes and banking crises to create executive structures that prevent those same mistakes happening again. Banks and investment advisers are under the supervision of different authorities. Banks can’t sell you stock (generally) and wealth managers can’t sell you bank accounts (generally); though, of course, they can if packaged up into a bank holding company. If you’re big, you can do anything.      The OCC is part of the U.S. Treasury Department. So is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as the Internal Revenue Service. FinCEN wants to make sure you don’t launder money and that know your customer/ant-money laundering informaton is sufficiently captured to allow some amount of sovereign control and leverage over the moneys within the U.S. economy.      The OCC has a different set of goals. It supervises banks and it wants to make them safe and competitive. The current acting comptroller of the OCC is Brian Brooks, a former chief legal officer of Coinbase, the crypto brokerage (though he will reportedly be leaving the OCC soon). While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is skeptical of cryptocurrencies, Brooks is a clear proponent. But it doesn’t boil down to just personality – there is structural, causal complexity underneath.      While there are about 4,000 banks in the U.S., and about as many credit unions, some of them are federally chartered under the OCC and some of them are state chartered. You can see that the overall share of regulated banking entities at the federal level is hovering around 20% to 30%. This creates a novel tension and a couple of key dynamics.      First, there are large returns to scale in being a bank. Assets at the giant, federally regulated banks like Citi and JPMorgan Chase, are ballooning. Deposits at small, state-scale banks are falling. Second, fintechs (e.g., Square, SoFi) are naturally availing themselves to intra-state commerce by having a digital distribution footprint. They default to seeking federal charters as well. This is why the OCC has spent so many calories on defining special purpose fintech charters, and why the local community bodies hate it.      Being a national body, the OCC competes with other national regulators like the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. or the Monetary Authority in Singapore for the best financial regulatory “product.” It must attract global capital and global talent. It is counterparty to organizations that engage in such games. So you can think of the OCC’s crypto posture as either (1) resulting from the DNA of the organization or (2) the impact of third-party pressure on the organization.      The most credible critics suggesting option (2), i.e., regulatory capture by the industry, are Angela Walch and Tim Swanson. I do not want to mischaracterize their arguments, so I recommend you click through on the links. At the core, their concerns focus on shadow banking (i.e., “risky” non-banking banking) and the mismatches in goals between non-expert crypto developers and economic policy experts. The state-level authorities play a different game. They participate in inter-state competition (i.e., is New York better than Wyoming?) and try to minimize the influence of federal overreach. Economically larger states want to defend their current position, including defending their large banking constituents, while smaller states want to lower switching costs so new entrants choose to charter there. This is why Wyoming pioneered a banking charter with Caitlin Long, which has been granted to crypto exchange Kraken in September 2020 and is now available to others.      Now, let’s say you are the OCC. A state like Wyoming has set precedent – almost like the legalization of cannabis use or the adoption of other progressive social policies. You see China launching a central bank digital currency. You see the Ethereum ecosystem with $25 billion in stablecoin deposits. You see American companies building U.S. dollar-denominated digital asset products to compete globally. You see Facebook and Google trying to eat into your banking sector. How do you defend your turf? How do you start to lay down the road, brick by brick?      Where is the road going?      On July 22, 2020, the OCC published Interpretive Letter #1170, allowing national banks can custody crypto assets.      On Sept. 21, 2020, the OCC published Interpretive Letter #1172, on holding stablecoin reserves. National banks can hold stablecoin reserves for customers.      On Jan. 4, 2021, the OCC published the OCC Chief Counsel’s view on the use of Independent Node Verification Networks and Stablecoins for Payment Activities. National banks can run blockchain nodes and use stablecoins for payments.      You can see the jigsaw puzzle coming together, even if the OCC’s letters are not the letter of the law. They can be challenged in court and they can be re-written by Congress through legislation. But they are today’s guidance for the financial industry, and in particular the national banking giants that hold $15 trillion of depository assets. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan are – by the stroke of the pen – crypto asset custodians, crypto payment companies and miners in blockchain networks.    What this means for the future    Allow us, for a moment, to raise our head above the trees to look at the forest.      Banks are quasi public-private institutions, attached to sovereign power. The central bank adjusts money supply to imperfectly target inflation, employment and growth. Banks create leverage of that money supply by lending out the money to consumers and businesses, which then circulates, gets deposited and lent out again. Narrow money of M1 today is about $6 trillion, while M2 is $19 trillion – about three times as large. This is a loose example of private-sector leverage that funds growth.      On the crypto side, a similar thing is happening in decentralized finance (DeFi). Instead of sovereign power, money is backed by software and the collateral it secures. In depositing ETH or other assets into Maker, you mint the DAI stablecoin. This can then be used to purchase other assets, which can be committed as collateral into lending markets like Aave or Compound to generate yield. Staked assets can then be further structured or wrapped into pools that earn market making fees on Yearn or elsewhere. Money is levered up and expands, creating leverage.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The Smart Money Economy      Bitcoin remains scarce, as does ether. Financial industries apply those scarce assets to economies for (hopefully productive) investment.      Back in the bank world, the banks must keep regulatory capital buffers to ""ensure” the stability of the overall system. There is some percentage of assets committed against systemic collapse. To be a node in the traditional financial system, you must put capital aside to prevent a run on the bank and generate some sort of “trust” in the entire game. That capital yields a particular return, and must have a certain low risk profile. Bank of America alone has over $150 billion in such capital.      We think there is an analogy and lesson to be drawn here to crypto miners. Most next-generation crypto protocols use some staking, rather than proof-of-work mining, concepts. Whether you are a liquidity pool provider in DeFi or staking within Ethereum 2.0 to generate consensus, the committed capital is returning some rate of return for standing up a financial service. That capital is generating trust in the overall network, and a collateralization buffer in certain instances. While the analogy is not exact, we hear the rhyme in the poetry.      Banks should be large-scale miners or validators of blockchain networks. They already know how to do this. Many crypto natives will proclaim that this would imply a takeover by the system by the financial incumbents. That’s too simplistic. It would imply interoperability between existing economies and Web 3.0. It would bridge the global consumer makers into blockchain-based commerce.

42385604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2OuZ,1610483685,"CEX, Lies and Videotape: Binance Accuses Rivals of Fighting Dirty","While many U.S. crypto exchanges are using the latest bull run to spruce themselves up in hopes of impressing institutional investors and regulators, China’s so-called “Big Three” centralized crypto exchanges (CEX) – Binance, Huobi and OKEx – are slinging mud at each other.      The latest flap is over a bogus video that purports to show a single sell order of 21 million bitcoin on Binance on Jan. 4. The clip went viral last week on WeChat, a popular China-based social media platform.      The video, viewed by CoinDesk, claims that bitcoin’s price took a hit after the order was completed. Screenshots in a WeChat group’s chats show that some users appear to be furious, accusing Binance of “market manipulation.”      The angry reactions ignored the fact that the 21 million number alludes to the total amount of bitcoin that will ever be mined, sometime by the year 2140 (bitcoin’s total supply currently stands at 18.6 million). So clearly 21 million bitcoin could not have been sold. Besides, most major exchanges’ bitcoin reserve data are available to trace.      But because we’re nothing if not thorough, CoinDesk confirmed with several on-chain data firms, including CipherTrace and CryptoQuant, that no orders of that size were placed on Binance at the time the video purports to show.      A Binance executive spoke out about the video on WeChat, throwing shade at unnamed “competitors” he claimed were behind the video.      The video ""could not be more fake,” Yi He, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Binance, wrote in Chinese on WeChat. “I was not going to respond because I thought nobody was going to believe it, but considering how ‘hard-working’ our competitors were to post it on every group chat, I just wanted to express my appreciation.”      As of press time, Binance did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.      If you looked at English-language social media platforms, you would think the three China-originated centralized crypto exchanges coexist in peace and harmony. But a survey of Chinese-language platforms reveal a differing dynamic. Screenshots of chats and public posts on WeChat and other popular Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo show multiple disputes among the three exchanges over the past several years. This is not the first time Binance’s He has confronted executives from rivals OKEx and Huobi on social media.      He’s accusations notwithstanding, both Huobi and OKEx denied responsibility for the latest incident. Ciara Sun, vice president of global business at Huobi Group, denied Huobi was involved in “the creation of the video,” and told CoinDesk the video “falsely” recorded a sell order on Binance’s platform.      “As a global financial organization that adheres to both ethical and regulatory standards, we value honesty and transparency within our organization and do not rely on misleading marketing tactics that would erode the trust of our community,” Sun said.      Likewise, OKEx CEO Jay Hao told CoinDesk that crypto exchanges are often the victims of false accusations of “price manipulation.”      “Anyone with knowledge of this industry would immediately be able to dismiss a photo like this, but it's unfortunate that some investors still suffer from these types of groundless and fictitious accusations,” Hao said.    It’s not just business, it’s personal    Normal business competition, centered on capturing market share in China, is only one part of the tensions involving the three exchanges. These hard feelings go back at least four years, when OKCoin’s then-CTO, Changpeng Zhao, and co-founder Yi He left what was at the time the largest Chinese crypto-to-fiat exchange to start Binance, according to Colin Wu, a China-based crypto writer who previously worked in the country’s crypto mining industry.      Meanwhile, OKCoin, along with other China-based bitcoin trading platforms, closed their trading operations in the country and moved offshore after Chinese regulators banned initial coin offerings in late 2017. OKEx has worked as a separate entity from its parent company OK Group or OKCoin since 2017, a spokesperson told CoinDesk previously. OKCoin now is a San Francisco-based crypto exchange, led by Chief Executive Hong Fang.      Huobi joined the fray slightly later and friction among the three exchanges really intensified after each launched crypto derivatives products. OKEx currently is the second-biggest derivatives exchange by bitcoin open interest, followed by Binance and Huobi. (The CME is the largest thanks to growing interest from institutional investors in the U.S.)      Several sources, who agreed to speak on the subject anonymously due to close business relationships with the three exchanges, told CoinDesk that as the competition heats up again there may be an uptick in tricks and false information such as the fake Binance video. In turn it can cause a lot of “fear, uncertainty and doubt” (FUD) among retail traders and investors in China, especially those who are relatively new to the market.      “The video came out at a time when retail sentiment was at the peak,” one source said. “When people are scared of the top, they could be easily aroused by anything like this.”      “No matter how much the cryptocurrency space has matured, there will always be interested parties from without who leap at the chance to cause FUD amongst traders,” OKEx’s Hao said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/12/cex-lies-and-videotape-binance-accuses-rivals-of-fighting-dirty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c15254958320fe25456ec02ad4dd8fe055c694fb-1200x741.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brian Brooks, who is currently leading the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will leave the federal agency within the next few days, Politico’s Victoria Guida reported Tuesday.      Brooks was named Acting Comptroller last summer after first joining the agency in March. He was nominated to serve a full term by President Donald Trump. However, with Trump’s loss in the November presidential election and the Democratic Party retaking the Senate earlier this month thanks to the results of the runoff election in the state of Georgia, it appears more likely President-elect Joe Biden will nominate his own choice to run the agency.      In an email, OCC Deputy Comptroller for Public Affairs Bryan Hubbard “refused to confirm such rumors.”      Brooks, the former general counsel at Coinbase, has had a major impact on the OCC’s crypto approach during his brief tenure. During his term, the OCC published several interpretive letters or made statements announcing that banks can provide services to issuers of stablecoins, partner with crypto custodians, conduct payments using stablecoins and operate nodes on blockchain networks.      Possibly his most far-reaching impact came from his push for fintech startups – like crypto companies – to secure national banking charters, allowing them to operate throughout the country without needing to apply for each state’s money transmitters license.      To date, BitPay, Paxos and Anchorage have filed for these charters.      However, the crypto-friendly regulator drew backlash from members of Congress, six of whom wrote an open letter after the election asking Brooks to focus on economic relief during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than crypto regulations.      Read more: ‘Inherently Borderless’: Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi      Rep. Maxine Waters, the chair of the Financial Services Committee, went a step further, asking Biden to rescind all of the OCC’s crypto-related guidance as part of a broader effort to revoke the rules implemented under Trump’s tenure.      Brooks has been an advocate for a digital dollar and the crypto space more broadly, and likened decentralized finance (DeFi) to self-driving cars in an opinion piece in the Financial Times Tuesday morning.      These “self-driving banks,” as Brooks put it, could create money market interest rates algorithmically, replacing human committees, and could enable broker-less trades. They could also increase liquidity risks or create asset volatility.

Meanwhile, the number of active bitcoin addresses and transaction volumes has climbed above peaks set in 2017.      Also, content moderation decisions from Amazon, Shopify and Twitter following the Capitol riots in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 have put efforts to “decentralize” the web into sharp relief.      Few, if any, crypto-based protocols or platforms have matured to that level, though there are encouraging signs. Yesterday, Sci-Hub moved to the “uncensorable” Handshake network, preserving its rich database of pirated academic research.    Top shelf    Activity peaks There were over 1.3 million active bitcoin addresses in a single day last week, the most since the crypto bull run of 2017. Similarly, trading volumes are treading new ground – largely driven by retail interest, analysts say – above peaks set three years ago. Bitcoin OGs weighed in on “how far we’ve come” between the two bitcoin rallies.      Uncensorable web Sci-Hub has launched on the uncensorable Handshake network. A database of pirated academic research, SciHub has long faced domain name revocations and attempts to wipe it from the web – but now Handshake’s alternative, distributed domain name architecture will help keep it alive. The fight to decentralize the internet’s basic protocols was thrown into relief by Twitter, Amazon and Facebook’s heightened and unprecedented content moderation decisions in the week following the Capitol riots.      Bitcoin APIs Digital asset manager NYDIG is joining forces with banking technology provider Moven to offer plugins for banks that want to launch bitcoin products.

Bitcoin options traders are placing bids for a $52,000, $64,000, and $72,000 BTC strike price, indicating that despite a 20% dip to $30,305 on Monday, the bulls are still roaming. Bitcoin is around $34,000 at press time, well shy of weekend highs above $40,000.    At stake    Hashrate distribution A frequent criticism of the Bitcoin ecosystem is the centralization of hash power contributed to secure the network. For years, the mining market has coalesced in China due to an abundance of cheap electricity, the proximately of mining machine giants and low production costs.      According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, China dominates the mining sector, accounting for nearly two-thirds of contributed hash power. The U.S. comes second with approximately 7% of the global hashrate, followed closely by Russia and Kazakhstan. It’s worth noting these metrics are based on a limited sample size.      Further, only 10 mining pools are responsible for 70% of bitcoin’s hash power, Casa CTO Jameson Lopp noted in a blog post this summer.      Detractors point to this concentration – at the national and corporate level – as a fault line for Bitcoin security. If malicious actors gained control of the network, they could perpetrate a 51% attack, which is a way to double-spend bitcoin or otherwise tamper with the blockchain’s record of transactions.      “In 2020, Bitcoin has […] become a highly centralized system that places an increasing amount of trust in a small number of large entities. Any centralization of Bitcoin network hash power should be of concern as it erodes the trustless model of the network,” TokenAnalyst, a cryptocurrency research firm, claimed last year.      While Lopp is seemingly in support of distributing power away from mining pools, he doesn’t see this concentration as a three-alarm fire. Hasu, a pseudonymous crypto researcher, also thinks concentration is harmless.      “[B]itcoin’s design doesn’t assume mining power is widely distributed. It’s simply not a requirement. Instead, it only assumes miners are rational, which is something completely different. Rationality means agents do what is best for them, even if that means colluding with other miners to attack the system,” he wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed.      Research has shown the costs of attacking a well-secured blockchain network would likely surpass the gains made. Further, in practice, a double-spend is not a death sentence. Ethereum Classic, a less-active fork of Ethereum, suffered three double-spend attacks in 2020 and is still chugging along in the new year, after a number of security updates.      Even if not a pressing threat, there is still a cause to decentralize bitcoin’s computing power. Nangeng “NG” Zhang, CEO of mining giant Canaan, noted there’s a growing trend chipping into China’s dominance.      “[B]itcoin miners have traditionally relied on the cheap electricity powered by hydroelectric plants in the Sichuan province as their source of renewable energy. But when you consider that hydropower is only available during the wet season in China, six months of the year, it’s no surprise that bitcoin miners have cast their eyes to more innovative and sustainable sources of energy across novel jurisdictions,” he wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed.      Several firms, including Layer1 and Northern Data, have set up shop in Texas, attempting to leverage the state’s abundant supply of cheap electricity and business-friendly environment. Layer1 even announced the audacious goal of usurping some 25% of the bitcoin hashrate in the coming years, though the company has had some notable blowbacks.      Now, Kentucky looks set to become the next center of U.S. crypto mining. A pair of lawmakers introduced legislation offering tax breaks to cryptocurrency miners.      As Zhang concludes: “In reimagining a mining ecosystem that is both sustainable and viable, we will do well to plan strategically for the long term and not only consider short-term wins – whether it’s in tech or profitability – focusing instead on the complete integration of commercial, sustainability and environmental goals.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/12/blockchain-bites-bitcoin-rebounds-addresses-above-2017-peak-sci-hub-decentralizes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/884bb5116ac857db35eb0b499d100b230df83459-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385597,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Ogj,1610468304,UK Treasury Calls for Feedback on Approach to Cryptocurrency and Stablecoin Regulation,"The U.K. Treasury has released a consultation paper to gather feedback from stakeholders concerning the government's regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.      The consultation solicits opinions on how the U.K. can make sure its regulatory framework is ""equipped to harness the benefits of new technologies, supporting innovation and competition, while mitigating risks to consumers and stability,"" and incorporates advice from the Cryptoassets Task Force.      With a large proportion of crypto assets falling outside regulatory oversight, the Treasury says they may pose a risk to consumers and lack financial safeguards.      The U.K. is planning a ""a staged and proportionate approach"" to new crypto asset developments, taking a focus in the paper on stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that generally aim to have a stable value by being backed by assets such as the U.S. dollar.      “[T]he landscape is changing rapidly. So-called stablecoins could pave the way for faster, cheaper payments, making it easier for people to pay for things or store their money. There is also increasing evidence that [distributed ledger technology] could have significant benefits for capital markets, potentially fundamentally changing the way they operate,” said John Glen, M.P., the Treasury’s economic secretary, said in the paper's introduction.      However, he said, such developments could ""pose a range of risks to consumers and, depending on their uptake, to the stability of the financial system.""      The consultation focuses particularly on developing a ""sound regulatory environment"" for stablecoins, which the U.K. government considers have most ""urgent"" risks and opportunities.      Since the announcement of the Facebook-backed libra project (now rebranded as diem), regulators and governments worldwide have raised concerns over the potential effects of so-called global stablecoins on financial stability and even monetary sovereignty.      The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has already issued guidance on crypto assets – including ""exchange tokens"" like bitcoin, ether and XRP – setting out which do and don't fall under its jurisdiction in July 2019.      This new consultation will focus on the roles of crypto assets and stablecoins in payments and investment, as well as the use of blockchain or distributed ledger technology in financial markets. It will also look at additional regulatory actions that might be required in the space.      Read more: UK’s FCA Warns Investors of High-Risk Crypto Investments and Scams      The paper marks the second Treasury-led crypto consultation. The first, announced last summer and concluded in October, set out plans to increase oversight into cryptocurrency promotions in order to protect investors. The results will be published ""in due course,"" the Treasury said in the new paper.      The FCA recently banned the sale of derivatives and exchange-traded notes, saying it considers the products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the potential harm they pose.

42387607,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQloBh,1610466182,"Tron Is Out, Dai Is Back: CoinDesk 20 List Updates for 2021 Q1","The surge in cryptocurrency trading in the last three months of 2020 led to one change in the CoinDesk 20: tron (TRX) has been taken off of the list of the top crypto assets traded on verified markets while Maker’s dai (DAI) stablecoin has returned.  Verifiable crypto volume nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2020, as bitcoin surged to new all-time highs. Volume on eight trusted exchanges used by CoinDesk hit $239.98 billion in Q4 2020, up from $90.08 billion in the prior quarter, according to Nomics.  The increase in trading volume varied across the CoinDesk 20 list of the most-traded crypto assets, with some seeing quarter-over-quarter declines. However, there was little turnover.  The exception was tron. The no-fee Ethereum rival did not keep pace with other major assets and fell out of the CoinDesk 20 ranking. It was replaced by dai, the dollar-pegged stablecoin used in Maker's decentralized finance (DeFi) network, which makes a second appearance on the list.  The new CoinDesk 20 list is as follows.  The CoinDesk 20 is a list, not an index. Its methodology uses volume data from eight exchanges, compiled by Nomics. The eight exchanges were selected, vetted and verified by all three of a trio of studies on fake and verifiable volume, published in 2019 and 2020. They are: Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex.  Last week CoinDesk announced the acquisition of TradeBlock, a provider of crypto-asset reference rates and indexes for financial institutions. This addition could result in methodology changes in the future, disclosed in advance, to improve the utility and robustness of the reference points the CoinDesk 20 provides on crypto markets.  Here's the quarter-to-quarter percentage change in volume for each CoinDesk 20 asset, reported from these eight trusted exchanges, including both dai and tron.  The CoinDesk 20 includes stablecoins, such as dai, which are pegged to fiat currencies because their trading volume and market cap are relevant to providing a picture of investment and trading activity in crypto markets.  Dai rejoins stablecoins tether (USDT) and usd coin (USDC) on the CoinDesk 20 list, after a quarter's absence. In Q3 2020, dai was pushed out of the CoinDesk 20 list, along with four other assets, in the list's largest quarterly turnover to date.  Here is how every asset on the new CoinDesk 20, plus tron, performed last quarter.  The CoinDesk 20 methodology will be reviewed and revised periodically. If you have questions or comments on the method, please email them to research at coindesk.com.  Note: Due to a calculation error, four assets were listed incorrectly in the 2021 Q1 update to the CoinDesk 20. Cardano, dai, ethereum classic and 0x should have been excluded. In their place, compound, polkadot, uniswap and yearn.finance should have been included in the list.",NEUTRAL,DAI,ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | DAI,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/12/tron-is-out-dai-is-back-coindesk-20-list-updates-for-2021-q1,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd0279036bea74709128739a70abe0af1ece94af-954x508.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385607,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Ox5,1610460246,First Mover: Market Signs Look Healthy as Bitcoin Sell-Off Subsides,"Bitcoin (BTC) was down for a fourth straight day, though changing hands well above Monday's low around $30,000. After soaring to a new all-time high around $40,000 last week, prices have tumbled about 13% since Saturday, the most for a three-day stretch since March 2020, according to TradingView.      ""Volatility is the price you pay for performance,"" as the investing-legend-turned-bitcoin-bull Bill Miller put it last week to CNBC.      In traditional markets, Asian shares rose on Tuesday and European indexes were little changed. U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. The possibility of further economic stimulus and turbulent U.S. politics helped push yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes to 1.16%, the highest since March, according to CNBC.      According to Bloomberg News, that political situation could entail the U.S. House of Representatives impeaching President Donald Trump with fewer than 10 days to go in his presidency because Vice President Mike Pence appears unlikely to invoke constitutional authority to remove the president from office.      Gold strengthened 0.9% to $1,861 an ounce.    Market moves    A high price does not a market make. But guess what does? High trading volume.      One of the important things to note about the bitcoin market during this year's rally is the record amount of cryptocurrency changing hands. That was true of the rapid ascent to new all-time highs above $40,000, and it's also been true on the way down.      What it means is the market is staying liquid, seen as a healthy attribute especially when prices are on the move. You might be a buyer at what might seem like nosebleed levels, but you're not the only one.      As reported Monday by CoinDesk's Muyao Shen, trading volumes and active addresses for bitcoin have now surpassed their previous all-time highs during the last crypto bull run of 2017.      ""This is first and foremost a sign of how much bigger and mature the industry is, with a lot more money flowing on these exchanges,"" Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. ""It is great to see higher volumes, making the market more liquid and efficient.""      The surging volume due to Monday's sell-off came in part from newcomers to the market, according to Schei.      ""Some of this volume is definitely from new and unexperienced investors entering the market for the first time and panicking when the price starts falling,"" he told Shen. ""These corrections are necessary and healthy, even in a bull market.""      And those newcomers aren't necessarily rubes. They might even be sophisticated Wall Street players who have only recently dipped their toes into crypto – a sign of bitcoin's increasing adoption by big institutional investors as a way of betting on the currency debasement amid trillions of dollars of central bank money printing.      ""The retail-driven spot market, which was pretty much the entire market three years ago, is now part of a much more mature and diverse marketplace that includes derivatives, investment funds and other institutional involvement."" Sui Chung, chief executive of CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk.      (For what it's worth, healthy liquidity is considered such a crucial component of any market that last year the Federal Reserve cited ""smooth"" functioning of Wall Street's plumbing as a rationale for continuing its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, a form of monetary stimulus that was previously considered an emergency measure but is increasingly seen as normal.)      Alongside the flurry of activity on cryptocurrency exchanges, there has also been robust traffic in bitcoin derivatives – financial contracts such as futures, options and ""perpetual swaps"" traders can use to bet on the cryptocurrency's price.      The Chicago-based CME said Monday its notional bitcoin futures volume climbed to a monthly record of $30 billion in December, exceeding the then-record $20 billion traded in November. The exchange launched its bitcoin futures contract in January 2018.      At least one industry executive says futures markets might become more critical as more investors hoard their cryptocurrency holdings while waiting for prices to go up.      ""With 'physical’ bitcoin disappearing, the volumes of derivative contracts are soaring,"" said Richard Byworth, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange firm Diginex, which last week launched its own ""bitcoin perpetual futures contract.""      There's high risk, too: The market was apparently liquid enough that some $410 million of long positions in bitcoin futures (bets on further price gains) were wiped out Monday after margin calls on the Binance exchange, according to the data firm Glassnode in a tweet.      All of this just makes it more likely that the bitcoin market is reflecting the wealth of opinions on where prices should be at any given time for a blockchain-based, 12-year-old, peer-to-peer electronic payment system with a fixed issuance schedule that is now seen as a hedge against potential debasement of the U.S. dollar.      Simon Peters, of the trading platform, eToro, wrote Monday that ""we can look to the $70,000-$90,000 range as a price target for the end of 2021."" Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter bitcoin trader, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey the latest sell-off might be ""just be a bump in the massive bull run – $100,000 this year is totally possible!”      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, says there's a ""good deal of open options interest at the $52,000 price level.""      With trading volumes growing, it's getting easier to place those bets, whether right or wrong.      - Bradley Keoun      Read More: Bitcoin’s Active Addresses, Trading Volumes Now at All-Time Highs    Bitcoin Watch    Despite bitcoin’s 20% crash on Monday, some options traders are betting on a continued price rally in coming weeks.      Some 4,000 call option contracts have been bought at the $52,000 strike in the past 24 hours, according to data from the Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas. The $64,000 and $72,000 strike call options show buying volume of 3,250 and 2,000, respectively.      The call options carry an expiration date of Jan. 29, so they represent a gamble that bitcoin could prices could rise above that level in the next few weeks.      These deep out-of-the-money trades are relatively cheap and tend to gain significant value if the price rally materializes, yielding big returns on small investments. As such, seasoned traders with bullish price expectations often buy call options at higher strike prices, on the chance that they might pay out. So the fact that traders are actually using them could indicate bullish market sentiment.      In another indicator from the options market, the one-, three- and six-month put-call ""skews,"" which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, remain entrenched in the negative territory. That’s a sign of call options, or bullish bets, drawing higher demand than puts, which are bearish.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: As Bitcoin Regains Lost Ground, Options Traders Bet on $52K Move By Late January    What's hot    Bitcoin exchange Bakkt inks deal with SPAC Victory Park Capital that will result in its becoming a publicly traded company with $2.1B enterprise value, hires Citigroup's former consumer-bank technology chief as CEO (CoinDesk)      Eye-popping projection for $3T crypto market underpins Bakkt deal (CoinDesk)      Institutional investors use ""refill"" strategy to avoid revealing big orders for bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase (CoinDesk)      Tether mints record 2B USDT in one week, pushing total to 24.6B, up fivefold over past year (CoinDesk)      Crypto investment company NYDIG acquires Digital Assets Data, brings co-founders (and brothers) Mike and Ryan Alfred on board (CoinDesk)      Aragon One CEO Jorge Izquierdo resigns in protest of ""governance"" decisions (CoinDesk)      ICYMI: European eToro traders call foul over closure of leveraged crypto contracts (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Well-known bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach says stock market's elevated valuations are ""supported by massive amounts of stimulus,"" sees consumer price inflation hitting 3% rate in May or June (CNBC)      Fewer than 40% of Americans could pay a surprise $1K bill from savings (Bankrate)      Federal Reserve system's profit surged 60% to an estimated $88.8B in 2020 as emergency asset purchases boosted interest income while interest expenses fell (Federal Reserve)      U.S. commercial landlords have granted billions of dollars in rent relief to struggling storefronts (WSJ)      Pandemic drives municipal borrowing to 10-year high (WSJ)      Blacklisting of Chinese stocks prompts banks to delist hundreds of derivatives (WSJ)      Apple is reportedly planning to create self-driving electric vehicles where it will outsource production via an established automaker (Nikkei Asia Review)      Small businesses to receive further help from the U.S. pandemic loan program, with $284 billion in additional funding provided to those most in need (Reuters)    Tweet of the day",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Muyao Shen, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/12/first-mover-market-signs-look-healthy-as-bitcoin-sell-off-subsides,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cf28279968007af001760348a71b673f05641de-1350x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trusts for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, litecoin and the Digital Large Cap Fund are now again accepting clients, according to its website but the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is not.  On Dec. 21, the cryptocurrency asset manager's website said the six products were “unavailable"" to new investors.  While no explanation was given, the move was not unusual: Grayscale periodically closes off its crypto trusts to investors.  At press time, the XRP Trust is also closed.  On Jan. 5, Grayscale announced the removal of XRP from its Digital Large Cap Fund after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging it had conducted an unregistered sale of securities with the XRP token.  Data tweeted by Grayscale on Monday showed assets under management were at $24.5 billion, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust making up the lion's share with $20.6 billion.

42385600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2OoH,1610456984,NYDIG Taps Fintech Firm Moven to Bring Bitcoin to Your Bank,"Digital asset manager NYDIG is joining forces with banking technology provider Moven to offer plugins for banks that want to launch bitcoin products.      The move comes in the wake of several letters from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency giving banks the green light to custody crypto and the ability to conduct payments and other activities with stablecoins.      “Being able to offer it on our platform for U.S. banks, it’s the right time frankly,” said Moven founder Brett King. “If PayPal and Square can do it, then community banks should be able to do it, too.” Many of Moven’s clients have around $1 billion in total assets, he said, with some operating with up to $10 billion in total assets.      NYDIG is Moven’s second partnership in the U.S., said King. It partnered with banking tech provider Q2 in November of last year.      NYDIG came out of $10 billion Stone Ridge Asset Management in 2017, hired BitLicense architect Benjamin Lawsky and secured $50 million in funding to build out the team. In December, it hired Patrick Sells away from Manhattan-based Quontic Bank to serve as its head of bank solutions. This week, the firm announced it had acquired Digital Assets Data to pad its crypto research and analytics offering.    See also: Charles Cascarilla: PayPal Whisperer    Moven advertises itself as a turnkey digital banking product that can be deployed in 30 to 60 days. The partnership will allow NYDIG to deploy its bitcoin products to banks quickly, Sells said.      Moven will be taking advantage of NYDIG’s APIs to offer buy, sell and hold services as well as more sophisticated bitcoin products like a money market account that pays interest in bitcoin or a credit card that has a bitcoin rewards component, Sells added.      “What’s important for any new technology is how easy adoption is,” Sells said. “Even though it may be very small bitcoin balances.”    See also: Crypto Asset Manager NYDIG Hires Tech-Savvy Banker to Pitch Its Wares to Institutions    NYDIG charges a fee for custody with storage options that are overseen by consultancy giant EY. In a low-interest-rate environment, Sells said he predicts banks will flock to a new form of earning revenue.      In an online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers shared exclusively with CoinDesk, NYDIG found that 80% of bitcoin holders would move their crypto to a bank if it had secure storage. Of those same holders, 71% would switch their primary bank account if a bank offered bitcoin-related products and 81% would be interested in buying bitcoin through their bank.      NYDIG is aiming to provide a less-risky option for banks that want to offer bitcoin products to their customers, Sells said. Banks that use the digital asset manager’s bank solutions don’t have to touch crypto.      “As a former banker … one of the things I realized is that for catching up to something like peer-to-peer payments, that really came at a cost for my bank,” Sells said. “Today banks have a 0% wallet share in crypto and this is a phenomenal non-interest income opportunity.”      Read the NYDIG survey:",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/12/nydig-taps-fintech-firm-moven-to-bring-bitcoin-to-your-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cf45e64b5445b25b74ef56b1916de78717e87e7-1500x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release on Tuesday, US$5 million in the form of a grant will go towards funding the day-to-day operations of the project's managing foundation.  The foundation is a not-for-profit designed to steward Filestar's network before a decentralized autonomous organization is established, a spokesperson told CoinDesk.  ""We see potential in the project to transform the storage mining landscape and establish a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace for computing-power and bandwidth sharing,” said Ryan Chen, director of strategy at Hashkey.  Filestar said it aims to improve upon decentralized network Filecoin and its distributed storage mechanism by removing the initial pledge collateral requirement.  The pledge requires miners of Filecoin to commit resources in order to participate in its economy – a measure Filestar says can greatly affect smaller miners.  Filestar is also preparing to launch a staking program that would enable community members to earn the network's native STAR tokens, cast votes for miners and participate in ""important decisions for Filestar’s future.""

42385601,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2OpX,1610452800,FinCEN's Crypto Rules Aren't as Unfair as Jack Dorsey Says,"Over the last few weeks, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, has been inundated with 7,477 angry comments about a rule change it proposed just before Christmas. “Impressive ineptitude,"" says one anonymous commenter, while another writes, ""touch bitcoin and you will feel the wrath u moneygrabbing pric [sic].""    Dozens of industry leaders including from Coinbase, Fidelityhttps://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/FidelityDigitalAssets-FinCEN-Comment-Letter.pdf and Coin Center have also filed more serious comments.    What's at stake? Up till now, exchanges like Coinbase haven't bothered to de-anonymize the non-custodial wallet owners that either send cryptocurrency to exchanges or receive cryptocurrency from exchanges. In effect, if you had a few thousand dollars in bitcoins in a paper wallet, Coinbase wouldn't ID you if you transferred those bitcoins to a Coinbase account.      FinCEN – a bureau of the US Department of the Treasury that defines rules for combating money laundering – has proposed changing this. U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions dealing in cryptocurrency would be required to start collecting information about owners of non-custodial wallets. (FinCEN refers to these as unhosted wallets). This means less privacy and an end to seamless deposits or withdrawals.      But the 7,477 letter writers aren't only upset about reduced usability and less privacy. They also claim the rule is unfair. Square's Jack Dorsey says the rule ""creates a double standard between them [cryptocurrency transactions] and legacy cash transactions that occur between financial institutions and individuals."" Kraken, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, claims the rule ""shatters parity"" among money service businesses.      See also: 65K Comments and Counting: Crypto Industry Fights ‘Arbitrary’ Treasury Rule      I sympathize with many of the concerns aired in the 7,477 letters. The new rule forces owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets to give up vital personal data. Financial institutions will have to build expensive systems to collect and store this information. And to boot, the rule proposal was issued with just 15 days for public comment, much of this over Christmas and New Year's. (Proposed rulemakings usually come with at least 30 days to respond).      But I disagree with claims about unfairness. Cryptocurrency is inheriting the same regulations that already apply to other forms of money transfer.    Not unfair    A key part of FinCEN’s Dec. 23 proposal is a new recordkeeping requirement. All U.S. financial institutions dealing in cryptocurrency would have to keep records on unhosted cryptocurrency transactions in excess of $3,000. This would mean collecting and verifying the name and address of anyone who wants to transfer more than $3,000 in cryptocurrency onto an exchange from a self-hosted wallet, and also the reverse of that, collecting names and address of owners of unhosted wallets to which withdrawals of more than $3,000 are made.      This isn’t a new thing. Since 1996, FinCEN has required money transmitters like Western Union and MoneyGram to abide by a $3,000 recordkeeping requirement. The rule proposed in December would extend this to money transmitters like Coinbase that transmit cryptocurrency.      Let me illustrate. Say that a stranger walks into a Western Union outlet with $3,000 cash and asks the agent to transmit it overseas. The Western Union agent is required to ID that stranger and keep a record of the transaction. This obligation arises from a FinCEN recordkeeping requirement that all money transmitters collect and verify personal information from transmittors other than established customers for any transaction above a $3,000 dollar threshold.      Now let’s translate this rule into the cryptocurrency space. A stranger walking into a Western Union outlet with $3,000 cash is just like an anonymous unhosted wallet owner requesting Coinbase to transmit $3,000 in bitcoin to a Coinbase account. If Coinbase and Western Union are to be held to the same standards for dealing with transmittors other than established customers, then Coinbase should also have to collect information about the owner of this unhosted wallet.    Cryptocurrency is inheriting the same regulations that already apply to other forms of money transfer.    The same applies to payouts from exchanges. When Coinbase is asked to make a withdrawal to an anonymous unhosted wallet, this is the equivalent of Western Union being ordered to provide cash to a stranger who is waiting at the counter. The law already requires Western Union to collect and verify personal information from recipients other than established customers for all transactions above $3000. Shouldn't Coinbase also be required to ID recipients that are not established customers?      Cryptocurrency fans can take at least some comfort that FinCEN’s new rule would treat cryptocurrency transactions with a lighter touch than traditional fiat transfers. In an earlier October 2020 proposal, FinCEN suggested that the 25-year old recordkeeping threshold be reduced from $3000 to $250. So a stranger who visits Western Union wanting to send $250 would now have to be identified, where before the trigger point was $3,000.      Luckily, FinCEN does not intend to apply this stricter $250 threshold to cryptocurrency transactions. Exchanges like Coinbase that deal in cryptocurrency would be subject to the separate, and looser, $3,000 recordkeeping threshold proposed on Dec. 23. This lighter touch makes sense. From a money laundering perspective, cryptocurrency is not as risky as fiat.    Earth to FinCEN: 'We care about privacy'    Fair or not, the rule won’t stop cryptocurrency users from feeling furious. FinCEN is well aware of this. From 2008 to Dec. 22, 2020, the day before it issued its unhosted wallet rule proposal, it received 3,724 submissions from the public in response to its rules and notices. A typical proposed rule change might have attracted 50 lawyerly responses. The 7,477 comments that have been lodged since Dec. 23 represents 67% of all public responses FinCEN has ever received!      Many of these comments mention privacy. FinCEN and other regulatory agencies that implement anti-money laundering rules have historically given short shrift to privacy concerns. The explosion of comments is a stern reminder the public cares about this issue. And while this probably won't stop the extension of existing money laundering law into crypto, it may start to affect the discussion about thresholds.      See also: JP Koning - Druckenmiller, Jones and Bitcoin’s Perfect Trading Machine      When FinCEN discusses the level at which to set thresholds (such as the $3,000 threshold for recordkeeping), it is trying to balance a number of conflicting concerns. These include its duty to fight the crime of money laundering, the administrative burden faced by the private sector, and the impact on financial inclusion. If thresholds are too strict, financial institutions will find them too costly to implement, and vulnerable members of society will be excluded from making payments. Too loose and FinCEN is not doing its job of stopping money laundering.      The 7,477 angry comments will oblige FinCEN to consider, perhaps for the first time, financial privacy in its decision about where to set thresholds. Why a $3,000 recordkeeping threshold? Might not privacy concerns merit a $5,000 trigger? Personal privacy should not only be a factor in setting cryptocurrency thresholds. What about the $10,000 threshold on cash transaction reporting, or the new $250 ceiling faced by money transmitters like Western Union?      I have no idea how FinCEN will react to the public’s response. But one thing is for sure.

42385606,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Ovp,1610451608,"As Bitcoin Regains Lost Ground, Options Traders Bet on $52K Move by Late January","Despite bitcoin's 20% crash on Monday, some options traders are betting on a continued price rally in coming weeks.      At the press time price of $35,580, bitcoin is up nearly 16% from the low of $30,305 observed on Monday. Even so, the number one cryptocurrency by market value is still well short of the weekend highs above $40,000.      Some traders, though, have been buying Jan. 29 expiry call options at the $52,000, $64,000 and $72,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.      A call option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option is a bullish bet, while a put option is a bearish bet. One options contract represents the right to buy or sell one bitcoin on Deribit.      A total of 4,000 contracts have been bought at the $52,000 strike in the past 24 hours, according to data provided by Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas. The $64,000 and $72,000 strike call options show buying volume of 3,250 and 2,000, respectively.      Theoretically, the purchase of the $52,000 strike call is a bet that bitcoin would rise above that level on or before Jan. 29, making the option ""in-the-money.""      Currently, the three contracts are out-of-the-money (OTM), with the spot price well below these strike prices, and are trading at 0.045, 0.0260 and 0.0190 BTC, respectively.      The deep OTM options are relatively cheap and tend to gain significant value if the price rally materializes, yielding big returns on small investments. As such, seasoned traders with bullish price expectations often buy call options at higher strike prices.      Therefore, the latest call option purchases at the $52,000, $64,000, and $72,000 strikes indicate bullish market sentiment. Other option market indicators are making a similar call.      The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, remain entrenched into the negative territory. That's a sign of call options, or bullish bets, drawing higher demand than puts.      According to analysts, on-chain fundamentals remain strong and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. ""Don't let short-term $BTC price action distract you. Fundamentals are strong, the network is healthy. Zoom out and HODL,"" Rafael Schultze-Kraft, CTO at the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, tweeted.      However, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time charting a quick move to fresh record highs above the peak of $41,962 reached on Saturday, given the U.S. Dollar Index is witnessing a recovery rally, weakening bitcoin and gold's appeal in the markets.

Users will be able to buy goods and services with the digital tokens on IMVU's platform, while earners will be able to convert tokens into cash if desired.  “While most virtual platforms allow users to earn in-game credits, those credits cannot be converted into anything that holds value outside of that platform or game,” said John Burris, chief strategy officer.  The token will be sold initially at a rate of 250 VCOIN for $1, or $0.004 per token.  On Nov. 17, the SEC published a “no-action letter,” effectively granting IMVU permission to offer VCOIN to users, albeit with strict restrictions on how these tokens may be sold.

The number of bitcoin “whale entities"" – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – rose slightly to a new record high of 2,140 on Monday. The increase came even as the cryptocurrency's price collapsed by more than 20% to hit a low of $30,305.      The violent sell-off was fueled by heavy selling in the spot market and was accompanied by record trading volumes. That, however, did not deter big players from accumulating the cryptocurrency, which rallied by 300% in 2020 and hit a record high of $41,962 over the weekend.      See also: Bitcoin Whales Buy Low, Sell High; Retail Investors Chase Rallies: Data      The dip demand suggests that large investors expect the pullback to be short-lived. The cryptocurrency has seen corrections of more than 20% during previous bull markets. Further, the latest bull market is backed by institutional money, compared to previous ones which were more speculative frenzies. As such, occasional price drops are unlikely to scare away the whales.      Whale address numbers have increased by nearly 25% year on year and have risen by 200 in the past two weeks. The bull run could soon resume, as the network remains healthy and other on-chain indicators are biased bullish, as noted by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, CTO of blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      Also, sell-side liquidity issues, which aided the third quarter's meteoric rally, could persist, as 78% of all bitcoin (14.5 million BTC) is now illiquid. ""It paints a potential bullish picture for bitcoin in the upcoming months, as less bitcoins are available in the network to be bought,"" Glassnode said in a recent report.    Weak hands crowded out    Data provided by Glassnode also shows some retail investors or weak hands (investors lacking confidence or resources to hold assets for the long term) have liquidated holdings.      The number of addresses holding less than 0.01 BTC dropped slightly from 8.54 million to 8.53 million total addresses, indicating that some participants responded by selling the drop.      See also: Bitcoin Bull Run: OGs on Why This One’s Different      It's worth noting that metrics based on addresses may not reveal a precise picture, given a single person or entity may hold multiple addresses.

42385589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Ocx,1610438400,Ethereum-Based Nexus Mutual Expands Its Decentralized 'Insurance' to Centralized Exchanges,"Nexus Mutual, a startup that provides a decentralized alternative to insurance, is extending its community-based offering to cover users of well-established cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and Gemini.      Until now Nexus, which uses digital tokens to revamp the traditional idea of mutual cover, was only focused on the world of decentralized exchange (DEXs), specifically catering to the explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is susceptible to hacks and losses.      However, centralized exchanges also get hacked on a semi-regular basis, and traditional insurance cover within the crypto industry remains thin on the ground and prohibitively expensive. Indeed, for many large exchanges, the balance sheet is basically the insurance fund, as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has noted.      Nexus takes a different approach, offering cover to users themselves, rather than relying on an insurance policy held by the exchange – or not, as the case may be.      “We are expanding to provide coverage for centralized exchanges, starting with the big ones like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, which is a product we’ve had really strong demand for,” said Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp in an interview.      None of the exchanges mentioned returned requests for comment.    How it works    Nexus Mutual takes a completely decentralized approach to what it calls “discretionary cover.” The firm employs the U.K.’s legal framework of a discretionary mutual, where members have no contractual obligations to pay claims. It applies this to a pool of digital NXM token holders, which uses the Ethereum public blockchain to track proportional ownership of the fund and a governance system to approve or decline payment of claims.      “You don’t have to rely on the insurance that the exchange may or may not be able to purchase themselves, you can come to Nexus separately and get covered, independently of the exchange,” Karp said. “Hopefully, we can provide a community solution to the existing limited-capacity sore point in the industry.”      The centralized exchange cover from Nexus will pay a claim if an exchange gets hacked and the user loses more than 10% of their funds, or if withdrawals are halted for more than 90 days, Karp explained.      “Currently, end users find it very difficult to assess the protections centralized exchanges have in place, like how much contingency funds do they hold back or what proportion of funds does the exchange have its own insurance on,” Karp said.      Nexus members can perform various roles, including being a customer by purchasing cover, assessing claims by voting or assessing risks by staking NXM tokens against specific risks. (For example, if you want to back Compound, you stake NXM against Compound; if you want to back Coinbase, you stake against Coinbase.)      “When the new product launches, Nexus Mutual risk assessors will first have to decide whether to back the risks by staking NXM tokens against them,” said Karp, a trained actuary and the former U.K. CFO at Munich Re. “The more secure an exchange is perceived to be, the more likely risk assessors will back it. Once sufficient staking has been established, cover purchases will go live and members of the mutual will be able to purchase cover.”      Nexus emerged sometime after the infamous DAO hack which rocked the Ethereum community back in mid-2016. The need for additional cover in the nascent DeFi space was underlined with an ironic twist last month, when Nexus founder Karp’s personal account was compromised in a targeted attack resulting in the loss of some $8 million in tokens.      Commenting on the attack, Karp said it was “quite scary” just how targeted it was.      “I think it puts the bar a lot higher for self-custody than I ever had in my mind before. That attack vector was very specific to me,” he said. “We’re still really early in the ecosystem, and we need to get to the point of having an FDIC-insured wallet equivalent in the decentralized world.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/12/ethereum-based-nexus-mutual-expands-its-decentralized-insurance-to-centralized-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b1299e0cb4a1b14cad5d9117027d3a072b3ea62-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Beijing-based firm touted that it has become the only public, permissionless blockchain project backed by the Chinese government, according to the firm’s statement shared with CoinDesk. The project has made it in the list of 57 high tech projects, including 5G and aerospace technologies, by the Shanghai government, according to an Nov. 25 official document from its tech committee.      The funding will be used to develop the public chain’s research. The project will also support an aerospace supply chain proposed to be built on Conflux Network, the firm said.      Conflux’s project has been included in the latest Five-Year Plan by the Shanghai government according to the firm. The plan is a series of social and economic initiatives that define the country’s future economy and societal development..      China has been mostly focused on developing permissioned blockchain while being cautious about public decentralized chains, since such projects have launched initial coin offerings (ICO) to raise capital and distribute their tokens as an alternative to fiat currencies.      “While the amount of money granted is important, it is the government’s signal to support a public permissionless chain like Conflux that matters the most for us,” Conflux co-founder Fan Long told CoinDesk.      The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, has banned ICOs and clamped down on fiat-to-crypto trading since 2017. Conflux will not launch an ICO or be involved in any form of centralized token sales, according to Long.

42385578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MPp,1610416800,Babel Finance Is Letting Crypto Mining Firms Use Machines as Loan Collateral,"Babel Finance is letting bitcoin mining firms put up their machines as loan collateral so the lender can offer them better terms.      The loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for these loans is 30%, in part because Babel keeps the freshly mined crypto until the borrower pays back the loan. The LTV is significantly cheaper than the 160% Babel normally charges, which means borrowers would need to put up $1.6 million worth of bitcoin in order to borrow $1 million in U.S. dollars.      In a bull market miners are increasingly uneasy parting ways with mined cryptocurrency. These loans allow the miners to cover expenses like paying electricity bills or purchasing new equipment while giving up less BTC or ETH.      “For miners, the biggest asset they have is their machines,” said Lei Tong, Babel’s managing director of financial services. “After the March 12 price drop, they really wanted to keep as many coins as possible. Putting their machines up as a mortgage is a much better way for them to get loans versus using bitcoin.”      The service launched in June 2020 and has since accumulated $22 million worth of machine-backed loans.      To offer the service, Babel has teamed with the world’s largest ETH mining pool, Spark Pool and bitcoin mining farm operators Hashage and Heng Jia Group.      Machine-backed loans now make up almost 5% of the company’s $450 million in total outstanding loans.      Babel Finance’s primary customers are miners, and the lender is aiming to help Chinese miners compete with Western institutions who are buying up the machines in a competitive market, said Tong. These new purchasers have increased demand but supply remains low because of a scarcity of computing chips that manufacturers use to create the machines.    Read more: Bitcoin Miners See Revenue Per TH/s Nearly Triple in 3 Months    Mining farms operate the machines while holding them as collateral for Babel, and the lender keeps the mined cryptocurrency; this allows Babel to collect the full value of the loan even if the price of the machine is undervalued during a market crash, Tong said.      “Normally it would be six terms for six months,” Tong said. “When they pay the terms, we’ll release the coins mined by the machines.” Babel knows the type of mining machine that’s being offered as collateral so it can estimate the number of coins the machines should be producing.      Babel audits the machines daily by double checking the output that should be coming from each machine with the mining farms and pools. Ten secondhand machine dealers who regularly work with mining machine buyers also price the machines by looking at the computational power of the mining network and the price of the cryptocurrency, Tong said.      In the future, the lender wants to let miners use their machines to hedge against the risk of their cryptocurrency investments.      “It’s quite complicated,” Tong said without elaborating further, but he added that the hedge would protect miners from losing their profits from market crashes.

42385576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2MNJ,1610409612,Pirated Academic Database Sci-Hub Is Now on the ‘Uncensorable Web’,"After her website faced repeated domain name revocations, Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan has registered her website on the distributed domain names network Handshake.      The pirated database of academic papers is now accessible directly through the service’s portals as well as through NextDNS, a privacy-focused, cloud-based domain name service resolver which converts IP addresses into domain names.      “The DNS is like a phonebook for the internet. The addresses in the phonebook are the server IP addresses. DNS was created to give IP addresses human-readable names so with our platform, you’re finding the IP address through Handshake, not through a certificate authority,” Namebase CEO Tieshun Roquerre told CoinDesk.      For a website that has had various domain names revoked over the years and which is now suspended from Twitter, the censorship-resistant DNS will help keep Sci-Hub accessible even as the legacy domain name system applies pressure.      Sci-Hub is a worldwide database of academic publications, which pulls the research papers from under the paywalls of academic magazines and uploads them to the internet for everyone to download and read. It’s maintained by a single coder from Kazakhstan, Alexandra Elbakyan, who is raising donations via Russian payment network Yandex and bitcoin, CoinDesk wrote last year.    How does Handshake work?    Handshake is “is effectively a decentralized domain name server,” Roquerre said. Instead of using the web-standard certificate authority to authenticate user connections to a server, Handshake stores references to the IP address of the websites registered in its system. Namebase is a platform that offers users access to the Handshake network.      That way, if certificate authority firms try to censor Sci-Hub’s domain name through the legacy system, then people who want to access the site still can through Handshake’s records.      “If you get censored at the server level, you can switch servers. But if your domain name gets taken down, no one can access your site. As long as the name is intact, you can point it to any server,” he continued. Even if the band website finds a new domain, users may not know whether or not it is authentic (as an example, Roquerre said that Sci-Hub is no stranger to imposter sites).      To register a Handshake domain, anyone can propose a website name and place a bid for that website on Handshake’s marketplace with its eponymous HNS token. After a two-week auction period, the highest bidder wins the domain (whose blockchain footprint acts like an NFT, Roquerre said) and the tokens are burned.      Roquerre said Namebase does not issue tokens and it is instead mined through Bitcoin-esque proof of work.      A total number of unique 6,818 Handshake domains are actively in use while roughly 375,000 have been registered, according to Handshake data shared with CoinDesk. The same data show marketplace volume has grown 60% on average month over month and is anticipated to top $140,000 this month.    Building the decentralized web    A decentralized domain name system like Handshake could be a significant win in the fight for the decentralized web.      The project is part of a crop of so-called Web 3.0 applications vying to create a less centralized, censorship-resistant internet. Handshake, for example, has a complementary browser to create an uncensored internet search experience.      Urbit, still another web 3.0 hopeful, is more than a decade in development and relies on Ethereum to construct a platform for decentralized personal servers.      As evidenced by Sci-Hub’s own problems, the decentralized web is being built out of fears of deplatforming. As the internet’s access points are increasingly centralized in the hands of a few actors, certain applications – most recently, Twitter-alternative Parler – have faced censorship at the hands of web server providers, app stores and DNS certificate authorities.
