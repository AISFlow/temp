42381971,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNN1,1559165446,"Egypt Lifts Ban, Will Allow Licensed Cryptocurrency Companies","Egypt appears to be loosening its restrictions on cryptocurrency.  A source speaking to the Middle East News Agency described a proposed bill to ban the creation, trading, or promotion of cryptocurrencies without a license. Previously Egypt banned all cryptocurrency under Islamic law.  Shawki Allam, the current Grand Mufti of Egypt, issued that ban in early 2018, stating the technology could undermine the legal system via tax evasion, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities. The Grand Mufti was also concerned with crypto's volatility and scams.  However, as the market has expanded and neighboring countries have begun exploring the technology, the government is softening its stance.  The bill, according to the Egypt Independent, would give the board of directors of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) the right to regulate cryptocurrencies and require, multiple potentially expensive licenses to do business.  The report reads:  The new law provides legal authority for the electronic authentication of bank transactions, electronic payment orders, and transfer orders as well as for the electronic settlement of checks and the issuance and circulation of electronic checks and electronic discount orders, provided that Board of Directors of CBE issue rules and procedures regulating all the aforementioned actions.  Egypt has discussed cryptocurrency legalization for years before this move. The draft bill isn't yet available for public reading.

In short, don't call digital money ""crypto.""  The six-letter word was traditionally associated with cryptography, but in recent years has been used to refer to bitcoin and the plethora of copycats and competitors that followed it, to the chagrin of many security specialists.  Now the AP writes that cryptocurrency is:  A type of digital money that uses encryption technology to make it secure. Avoid using the shorthand crypto, which can be confused with cryptography. Cryptocurrency is not the same as virtual currency, which is used in virtual worlds such as online games. [Emphasis added.]  The Stylebook even offered a bit of commentary on the best uses for cryptocurrencies:  Although it’s possible to trace bitcoins and some other cryptocurrencies as they are spent, owners of accounts behind the transactions aren’t necessarily known. For this reason, cryptocurrency is a favored form of payments among criminals, including those behind ransomware, in which malicious software locks a computer and its data until a ransom is paid.  Every year the Stylebook adds new terms to its lexicon. This year, in addition to ""cryptocurrency,"" ""deepfake,"" ""electronic cigarette,"" and ""CRISPR"" made the cut.  Many in the industry expressed excitement at the ruling as it signals that crypto – sorry, cryptocurrency – has become mainstream enough for the wonky Stylebook to give it a nod.

Button Wallet  launched in late 2018 as a messenger-based platform for sending payments, a la Venmo. Currently integrated with Telegram, the company tells CoinDesk it has 100,000 users with 2,000 actively using the product.  “For mass-market adoption of decentralized banking, you need more people,” said Button Wallet COO Rachael McCrary. “You need to make it easier for people to buy in.”  To that end, the company’s new fiat-to-crypto functionality comes as some of the world’s most prominent messaging platforms explore crypto use cases. Facebook’s “GlobalCoin” project is said to center on payments in the social media giant’s Messenger and WhatsApp services. Telegram itself is reportedly nearing completion of its hotly anticipated Telegram Open Network (TON).  Button Wallet’s fiat on-ramp stems from a partnership with payment processor Wyre. Jack Jia, Wyre’s director of institutional sales, told CoinDesk via email:  “At Wyre, we’re on a mission to help lower the barriers to entry for crypto platforms by offering them compliant ports into a regulated fiat world. ... Helping users already familiar with Telegram to easily buy crypto and self-custody funds all within the messenger app is a major achievement by Button Wallet.”  Next steps  Button Wallet is non-custodial wallet that lets users exchange and send a variety of cryptocurrencies, typically in small amounts. The startup was funded last fall with a $470,000 pre-seed round from MIT Play Labs, Ethereum Classic Labs, Seraph Group and angel investors.  McCrary says the company has seen a concentration of users in the U.S., U.K., Indonesia, Venezuela and Germany. Initially, only U.S. dollars sent via automated clearing house (ACH) transfer will be supported for purchases. The company says it plans to add fiat currencies from Europe and Asia soon. Bitcoin, ether and DAI are the only cryptos available for purchase with dollars, though the wallet can store several other assets.  Next up, Button Wallet says it’s ready to integrate Telegram’s forthcoming GRAM token. There are also plans to plug into other messaging platforms. At the recent ETH New York hackathon, Button Wallet co-founder Alekasndr Safonov said the company built a wallet that works in Discord.  “We definitely believe in empowering people to control their own finances in any way they want,” McCrary said, adding:  “We’re just a software company giving people another option.”  Button Wallet team photo courtesy of the company",POSITIVE,DAI,ASIA | BTC | ETC | FIAT | DAI,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/29/telegram-based-crypto-wallet-app-now-allows-fiat-purchases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4c1f85fd8ed3769bc51e84121dd58e860838ab4-1280x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNiP,1559152849,Scammers Boost BSV Price With Fake Satoshi Confirmation,"Scammers boosted the price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) Wednesday by publishing a fake news alert purporting to show that BSV's creator is also bitcoin's.  Masquerading as the Chinese news site Coinbull, the bogus alert claimed that Craig Wright had transferred bitcoin (BTC) from the so-called Satoshi wallets to prove his identity.  The result? A $60 boost in the bitcoin SV price in less than 10 hours.  Wright, who led the fork that created BSV in November 2018, has maintained for years that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous architect of bitcoin, but his claims continue to be met with widespread skepticism.  If he really were Satoshi, many critics have said, then Wright should control the private keys to the wallets that mined the first bitcoin – and thus needs only to move some of those coins to settle the matter.  Hence, the ""alert"" read:  CSW transferred 50k BTC from the biggest BTC wallet to Binance, which confirmed he is the real Satoshi. As such CZ will re-list BSV and make an official apology on Twitter.  These scams are common – and lucrative.  ""The trick is easy and constantly used by many scams – all Chinese crypto media circulate the breaking news via picture as above in WeChat instead of a news link. So anybody can just use the same theme template and photoshop one,"" said Dovey Wan, founding partner at Primitive Ventures.  Coinbull responded on WeChat with its own announcement, writing:    Coinbull announcement: regarding recent malicious photoshopped image to impersonate Coinbull to spread rumors.      Recently, we have received feedback from users that certain people had maliciously sent out photoshopped Coinbull news alert to spread rumors about Binance and CSW which had bad consequences. We remind our users again not to trust any rumors and not to spread any rumors.

42381984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNdN,1559149285,Cloud Giant Salesforce Unveils First Blockchain Product for Business,"Salesforce, the leading provider of cloud solutions for business management, revealed its own blockchain solution today built on the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. Executives made the announcement at the company's tech conference, TrailheaDX.  The product, named Salesforce Blockchain, is ""a low-code blockchain platform that extends the power of CRM (client relations management)."" The company says that the solution helps users build and maintain blockchain networks, apps and smart contracts, allowing them to ""create and share blockchain objects in the same process as any CRM data object — with clicks, not code,"" according to Salesforce's press release.  Low-code is a framework that allows for drag-and-drop programming for complex apps and is gaining popularity in enterprise businesses.  The solution also helps integrate blockchain data into sales forecasts and predictions, integrate other existing blockchains with Salesforce, and ""add third parties to their blockchain with a few clicks,"" the company said.  Salesforce also named the three first clients that are testing the product right now. One of them is the research data company IQVIA, which is exploring the tech to track and validate medical drug labels. Another one, ratings agency S&P Global, is looking into how the solution can speed up the review and approval of new business bank accounts.  Chris Heusler, global chief commercial officer at S&P Global Ratings, said in a statement:  ""Leveraging Salesforce Blockchain, S&P Global Ratings has created a trusted network of reviewers, where everyone can work from a shared, transparent and auditable review process — completely reinventing and expediting how we do KYC reviews for our customers.""  The third partner, Arizona State University, is testing tracking academic records on the blockchain.  ""This network has the potential to be a game changer for integrated, seamless learning — increasing transparency of student achievements and ultimately making the exchange process of academic records easier for both learners and institutions,"" Kent Hopkins, vice president of enrollment at Arizona State University, said in a release.  While currently only selected clients are able to try out Salesforce's blockchain solution, it should be generally available in 2020, the company said.  A year of exploration  Salesforce first announced its blockchain plans at TrailheaDX a year ago when the company's CEO Marc Benioff told Business Insider he had been thinking about the idea since the World Economic Forum in Davos that January. At the forum, an attendee approached Benioff and suggested Salesforce should apply the technology in its offerings. Benioff said he was intrigued by the idea.  “And it’s like you know if you did this, this and this you could add blockchain and cryptocurrencies into Salesforce... And I’m like ‘wow’ and that’s kind of how it works,” Belioff said, according to Ledger Insights.  Earlier, Salesforce partnered with the blockchain startup Dapps Inc., which in May 2017 announced the release of a product allowing users to integrate the Salesforce system with the Hyperledger, ethereum and bitcoin blockchains, Ledger Insights reported.  This April, Salesforce announced that it had joined the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI), the global blockchain think tank with participants like Microsoft, IBM, the Bank of Canada, PepsiCo, Raiffeisen Bank, Polymath and others.  In November, Salesforce secured a patent for a blockchain system designed to filter spam and check if emails are changed or otherwise tampered with after being sent. ""Used properly, the immutability and distributed nature of the blockchain can make it impossible to modify information once it has been committed to the blockchain,” the patent said.  On May 23, the company published a blockchain primer for the readers of its corporate blog, describing the basic principles of the technology and use cases like money transfers, medical record storage, and supply chain management. It also explained what benefits the blockchain tech can bring to the fields Salesforce is focused on, like customer relationship management.  ""Blockchain is a technology that promises to fundamentally change how we share information, buy and sell things, and verify the authenticity of information we rely on every single day — from what we eat to who we say we are. And because it can facilitate all of this in secure, efficient, and transparent ways across many different domains, the effects can be transformative — every business, government, and individual can benefit,"" the blog post said.

42381989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNkv,1559145606,Libra: Everything We Know About Facebook's Cryptocurrency,"The world's biggest social media company appears dead-set on launching its own cryptocurrency.  Facebook has yet to announce much on its plans publicly, but media reports on its crypto ambitions have emerged over the past six months, painting a partial picture of how the social network wants to capitalize on blockchain technology.  In short, a team led by former PayPal president David Marcus is building an asset-backed cryptocurrency, one designed to operate within the company's existing messaging infrastructure (WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger).  The only facts arising directly from the company come from Laura McCracken, Facebook’s head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, who told German magazine WirtschaftsWoche on June 4 that a white paper for the token would be published on June 18. She also said the token will not be tied to any single fiat currency, but will instead be linked to a basket of currencies.  However, indications that Mark Zuckerberg's company wanted to diversify into fintech first materialized as far back as 2017.  Below is a full telling of what is known so far about Facebook's cryptocurrency.  (Editor's note: This piece will be updated as new details emerge.)  December 2017  Looking back, the first sign that Facebook was prepared to be very serious about distributed ledger technology came in December 2017, when David Marcus joined Coinbase's board of directors.  At the time, Marcus was the vice president of messaging products at Facebook. This would have included two of the biggest messaging platforms in the world, Messenger and WhatsApp (which Facebook acquired in February 2014 for $19 billion).  Though giants in their category, neither of Facebook's messengers have the payments functionality enjoyed by their top rival: China's WeChat.  But Marcus was president of PayPal, the U.S.'s leading online payments company. He's no stranger to solving this category of tech problems.  August 2018  More importantly, the next clue that Facebook intended to take crypto seriously came in August 2018, when CoinDesk first reported that Marcus was leaving Coinbase's board.  Marcus had been reassigned to focus on blockchain in May 2018. At the time, a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk that Marcus had stepped down to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.  December 2018  In December 2018, Bloomberg reported that Facebook intended to build a stablecoin. Stablecoins are a controversial kind of cryptocurrency that have comparably frictionless settlements as classic cryptocurrencies, without the price volatility.  Long thought to be impossible without excessive centralization (and perhaps even then), they became one of the hottest forms of cryptocurrency last year, as the most popular – Tether's USDT – faced significant headwinds and investors poured resources into competitors such as Ampleforth, TrueUSD and the ill-fated Basis.  At that time, Facebook's entry was reported as a WhatsApp-centered product, primarily focused on India. That might have only been part of it, or Menlo Park's ambitions might have since expanded.  One source that had visited Facebook told CoinDesk that any doubts about whether the company wanted to do a stablecoin should be set aside. The same source told CoinDesk to look for Facebook to roll out the project with a broad group of noted cryptocurrency companies and leaders backing it, in order to allay doubts that it might be overly centralized.  The next month, the New York Times reported that Facebook wanted to unify Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. No doubt there are many strategic reasons to do this, but for person-to-person payments it also maximizes the universe of people that can exchange the company's new cryptocurrency.  February 2019  Early in February, Cheddar broke the news that Facebook had acquired a British blockchain company called Chainspace. Cheddar reported this as an ""acqui-hire."" That is, it was more about hiring the people than acquiring Chainspace as a business.  That said, Facebook had also been acquiring talent the old-fashioned way: with a slew of blockchain-related job postings in early 2019.  Shortly thereafter, rumors swirled that Facebook was seeking investors to back its crypto efforts. Many Silicon Valley investors CoinDesk spoke to at the time had ""heard"" that Facebook was raising money, but details were sparse – especially given the exhaustive scope of Facebook's non-disclosure practices.  At the end of the month, the first hints about timing came out. Those dates have since been pushed back, but readers also got a sense for how the company was operating.  Multiple sources have confirmed to CoinDesk that the social media giant really only talks about its blockchain efforts behind closed doors in Menlo Park, physically, and only after everyone involved has signed non-disclosure agreements.  Four people that had been briefed on the matter told the New York Times in February that Facebook had already spoken with leading crypto exchanges. In May, Coinbase and Gemini were specifically cited by the Financial Times as two Facebook had discussed listings with.  April 2019  Another major development was Facebook's announcement of a pivot to privacy, fully articulated by CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the company's annual F8 event for developers.  ""I believe it should be as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a photo,"" Zuckerberg was quoted as saying during his presentation.  While not directly a cryptocurrency announcement, it does fit into the larger story. Zuckerberg described a future for Facebook where the public news feed is no longer the site's main attraction. In fact, the site could become primarily a platform for millions of private conversations.  If this happens, however, end-to-end encrypted content would make targeted ads less feasible. By controlling a new kind of money, Facebook could establish monetizable experiences that could make up for lost advertising revenue.  It's worth remembering, though, that a full 98 percent of Facebook's $40 billion in revenue came from advertising in 2017. In March, a Barclays analyst said Facebook's cryptocurrency could earn the company anywhere from $3 billion to $19 billion by 2021.  May 2019  The rumors about Facebook seeking funding for the project first entered the public sphere in a tweet from Nathaniel Popper, a New York Times reporter.  But then the Wall Street Journal substantiated the claim in early May, indicating that Facebook was looking further afield than just venture capitalists. Facebook had met with payments firms such as Western Union and Visa, the Journal reported.  Meanwhile, Congress began to take notice of Facebook's efforts and the company subsequently picked up two compliance professionals from Coinbase, with significant prior experience in banking and payments.  Other names started becoming publicly associated with the project, with CoinDesk breaking the news that a notable crypto-economist, MIT's Christian Catalini, has taken a role at the company.  Then Reuters found that the social media giant had registered a company in Switzerland, Libra Networks, with Facebook Global Holdings as its stakeholder.  The name referenced what the Wall Street Journal had previously identified as a codename for the effort, ""Project Libra."" That registration can be seen here, though it simply describes a company working on a combination of financial services products, with blockchain as a component.  Le Temps reported that the person helming Libra also runs Facebook in Switzerland, Majella Goss, which operates out of a Geneva coworking space.  Beyond the GlobalCoin moniker, the BBC reported that testing should begin by the end of this year and the currency itself should roll out in the first quarter of 2020.  Borrowing from the playbook of the Asian e-commerce stablecoin Terra, the BBC story suggests Facebook will seek discounts from online retailers for customers who use GlobalCoin. This could be mutually beneficial both to the retailers and Facebook, as payment services provided by credit card companies come with fees that eat into e-tailers' profit margins.  June 2019  Reports in early June suggest Facebook may be getting close to launching its cryptocurrency.  According to a June 2 Financial Times report, Facebook has been in talks with the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to see if its stablecoin would fall under the regulator's remit.  Then a June 5 report from The Information claimed that Facebook's digital token is expected to be unveiled in a matter of weeks.  Corresponding with previous reports from as early as December 2018, The Information said Facebook's cryptocurrency will be “designed to function as a borderless currency without transaction fees and will be aggressively marketed in developing nations where government-backed currencies are more volatile.”  Subsequent reporting by CNBC listed key staffers involved in the project.  On June 14, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook had lined up more than a dozen big-name companies – including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Uber – to invest $10 million each in a consortium that would govern Global Coin.  The report citing anonymous sources came days ahead of the anticipated white paper release.  On the same day, the Financial Times said Facebook has hired Standard Chartered bank's managing director for group public and regulatory affairs, Edward Bowles, who will join in September. The piece added that former U.K. deputy prime minister Nick Clegg had joined the effort in January to head the global affairs and communications team.

The bipartisan letter  , which was spearheaded by U.S. Representatives Trey Hollingsworth (R.-IN) and Darren Soto (D.-FL), asks the National Economic Council to host a forum on the nascent technology, as well as to include blockchain on a list of technologies that the Trump Administration will promote.  In addition to Hollingworth and Soto, the letter, dated May 24 and publicly released on Wednesday, was also signed by U.S. Reps. Bill Foster (D.-WI), Tom Emmer (R.-MN), Ted Budd (R.-NC), Josh Gottheimer (D.-NJ) and David Schweikert (R.-AZ).  ""Government agencies within the United States are exploring blockchain technology in multiple ways,"" says the letter addressed to Larry Kudlow, a financial analyst and former CNBC host who has led the council since 2018.  However, ""more can be done"" to support the technology in the U.S., the lawmakers said. The letter specifically cites the fact that blockchain tools – and, it is implied, cryptocurrency projects – are governed by decades-old laws, ""and a lack of regulatory clarity may be dampening investment.""  The letter goes on to say:  ""To continue its standing as a world leader in technological innovation, the United States should engage with policymakers, the private sector, and academia to promote the research and development of blockchain technology; explore its benefits for private and public use; collaborate on cross-sectoral policy, standard-setting, scalability, and implementation issues; and discuss potential regulatory approaches.""  Soto, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement that ""blockchain has the profound potential to benefit society and be a driver of economic growth.""  ""It is crucial we continue to be informed on new initiatives and educate Congress and other government agencies on the impact of these emerging technologies,"" he added.  The National Economic Council is a presidential advisory group that focuses on economic initiatives.  Formed in 1993, the group is tasked not only with advising the president's economic policy, but also advancing his goals.

42381983,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNc7,1559138425,A UK University Is 'Fingerprinting' National Archives With Blockchain,"The U.K.'s University of Surrey has announced that it's securing digital government records of national video archives around the world against tampering using blockchain tech and artificial intelligence (AI).  In a press release provided to CoinDesk, the university said its Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) has teamed up with the Open Data Institute and the National Archives in the U.K. to develop what it calls a ""highly secure, decentralised computer vision and blockchain based system"" called ARCHANGEL, which is designed to preserve the integrity of digital archives for the long term.  Computer vision is a field in which computers are programmed to analyze and understand digital images or videos.  The system “essentially provides a digital fingerprint for archives, making it possible to verify their authenticity,"" according to project lead at the University of Surrey, Professor John Collomosse.  ARCHANGEL uses blockchain tech as a database maintained by a number of archives. The system is designed to automatically flag modifications to the digital public record, whether accidental or malicious, and it is backed up by the ""proof-of-authority"" blockchain system.  ""Everyone can check and add records, but no one can change them. As no data can be modified, the integrity of the historical record remains intact,"" the university explained.  The new system has already been trialed by the national government archives of the U.K., Estonia, Norway and Australia, as well as the National Archives and Records Administration in the U.S., according to the release. The institution will present a paper describing the work at the CVPR conference in Los Angeles next month.

42381990,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNjf,1559127635,Bitcoin Price Eyes Longest Monthly Winning Run Since 2017,"View  With 63 percent month-to-date gains, BTC looks set to register its longest monthly winning run since August 2017.  The falling channel breakout seen on the monthly chart favors a rally to key Fibonacci resistance of $9,442.  BTC has pulled back from one-year highs hit earlier this week. The cryptocurrency, however, remains on the hunt for a near-term move above $9,000, as the daily chart pennant breakout confirmed on Sunday is still valid.  The short-term bullish case would weaken if the price drops below $8,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to register its longest winning streak since August 2017, with four consecutive months of price gains.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $8,670 on Bitstamp, representing 63 percent gains on the opening price of $5,267 seen on May 1.  The bulls usually take a breather after engineering such stellar gains, and a healthy correction may be seen over the next two days.  However, a drop all the way back to the monthly opening price of $5,267 before Friday’s UTC close looks unlikely, as both the short-term and long-term technical studies are biased bullish.  For instance, BTC is currently witnessing strongest buying pressure since December according to the weekly chart money flow index.  Further, the cryptocurrency is trading well above the 200-day moving average (MA) – a widely tracked barometer of the long-term trend. The average, currently located at $4,544, is beginning to curl upwards in favor of the bulls for the first time in over 12 months.  So BTC looks set to end in the green for the fourth straight month, having rallied 11, 8 and 28.6 percent in February, March and April, respectively. The run marks the longest monthly winning streak since August 2017, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin’s price was solidly bid in the five months to August 2017. A minor blip in September was followed by a three-month rally to a record high of $20,000  The cryptocurrency jumped 11 percent in February this year, snapping its record six-month losing run  If prices remain near $8,600 till Friday’s UTC close, then the resulting monthly gain would be the highest since August 2017.  Monthly chart  Bitcoin's price has risen sharply this month, validating the falling channel breakout confirmed on April 30.  The 5-month MA is rising, indicating a bullish setup and looks set to cross above the neutral (flat) 10-month MA on June 1. That bullish crossover would strengthen the long-term bullish view put forward by last month’s channel breakout.  The cryptocurrency, therefore, could extend the ongoing rally toward $9,442 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from the December 2017 high to the December 2018 low.  The long-term bullish view would be aborted only if the price finds acceptance below $6,000, although that looks unlikely.  Daily chart  Despite the pullback from the 12-month high of $8,940 hit on Monday, the outlook remains bullish, as the pennant breakout – a bullish continuation pattern – is still valid.  Further, the price is holding above the former resistance-turned-support levels of $8,500 (June 2018 high) and $8,390 (May 16 high).  Adding to those, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup, and the Chaikin money flow index is signaling strong buying pressure with a positive print.  Prices, therefore, could rise above $9,000 over the next few days. The short-term bullish case would weaken if the ongoing correction is extended to levels below $8,000.

CipherTrace announced Wednesday that it will help ensure sound anti-money laundering (AML) processes are in place for the firm's Rakuten Wallet exchange platform, which is based in Tokyo.  Rakuten Wallet started accepting account registrations last month from those who have an account at Rakuten Bank or who already have a Rakuten member ID. It is yet to open the platform for the wider public.  “Regulatory compliance and anti-money laundering protections are of the utmost importance,” said Yoshinao Kiyama, head of the risk control department at Rakuten Wallet. ""We believe CipherTrace will provide us the necessary tools needed to best support Rakuten Wallet.""  Last month, cryptocurrency exchange Binance also partnered with CipherTrace to enhance AML processes such as tracing the source of on-chain funds and matching user IDs to problematic wallet addresses across its platform.  Rakuten Wallet was previously known as Everybody’s Bitcoin, an exchange Rakuten acquired for $2.4 million last August. A rebranding of the entity to Rakuten Wallet took place on March 1, at which time the older service was closed.  The new exchange received a license earlier this year from the Japanese Financial Service Agency. The exchange is therefore registered with the Kanto Local Financial Bureau as a virtual currency exchange service provider under the country’s Payment Service Act.

Through the sale, the firm aims to raise €3.5 million ($3.9 million), allowing it to continue providing loans to small businesses, Germany-based Bitbond announced Tuesday. The STO is open until July 8 for investors everywhere except the U.S. and Canada.  The security token, called BB1, works like a bond, and Bitbond will buy back the tokens after 10 years. The prospectus of the STO has been approved by German financial regulator BaFin, the firm said.  Bitbond provides working capital loans to small businesses that use e-commerce platforms like eBay and Amazon in Asia, and claims to have already processed over $15 million-worth of business loans.  Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond founder and CEO, said:  “Small businesses are an incredibly important part of the economy, and hire the majority of all employed people worldwide. We see this STO as a way to help small businesses create more jobs, and supercharge their own growth.”  Founded in 2013, Bitbond has already raised millions in VC funding to support its loan offerings.

42381980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNYL,1559116832,U.K. Exchange Coinfloor Is Getting Paid to Help Crypto Firms Access Banking,"Coinfloor, the U.K.’s longest-running crypto exchange, has teamed up with electronic money institution (EMI) Enumis to deliver bank-like accounts to crypto firms, a perennial pain-point across the industry.  Under the partnership, Enumis will pay Coinfloor a fee for referring reputable crypto-facing businesses that successfully set up current accounts (the U.K. equivalent of checking accounts).  “Being insiders in the crypto space we are aware of crypto companies operating as good and compliant custodians and so now we will vet and review these and recommend them to Enumis for onboarding,” Obi Nwosu, CEO, Coinfloor told CoinDesk. “I think ‘brokering’ is technically the wrong word, but we are working in partnership with Enumis and introducing clients to the offering.”  After getting its own current account with Enumis at the start of the year, the firms realized that “together we can do more,” Nwosu said.  Aside from the fees, Coinfloor is hoping that the access to fiat accounts will be another draw for startups to use the exchange. The company, founded in 2013, currently has 50,000 customers, aims to become the premier fiat bridge for the U.K.  “Obviously we think it will bring people to the exchange and we tend to be the best price anyway,” noted Nwosu, adding:  “But this also about helping firms who are doing things the right way to succeed: something we are doing even if they are ostensibly competitors. We would argue that if we are all succeeding it’s beneficial to everyone.”  Getting and holding onto a bank account is a longstanding challenge for any business that handles cryptocurrency. There have been a few notable exceptions in the U.K., such as Barclays banking Coinbase and Circle, but it’s a rare occurrence, and the arrangements are normally clandestine. Banks, for their part, fear the headline risk of being even an arm’s length from crypto that may have been involved in hacking events, crimes and so on.  Next best thing?  To be clear: Enumis isn’t a bank, though it offers many similar services. Founded in 2010, it is authorized as an EMI by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, from which it also holds a consumer credit license. Importantly it is wired into payment networks such as Mastercard, the U.K. Faster Payments Service, CHAPs and BACs.  Similar to U.S. money transmitters, EMIs need to hold 100% of customers’ deposits in reserve and can’t lend them out like a bank would.  Through its partnership with Coinfloor, Enumis is offering firms current accounts with online banking and API capabilities, with a debit card that gives a 0.2% rebate on usage at Coinfloor.  “I have to be careful with my words because we are obviously not a bank,” said Ali Latif, CEO and founder of Enumis. “We issue electronic money, but from the perspective of someone using the facilities, you are effectively getting the same sort of functionality.”  With Brexit looming, Enumis is looking for ways to win over European crypto exchanges and payments firms, tapping the clearing systems they use across the EU’s various member states. Latif said. ""We are currently in talks with the Lithuanian central bank for integration to SEPA, the pan-European payments system.""  Coinfloor’s Nwosu stressed that its recommendations to Enumis do not guarantee an account.  “It’s possible that we could review a firm to the best of our abilities and Enumis may look at it from a different angle with access to different data than we do and may come to a conclusion that they are not comfortable,” he said. “It's definitely not by any stretch a passport.”  Rather, candidates' compliance practices will be rigorously vetted. ""We want to find the diamonds in the rough,"" Nwosu said.

42381979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNVp,1559102426,Bitcoin's 'Toxic' Twitter 'Culture War' Explained,"""What the heck! It's a food fight on here. [Bitcoin developer] Matt Corallo is mad at Blockstream. Ragnar and Giacomo Zucco clubbing people left and right. Wat is going on!?""  This text from a bitcoin enthusiast friend aptly described the confusion on social media platform Twitter in recent days, when leading members of the bitcoin developer and startup ecosystem have been fighting over bitcoin's ""culture"" and whether it needs to be changed or improved.  The root of the debate: Does bitcoin have a culture problem? Is there too much ""toxicity""? And yet, as Twitter is a free-for-all, there were all sorts of sub-parts to the debate, centering on other questions: Is bitcoin inclusive enough? Why is Twitter so harsh? And what, exactly is bitcoin culture?  It's hard to say exactly how the fiery battle started, but it appears to have stemmed from a tweet from Token Daily co-founder Soona Amhaz stating: ""A few bright ethereum core developers have personally confided in me that they turned to ethereum after feeling [antagonized] by the bitcoin community. Play the long game or you will lose talent.""  Amidst the discussion that followed came Neil Woodfine, Blockstream's marketing director, who argued that bitcoin's culture can seem unwelcoming partly because there are so many fraudsters in the industry trying to make a quick buck.  And those in the ecosystem who have been around for more idealistic reasons, have grown to reject this mindset in a sometimes harsh manner.  ""Bitcoin industry culture is therefore *necessarily* one of extreme skepticism, cynicism, rigorous review, and forthright language,"" Woodfine tweeted, adding:  ""If you’re unhappy with bitcoin culture, sorry, you’re the problem. Bitcoin is better off without you—you’re not cut out for the challenges ahead. You’re not good under pressure, you’re too sensitive, and you lack conviction.""  Others on Woodfine's ""side"" of the debate (though the debate was so raw and messy it's hard to determine actual sides) argue that bitcoin's community has been hardened by past debates over the years. The most well-known of which was bitcoin's scaling debate, which abruptly ended when a minority of bitcoiners broke off to create bitcoin cash.  In short, the argument goes that the reason the community can come off as unwelcoming is because they've had to dispel many bad ideas along the way.  'Gaslighting bullshit'  But Woodfine's thread, while popular, didn't sit well with everyone.  ""This is gaslighting bullshit,"" said Neha Narula, research director for MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, calling Woodfine's thread a ""travesty.""  This side of the debate suggests that there's something wrong with bitcoin's ""culture,"" that settling for the way things are is not enough, and that people should make more of an effort to include people in the community.  ""Always question, never settle, and know that there are lots of us who try to debate, criticize, learn, and improve without being jerks,"" Narula went on to write.  Others had similar reservations with the idea bitcoin's culture is static, arguing that the culture isn't set in stone.  ""Totally wrong. That some dudes on Twitter can declaim what bitcoin's culture is and should forever be is ridiculous. We're still building the culture, and we *can* make it better,"" argued Chaincode developer John Newbery, leading into a conversation about how bitcoin developers aren't a very diverse group and he wants people of various cultural backgrounds to feel more welcome.  In what might have been the climax of the debate, bitcoin developer Matt Corallo blocked Blockstream CSO Samson Mow, going on to argue some individuals at the bitcoin tech startup Blockstream's culture are ""toxic."" Corallo helped to found the startup in 2014.  Never again  It might seem this massive debate came out of nowhere. Tierion researcher Paul Sztorc's take is that people in the community just didn't have an outlet to talk about these concerns until this debate blew up.  ""Usually when people fight, it is because lots of unresolved stuff has been bubbling up over time. Then it is triggered by one little event -- the straw that broke the camel's back, as they say,"" Sztorc argued.  On that note, some participants see truth in both sides of the debate.  ""Some people say we should promote better culture that is more inclusive and respectful. Other people say [peer-to-peer] network protocols must remain neutral and not care about cultural issues. They are both right,"" argued Ciphrex co-founder CEO Eric Lombrozo, though he later argued that Twitter culture -- which he described as ""mostly a bunch of dudes trying to win stupid prizes"" -- isn't representative of bitcoin's overall culture.  BitTorrent creator and bitcoin developer Bram Cohen also blames the ""toxicity"" on the social media platform Twitter specifically.  ""Anyone who persists in being a jerk should eventually be made to feel unwelcome, but the default assumption should be that people simply haven't learned the norms yet and explain it to them,"" he said.  Meanwhile, others drew alternative conclusions about the state of the bitcoin community from the debate.  As Woodfine tweeted:  ""After this weekend, let no one ever again claim that bitcoin is an echo chamber.""
