Trump's post came late in the U.S. day on Tuesday, several hours after the tokens were initially made available. Some $9 million of the tokens were sold as of press time, some 3% of the total tokens allocated to the public sale.  ""Today's the day!"" Trump said in an X announcement.  WLFI serves as a governance token for the platform, enabling users to participate in DeFi activities like borrowing, lending, and creating liquidity pools.  The token sale website went live earlier Tuesday and suffered numerous outages.  As such, trackers for the WLFI token on its website did not show an immediate spike in purchase volume after Trump's X post - with over 540 million tokens already purchased by users before his endorsement.

34749411,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648072,1729033235,Solana Meme Coins Rising But Is This Deployer Dumping On Degens?,"Crypto prices are printing higher. Bitcoin, for example, broke above $66,000 before cooling off earlier today. Like the world’s most valuable coin, Solana and its meme coins are trending higher. According to Coingecko, SOL trades above $150, adding nearly 7% in the previous trading week. Meme Coins Soaring But PELF Deployer Dumping The lift-off in Solana has seen some of its ecosystem tokens massively benefit. Among the many, Solana-based meme coins continue to rip higher. According to Coingecko, three Solana meme coins, including Popcat and DogWifHat, now command a market cap above $1 billion. Related Reading: SUI Records Substantial 120% Price Surge, But Insider Selling Claims Raise Red Flags While investors are closely tracking the performance of Popcat, the first cat-themed meme coin to break above the $1 billion level, some whales are fading the current bull run. One analyst, citing Nansen data, observes that the deployer of the PELF, a meme coin on Solana, is offloading. Initially, the deployer received 247 million PELF for 82 SOL worth $12,516. Later, the addresses received another 39.13 million PELF. According to on-chain data, the address has sold 3.2 million PELF for 662 SOL. Although analysts believe the deployer might have offloaded more tokens through other unknown addresses, the whale currently owns over $7.8 million worth of PELF at spot rates. Usually, any liquidation by a whale is considered bearish and might significantly influence price action. Retail traders, some interested in meme coins, often closely monitor the accounts of known whales, including deployers. If they choose to sell, moving tokens to a DEX, speculators will also look to sell before prices tank. Will Improving Crypto Sentiment Drive Demand? PELF remains in an uptrend, judging by the formation in the daily chart. The token is up nearly 300% from September lows. However, PELF is inside a broader range and down from its March 2024 highs. If buyers are to take charge, there must be a confirmation of October 14 gains. In that case, PELF could break above $0.0008101, bottoming out from Q3 2024 lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Road To $70,000? Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels Improving crypto sentiment could lift meme coins, driving them to new valuations. As of October 15, the total market cap of Solana meme coins exceeds $10.9 billion. Interestingly, they continue to grow in strength, looking at the number of Solana meme coins breaking into the top 10. According to Coingecko, Dogecoin is still the most valuable. However, DogWifHat, Bonk, and Popcat are now among the top 10, flipping Floki, Neiro on Ethereum and Brett.

The fund tracks the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index which measures the market cap weighted performance of some of the largest cryptocurrencies.  Grayscale Investments has filed to turn its multi-token fund, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC:OTCQX), into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), adding to its offerings of crypto ETFs after the conversion of its bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} funds earlier this year.  The fund tracks the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index which measures the market cap weighted performance of five of the largest cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}}, XRP {{XRP}}, and avalanche {{AVAX}}.  Once approved and converted into an ETF, the fund which currently trades over the counter, will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, which submitted a 19b-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday.  “Today, Grayscale filed to uplist Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund as a diversified multi-crypto asset ETP on NYSE Arca. The fund is currently trading under ticker: GDLC, and continues to meet growing demand by providing diversified exposure to crypto through a portfolio of market-leading digital assets. This filing reflects Grayscale’s steadfast commitment to making the crypto asset class more accessible for all investors,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk.  It would be Grayscale’s fifth ETF launch this year after the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) as well as two mini versions of the funds earlier this year.  Both GBTC and ETHE have bled money since launching in January and April as investors have pulled over $23 billion out of the two funds, according to data from Farside Investors.  The approval of the ETFs started a wave of fresh applications to launch funds tracking smaller tokens with issuers filing for funds holding Ripple's XRP, Solana's SOL and Litecoin's LTC.

42390194,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjxgt,1729029468,Is Elon Musk Selling Bitcoin? Tesla Transfers All $760M of Its BTC to Unknown Wallets.,"Wallets associated with Elon Musk's Tesla have moved $760 million worth of bitcoin (BTC).  The funds were moved to unknown wallets.  Tesla is the fourth-biggest bitcoin holder among public companies.  Elon Musk's Tesla, one of the biggest corporate owners of bitcoin {{BTC}}, transferred nearly all $760 million of the cryptocurrency it owns to unknown wallets, raising the possibility the carmaker is selling.  Wallets associated with the electric car manufacturer on Tuesday moved more than 11,500 bitcoin to wallets whose ownership is unknown, according to crypto data firm Arkham Intelligence. The Tesla wallets only retain about $6.65 worth of BTC – essentially nothing.  Tesla is the fourth-biggest holder of bitcoin among publicly traded U.S. companies, per BitcoinTreasuries data. Only software company MicroStrategy and bitcoin mining firms MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms have larger stockpiles.  Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in February 2021, and at some point owned as much as $2.5 billion worth, according to Arkham data. However, the firm sold 75% of its holdings in early 2022 at a loss. When Arkham Intelligence added the car maker's bitcoin wallet tracking feature to its dashboard in March, it held about 11,509 bitcoin, worth roughly $770 million.  Musk had also previously announced, back when Tesla first acquired its stash, that the company would soon accept bitcoin payments, but the plans were dropped shortly after due to environmental concerns.  While some of Musk's companies – including Tesla and SpaceX – hold bitcoin on their balance sheets, it is unclear how much the X (formerly Twitter) owner believes in the cryptocurrency himself. In an interview broadcast on YouTube in July, Musk said that he thinks ""there's some merit in bitcoin, and maybe some other crypto,"" but that his soft spot was for dogecoin {{DOGE}}.

After several days of anxiety and uncertainty, yesterday’s market surge has reignited optimism across the crypto space. Investors and traders are closely watching Ethereum’s price action, as a break above this crucial zone could signal the start of a significant upward trend, potentially setting the stage for an Altseason. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising Top analysts and investors await confirmation that ETH is poised to rally soon. Carl Runefelt, a well-known analyst and investor, has shared his technical analysis on Ethereum, suggesting that the long-awaited rally may be just around the corner. According to Runefelt, ETH’s breakout from the current supply zone could lead to a substantial price surge, attracting bullish momentum for Ethereum and a broader range of altcoins. The next few days are critical for Ethereum’s price action as the market awaits signals that could define the direction of this potential rally. Investors remain optimistic, anticipating that ETH could lead the market into its next major bullish phase. Ethereum Testing Crucial Supply Ethereum has been trading within a bullish triangle formation since early August, and the moment of truth for a potential breakout may be close. ETH has underperformed BTC throughout the year, causing many investors and traders to question ETH’s strength during this cycle. This trend led to a shift in confidence as Bitcoin continued to dominate, leaving Ethereum behind. However, during yesterday’s market pump, Ethereum showed renewed strength, outperforming Bitcoin for the first time in a while, signaling a possible shift in market dynamics. Prominent crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Ethereum’s imminent breakout from the bullish triangle pattern. According to Runefelt, Ethereum is approaching a key moment, and a breakout from this pattern could lead to a major rally. He suggests that once ETH breaks through, the next supply zone to target is around $3,400, representing a significant upward move from current levels. Related Reading: Solana Will Target New ATHs Once It Breaks $160 Resistance – Analyst This optimistic outlook comes from renewed positive sentiment across the market and Ethereum’s improved price action. Traders and investors are closely watching the next few days, as a successful breakout could mark the beginning of Ethereum’s long-awaited bullish trend and re-establish its strength relative to Bitcoin. ETH Technical Levels To Watch Ethereum is trading at $2,611 after a notable 7% surge yesterday. This upward momentum allowed the price to break past the $2,500 mark, a critical resistance level pushing the price down since the beginning of October. Now, Ethereum is less than 8% away from the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,806. For bulls to gain control and establish a sustained uptrend, ETH must reclaim this 200-day EMA and close above the $2,800 level. Doing so would signal a continuation of bullish momentum and set the stage for a potential rally to higher price levels. On the other hand, if Ethereum fails to hold above the $2,500 support level, a deeper correction may be on the horizon. In that case, the price could return to $2,300, where stronger demand may help stabilize the market. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details The next few days are crucial for Ethereum, as traders and investors are watching closely to see whether the price can hold its recent gains and break through key resistance levels.

34744647,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648041,1729022457,XRP Price Growth: Analyst Breaks Down The Movements And Why It’s So,"The reason behind the stagnant XRP price growth has remained a mystery, with many crypto analysts pointing to legal disputes and market volatility as key factors holding back its momentum. However, even during favorable market conditions and after gaining legal clarity following multiple Ripple Court wins against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has still failed to experience a notable upward surge. As a result, investors have questioned the cryptocurrency’s sluggish price growth, prompting a crypto analyst to provide a detailed explanation of why XRP remains at a low price, barely showing signs of a feasible rally. Why XRP Price Struggles To Gain Momentum On October 13, a crypto analyst and researcher known as ‘Crypto Tank’ took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss the reasons why the XRP price is not moving. In the lengthy X post, the analyst explained that the XRP price was determined by dividing the volume of XRP actively being used on the ledger by its circulating supply. Related Reading: Over $182 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin Price Breaks $64,000 And Sends Bears To The Gallows According to Crypto Tank, XRP investors have this misconception that the total XRP in circulation is about 56 billion. However, this figure is misleading as a large portion of XRP’s supply is held in various private wallets by large-scale holders, also called “Whales.” This means that most of XRP’s supply is not actively being used in the market, but is held firmly in these wallets. The analyst revealed that what truly matters for XRP’s price movements is how much of the circulating supply is used to actively engage in transactions on the XRP ledger. Currently, only about 20% of the total XRP supply is actively engaged on the XRP Ledger daily. For XRP to be used to execute transactions, it often needs to be paired with Automated Market Makers (AMMs), which provide liquidity during trades. These liquidity pools are important for XRP to conduct global settlements, as only ample liquidity can facilitate these enormous transactions which extend to trillions of dollars. This need for substantial liquidity in the XRP Ledger is what limits its price movements. Following the analyst’s report, it is clear that XRP’s price struggles are more complicated than mere market volatility. Its ongoing legal dispute with the SEC also adds uncertainty to any potential price increases in the future. Analyst Unveils XRP Road Map To $500 While discussing the reasons why XRP’s price has remained stagnant, Crypto Tank also unveiled a road map for how XRP could reach $500. The analyst explains that if XRP could become widely adopted for global settlements like SWIFT, it could potentially reach this price target.

34744259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648206,1729021489,"Bitcoin Rally Expected: Standard Chartered Eyes New High Of $73,800 Pre-US Election","Bitcoin has recently shown significant momentum, reaching its highest level since July, briefly touching $67,900 and recovering 7%. This surge follows a dip to $58,900 at the end of last week, further fueling bullish sentiment among investors optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s potential to reach new heights before the end of the year. However, according to research from multinational bank Standard Chartered, this optimistic outlook may be realized even sooner than expected. Key Factors Behind BTC’s Price Surge Geoff Kendrick, the head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, recently estimated that the Bitcoin price could hit $73,800 ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday November 5 , representing a 10% increase from current levels. particularly in relation to one of the largest public BTC holders, MicroStrategy, which recently increased its holdings to 252,000 BTC, led by the vision of co-founder and renowned Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor. Related Reading: Worldcoin Gains Upside Momentum: Is A Major Breakout Ahead? Historically, MicroStrategy and Bitcoin have traded in tandem; however, Kendrick notes that MicroStrategy’s stock has recently outperformed Bitcoin, suggesting a developing premium that could drive Bitcoin prices higher in the coming days. Two key factors underpin this bullish outlook. The first is the news, reported by Bitcoinist last month, that BNY Mellon has received an exemption from SAB 121, a regulation that requires financial institutions to list cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Kendrick explains that such regulatory relief is often seen as a positive signal for the broader Bitcoin market, potentially encouraging wider institutional adoption and therefore acting as a bullish catalyst for the ongoing rally seen in recent days. The second factor relates to MicroStrategy’s declared intention to evolve into a “Bitcoin bank,” which would involve offering Bitcoin capital market instruments. Kendrick believes that future exemptions could enable the firm to generate yield by lending out its Bitcoin holdings. The analyst argues that as the digital asset ecosystem gains legitimacy and accessibility, MicroStrategy’s valuation should rise, further benefiting BTC’s price over the long term. Both Presidential Candidates Could Boost Bitcoin price Regarding the upcoming presidential election, Kendrick views the outcome as secondary to these fundamental factors. He asserts that regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins, the broader digital asset ecosystem is increasingly poised to become mainstream. Related Reading: SUI Records Substantial 120% Price Surge, But Insider Selling Claims Raise Red Flags While Kendrick has previously suggested that a Trump presidency would be the most beneficial scenario for BTC, with notable proposals for the industry including the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve for the country, he maintains that both candidates could positively impact the asset in the long term. In fact, Kendrick projects that if Trump regains the presidency, the Bitcoin price could soar to as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $67,000, still holding to some of its gains of 2% in the 24-hour time frame despite quickly retracing before hitting $68,000.

42390198,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjxr9,1729019147,Coinbase Escalates SEC Fight Over the Agency's Inside Chatter on ETH,"A research firm Coinbase hired intends to ask a judge for a quick call on whether it should get key SEC documents that might reveal how the agency came to view crypto tokens as securities.  The federal court could decide whether the company (and the public) get to see what the SEC officials said in private discussions as they tried to figure out whether digital assets like ETH should be counted as securities.  An intermediary for the biggest U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase Inc. (COIN), is cranking up its legal fight over the Securities and Exchange Commission's unwillingness to produce documents revealing the regulator's internal thinking on whether to pursue Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} and other tokens as illegal securities.  Coinbase hired History Associates Inc. to pursue SEC communications under the Freedom of Information Act – a process that initially concluded with the agency denying the request by citing that the documents were connected to an ongoing investigation. Coinbase's hired gun eventually sued over the denial, and History Associates is preparing to ask the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to force the hand of the agency, which has since suggested the reason for its initial denial may no longer be valid.  ""Lacking reasonable alternatives, History Associates intends to move for partial summary  judgment on the SEC-generated documents,"" the company said in a notice filed on Monday with the court, detailing that plan to ask for a court ruling.  A spokesperson for the SEC told CoinDesk the agency declines to comment ""beyond our public filings.""  ""Over a year ago we made FOIA requests aimed at files on ETH 2.0 and other mysteries,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in a posting on X, arguing that the internal agency communications ""belong to all of us,"" not the SEC. ""We then sued to end their stall, only to get an entirely new set of excuses.""  Read More: Coinbase Accuses U.S. SEC, FDIC of Improperly Blocking Document Requests  Coinbase has been conducting a multi-front legal fight with the SEC, including battling over an SEC enforcement action that accused the company of running an illegal securities business, a petition by the company to force the agency to make crypto-specific regulations and this conflict over whether insider messages on the SEC's crypto thinking should be subject to public review.

In a post on X today, Kiyosaki elaborated on his views regarding the current economic climate, drawing parallels to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Why Bitcoin Could Crash To $5,000 Kiyosaki revisited the events of 2008, referring to the GFC as a pivotal moment when, in his view, “the criminals at the Fed and Treasury began printing trillions of fake dollars in an attempt to stop a Global ‘F-ing’ Depression.” He argued that these measures were taken to save “their ultra-rich friends,” while the general public was left to suffer the consequences. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Record $19.8 Billion—Is The $100K Rally About to Begin? According to Kiyosaki, the massive influx of newly printed money led to what he describes as “The Everything Bubble,” a phenomenon where all markets began to rise artificially, “floating on a sea of fake money.” He believes that this bubble is unsustainable and is on the verge of transforming into “The Everything Crash.” He warns that “everything will crash, including gold, silver, and Bitcoin,” suggesting that the market is approaching a critical point akin to a “blow-off top.” Kiyosaki emphasizes that this impending crash could be detrimental for most people, potentially leading to a global depression that was narrowly avoided in 2008. He urges individuals not to be complacent or comfortable in what he considers a “fake bubble,” and to instead prepare for the forthcoming economic downturn. He points out that prominent investors are already taking action by selling “overpriced” assets and converting them into cash. The best-selling author cites Warren Buffett as an example, noting that Buffett has reportedly been selling his Apple shares and accumulating large reserves of US dollars. Related Reading: Samara Asset Group Eyes $32.8 Million Bond Issuance To Increase Bitcoin Holdings Despite the grim outlook, Kiyosaki sees the anticipated crash as an opportunity for those who are prepared. He encourages people to take proactive steps, even if they currently lack financial resources. “After the everything crash….that follows the everything bubble….the prepared will get really rich…I plan on being one of the prepared…I plan on becoming even richer….and I want you to become richer too,” Kiyosaki remarked. Specifically regarding Bitcoin, Kiyosaki predicts that the cryptocurrency could plummet to $5,000 during the crash. However, he also forecasts a dramatic rebound, with Bitcoin potentially soaring to $100,000 or even $250,000 and beyond after the market stabilizes. “Take Bitcoin for example… it may crash to $5000 a coin….then boom to $100,000 to $250,000 and higher. Obviously, I will be buying all the Bitcoin I can, as well as other assets, at bargain basement prices,” he stated. Throughout his post, Kiyosaki maintains a critical stance toward the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury, whom he accuses of perpetuating a flawed financial system that benefits a select few at the expense of the majority. He concludes, “I want you to be one of the rich…not one of the victims of the criminal Fed and Treasury.” At press time, BTC traded at $65,657.

42390204,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjyLv,1729015907,Why the $172B Stablecoin Market Could Send Crypto Prices Higher,"Stablecoin market capitalization is almost back to its all-time high.  That means there’s a lot of sidelined capital ready to be deployed when momentum picks up again, according to analyst Alice Liu.  Liu compared stablecoins to Berkshire Hathaway’s cash holdings.  Crypto markets are sitting on a powder keg that could soon blast prices higher.  That’s according to Alice Liu, lead researcher at crypto data firm CoinMarketCap, who told CoinDesk that crypto investors should view the $172 billion stablecoin market as a huge reserve of cash ready to be deployed into cryptocurrencies the moment bitcoin {{BTC}} rises again and momentum picks up.  “A lot of people want to keep cash on the side – both crypto degens and institutions,” Liu said. “It’s almost similar to Warren Buffett holding cash on the side, waiting to buy at any point.”  Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm run by billionaire Buffett, reported holding nearly $277 billion in cash at the end of the second financial quarter. That’s a 46% increase from the $189 billion that it was sitting on in the first quarter.  Dry powder  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay at par with a government-issued currency, typically the U.S. dollar.  Some cryptocurrencies – like ether {{ETH}}, the second largest coin by market capitalization – are still languishing way below their 2021 all-time highs, but the stablecoin market has almost regained its former strength, down just 8% from its $187 billion peak of spring 2022.  Even more striking, stablecoins account for about 50% of all value settled on public blockchains. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by value, only accounts for 25% of such transactions.  Liu said that while a portion of that capital is being used for other purposes – for example, to earn yield through DeFi protocols – the sheer size of the available liquidity meant that, if crypto prices start rising again, stablecoins will likely add fuel to the fire.  It's not just the total stablecoin market capitalization that's important, but where these tokens are located. For example, stablecoins held on crypto exchanges are easier to deploy into the market rapidly – and historical data suggests that an increase in stablecoins on exchanges tends to precede higher prices. According to CryptoQuant, stablecoins on exchanges have grown by 20% this year.  That metric has grown by 20% this year, according to data analytics firm CryptoQuant.  “This is probably going to be one of the main drivers for us in a bull market,” Liu said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/why-the-172b-stablecoin-market-could-send-crypto-prices-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e035d1f8dd3798f928136ed8f824013b824b1100-3940x3940.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is the first to apply for such a fund.  The current submission in the form of a S-1 filing is a first step but meaningless unless it is followed by a 19b-4 filing.  Canary Capital Group, a new digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, seemingly wants to become a leader in the world of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than a follower.  The firm on Tuesday submitted paperwork to launch the Canary Litecoin {{LTC}} ETF.  The token is the native cryptocurrency of Litecoin, an open-source blockchain project whose code is copied from Bitcoin’s. Though several non-native ETF issuers have launched crypto funds this year, this is the first filing for a fund tied to LTC.  For Canary, which is only about a month old, this marks the second ETF that the firm has plans to launch after it filed documents for an XRP fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a week ago.  Both filings have yet to disclose the management fee or ticker for the potential fund.  The firm submitted an S-1 document on Tuesday, a requirement for companies seeking to issue a new security and be listed on a public stock exchange. It is one of two filings needed to launch an exchange-traded product.  The filing is thought to be the first step in introducing a fund, but it is meaningless if it isn’t followed by the 19b-4 filing, which signals a rule change at the stock exchange on which the fund would be traded.  The latter requires the SEC to stick to a strict timeline in approving or denying the application, while the regulator has no requirement to respond to the S-1 filing.  LTC jumped 5% higher on the news of the filing, trading at $66.46 as of price time.",POSITIVE,LTC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LTC | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/15/ex-valkyrie-founders-canary-capital-group-files-for-first-litecoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc2d452054c16109d87eb1cafcf0baac58c1e73e-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34740331,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648024,1729011619,Worldcoin Gains Upside Momentum: Is A Major Breakout Ahead?,"Worldcoin (WLD) is showing signs of a strong upward push, gaining traction toward the $3.2 key resistance level. As market optimism builds, many are wondering whether Worldcoin is on the verge of a major breakout that could propel it to new highs or if current gains might face resistance in the near term. With growing momentum in its favor, this analysis explores the recent bullish momentum behind WLD and assesses whether it has the potential to trigger a major breakout. By evaluating key resistance levels, technical indicators, and overall market sentiment, we seek to determine if this rally can push the token to new highs or if a reversal is on the horizon. Analyzing Recent Gains Of Worldcoin WLD is currently trading above the 4-hour 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating a robust bullish trend. The recent breakout above the key $2.1 resistance level further strengthens its upward momentum, suggesting that buyers are actively pushing the price higher. Should WLD maintain its position above this key threshold, it could open the door for more gains, with the next target potentially set at the $3.2 resistance level in the near future. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals renewed bullish potential, as the RSI has surged to 77% after dipping to 52%. A reading above 70% often signals that an asset is approaching overbought conditions, indicating that WLD could experience short-term consolidation or profit-taking. However, if the buying pressure persists, it could lead to further upward movement, driving the price toward higher resistance levels. Related Reading: No Ties To OpenAI: Worldcoin Drops 9% As Top Trader Issues Warning Furthermore, the daily chart shows that Worldcoin is experiencing considerable pressure on the upside, characterized by a series of bullish candlestick formations. This positive trend is underscored by the asset’s position above the critical $2.1 support level and the 100-day SMA. As WLD maintains this upward trajectory, it reinforces optimistic sentiment in the market, setting the stage for potential gains as it approaches higher resistance levels. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is currently positioned at 72%, well above the pivotal 50% threshold, which suggests that buying pressure significantly outweighs selling pressure in the market. Can WLD Maintain Its Uptrend, Or Will Bears Intervene? WLD is currently exhibiting strong, upbeat momentum as it approaches the $3.2 resistance level. A successful breakout above this mark could unlock additional gains, potentially driving the price toward the $5.2 resistance level. Related Reading: Worldcoin Drops 6% Amid Alameda Research 1.5 Million Token Sale, Will WLD Price Hold? Conversely, if bears take control at the $3.2 resistance level, the price may start to decline toward the $2.1 support range. A drop below this level could trigger a deeper decline, possibly leading to a test of the $1.2 support level and beyond.

As of September 2024, the Ethereum network issues ~940,000 ETH in new supply every year. Since its transition to PoS on September 15, 2022, and the implementation of EIP 1559, the Ethereum Network has functioned as a net deflationary asset, reducing supply by an average of 0.106% per year. In our view, the emergence of restaking offers investors greater control over their risk and return profiles, enhancing the utility and efficiency of ETH as collateral within DeFi. By Lorenzo Valente, Research Associate Introduction As bitcoin (BTC-USD) cements its position as a reliable digital store of value and the only asset with a rules-based monetary policy, Ethereum - the network - and ether ((ETH)) (ETH-USD) - the asset - appear to be gaining momentum with similar potential. Indeed, ETH is emerging as an institutional-grade asset with yield-generating potential. As the only real yield-bearing digital asset when staked , 1 ETH appears to have unique and distinctive characteristics that position it as a “reference indicator” 2 within the digital asset space. ETH already plays a pivotal role in private and public financial markets, influences the monetary policy of adjacent digital networks and applications, and gauges the health of the broad-based digital assets ecosystem. With a market capitalization of ~$315 billion and millions of monthly active users, as shown below, the Ethereum network is settling meaningful economic value.

ETH’s staking yield already is influencing other smart contract ledgers, differentiating it from other digital assets except bitcoin. Similarly, U.S. Treasury bills play a pivotal role in the traditional economy in several ways: setting benchmark rates, serving as a quality store of value during uncertain times, and influencing market expectations of future economic conditions. Our research suggests that, as an asset, ETH is beginning to develop attributes in the digital asset space similar to those of U.S. Treasury bills. ETH’s potential to generate yield - and its widespread use as collateral in digital asset transactions - are emerging as its two most distinctive and significant qualities. Investors can gain exposure to ETH’s yield by staking it to secure the Ethereum ledger. In other words, the yield is not technically native to ETH the asset. Liquid staking derivatives like Lido, Rocket Pool, or Frax provide ways to tokenize staked ETH and its yield. Liquid staking allows users to stake their ETH, while maintaining liquidity, by receiving a derivative token that represents their staked ETH. Another method called “solo staking” provides more direct control over the staked assets, and a higher reward rate, but locks up the ETH. Our goal in this paper is to identify and define ETH’s distinctive characteristics. What is special about ETH, and how does it stand out within a broader field of assets? We are aiming to answer the following questions: How is ETH able to generate yield? How can Miner Extractable Value (MEV) yield predict economic cycles? Does ETH have bond-like properties? Do Staking and Restaking enhance ETH as programmable collateral? If so, how? Will ETH’s Staking Yield become the Reference Yield of the Crypto Economy? If so, in what sense? Within a standard classification of traditional assets, what are ETH’s hybrid properties? 1. How Is ETH Able To Generate Yield? “Proof-of-Stake” (PoS) is a fairly new “consensus algorithm” that is more energy efficient than “Proof-of-Work” (PoW). Why? In PoS, the consensus algorithm selects “validators” - equivalent to “miners” in PoW - to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to ""stake"" as collateral. The higher the stake, the higher the probability of being selected to construct and validate the next block. As a result, instead of requiring massive amounts of computational mining power, the PoS system requires validators to have a significant investment in the network - a stake they could lose if they validate fraudulent transactions or break core protocol rules. Validator stakes deter fraudulent behavior, as does the cost of electricity that Bitcoin miners pay to participate in the network. Both ensure that each participant acts with economic rationality and integrity. When the Ethereum network upgraded to Ethereum 2.0, its protocol shifted from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. The associated implementation of EIP-1559, Ethereum’s latest monetary policy update, introduced a novel fee market structure. Both changes altered the way ETH generates and distributes yield. ETH yield is based on the following three components: Issuance (≈2.8% APR) + Tips ( Let’s look in more detail at each component of the yield. Issuance As of September 2024, the Ethereum network issues ~940,000 ETH in new supply every year - equivalent to an annualized percentage yield (APY) of ~2.8% at today’s staking ratio. The staking ratio varies based on the amount of staked ETH over time. If more validators stake, the staking ratio increases, pushing down the yield on issuance, because it is distributed equally among participating validators based on their weighted stakes. Importantly, the Ethereum network guarantees a minimum annual emission rate of 1.5% which, in the unlikely event it hit, would require the staking of 100% of ETH and no transactions on the blockchain. All validators who secure the network, by achieving consensus and processing transactions, receive the issuance. Tips Introduced by the London upgrade and EIP-1559, ""tips"" are optional fees that users can include with their transactions on Ethereum. Tips are ""priority fees"" because they incentivize validators to prioritize transactions within a block. When users want to send transactions, they must pay the base fee and can choose to pay the tip. The base fee adjusts dynamically based on network congestion, increasing when the network is busier. The priority fee, or tip, is optional if users want to expedite their transactions. In practice, the priority fee is a cost, varying with the network's usage and congestion. MEV In addition to the issuance and the user tip, validators also collect ""Miner Extractable Value"" (MEV) rewards, or the additional profits earned by including, excluding, or reordering transactions in the blocks they produce. MEV is the equivalent of “Payment for Order Flow"" (PFOF) in traditional markets - extra revenue that high-frequency market makers and traders pay validators to prioritize their transaction flow. As with priority tips, the yield is volatile, as it relies on the supply and demand for block space and exploits less-informed traders conducting transactions on the network. Importantly, MEV rewards are available only to validators running an MEV client, such as MEV Boost. Base Fee Importantly, the Base Fee - again, the standard cost to send a transaction - does not contribute to the yield. Instead, it is “burnt” and does not provide stakers with direct cash flow. As part of the EIP 1559 upgrade, the base fee mechanism makes fees more predictable and the Ethereumnetwork more user-friendly. Only the base fee and issuance can alter the total supply of ETH. ETH tokens that users pay for the base fee are removed permanently from the total supply. If the base fee is high enough (greater than 23 gwei 3 in today’s market) and the “burnt” amount surpasses the network issuance (940,000 annual ETH), the total supply of ETH outstanding declines over time, making the protocol deflationary. Conversely, if the network issuance is higher than the burnt base fee, then the network becomes inflationary. Two dynamics support the deflationary trend in ETH’s supply. First, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism enables validators to reduce the operating expenses (Opex) and capital expenditures ((CAPEX)) associated with running network servers. In other words, the energy and data center costs associated with PoW and ASIC 4 machines do not exist in PoS. Second, as the premier smart contract platform, the Ethereum network operates at the base layer with a constraint of 14 transactions per second. Thanks to its rigorously tested code, Ethereum has attracted the highest number of active developers, the widest variety of applications, and thehighest values settled - all in its short nine-year history. Since its transition to PoS on September 15, 2022, and the implementation of EIP 1559, the Ethereum Network has functioned as a net deflationary asset, reducing supply by an average of 0.106% per year. Had Ethereum continued to function with PoW, without EIP 1559, the network’s supply would have inflated by 3.2% per year, as shown below. Source: Ultra Sound Money. Data accessed 08/15/2024.

How Can Miner Extractable Value (MEV) Yield Predict Economic Cycles? As noted above, Miner Extractable Value (MEV) yield is a component of ETH's staking yield. In this section, we delve deeper into MEV, with particular attention to how it is created and how it can predict economic activity and market cycles. Equivalent to Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) in traditional finance, MEV occurs when market makers and high-frequency trading firms pay validators an extra fee to bypass the standard Ethereum “Mempool’’ queuing, prioritizing their transaction bundles. 5 Similarly, in the traditional financial world, companies like Citadel Securities compensate platforms like Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity for directing customer order flow their way. In practice, MEV was born in 2017 during the ETH ICO 6 boom as a basic form of priority “bribe.” During the ICO era, participants and investors buying tokens in certain projects had to deposit ETH into a smart contract in exchange for the project's native token. As they became more popular, the token offerings became oversubscribed and operated on a first-come, first-served basis. To be among the first to deposit ETH into those smart contracts, participants “bribed” validators off-chain. Like PFOF, MEV often reflects retail trading activity, as market makers are willing to pay more for less-informed orders than for informed ones. Just as PFOF payments are a gauge of spending excesses and risk appetite in the retail equity space, MEV plays a similar role in forecasting recessions and economic cycles in the Ethereum ecosystem, as shown below. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2024, based on data from Daytradingz.com and MEV-Explore v1 as of 06/09/24.7 For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. While the revenue generated from MEV on Ethereum and PFOF in the stock market is comparable, MEV as a percentage of the combined market cap of ETH and ERC-20 tokens is much higher than the equivalent in the US equity market. The $0.79 billion in revenue extracted pro rata annually since the merge represents 0.20% of ETH's $315 billion in market cap. The combined market cap of ETH and ERC-20 tokens is ~$500 billion, taking the percentage of revenue extracted down to 0.15%, still 27 times higher than 0.0056% that the $2.891 billion in PFOF revenue represents of the US stock market's $50 trillion market cap. In its early stage of development, Ethereum’s order routing mechanism is more expensive than that in traditional finance but, important to note, Ethereum supports a broader range of order types through smart contracts - such as flash loans, staking, swaps - and other interactions with decentralized applications. Additionally, in traditional finance, other fees and profit centers - broker fees, exchange fees, and profits from hedge funds - sit on top of PFOF revenue. Those costs are not as transparent, but are important to the overall cost structure of financial transactions in the traditional world. Based on historical PFOF patterns in traditional finance, an increase in PFOF revenue has been correlated with higher retail activity involving less-informed traders, while lower PFOF has indicated the opposite. Between 2021 and 2022, for example, Robinhood's PFOF revenue dropped 40% from $974 million to $587 million as interest rates increased 16-fold, signaling the onset of a bear market. Similarly with MEV, from July 2021 to October 2021 block space used by high-frequency trading firms and MEV bots dropped five-fold before the severe crypto bear market in 2022, as shown below. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2024, based on data from Explore.flashbots.net as of 08/15/2024. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Our research suggests that the majority of MEV over the next year is likely to be extracted and redistributed on Layer 2s. Layer 2s are secondary protocols built on top of Ethereum. They improve scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off the main chain while leveraging its security, enabling faster transaction times, and lowering transaction fees significantly. During the next two years, we expect more than 90% of total transactions to occur on Layer 2s. Catering to more price-sensitive retail investors, Layer 2s should dominate ETH trading activity, benefiting disproportionately from MEV, even more so when sequencers - or validators for Layer 2s - decentralize further. Today, Arbitrum and Optimism, the dominant Layer 2 networks, operate with a single sequencer - which means that block space is not auctioned to the highest bidder. Instead, transactions are ordered on a first-come, first-served basis, with no reordering possible by block searchers or builders. As a result, some forms of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) are not possible, indicating that MEV is significantly lower than it could be in a more advanced state with multiple decentralized sequencers and a more mature MEV infrastructure. The MEV Yield, a subset of the overall ETH yield, is becoming a reliable indicator of activity and economic cycles on the Ethereum blockchain. Dominated by retail trading with a higher proportion of less-informed flow compared to traditional finance, MEV is a gauge of activity and economic health that impacts ETH’s yield during cycles and provides a framework for valuing Layer 1 ledgers. 3. Does ETH Have Bond-Like Properties? Fixed income assets, particularly bonds, have existed for centuries and are among the most important financial enablers of economies. Bonds represent loans made by an investor to a borrower, typically a corporation or a government. Our research suggests that, while not equivalent, staked ETH (stETH) 8 has features like those of sovereign bonds, similarities worth exploring. Among the most important similarities and differences between staked ETH and sovereign bonds are the following: Bond Component Sovereign Bond Staked ETH Issuer Government of a Country Ethereum Network Principal Face value of the Bond Staked ETH amount I nterest/Coupon Periodic interest payments, usually semi-annual or annual Staking rewards paid programmatically Maturity Fixed term after which principal is paid Indefinite (ETH remains staked until unstaked) Liquidity Traded in Bonds Markets Traded on Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges Collateral Full Faith and Credit of the Issuing Government Value of ETH and the Security of the Network Note: For the maturity section, staked ETH can be unstaked at any time, after which the initial amount staked called “principal” can be recouped in addition to the yield earned over that period. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2024. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. As we discuss the comparison of staked ETH and a sovereign bond below, we emphasize that their differences are as meaningful as their similarities. In our view, their risk profiles represent the most significant difference between staked ETH and a sovereign bond. Credit Risk Sovereign Bond: When a government issues local currency-denominated debt, the possibility exists, albeit less likely for stable economies, that the government could default on its bonds. Staked ETH: The Ethereum network cannot default on staked ETH, since technically it is not debt. The yield from staking is derived programmatically from on-chain activity and network issuance, meaning that the yield can fluctuate based on network performance, activity levels, and staking ratio. Inflation Risk Sovereign Bond: Inflation in the local currency can erode the value of bond returns, diminishing purchasing power. Staked ETH: Inflation risk is present if the issuance rate of new ETH meaningfully exceeds the Base fee burnt, leading to an increase in supply that diminishes the net yield, which dilutes the value of interest payments. Interest Rate Risk Sovereign Bond: Changes in interest rates can affect the bond's price, with rising rates typically leading to falling bond prices. Staked ETH: While Ethereum itself does not issue multiple bonds - multiple staking yields at different terms - changes in the yield expectations for other Layer 1 smart contract platforms can influence the perceived value and attractiveness of staking ETH. Currency Depreciation Risk Sovereign Bond: Depreciation of the local currency relative to other currencies can reduce the value of interest payments and principal significantly when converted to other currencies. Staked ETH: ETH's value relative to other major cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can fluctuate, impacting the real value of the staking yield and principal relative to other assets. Political And Legal Risk Sovereign Bond: Changes in government or regulatory regimes can impact bond repayments, potentially leading to changes in fiscal policy and/or debt restructuring. Staked ETH: This analogy is less direct. Staked ETH carries additional risks related to network security and governance. If validators misbehave or collude, staked ETH can be slashed as a penalty, leading to the potential loss of principal. Regulatory changes impacting the broader cryptocurrency market also can impact the value and security of staked ETH. Volatility Risk Sovereign Bond: Sovereign bonds generally are considered low-risk and low-volatility investments. In times of economic instability or political turmoil, however, the volatility of bonds can increase significantly. Staked ETH: Staked ETH is more volatile because it is nascent. Volatility can impact both the staking yield and the value of the principal. Modeling staked ETH as a sovereign bond requires understanding the differences in their respective risk profiles. While both can be influenced by inflation, interest rate changes, and currency depreciation, the nature of those risks and their implications can vary significantly. Additionally, ETH staking introduces unique risks related to network security, validator behavior, and smart contract bugs, which have no direct parallel in traditional sovereign bonds. Similar to calculating the present value of Sovereign bonds, one could attempt to model the present value of a so-called “Staked ETH bond.” The formula would add the present value of each reinvested coupon payment to the present value of the bond’s face value at maturity. Then, by modeling the coupon interest with the staked ETH yield and the discount rates with a risk-free rate similar to US T-Bills, one could derive the present price of the staked ETH Bond. That said, one of the most important differences between the sovereign bond and a “Staked ETH bond” stems from the fact that the staked ETH yield can vary from day to day. Therefore, modeling a “Staked ETH bond” would require the calculation of an average yield over the maturity period. Additionally, unlike traditional sovereign bonds, staked ETH can be unstaked or “called” at any time, the principal redeemed at will. Today, ETH does not have a yield curve, which means no relationship between the staking yield and the time to maturity of the staked asset. Based on our research, however, an ETH yield curve is likely to evolve in the coming years, increasing the analogy to sovereign bonds, with ETH staked at different maturities and terms. 4. Do Staking And Restaking Enhance ETH As Programmable Collateral? Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) are protocols designed to simplify the staking process for users with little technical expertise. LSDs partner with trusted node operators to manage staking operations on behalf of users. Users who stake their ETH through Lido - a leading LSD provider - receive stETH in return. The stETH is a synthetic version of their staked ETH and functions much like a tokenized certificate of deposit. stETH token rebases automatically to reflect staking rewards (3.2% APY) and can be converted to ETH on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Then, the token, or certificate of deposit, can be used in lending, acquiring leverage, rehypothecation, and many other financial activities within the digital asset space, particularly Ethereum-based applications/protocols. stETH is the yield-bearing version of ETH. Because it is as programmable and liquid, stETH is beginning to replace ETH in many DeFi protocols and applications. Indeed, stETH has been replacing ETH as high-quality collateral within the Ethereum economy. Today, stETH supplied as collateral in DeFi totals ~2.7 million, or roughly 31% of the entire stETH supply, as shown below. 9 Note: The left Y axis in this third-party chart is measured in dollars (billions). Each of the Abbreviations shown at right in the chart above refers to a different asset, which can be used as collateral, as follows: cbeth (Coinbase Staked ETH), reth (Rocket Pool ETH), dai (MakerDao Stablecoin), usdt (Tether Stablecoin), usdc (Circle Stablecoin), weeth (Ether.fi ETH), wbtc (Wrapped Bitcoin), eth (ETH), steth (Lido Staked ETH).

(https://dune.com/lido/steth-collateral-compare-to-others) For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. More than 80,000 stETH exists in liquidity pools across Curve, Uniswap, Balancer, Aerodrome, and other leading DEXes (decentralized exchanges). 10 stETH, the yield bearing asset, is becoming the preferred collateral, thanks to the capital efficiency it offers users, liquidity providers, and market makers. Currently, the collateral of choice on Aave V3, Spark, and MakerDao, 1.3 million stETH, 598,000 stETH, and 420,000 stETH, respectively, are locked into those protocols and used as collateral to issue loans or crypto-backed stablecoins, as shown below. Our research suggests that stETH and other liquid staking derivatives of ETH are becoming the high-quality collateral of choice for financial activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Note: Each of the legend labels shown at right in the chart is the name of a specific protocol. But what if users were to seek a higher yield on their staked ETH while providing more utility as collateral? That is exactly what Eigenlayer - a repledging/restaking protocol - can facilitate. To date, Eigenlayer has amassed $13 billion USD in ETH tokenized certificates of deposit, accounting for 50% of Lido TVL and for ~4% of ETH’s total supply, as shown below. 11 Liquid staking derivative tokens representing staked ETH on the Ethereum network can be re-staked on the Eigenlayer platform, enabling other protocols to enhance their network security for a designated duration, a process similar to leasing security services. Certain protocols with tokens too volatile for reliable network security may face liquidity shortages and/or need to augment their security, both of which can be addressed either by dual token staking or by renting their entire security with a more stable form of collateral like ETH. For their security services, restaking protocols like EigenLayer reward restakers, much like the Ethereum network pays validators. In our view, the emergence of restaking offers investors greater control over their risk and return profiles, enhancing the utility and efficiency of ETH as collateral within DeFi. Note: Each of the Abbreviations shown at the top of the chart above refer to the protocol to which the different ETH liquid staking tokens belong, as follows: Steth (Lido), rETH (Rocketpool), sfrxETH (Frax), cbETH (Coinbase), ankrETH (Ankr), LsETH (Liquid Collective), oETH (Origin Protocol), mETH (Mantle), SwETH (Swell),wBETH (Binance).

Restaking (theblock.co) For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. EigenLayer’s success demonstrates that users and institutions have strong interest in leveraging their ETH holdings in more sophisticated ways. By introducing new use cases, EigenLayer allows participants to preserve their ETH holdings while generating additional yield. As they emerge from the EigenLayer launch - much as stETH emerged with Lido from native staking - liquid restaking tokens are likely to serve as collateral across various platforms. Whether in liquidity pools, lending/borrowing platforms, structured products, or crypto-backed stablecoins, various forms of yield-bearing ETH are likely to become the programmable collateral of choice for the leading applications and products in DeFi - whether deployed on Ethereum Layer 1 or any of the Layer 2s available today. 5. Is ETH’s Staking Yield Becoming The Endogenous Benchmark Of The Crypto Economy? Thus far in this paper, we have characterized Staked ETH as a sovereign bond-like asset in some respects, and we have described both ETH and its liquid staking derivatives as high-quality liquid collateral within DeFi that supports many of the widely used applications. In this section of the paper, we highlight another unique characteristic of ETH’s staking yield: its influence on investments within the crypto economy, which our research suggests is comparable to the role of Treasury bills and the Federal Funds Rate 12 in the traditional economy. Today, the staking yield impacts both public and private investments within the digital asset space, much like the role of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in traditional finance. First, the ETH yield seems to be exerting significant pressure on native yields in competing Layer-1 smart contracts, compelling other blockchains to offer higher rewards to validators for their security and long-term commitment, as shown below. Why would investors/validators hold and stake a riskier and more volatile asset if its return on investment is not likely to be higher? Importantly, unlike ETH, the yield on other assets tends to be dilutive to cash flows. In other words, if an investor holds and does not stake any other Layer-1 token, network inflation dilutes it.

(Staking Rewards: Secure & Reliable Crypto Staking) For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. The staking yield on ETH also raises the opportunity cost of holding and borrowing stablecoins. As its native yield has increased and become the benchmark, ETH’s higher activity, MEV fees, and overall demand have placed several DeFi protocols under pressure. MakerDAO. Aave, and Compound are three such protocols. MakerDAO is a protocol that governs the issuance and management of the DAI stablecoin. DAI is issued against collateralized debt positions (CDPs), as users lock up collateral like ETH or other whitelisted assets to mint DAI. One of the core features of the MakerDAO protocol is the DAI Savings Rate (DSR), which allows DAI holders to earn interest by locking their DAI into a special smart contract. Following significant selling pressure on DAI and a decrease in its circulating supply, the MakerDAO governance decided to increase the DSR rate from 5% to 15%. In money markets like Aave or Compound, where supply and demand dictate terms, the reward rate for supplying/lending stablecoins has increased significantly. The supply APY for fiat-backed stablecoins 13 can range from 5% to more than 15%, depending on market conditions. The rate reflects investor willingness to borrow stablecoins while supplying ETH, or stETH, as collateral, without having to sell. Alternatively, protocols like Ethena Labs - which offers a stablecoin collateralized by a cash-and-carry trade 14 between a spot stETH position and a short position on a perpetual future 15 - have attracted many stETH holders. Why? Ethena’s stablecoin offers a significantly higher yield than DeFi alternatives, not to mention ETH’s plain vanilla staking yield. The yield from ETH staking also impacts yield farming opportunities. Teams looking to bootstrap new products or features and attract ETH-denominated capital to their pools must align their incentives with the prevailing market conditions. Higher staking yields typically translate into higher user acquisition costs for many teams and protocols, as potential investors and liquidity providers are more likely to stake their ETH for more stable returns instead of the higher risk-return associated with new or less-established yield farming opportunities. Investors allocating capital to early-stage digital assets are asking the same question: on a risk- and liquidity-adjusted basis, will this project provide a better investment return than that from staking ETH? We can explore the question with a hypothetical example. To what degree would a closed-end fund with a typical seven-year investment time horizon - the average harvesting period for tech startups - need to outperform ETH in order to break even, after compounding? If the ETH yield is 4% after compounding over seven years, the closed-end fund would have to outperform ETH more than 31%, even without taking into account price appreciation. Put differently, early-stage investors in the digital asset space often contemplate this: On a risk- and liquidity-adjusted basis, could a project they’re evaluating offer stronger returns compared to simply holding and staking ETH over the investment period? For example, consider a typical fund with a 7-year horizon, commonly referred to as the harvesting period, during which investments are expected to mature and deliver liquidity. If the same capital instead were allocated to ETH and staked, with an average staking yield of 4%, the project would need to outperform ETH by at least 31% to compensate for the compounded yield effect alone. In bull markets with oversubscribed private rounds, less attractive valuations, and less favorable vesting terms, the competition from staked ETH would become even more intense. 6. What Are ETH’s Hybrid Properties? The spot Bitcoin ETFs have found success perhaps because of the appreciation potential and stability relative to other stores of value, particularly fiat currencies. Human decision making by monetary authorities - sometimes arbitrary and inconsistent - has played a significant role in the devaluation of fiat currencies over the long term. Antithetically , bitcoin is “rules-based,” its supply mathematically metered to top out at 21 million coins. 16 As such, bitcoin is emerging as a compelling alternative to fiat currencies, a digital asset class akin to digital gold. As a younger asset, ETH has undergone several monetary and technical upgrades over the years. In addition, its Turing completeness 17 and cash flow yield have made it challenging to describe, define, and frame within traditional asset class boundaries. Robert Greer’s paper, “What is an asset class anyways,” 18 categorizes three types of assets: Capital Assets: Assets such as equities, bonds, or real estate that are productive and accrue value to the holder in the form of cash flow. Consumable Assets: Assets like commodities that can be consumed or transformed into other assets or goods. Store Of Value: Assets that cannot be consumed or transformed into other assets or goods but that maintain value over long periods of time. Source: Greer 1997.19 For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. In this paper, we have illustrated the parallels between the yield on ETH and that on debt-like instruments, particularly sovereign bonds. We have demonstrated that the ETH staking yield is a gauge for smart contract activity and economic cycles in the digital asset space, much like the Fed Funds Rate in traditional finance. Additionally, like any other Layer 1 asset, ETH is a consumable asset, used in the Ethereum network to pay for transactions to be included in the ledger. That process involves exchanging the asset to pay validators to store and compute data. We’ve also highlighted staked ETH’s ability to function as a high-quality liquid asset within DeFi, functioning like pristine collateral that powers the most popular applications and stablecoins like DAI and USDe. So, what is the best way to categorize and define ETH as an asset? While the Bankless 20 team has popularized ETH as a ""triple point asset"" that simultaneously embodies the characteristics of three different asset classes - according to Robert Greer’s classification - we believe bitcoin has and will continue to be a distinctly reliable store of value. That said, we also believe ETH is paving the way for a new hybrid asset. While it exhibits store-of-value properties in the smart contract economy, what distinguishes ETH from any other digital asset is that it is a programmable and cash flow-generative asset that can be used as high-quality collateral in financial applications. ETH and staked ETH are highly liquid and widely traded on many exchanges. Their liquidity ensures that they can be liquidated and converted to other assets easily and/or used in various DeFi protocols. While more volatile than government bonds or real estate, ETH is one of the most established, valuable, and widespread cryptocurrencies in the world. With spot ETH ETFs now live, ETH’s acceptance is likely to increase and its volatility decrease. Currently, ETH and its liquid staking derivatives are entrenched as collateral in various DeFi protocols, not only securing loans, but also participating in liquidity pools, generating yield, and issuing stablecoins. Although ETH may not fit neatly into a single asset category, its multifaceted attributes highlight it as a unique asset, highly attractive for those seeking exposure to the rapidly growing global smart contract economy. Important Information Digital assets, often referred to as cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether are relatively new investments, which have unique and substantial risks, and which may be more volatile than other types of investments. Digital assets operate without central authority or banks and are not backed by any government. Even indirectly, digital assets may experience very high volatility. Digital assets are not legal tender. Federal, state or foreign governments could restrict the use and exchange of digital assets. Digital asset exchanges could stop operating or permanently shut down due to fraud, technical glitches, hackers or malware. There is no assurance that Ether will maintain its value over the long term. ARK strongly encourages any investor considering an investment in Ether or any other digital asset to consult with a financial professional before investing. All statements made regarding Ether are strictly beliefs and points of view held by ARK and are not recommendations by ARK to buy, sell or hold Ether. Historical results are not indications of future results. 1 Importantly, ETH can generate yield only if and when the holder is willing to perform staking; moreover, not every holder is permitted to stake. This differs significantly from a bond that generates a yield in virtue of being held. If an investor were simply to hold ETH, no yield is generated; the appreciation/depreciation of their principal investment is related solely to price movement as determined by supply and demand. 2 A “reference indicator” is a benchmark metric used to evaluate other data points. ETH and its staking yield are becoming benchmarks (reference indicators) within the digital asset space that are used to judge other Layer 1s, risk profiles, and returns. 3 Gwei stands for ""gigawei,"" a denomination of ether (ETH). 1 ether ( ETH ) = 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) gwei. Gas fees on the Ethereum network typically are specified in gwei. Gas fees are the costs required to perform transactions or execute smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 4 An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a highly specialized microchip designed to perform a particular task with high efficiency and performance. 5 Please note that this extra fee differs from “tipping” as described earlier in the paper. 6 An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a fundraising mechanism within the digital asset space; new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for fiat currency or established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ether (ETH). 7 See Daytrading.com . 2024. “Payment for Order Flow Data, Analysis and Insights.” ( DAYTRADINGz.com ). See also MEV Explore v1.2024. “Pre-merge Data: December 14, 2019 - September 15, 2022.” MEV Explore 8 Whether through solo staking or via a liquid staking derivative, staked ETH refers to ether that has been deposited in the Ethereum network and that is earning yield. 9 cbETH, rETH and stETH are liquid staking derivatives issued by different protocols. WBTC is a wrapped token of bitcoin issued on the Ethereum blockchain. USDT and USDC are two stablecoins pegged to the US dollar issued by Circle and Tether. 10 DEX stands for decentralized exchange, protocols that allow users to swap tokens in a permissionless way via smart contracts. 11 The Block. 2024. “Restaking.” ( https://www.theblock.co/data/decentralized-finance/restaking) 12 The Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions like banks lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis. 13 A Fiat backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar. The peg is achieved by holding the reserves of the fiat currency equivalent to the total supply of the stablecoin, either as cash equivalents or short-dated securities. 14 A cash-and-carry trade is a classic arbitrage strategy used to profit from discrepancies between spot and futures prices. 15 A short position on a perpetual future involves selling a perpetual futures contract with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will decrease. Perpetual futures contracts are a type of derivative that, unlike traditional futures contracts, do not have an expiration date. 16 Downing, F. et al. 2024. “The Bitcoin Monthly, February 2024.” ARK Investment Management, LLC. 17 Turing completeness is a concept in computer science and mathematics that describes a system capable of performing any computation that can be algorithmically defined, given enough time and resources. 18 Greer, R.

34738240,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648040,1729006257,"Bitcoin Stochastic Breakout Puts BTC Price Above $500,000, Here’s When","Bitcoin investors are still dwelling in excitement in light of a recent breakout towards $66,000. This rally has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with many traders now anticipating higher highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to a crypto analyst, this breakout has seen the stochastic indicator print a signal to a rally that could send Bitcoin to the $500,000 price target. Stochastic Breakout To Send BTC Price Above $500,000 Taking to social media platform X, a crypto analyst known as Tarder Tardigrade highlighted an interesting price breakout with the Stochastic Indicator. The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to measure the closing price of an asset relative to its price range over a specified period. Like the RSI, it can help to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Flashes Historical Bull Flag, Here’s What Happened Last Time In Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, which was accompanied by a detailed BTCUSD monthly candlestick chart, he pointed out that the stochastic indicator has been steadily moving downward and remained confined within a falling wedge pattern for most of 2024. However, the recent rally in Bitcoin’s price, which was first observed in September and has now resumed in October, triggered a notable breakout from this falling wedge The analyst emphasized that this stochastic breakout coincided with the formation of a local bottom in Bitcoin’s price, around the critical $60,000 level. He further noted that this breakout is not just significant in isolation but represents the starting point for what he predicts to be a parabolic rally. According to Trader Tardigrade, this breakout sets the stage for Bitcoin to potentially surge toward the $500,000 price target. When To Expect A $500,000 Bitcoin? This interesting projection of the Bitcoin price is supported by a similar pattern following a previous breakout of the stochastic indicator, which also aligned with a local bottom in late 2016. After that breakout, Bitcoin saw an extraordinary price surge over the subsequent months, culminating in a peak of $19,600 in December 2017. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Giga Pump’ For XRP Price, Here’s The Target Going by this previous price performance, a similar breakout would see Bitcoin continue to surge throughout the rest of 2024 and the entirety of 2025. Notably, the analyst highlighted a peak of the parabolic rally at $520,000 sometime in 2026. $Bitcoin Stochastic BREAKOUT 🔥$BTC has the same pattern as the previous cycle.

A parabolic rally to $520,000 would translate to a 690% increase from the current price. In another analysis of the daily candlestick timeframe chart, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that there are no reasons to be bearish on Bitcoin at the moment. The price is demonstrating strong momentum, having flipped a key descending resistance trendline into support, and is now breaking out of another falling wedge above the descending trendline.

34738470,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24323,1729005853,Bitfinex Alpha 126 | Áp lực bán giảm bớt nhưng thị trường vẫn nhạy cảm,"Tải Full Alpha Tuần trước, Bitcoin đã có một cú đi lùi đáng kể , giảm hơn 11% từ đỉnh $66,587 vào cuối tháng 9 xuống còn $58,943 vào ngày 10/10 do áp lực bán mạnh. Tuy nhiên, áp lực bán này nhanh chóng giảm bớt và BTC đã bật tăng trở lại lên mức $64,500 khi lực mua quay trở lại. Đáng chú ý là phần lớn hoạt động bán ra vào đầu tuần trước đến từ Coinbase, được phản ánh qua chỉ số Coinbase Premium Gap, giảm xuống -100 điểm trước khi giá phục hồi. Các chỉ số on-chain cho thấy tầm quan trọng của mức giá thực tế từ các holder Bitcoin ngắn hạn (hiện ở mức $63,000) như một ngưỡng kháng cự quan trọng. Vượt qua ngưỡng này có thể báo hiệu đà tăng tiếp theo, trong khi thất bại có thể dẫn đến việc kiểm tra lại các mức hỗ trợ thấp hơn, có thể gần $59,000 hoặc thậm chí $55,000. Thị trường vẫn còn rụt rè, các biến động trong tương lai có thể phụ thuộc vào việc liệu Bitcoin có thể vượt qua mức giá trị realised của những người nắm giữ ngắn hạn hay không. Cho đến lúc đó, các nhà giao dịch nên dự đoán khả năng điều chỉnh nhưng cũng cần sẵn sàng cho một cú “bật tăng” mạnh mẽ hơn từ các mức thấp hơn, do khả năng phục hồi tiềm ẩn của thị trường. Dữ liệu kinh tế mới nhất cho thấy lạm phát đang tiếp tục hạ nhiệt, với Chỉ số Giá tiêu dùng chỉ tăng 0.2% trong tháng 9, đánh dấu mức tăng hàng năm chậm nhất trong hơn ba năm. Sự giảm phát này chủ yếu do giá năng lượng và nhà ở giảm, mặc dù lạm phát lõi, dẫn đầu bởi lĩnh vực dịch vụ, vẫn ở mức cao. Lạm phát của nhà sản xuất vẫn ổn định trong tháng 9, mang lại sự “dễ thở” cho áp lực lạm phát. Giá năng lượng giảm đã giúp chi phí sản xuất không đổi, báo hiệu rằng lạm phát có thể không leo thang mạnh trong thời gian tới. Tuy nhiên, các doanh nghiệp vẫn đang phản ứng thận trọng với lãi suất cao, vì tăng trưởng hàng tồn kho chậm hơn và sự không chắc chắn gia tăng phản ánh lo ngại về nhu cầu và chi phí tài chính. Mặc dù sự lạc quan của các doanh nghiệp nhỏ đã được cải thiện đôi chút, nhưng các doanh nghiệp đang tập trung vào hiệu quả để vượt qua những thách thức do lãi suất cao. Những phát triển gần đây trong ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử cho thấy những động thái quan trọng trong các hoạt động quản lý và thị trường. Ủy ban Dịch vụ Tài chính Hàn Quốc đang xem xét lại lệnh cấm đối với các quỹ ETF tiền điện tử giao ngay và tài khoản tiền điện tử tổ chức trong nước, báo hiệu một sự thay đổi tiềm năng trong bối cảnh đầu tư tiền điện tử của đất nước. Trong khi đó, Canary Capital đã nộp đơn lên SEC Hoa Kỳ để thành lập quỹ ETF XRP giao ngay , nhằm mục đích đơn giản hóa việc đầu tư XRP cho người dùng môi giới truyền thống bằng cách loại bỏ nhu cầu quản lý tiền điện tử trực tiếp. Trong một tin tức khác, người được ủy thác của Mt. Gox đã gia hạn trả nợ cho các chủ nợ đến ngày 31/10/2025 do sự chậm trễ về thủ tục. Việc trì hoãn này làm giảm bớt lo ngại của thị trường về việc bán tháo Bitcoin tiềm năng, vì nhiều người lo ngại rằng các chủ nợ có thể thanh lý một số trong số 44,900 BTC sắp được phân phối, điều này có thể gây áp lực lên giá Bitcoin.

42390199,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjxwH,1729005394,Why This ETF Expert Is Bullish on Ethereum and Says Washington’s Crypto Stance Is Misunderstood,"The crypto ETF era is just getting started, according to Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of crypto fund issuer Bitwise.  Crypto-native investors that have soured on Ethereum's ether (ETH) are underestimating its appeal to TradFi investors and developers.  Crypto is in a great spot no matter who wins the U.S. election, he argues.  It’s been a great year for Bitwise Asset Management.  The specialist in developing crypto investment products launched two of the most successful exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of all time. Its spot bitcoin ETF has amassed more than $2.7 billion in the span of nine months, while its spot ether ETF has raked in over $250 million in 84 days.  “We’re holding our own against BlackRock and Fidelity,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk, referring to two giants of traditional finance that have vastly larger operations than Bitwise. “There are people who want a crypto-native asset manager to survive.”  That’s not all. The company grew its assets under management from roughly $1 billion to $5 billion, Hougan said, and Bitwise’s acquisition of ETC Group – Europe’s largest bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) issuer – means the firm now has a solid footing on the old continent.  If you listen to Hougan, they’re just getting started.  “We’ve entered the ETF era of crypto,” he said. That means crypto is going to be normalized in people’s portfolios, and a growing cohort of investors will want access to a wide array of crypto investment vehicles, be it single-asset (like the spot bitcoin ETFs) or multi-asset products (which could combine bitcoin and ether, for example).  Case in point, on Oct. 7 Bitwise filed to convert three of its crypto futures ETFs into strategy-based trend-following funds, which rotate out of the market when it loses momentum, with the goal of providing exposure to volatility to investors while minimizing downside risk.  Bitwise’s ascent is happening in a context of quick technological innovation in crypto, with settlement times and transaction fees getting ever lower – which means crypto applications can now become mainstream much faster than people think, according to Hougan. And shifting political tides in Washington could indicate that, as far as regulatory roadblocks go, the worst is behind us.  “It won’t be all sunshine and roses, it will still be imperfect. I just think it will be better than in the past,” Hougan said.  Ethereum’s appeal  If the tremendous success of bitcoin ETFs is the story of the year, the comparatively disappointing ether ETF flows has turned sentiment – at least on Crypto Twitter – against the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  “Inside crypto, many people look at Ethereum as old tech and would rather talk about Solana or Sui or Monad or Aptos or whatever,” Hougan said.  But for him, they’re missing the bigger picture.  The bulk of the $170 billion stablecoin market is issued on Ethereum, Hougan pointed out, and the majority of tokenization projects – like BlackRock’s BUIDL fund or DeFi protocol Ondo – are being built on it, too. Same with the most popular crypto apps, like Uniswap or Aave.  “It’s the Microsoft of blockchains, because Microsoft is like this really boring old tech company from the '70s and it's still the third-largest company in the world,” Hougan said. “If you work at a large bank and you're trying to tokenize an asset, you're not going to get fired for putting it on Ethereum.”  In that sense, Ethereum is the platform for killer crypto applications. So, the network is being sold to investors because it has utility – the fact that it also produces cash flow doesn’t hurt at all.  In fact, Hougan said that among clients, interest for bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} is neatly divided in half. Those with concerns about the monetary situation and the fate of the U.S. dollar will naturally gravitate toward bitcoin, while the rest tend to be much more excited about everything being built on top of Ethereum.  “One thing that I'm really confident about is that 2025 flows in ether ETFs will exceed 2024 flows. And I bet 2026 flows will exceed 2025 flows,” Hougan said. “I just think Ethereum takes somewhat more education than bitcoin, but that education is happening.”  The complexities of Washington  Another major development this year? The feeling that in Washington, crypto isn’t taboo anymore.  The White House took an adversarial stance towards crypto through most of U.S. President Joe Biden’s term – for example, going out of its way to veto a controversial accounting measure, SAB 121, which makes it hard for banks to custody crypto. But things started to change when former President Donald Trump said in May that he’d champion the industry. He then doubled down by vowing to constitute a strategic bitcoin reserve, to free Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht from prison and to help the bitcoin mining industry develop in the U.S.  Trump’s promises stood in stark contrast to the Biden administration’s cold antagonism. And with half of all corporate election spending coming from crypto companies, the Democratic Party softened its stance. Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s candidate for the presidential election, pithily expressed support toward blockchain technology in September.  The important thing for crypto investors to understand is that, no matter who wins the presidential election in three weeks, things are never completely black and white, Hougan said.  It’s not that “Washington is either pro-crypto or anti-crypto,” Hougan said. “Politicians can be overtly hostile and absurdly positive … and they can be anything in between.”  For example, in 2024 the crypto industry obtained the approval of bitcoin ETFs and ether ETFs, Hougan said, and suffered in September from a “lighter SEC enforcement season than we have in any of the past three years.”  “Compare that track record to what we got in 2022 or 2023. In those years, we just got kicked in the shins, and in this year, we got some wins,” Hougan said. “Did we get a solana ETF? No, but it’s a spectrum.”  That’s why a Harris presidency probably wouldn’t be as bad for crypto as the Biden administration has been – even if she doesn’t end up really supporting blockchain development. Moving forward, questions may revolve more around which sectors of the industry benefit over others.  For example, Congress is likely to pass a stablecoin bill no matter who wins the election. But under Harris, the bill may favor large banks, whereas under Trump, the bill may foster “entrepreneurial creativity,” Hougan said.  Similarly, a Harris win may end up benefiting Ethereum at the expense of other smart contract platforms like Solana {{SOL}} or Avalanche {{AVAX}}, simply because these newer blockchains haven’t cleared the same regulatory hurdles.  “Crypto will do well regardless of the outcome,” Hougan said. “Like, Bitcoin doesn't need Washington. It just needs Washington to get out of the way.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | SOL,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/15/why-this-etf-expert-is-bullish-on-ethereum-and-says-washingtons-crypto-stance-is-misunderstood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/119684f4317c9cdae13bf73c082666d73ae81d35-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390202,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjy1P,1729003647,Why Tokens Will Lead the Next Wave of Financial Innovation,"In less than two decades, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have exploded from $1 trillion in assets under management to more than $10 trillion today and Bank of America forecasts a $50 trillion ETF market by 2030. Investors are drawn to ETFs because they offer the diversification of mutual funds with the liquidity of stocks, often at a lower fee.  But that alone does not explain their success.  At their core, ETFs are a financial technology that has democratized access to asset classes and strategies that were once difficult for most investors to reach. These include everything from municipal bonds to foreign stocks to stock options to private credit. By reducing barriers to entry and enhancing flexibility, ETFs have fundamentally changed how people invest.  The success of ETFs should not surprise us. Financial innovations throughout history have followed a similar trajectory — improving access, reducing friction, and broadening choice, which in turn can create entirely new markets. Mutual funds (1924) allowed investors to pool their money together and invest in a portfolio of securities. The first charge card, the Diners Card (1950) enabled consumers to pay for goods without carrying cash, creating a massive market for consumer credit in the process. Discount brokerages (1975) opened stock trading to regular investors, while online banking and brokerages (1990s) made banking more convenient and more accessible for people with limited mobility or who lived in remote locations.  Each of these technologies began at a small scale and took some time to penetrate their respective markets.  ETFs were initially dismissed as niche products, perhaps suitable for a few DIY investors but not appropriate for advisors, traders, institutions, high net worth individuals or other major Wall Street players.  While it’s true that ETFs began as index funds, today most ETF launches are for active strategies. According to BlackRock, active ETFs accounted for 76% of all U.S.-listed ETF launches in 2023, and 21% of global ETF inflows in the same year. The company expects active ETF assets under management to surge to $4 trillion by 2030, a more than four-fold increase from $900 billion today.  The success of the ETF market is an example of Clay Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma. When new technology emerges, the incumbents in a market (in this case traditional asset managers, banks and brokerages) are often slow to embrace it, allowing disruptive innovators to get a critical head start. Their position is understandable, says Christensen. In the investing world, small-time DIY investors were initially the least interesting kind of customer. They didn’t have a lot of money to invest, were stingy about fees and therefore could be easily dismissed.  That view was shortsighted. Incumbents misjudged the potential of the DIY segment to grow precisely because of technology innovations like ETFs (and online brokerages). And they misjudged ETFs as something that could have broad appeal.  Christensen says that markets that do not exist can not be analyzed. ETFs created a $10 trillion market that did not exist before. The emerging market ate the old one.  Tokens, like ETFs, have the potential to democratize finance further.  When it comes to tokens, myths and misinformation abound. Often, all tokens are classified as “crypto” as in “cryptocurrencies.” This is unfortunate, as the term cryptocurrency is a misnomer. The fact is many if not most tokens are not trying to be currencies in the classical sense of a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Rather, tokens are best thought of as simply containers for value. Think of a standard shipping container, which can contain everything from computers to car parts, potatoes to canned plums, and everything in between.  These programmable containers can represent anything of value — stocks, bonds, art, intellectual property — just as a website can be “programmed” to contain any kind of information online, like a storefront, social media site, or government landing page. Tokens are also accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection, and eliminate the need for many traditional intermediaries. Embedded technology like smart contracts can automate functions once handled by brokers, exchanges, and transfer agents, reducing both friction and fees.  The first killer app so far for tokens has been U.S. dollars. Tokenized dollars, known as stablecoins, enable users the ability to move and store value in dollars and then deploy those dollars into a wide range of financial services, such as trading securities, depositing them in lending platforms to receive loans, or using them to invest in a new startup. Stablecoins today exceed $150 billion in circulating supply and process trillions annually in payments. Billions of people now have an easy way to own dollars. This is a breakthrough.  Much like ETFs, tokens have the potential to create new markets (billions of people do not invest money in financial markets) and make financial products more accessible and customizable (tokens are infinitely programmable). As banks and competitors struggle to adapt to this new technology, early adopters will be positioned as the global leader. Incumbents will have no choice but to follow or partner with those pushing the financial frontier.  Just as Wall Street juggernauts BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and others grew into juggernauts on the back of ETFs, the next generation of financial powerhouses will emerge from the token revolution. But who are they? There are contenders but it still feels like anyone’s game.

42390205,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbjyGn,1729002104,Bitcoin Jumps to Just Shy of $68K Before Quick Plunge Lower,"The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} put in an ""upside down V"" during the U.S. morning hours on Tuesday, surging to a nearly three month high of $67,800 before tumbling back to the $65,000 level.  At press time, the world's largest crypto was trading at $65,500, down 0.6% over the past 24 hours and 3.3% lower than its session high touched only an hour ago. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 1.3% over the last 24 hours, with solana {{SOL}} and cardano {{ADA}} among the index constituents underperforming BTC.  Despite the unsettling action this morning, bitcoin remains higher by 8% over the past week, with continued momentum for crypto-friendly Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump possibly behind that rally, said Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick in a Tuesday note. The former president now has a 56% chance of winning in November, according to Polymarket, said Kendrick (now 56.9%). It's his highest probability of winning since Joe Biden dropped out as the Democratic candidate.  The odds of a GOP sweep of Congress are also on the rise, Kendrick pointed out. According to his calculations, if Trump wins the presidency, there is a 70% chance he will be dealing with a Republican-led House and Senate.  Liquidations  Bitcoin's rise over the past few weeks has been very gradual, but the quickness of this morning's gains then losses led to over $127 million in both short and long leveraged bets to be liquidated over the past four hours. Liquidation happens when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open, leading to the forced closure of bullish long and bearish short positions - causing a brief spike or plunge in prices.  Traders at QCP Capital attributed the spike to several reasons from earlier this week. The firm said in a Telegram broadcast that the rally may be election-driven, initially sparked by Republican Donald Trump’s lead in prediction markets and polls, and further boosted by Democrat Kamala Harris’s pledge for a crypto regulatory framework signals a friendlier stance toward the industry.  ""Disappointment with China’s latest stimulus may have led some speculators to shift capital from Chinese equities back into Bitcoin—a scenario we first anticipated in our October 8,"" QCP added. Finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised new steps to support the property sector and hinted at greater government borrowing at a Saturday briefing. However, the announcement fell short of expectations and suggested a low probability of continued outflows into China-linked assets.

34736152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648005,1729000845,"Brace For Impact: XRP Primed For Massive ‘Explosion,’ Analyst Says After Key Break","Price movement of XRP has been slow recently; it stays about $0.53 and shows a 7% drop over the previous month. Many investors are becoming frustrated as they see the altcoin stagnating after a bit of an increase recently. Despite the weak performance, technical analysts are starting to see possible signals of a major change despite the negative vibe; if XRP effectively crosses an important Fibonacci retracing level, they project a strong recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months Market analyst “Random Crypto Pal” thinks XRP is about to break out in an “explosive” manner. On social media, he shares his observation and emphasized the significance of the 0.236 Fibonacci level, which XRP has not yet hit but is approaching. Should this level give way, he expects a price explosion similar to the one it observed in 2017. Once #XRP breaks above 0.236 fib the 2017 #XRP EXPLOSION is coming 👀🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥 Only PURE FACTS 😎😎😎 Like ❤️ repost ♻️ FOLLOW 🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/AOz255KQ0y — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) October 13, 2024 The Trajectory Of XRP Towards $0.80 The Fibonacci level of 0.236 analysts have on their radar would see a price that is slightly above $0.80. XRP is currently trading at $0.548, so an approximate gain of 45% would be needed to be achieved in order to bring about a price for that. When it reaches this threshold of $0.80, the huge returns may appear rather quickly for the coin. In 2017, XRP broke above the resistance of 0.236 Fibonacci and continued on a long rising trajectory that topped at an all-time high in January of 2018. The historic parallel gives analysts hope that history may repeat, but unless XRP is able to break this resistance level it is not really possible to predict whether or when the rally might occur, nor the magnitude of the price increase. Ripple’s Legal Dispute A primary obstacle that may mitigate this confidence is XRP’s protracted legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The ambiguity over this litigation persists in affecting investor sentiment. The SEC has classified the majority of altcoins as investment contracts; nonetheless, XRP has endured the most intense scrutiny, rendering it one of the most legally complicated digital currencies available. The decision of the court that XRP is not a security constituted a major victory for Ripple Labs, but it has almost been challenged by an appeal from the SEC. The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC gives uncertainty over how long the cryptocurrency would face this uncertainty.

XRP could, therefore, present the avenue of survival through institutional investment despite the judicial ambiguity. Bitwise and Canary Capital appear to believe in the coin by pushing for a US-based XRP ETF. This tool would definitely make XRP’s position better and may attract more investment. Furthermore, advancements on the XRP Ledger are fostering optimistic feeling among the community. The potential for XRP to surpass $0.80 and initiate a new surge is yet to be determined. Nonetheless, due to the influence of technical, legal, and institutional considerations, investors are closely monitoring forthcoming developments.

42407362,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGlYC,1728998285,"Trump-Touted Crypto Website Crashes as Token Sale Goes Live, With Just 1.7% of Target Sold","The Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial's WLFI token sale went live at 12:40 UTC.  The token sale website suffered numerous outages shortly after going live, and as of 15:41 UTC, some 344 million tokens had been sold to around 3,000 unique wallets. Still, the amount represented just 1.7% of the 20 billion tokens allocated to the public sale.  WLFI serves as a governance token for the platform, enabling users to participate in DeFi activities like borrowing, lending, and creating liquidity pools.  Republican Donald Trump holds the role of ""chief crypto advocate,"" with his sons Eric and Donald Jr. as ""web3 ambassadors,"" and Barron as the ""DeFi visionary,"" highlighting the family's deep involvement in the project.  A new crypto project promoted by U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his family got off to a bumpy start on Tuesday, as the website crashed and sales of a new digital token fell far short of the $300 million fundraising target during the first few hours.  The public token sale for the crypto project, World Liberty Financial, appeared to go live around 12:40 UTC (8:40 a.m. ET), and almost 2,900 investors bought the token despite the site suffering numerous outages during its first hour.  Read more:We Applaud Trump’s Crypto Efforts Though His Record, Rhetoric Raise Red Flags  Blockchain data shows that about 344 million of the platform's WLFI tokens were sold in the first hour to around 3,000 unique wallets.  But that amount still represented just 1.7% of the 20 billion tokens allocated to the public sale.  Sandy Peng, a WLFI advisor and co-founder of the Scroll blockchain network, attributed the website outages to excessive traffic. ""The team wasn’t expecting this level of interest,"" said Peng, whose Scroll network is set to host World Liberty Financial's blockchain application.  According to Peng, the World Liberty Financial website—which serves as the official portal to the WLFI token sale—received 72 million unique visits in its first hour. The site fell offline due to the excessive traffic but has come back online intermittently, apparently having switched to a new web hosting service.  WLFI token sales appeared to ramp up around 17:30 UTC, when the website came back online for about an hour. By 18:10 UTC, an Ethereum blockchain wallet connected to the token sale held nearly $5.7 million worth of ether (ETH), $1.6 million of tether (USDT) and around $300,000 USD Coin (USDC) tokens.  According to project officials, the WLFI token will be used to govern the World Liberty Finance platform, which is designed to let users engage in borrowing, lending and other DeFi activities. The token, which will be non-transferable for the time being, will give users a vote in matters such as protocol upgrades, technical changes, promotional partnerships and oversight of security risks.  Trump is described in materials for the project as World Liberty Financial's ""chief crypto advocate."" His three sons, Eric, Barron, and Donald Jr. are listed as ""Web3 ambassadors.""  Some 20 billion tokens were allocated to the public sale, offered at a fixed price of $0.015, or 1.5 cents each, amounting to a total fundraising goal of $300 million. The overall supply of the tokens, including those not available through the public sale, is 100 billion.  The WLFI token sale is restricted exclusively to non-U.S. persons and accredited U.S. investors. Top officials behind World Liberty Financial disclosed Monday that the project had whitelisted over 100,000 accredited U.S. investors ahead of the token launch. The U.S. restrictions are designed to protect WLF from violating U.S. securities regulations.  In the U.S., an accredited investor is authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission to invest in unregistered securities such as pre-IPO shares. They must meet specific income and net worth criteria, such as $200,000 in annual earnings and total assets over $1 million.  What is World Liberty Finance and WLFI?  A ""gold paper"" about the token released Tuesday morning shed more details on WLFI, including its distribution and exact role in the platform.  World Liberty Financial is described as a unified platform where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools and transact with stablecoins.  The token will allow holders to propose future changes to the platform. However, all $WLFI will be non-transferable – meaning they will be locked indefinitely in a wallet, or ""smart contract,"" and impossible to trade unless the rules are modified in the future. All governance decisions will be in line with U.S. regulations to ensure any changes are complaint with laws, according to the WLF team.  Read More: Donald Trump-Supported World Liberty Financial Raises Just 4% of Token Sale Target on First Day  ""WLF strongly believes in supporting US dollar-based stablecoins and DeFi applications that seek to preserve the US Dollar’s status, ensuring it remains the global reserve currency for the next century—without compromising the freedoms that decentralized assets provide,"" an excerpt from the gold paper reads.  ""A key part of our mission at World Liberty Financial is to leverage the global reach and recognition of the Trump brand to bring as many Web2 users into the world of Web3 as possible,"" it added.

34733883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647986,1728995402,"Why Bitcoin Price Blasted Past $66,500: Key Reasons Revealed","Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, climbing from a low of $62,050 on Sunday to a peak of $66,500 late Monday. As of Tuesday, the BTC price is slightly correcting below this key resistance level, but hovering above $65,000. Several critical factors have contributed to the rally, including a short squeeze coinciding with the upcoming US elections, strong demand in the spot Bitcoin market, and substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). #1 Short Squeeze And US Election Influence Yesterday’s price surge can be partly attributed to the liquidation of leveraged short positions. Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital writes in their latest investor note that nearly $80 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum leveraged shorts were liquidated, applying upward pressure on the market. While some speculate that the postponement of Mt. Gox’s repayment deadline to October 2025 played a role, this news was already published on Friday, suggesting other factors were at play during Monday’s rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Record $19.8 Billion—Is The $100K Rally About to Begin? “Although there could be many factors that could explain today’s move, it is quite an interesting time if we look at historical price action. We are in the middle of October and just three weeks away from the US elections,” QCP Capital notes. In both 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin remained in a tight trading range for months before initiating a significant rally approximately three weeks before the US Election Day. In 2016, Bitcoin doubled in price from $600 by the first week of January following the election. Similarly, in 2020, it surged from $11,000 to a high of $42,000 by January. This year, October—often referred to as “Uptober” due to its historically strong performance—has been underwhelming, with Bitcoin up just 1.2% compared to an average of 21%. The current rally, occurring three weeks before the US elections, suggests that history might be repeating itself, potentially leading to further price appreciation as investor optimism builds. #2 Strong Demand For Bitcoin For the first time since mid-2023, Bitcoin’s buy orders are matching sell orders in spot market order books across exchanges. Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted this development via X: “Bitcoin buy walls on all exchanges are now strong enough to neutralize sell walls.” This shift marks a significant change from the trend observed since May 2021. “Data from the last cycle (2020-2022). It’s the accumulated difference between quoted buy and sell volumes. Since May 2021, sell walls had been consistently thicker than buy walls until the end of the cycle,” Young Ju shared. #3 Surge In Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Monday witnessed one of the highest Bitcoin ETF inflows on record, totaling $555.9 million—the largest net inflow day since June 3. This substantial capital influx was spread among several major asset managers. BlackRock received $79.5 million, Fidelity attracted $239.3 million, Bitwise accumulated $100.2 million, Ark Invest saw inflows of $69.8 million and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced inflows of $37.8 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Key Breakout: Last Three 200-Day MA Crossings Triggered ‘Parabolic Bull Runs’ Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and host of the ETF Prime podcast, commented on these inflows via X: “Monster day for spot btc ETFs… $550mil inflows. Now approaching *$20bil* net inflows in 10mos. Simply ridiculous & blows away every pre-launch demand estimate. This is NOT “degen retail” $$$ IMO. It’s advisors & institutional investors continuing to slowly adopt.” At press time, BTC traded at $65,750.

The token is ""operationally ready,"" awaiting regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple Labs' president said.  The company added former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair and ex-CEO of Centre, David Puth, to the advisory board for its stablecoin operation.  MIAMI, U.S. – Ripple named exchange and market maker partners for its upcoming dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, on Tuesday at the Ripple Swell 2024 conference in Miami, Florida. The firm also added ex-Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair, Sheila Bair, and David Puth, the former CEO of Centre, a consortium which set standards for USD Coin (USDC), to the advisory board for its stablecoin.  Ripple is an enterprise-focused blockchain service closely related to the XRP Ledger {{XRP}}. The firm partnered with exchanges Bitstamp, Bitso, Bullish, CoinMENA, Independent Reserve, MoonPay and Uphold for distributing RLUSD at the start, while crypto trading firms Keyrock and B2C2 will serve as market makers for the token. Bullish is the parent company of CoinDesk.  The firm is waiting for regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services for the public rollout of RLUSD, President of Ripple Labs, Monica Long, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""From our side, we are operationally ready,"" Long added.  The announcement comes as Ripple laid out plans earlier this year to issue its own stablecoin vying for a piece in the $170 billion and rapidly growing market of stablecoins. Stablecoins are a key piece of infrastructure within the crypto economy, serving as a bridge between traditional government-issued money and blockchain-based digital assets. They are getting increasingly popular for cross-border transactions and as payment vehicles for goods and services, especially in the emerging markets.  With the stablecoin, Ripple aims to leverage the company's established position for payments and be a key bridge for tokenization of real-world assets, Long told CoinDesk.  ""For RLUSD and stablecoins generally, we definitely have validated the utility of them with payments,"" Long said. ""We're also believers in this broader trend of real-world asset tokenization. When we think beyond tokenizing money to different instruments and capital markets like securities and bonds, real estate and other assets, you need a stable coin that's trusted and very reliable, very robustly managed for on and offramps as well.""  RLUSD's value will be backed by short term U.S. Treasuries, dollar deposits and cash equivalents, and is currently in test mode on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks. The company will release independent monthly attestations about its reserves, which will be prepared by San Francisco-based accounting firm BPM.

Open interest in cash-margined futures has reached an all-time high of 384k BTC ($25.5 billion), driven primarily by institutional activity on the CME.  Crypto-margin as a percentage of total open interest is approaching an all-time low, currently around 18.5%.  Cash-margined bitcoin {{BTC}} futures contracts are more popular than ever.  Open interest in cash-margined futures hit an all-time high of 384,000 BTC ($25.5 billion) on Monday, surpassing the November 2022 peak of 376,000 BTC, when bitcoin traded near $16,000, according to data source Glassnode.  The CME futures accounted for 40% of the cash-margined tally on Monday. Glassnode's cash and crypto-margin charts include standard futures data (excluding perpetuals) from Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX, Bybit, CME, Deribit, Huobi, Kraken and OKX.  Cash-margined open interest has been steadily increasing for the last two years, while open interest in crypto-margined has steadily declined from 210,000 BTC to 87,000 BTC, now accounting for just 18.2% of the total open interest of 478,000 BTC.  Glassnode defines crypto-margin as ""the total amount of futures contracts open interest that is margined in the native coin (e.g., BTC) and not in USD or stablecoin."" The firm defines cash-margin as ""the total amount of futures contracts open interest that is margined in USD or USD-pegged stablecoins. Stablecoins include USDT and BUSD.""  Open interest (OI) refers to the number of active or open futures contracts at a given time. An uptick in open interest is said to represent an inflow of money and preference for leveraged products. Open interest can be measured in native token terms and notional terms. The latter is influenced by the underlying asset's price and can be misleading.  Cash-margined contracts breed less volatility  In cash-margined contracts, the underlying collateral being used is stablecoins and/or dollars, which are more stable than tokens used as margin in the crypto-collaterized futures.  As such, cash-margined contracts are relatively less vulnerable to forced liquidations and breed less volatility. Ultimately, this could provide a more sustainable bull run moving into 2025.  The CME's leadership in cash-margined segment suggests increasing institutional activity in the derivatives market. Sophisticated investors might be using CME futures to hedge their directional plays or set up the market-neutral basis trade.  In October 2023, CME became the largest futures exchange for the first time, capturing over 30% of the market share and overtaking Binance. This increase was most likely driven by traders pricing the expected debut of the U.S.-based spot ETFs, which went live in January.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/cash-margined-bitcoin-futures-are-more-popular-than-ever-as-open-interest-reaches-new-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7ce97a48724fa7aeb66d2eed694f16f3cb1a79e-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hard-landing thesis is supported by positive real rates, declining savings rates, and traditional recession indicators like yield curve inversion. Gold and Bitcoin are recommended for their potential to perform well in both soft and hard landing scenarios, despite Bitcoin's volatility. Bitcoin offers unique convexity potential, acting as both a store of value and a tech asset, making it an all-weather play. Periodically, I write about macro. Early on in my investment career, I discovered the wonders of being a stock investor with a well-defined macro view. The main problem is the ability to sustain a well-calibrated macro view. Only periodically have I been capable of holding a high-conviction macro thesis that I feel confident enough to use to scale my position size. Nevertheless, more important than having the right thesis is holding the right asset. It all boils down to having the right portfolio. The investment world now seems divided between two fiercely competing theses: soft-landing and hard-landing. The hard landing thesis seems to have lost some luster since 2023. Yahoo Finance It has been like this for a long time; it has been so recurrent that it doesn't feel like déjà vu anymore, it just feels like another “Friends” episode. At times, investors have been confronted with this fork in the road, and having counted myself among the hard-landing crowd a few times, I can hear myself being a bit of a broken record throwing out reasons for a recession. However, also knowing that I have been wrong a couple of times in the past and that my portfolio performance suffered, I have to ask myself if there isn't an all-weather asset that can help me avoid the losses of being wrong. In other words, can I pick the wrong thesis and still make money? I think we can pick the asset that fits, but to get there we need to revisit historical patterns. Hard-landing thesis For now, let's take a step back and go through the current possibilities. The hard-landing thesis is perhaps the best documented. A bit like the pursuit of the holy grail, it has attracted the sharpest and most adventurous minds to the fold. Therefore, the case is very well-supported with data points that make a compelling argument. One of the most important aspects to consider is that we are now in positive real rates territory. Positive real rates have been a rare beast in the last 25 years, and almost every time they have been with us for a prolonged period, it has ended in recession. FRED One way I tend to look at this is by adding the savings rate. When real interest rates become positive, available income will drop, and it will likely be compensated by savings consumption. If the tightening cycle is not too destructive, the economy might bear it well. The 1990s is a good example of a decade when real rates trended higher in the first half, with the savings rate dropping steadily. By 1995, real rates started trending lower until 1997, when they resumed, with a new inflection point at the end of 1998. The savings rate kept dropping and bottomed in 2000, just before the recession. FRED A similar analysis can be done for the period ending with the 2008 recession, while the following period, until 2023, was mostly characterized by negative real rates and stable savings rates. The helicopter money of 2020/21 blurs the analysis for the current period. Nevertheless, we are in a tightening period in terms of real rates since 2022, when the rate tightening cycle started. Savings rates are now lower than in 2019, and they seem to be trending lower in 2024. If we factor in the unemployment and apply the Sahm rule, we get the alert that we might be close to a recession or even already be in one. FRED We can look at other popular recession indicators like the inversion of the yield curve, which is uninverting like it does right before a recession. FRED The case is very clear in favor of a recession, with several traditional recession detection metrics flashing red or orange, but, as always, not every single metric is aligned with this view. Soft-landing thesis For me to be completely convinced that the recession is inevitable, I would need to see the insides of the stock market reflecting this. I would need to see cyclicals underperforming defensives. Seeking Alpha Looking at the performance of the various sectors of the S&P 500, we can see that the worst performers in the last month were defensives like Healthcare ( XLV ) and Consumer Staples (XLP). During the last year, the best performers were Technology ( XLK ) and Financials (XLF). While the worst performers were Healthcare and Energy (XLE). This does not suggest a recession. In the past, for instance, the Consumer Discretionary ( XLY ) peaked way ahead of the recession. Seeking Alpha The fact that we presently lack these cues may have two distinct meanings: Either the recession was cancelled, or the equity market is deeply wrong. One decade ago, it was common to hear that the bond market was the smart money, however, fast forward to the present and with all the bond buying from central banks, we cannot be sure that the bond price action carries the same signal . Investment action I think the most likely thesis is that the hard landing is coming. Nevertheless, we have laid out several data points that indicate weakness in both the soft and hard landing scenarios. For instance, although Consumer Discretionary is still strong, it has not surpassed its 2021 peak, and it has underperformed Healthcare since pre-Covid. Seeking Alpha This makes me believe that in both scenarios, the Fed will be dovish. In a hard landing, it will use the same playbook as 2008. However, in a soft landing, the Fed is also likely to try to support the labor market and consumers. Therefore, the end game seems like more liquidity in either case. The best asset to own going into a recession will be Gold (GLD). The liquidity injected into the system will be reflected in gold prices rapidly. But understand that in these moments, markets will also test the soft landing thesis. You will likely see the most cherished names in equity land trying to rally. Below, I also included Louis Vuitton (LVMUY). As you can see, it went up even faster than gold. Later on, the moments of acute collateral shortages brought everything back, even gold gave some of the gains back. Nevertheless, gold still outperformed bonds like the iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF ( IEI ) in 2008. Seeking Alpha What assets will perform well in the soft landing? Equities are likely to perform well in the soft landing. The Fed will ease somewhat more in order to reach a neutral rate, and that should be good for consumers and equity prices. In that scenario, we should see the S&P 500 resume its grinding higher, and Discretionary Staples should also break to new highs. Therefore, gold investors basically risk a soft-landing scenario where gold still performs well, but the most cherished names in equity land outperform it. Is there any way to get some convexity? I think so, with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). It's very hard to provide a short, detailed description of what Bitcoin is. It is many things to many folks. But I dare cite Paul Tudor Jones' letter on Bitcoin from 2020. There, PDT argued that Bitcoin is a store of value and benchmarked it against other available assets. Paul Tudor Jones & Lorenzo Giorgianni Letter, 2020 Although it comes last, for PDT, the surprising factor was that it ranked at close to 70% of gold's score, while it has a fraction of gold's market capitalization. In his assessment, he included four main dimensions: Purchasing power – the ability to retain value; Trustworthiness – universal trust as a store of value; Liquidity – the ability to convert to common currencies; and Portability – the ability to move the asset geographically. I believe that if the assessment were to be conducted now, the score would be much higher. The ETFs have added additional bandwidth that now allows institutions to onboard very fast. They are also contributing to reinforcing the whole infrastructure by pressuring the SEC to make regulatory decisions, bringing big players in, e.g., JPMorgan (JPM), and allowing companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) to add more offerings. Looking at Bitcoin's behavior during the initial Covid months, we can see that it started to move up as it became evident that some intervention would be necessary. In my view, the market was operating on a soft landing thesis. However, when we got to March and lockdowns became a reality (hard landing), credit markets freaked out, there were collateral shortages, and people liquidated in panic. Almost every asset suffered, but Bitcoin suffered much more. However, as the stimulus was unleashed in size, Bitcoin came back to surpass every other asset. Seeking Alpha Risks The previous chart encapsulates the main advantages and risks of using Bitcoin in the present scenario. It might outperform in both soft landing and hard landing but will likely do so with huge volatility. In weeks of collateral shortages, it will likely be the asset of choice to be liquidated to meet margin calls, just like what happened in 2020. Imagine holding Bitcoin in February 2020; could you ride it out? It is a tough question. Additionally, there will be periods when it might underperform equities. In the previous chart, we see that in July 2020, as investors were loading up on risk assets, Bitcoin was underperforming Apple massively. Could investors ride it out without the fear of missing out? I really doubt it. The main issue for Bitcoin investors will be to stick to the plan when dealing with long weeks of violent moves. Another risk is how to implement this strategy. I am bullish on the spot product, but buying spot and storing it is not for everyone, and it is beyond the scope of this piece to explain how to do it. There are solutions like buying it on the exchanges and keeping it there (not really Bitcoin, more like an IOU). Or buying the ETF and dealing with tracking error and ETF-related risks (e.g., custody, fraud). There is also the risk of Bitcoin simply failing technically, or failing to become universally seen as a store of value. Finally, my scenarios do not contemplate a sudden need to tighten monetary conditions. If such a scenario materializes, I believe Bitcoin will underperform massively, as it did in 2022. This is the major weak spot in my investment rationale. Deep Dive on Bitcoin Let's now move to a more granular analysis of Bitcoin that can shed more light on Bitcoin itself and help us see where it stands right now on more granular metrics. Right now, the corrections from local peaks are compatible with previous bull markets, when Bitcoin had violent pullbacks in notable previous uptrends. Therefore, the current fractal has similarities with the previous bull runs. Glassnode A more fundamental way to look at these supply and demand dynamics is to consider the average cost of active investors. We can look at the active investor price, which now stands at $52.5k . The spot price has been trading significantly above that level. That is a sign that the potential supply is comfortably in the money and may take its time before rushing to sell. Ignoring all the noise from market commentators, we can see that the CPI has been trending lower. Bitcoin investors are very liquidity-sensitive and will try to front-run interest rate cuts and easing financial conditions. With Bitcoin now printing a series of higher highs and higher lows since March, we might be witnessing the change in sentiment that sets in motion a breakout. Tradingview Finally, there is Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score, a metric used to measure Bitcoin's value by comparing its market value to its realized value—the realized value being the value at the last time each bitcoin was moved on-chain. Like traditional valuation metrics, this gives us insight into whether the market is overvalued or not. A high MVRV suggests that investors deep in the money might eventually balance the price by increasing supply, creating a price top. A low MVRV implies exactly the opposite. Currently, the MVRV Z-score shows we are far from the high levels that mark tops, and this, together with the previous data, is compatible with a constructive scenario. Where might this lead us? Coinglass At this point, I think the value potential for Bitcoin can be best summarized by VanEck's CEO, who suggested that it could reach half of gold's market capitalization, which would translate to a price target of $350,000 . This might seem ambitious, but we're not even considering the possibility of adoption by Central Banks. Conclusion Bitcoin has the potential to perform well in both soft and hard landing scenarios, and it will have movements of violent reversals that might drive investors mad. There is one reason for that: Bitcoin has features that make it similar to gold but also has features that make it akin to a tech stock. Therefore, markets will at times use it as a store of value similar to gold; other times, this will be supercharged by the fact that it is a technology being adopted at a fast pace. Conversely, sometimes the opposite will happen: investors will recognize the risk of Bitcoin being a failed technological attempt to emulate gold, and they will dump it to stabilize portfolios. We have covered it all. I think Bitcoin, at this juncture, has enough convexity potential to make it an all-weather play – one of those that seldom appears. However, that does not mean you won't get wet if it rains.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726820-macro-literally-at-a-crossroads-bitcoin-might-be-the-asset-that-fits?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34732663.jpeg

34731469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647941,1728990034,"SUI Records Substantial 120% Price Surge, But Insider Selling Claims Raise Red Flags","Layer 1 blockchain protocol Sui (SUI) has made headlines recently, recording an impressive 120% increase over the past 30 days, allowing the protocol’s native token SUI to outperform the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies on the market, culminating in a new all-time high of $2.35 on October 13. However, since this peak, the token has retreated by nearly 5%, largely due to growing concerns over allegations of insider selling among the project’s stakeholders. Can SUI Match Solana’s Success? Market expert LightCrypto took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday to express his skepticism about the sustainability of SUI’s recent gains. In a lengthy post, he noted SUI’s substantial rise, which has quintupled from its previous lows of $0.5 on August 5, amid the broader market crash that occurred that day. While the market appears to be eager for new winners, with macroeconomic conditions pointing to further price gains, LightCrypto raised two critical points that could undermine SUI’s upward trajectory. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising Firstly, the expert questioned the rationale behind SUI’s current $23 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV), particularly when compared to Solana’s $73 billion according to Coingecko data. LightCrypto argued that it no longer makes sense to assume SUI can replicate Solana’s success, especially given that it currently trades at just a quarter of Solana’s market valuation. The expert further challenged the community to articulate a compelling risk-reward scenario that justifies such a disparity, asking whether SUI has demonstrated even a fraction of Solana’s potential. Potential Market Correction Looms Secondly, LightCrypto alleged the worrying trend of insider selling, indicating that insiders, including what is believed to be a large endowment fund, have dumped around $400 million in tokens during the recent rally. The expert noted that this selling trend has not only occurred at higher price levels, but has also been ongoing since much lower valuations. Ultimately, LightCrypto believes that the acceleration of these sales may create a disconcerting atmosphere for retail investors, who may be buying tokens from those best informed about their true value. Related Reading: Why Isn’t XRP Price Moving? Crypto Pundit Claims The Answer The implication is stark: as these supposed insiders cash out while retail investors chase momentum, the potential for a market correction looms large, potentially threatening the token’s current rally. Despite these allegations, SUI, currently trading at $2.24, continues to see significant investor interest in the token, with trading volume up 36% in Sunday’s session, valued at approximately $1.7 billion.

The company's ""infinite money glitch"" involves borrowing at low rates to buy appreciating Bitcoin, leveraging its software business to cover interest payments. The main risk is the company's reliance on speculative Bitcoin interest and the sustainability of borrowing at low rates for continued BTC purchases. Given the 160% premium to BTC holdings, I recommend investing directly in Bitcoin or spot ETFs rather than MicroStrategy at this juncture. Perhaps one of the most interesting assets in the financial markets for followers of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies is the equity in MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). I've covered MSTR a few times for Seeking Alpha and I'm not going to rehash my points about the stock premium to BTC holdings. Last December, I thought the setup for MSTR was one of the best I could find in the equity market. So much so, that I called MicroStrategy my top long idea for 2024 in Seeking Alpha's Long/Short Pick Investment Competition. The stock has nearly quadrupled since that article was published. Data by YCharts Yet, I've missed a large part of this rally because I've felt the large premium to the underlying BTC that the company holds on its balance sheet was unwarranted. That premium is now larger. Given 252,220 BTC on the balance sheet, MicroStrategy's BTC holdings have a market value of $16.6 billion versus a stock market capitalization of $43 billion. Thus, an implied premium of nearly 160%. This premium continues to be the center of much of the debate pertaining to MSTR stock. I'm not going to focus on the premium. Rather, in my updated view on MSTR we'll look at MSTR vs BTC, the long term trend in BTC per MSTR shares, and assess whether it's time to throw caution to the wind and get back on board this 'infinite money' printing train. MicroStrategy vs Bitcoin Data by YCharts Year to date, MicroStrategy stock has vastly outperformed Bitcoin. Since the beginning of the year, MSTR has rallied over 240% while BTC has generated just a 49% return. This out-performance for MSTR has been well-covered at this point. The stock acts as a leveraged play on the coin precisely because of the corporate treasury strategy that MicroStrategy has been operating since it began holding BTC as its primary reserve asset several years ago. What I find to be more interesting is the out-performance for MSTR has started to intensify over the last several weeks: Data by YCharts If we look at MSTR vs BTC on a 6-month chart, the 47% moonshot in MSTR at a time when BTC has been mainly flat to down is nothing short of staggering. What explains this? Some of the sentiment that I'm seeing on places like X seems to imply MSTR is at the beginning of a large short squeeze. While I do think it's plausible that there is a short covering component to this recent rise to some degree, the overall trend in the MSTR short position has already been down for nearly two years: Data by YCharts At the end of 2022, the percent of MSTR shares outstanding sold short was over 30%. Currently, that figure is down to 15%. On the surface, this may look as though shorts have covered half of their position, but that's not the full picture. The shares outstanding figure has increased by 68% over the same time frame. On a split-adjusted basis, there has been very little change in the number of shares that are short: MSTR Short Interest (Nasdaq, Author's calculations) We don't yet know what the short interest is for the first half of October, but as of September 30th, there are 30.7 million MSTR shares sold short. Split-adjusted , this figure is still right in line with where it was in late December and early January. Again, we don't know what this figure will look like yet for the first half of October. But I don't think we can conclusively say a short squeeze is driving this move in MSTR shares relative to BTC. What is more likely in my estimation is MSTR is benefiting from a retail-driven meme trade: MSTR Daily chart w/Retail Trader % (TrendSpider) Retail traders have become a much larger percentage of volume measured through TrendSpider data. At the peak of the March rally, retail percent of MSTR volume hit 1.05. As of October 11th, that figure ripped up to 1.44. For comparison's sake, this is actually much less than the retail percentages that can be observed in other high-flying stocks like Tesla ( TSLA ) or NVIDIA ( NVDA ). But there is a clear spike in retail interest for MSTR and I suspect this is the larger driver of MSTR's recent performance than an active short squeeze. The question is why? Infinite Money Glitch The resumed interest in MSTR shares is perhaps due to greater market acceptance of the company's BTC treasury management strategy. What has been dubbed online as the 'infinite money glitch' is fairly straightforward. MicroStrategy borrows at a low fixed rate cost of capital and pours the borrowed funds into additional Bitcoin purchases. Essentially, creditors are giving MicroStrategy a depreciating asset at a low borrow cost so that the company can continue to buy an asset that historically appreciates at an annualized rate that dramatically surpasses the borrow rate. The advantage that MicroStrategy has is its software business generates cash that can be used to pay off the interest on corporate debt. Historically, this debt has been beneficial to shareholders on a BTC per share basis: Q2 Earnings Deck Slide 6 (MicroStrategy) When adjusting for the company's assumptions on diluted shares outstanding, the net benefit to shareholders is a higher return of value reflected through what MicroStrategy is calling a BTC Yield. The company is projecting this yield to continue higher at an annualized rate between 4-8% between 2025 and 2027. Adjusting for the dollar rise in BTC, BTC per MSTR share has increased by 2.9% year to date per data from BitcoinTreasuries : BTC Holdings Per MSTR Share (BitcoinTreasuries.Net) Frankly, it's a fascinating strategy and it has worked so far; which is undoubtedly why MicroStrategy has gained so much attention in recent weeks. When the MSTR premium runs up, the company raises more capital and buys Bitcoin to bring the share premium back down. It's a compelling flywheel if it keeps working. However, I'm not convinced the company can continue doing this without selling some of its BTC down the line. Risks The obvious risk is the company's equity is more reliant on speculative interest in Bitcoin rather than any underlying business. The less obvious risk is how much longer the company can continue borrowing at such low rates to finance Bitcoin purchases. Q2 Earnings Deck Slide 12 (MicroStrategy) Long-term profitability of the software business is not at all clear, in my opinion. In the last quarter, the company was barely profitable even if you strip out stock-based compensation. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 63.2% in Q2-24 and is 57% trailing twelve months. The point is, the very dynamic that allows MicroStrategy to do this can't continue in perpetuity. Closing Thoughts I will absolutely own it that I've been wrong on the premium dynamic for MSTR this year. For me, the question when allocating my own capital is what is the better play today having missed out on the rally in MSTR since my article in July. Personally, I think it's wiser to put capital into Bitcoin directly or one of the spot ETFs at this juncture. A 160% premium to BTC holdings via MSTR implies a BTC price of $171k BTC. Assuming BTC gets that high, I suspect the better return from here will be in BTC rather than MSTR. I could certainly be wrong again. But I'd rather buy the asset that I know MicroStrategy will buy than buy MicroStrategy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726809-microstrategy-infinite-money-glitch?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34731334.jpeg

This article explains how IREN's no-HODL is holding back profitability, destroying shareholder equity, and potentially rendering its thousand expansion efforts irrelevant. IREN's cost basis with the newer fleets and HPC can rival CLSK, but its profitability profile remains inferior because CLSK can sell Bitcoin at potentially higher prices in the future. Overall, IREN's no-HODL policy is a dealbreaker for us as it is detrimental to its profitability prospects and valuation. Introduction There's a saying: A single mistake can undo a thousand good deeds We think that this saying reflects our thesis for Iris Energy ( IREN ) quite accurately. IREN was an underdog just two years ago. It grew its capacity from 0.8 EH/s to 21 EH/s (September update) while maintaining operation cost efficiency around the sector average (Fig 1). Fig 1. All-in Cost Basis of Major Bitcoin Miners. It includes power cost, depreciation SG&A, financial costs, and other costs not related to impairment. One-off expenses/income such as BITF's 2024Q2 tax recovery are pro-rated to previous periods. (Author) On the growth side of the equation, IREN remains as the fastest-growing Bitcoin mining company in the sector now and into the near future. IREN is still keeping its momentum with expansion to 30 EH/s fully funded and a visible pathway to 50 EH/s via purchasing options . As a result, as of 2024Q2 (not the monthly update), IREN gained 233% more network share (relative Bitcoin network) compared to 2022Q4 figures, while Bitfarms ( BITF ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) lost a quarter of their market share (Fig 2, Fig 3). Table 1 also shows that IREN is expected to outgrow competitors in the near future. Table 1. Expansion Guidance of Major Bitcoin Mining Companies Company BITF CLSK IREN MARA RIOT Latest Capacity 11.30 27.6 21 36.9 28.2 Guided Capacity 21.00 50.00 40.00 50.00 41.00 Guided Growth (%) 86% 81% 90% 36% 45% Guidance Timeline 2024Q4 2025Q4 2025H1 2024Q4 2025Q4 This rate of capacity growth is important to gain network share because the Bitcoin reward (production) is based on one's capacity relative to the sum of capacity of all miners. Fig 2. Normalized Change (%) of Relative Network Share of Major Bitcoin Miners. The Relative Network Hash Rate was used instead of the Bitcoin Total Network Hash Rate for comps in order to better present the growth between the miners under consideration. All revenue-related computations still uses the Total Bitcoin Network Hash Rate. (Author) Fig 3. Relative Network Share of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) On the cost side of the equation, although the all-in cost basis per Bitcoin throughout the sector has increased after the halving event in April 2024, IREN still maintains its sector average cost efficiency, not as good as CleanSpark, but better than the rest, namely Riot Platforms ((RIOT)), Marathon Holdings ( MARA ), and Bitfarms ((BITF)). Overall, IREN looks promising and has gained positive attention among investors. However, we identified a fundamental problem we perceive as a non-negotiable dealbreaker for investing in IREN. The good news is this problem could be easily reversible by the board. Hence, we remain hopeful. The Mistake That Undoes A Thousand Efforts IREN's business model revolves around liquidating all Bitcoins mined and shareholder dilution to fund operations and expansions. Many analysts and investors will attribute the advantage of such a policy to being debt-free. This pursuit of a debt-free policy could be a side effect of a past shadow , where it lost 3.6 EH/s worth of operation due to a loan default. Whether this is true is not relevant. What's relevant is that the adverse consequences of this policy outweigh the benefit of being debt-free. Irreversible Realized Losses The first adverse consequence of a no-HODL policy is the irreversible losses from Bitcoin mining. IREN reported a net loss of $24.2mil in 2024Q2 or a $29,500 loss per Bitcoin mined (divided by 821 Bitcoins mined during the period). Although all major Bitcoin mining companies made losses in 2024Q2, IREN made different types of losses. IREN's losses differ from those of other Bitcoin mining companies because its losses are fully realized and irreversible. We highlighted this problem in our buy thesis for MARA , where we looked into whether an unprofitable Bitcoin mining company can justify a price-to-book value ratio ('PBR') greater than 1. We highly recommend you go through our rationale for full context. In short, we explained that PBR>1 indicates an underlying expectation for profitability. Yet, PBR>1 is okay for unprofitable Bitcoin miners because they can HODL the Bitcoins produced and sell them when the price appreciates above the cost incurred for their production. As long as the Bitcoins are not sold for cash, the profits and losses are not realized and has the opportunity to turn a profit. It is like an active trade position in Bitcoin. For example, if IREN HODLs Bitcoin, IREN can wait until the Bitcoin price appreciates above $92,500 (its all-in cost basis per Bitcoin in 2024Q2) before selling the 801 Bitcoins mined in 2024Q2. This essentially reverses the reported losses in 2024Q2 into gains on digital assets. Unfortunately, IREN's no-HODL policy inhibits it from doing so. Depending on our Bitcoin outlook, this policy may pose a significant problem. If you expect Bitcoin to trade above its cost basis (like in the past), which is $92,500, IREN's no-HODL policy shouldn't concern you. However, based on our expectations (peaking at $100,000 before an 85% drop during the bear market ), IREN's all-in cost basis of $92,500 per Bitcoin is unfeasible. This unprofitability can lead to a bigger problem: IREN's aggressive 50 EH/s expansion may become irrelevant, essentially undoing its thousand-effort. The Undoing of its Thousand Efforts We stressed that it is not about having the largest absolute mining capacity ('EH/s'); it is the growth rate that counts. In this aspect, IREN is putting tremendous effort into what counts, which saw it increase network share by 233% compared to the major Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin production. However, these growth efforts could be irrelevant if Bitcoin cannot be produced profitably because producing more Bitcoins at a loss will only worsen profitability. Some might argue that IREN's expansion will include newer mining fleets with better efficiency. Still, our findings indicate that the improved efficiency is insufficient for IREN to turn profitable with a no-HODL policy. IREN expects its mining fleet efficiency to improve by 40% from the current 25 J/TH to 15 J/TH with the new mining fleets. This will reduce its cost of revenue (electricity) down from $25.7mil (2024Q2) to $15.4mil, which will reduce total cost from $75.9mil (or $92,500 per Bitcoin) to $65.6mil (or $80,000 per Bitcoin). IREN remains unprofitable even if the full cost savings from the newer mining fleets are captured. Hence, IREN's effort to expand may yield no fruit (profit) because of the no-HODL policy. Then what about the HPC business segment? Can it help solve the irreversible loss problem? Contributions of HPC Our findings show that IREN's HPC can be a cost-saving measure. Since IREN is hosting its HPC operations and Bitcoin mining operations under the same roof, we don't expect SG&A costs to scale as much as HPC capacity. So, the two cost drivers would be electricity and depreciation. Electricity is a non-issue because the hardware margin is 98%. For depreciation, assuming a 5-year useful life on the $76mil ( $ 10mil + $22mil on H100 + $44mil on H200) GPU investments, the annual depreciation cost per quarter would be $15.2mil. So after depreciation, expected annual profits will drop from $34mil to $19mil (or $4.75mil per quarter). Based on 2024Q2 Bitcoin production, this translates to $5,800 cost savings per Bitcoin ($4.75mil divide by 821 Bitcoin). Assuming the expected $80,000 cost basis per Bitcoin, IREN's HPC segment can further push cost down to $74,200 per Bitcoin. It remains to be seen whether this is enough to make IREN the most efficient in the sector because CLSK, the reigning champion of mining efficiency, will also update its mining fleets with newer models. Nevertheless, IREN's HPC segment is expected to help it achieve similar cost basis as CLSK, which is the best in the sector (Fig 1). However, their profitability profile differs drastically because CLSK has the opportunity to sell Bitcoin at potentially higher prices in the future thanks to its HODL policy. Therefore, we can see that IREN's no-HODL policy is lowering profitability, potentially to a point of rendering its expansion efforts irrelevant. Unrecoverable Shareholder Equity Another problem with IREN's no-HODL policy is about shareholder dilution. Our previous thesis mentioned that any form of margin of safety (based on book value) is expected to be temporal due to the lack of un-depreciable assets (Bitcoin). On the flip side, IREN's book value also does not have room for appreciation due to the lack of appreciable assets (Bitcoin). For context, all these major Bitcoin miners increase outstanding shares almost proportionally (aside from CLSK) over the past 3 years. But only MARA and RIOT managed to recover their shareholder equity (Fig 4). Note that during the Bitcoin bear market (Fig 4), every major Bitcoin miners lost shareholder equity during the Bitcoin bear market. What MARA and RIOT had in common was their large Bitcoin reserves. This is also a contributing factor for our bullish thesis for MARA . Fig 4. Adjusted Book Value Per Share of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) Fig 5. Proportion (%) of Bitcoin over Total Asset (Author) (Author) Fig 6. Normalized Change (%) Outstanding Shares of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) Unrecoverable book value is also highly detrimental to valuation. By referring to Fig 7, we observe an ongoing sector-wide mean reversion on PBR where IREN is now trading at the same PBR as the likes of MARA, which has high proportion of Bitcoin on Balance Sheet. This is where the same water that hardens the egg, softens the potato. This mean reversion offers fundamental upside for MARA but significant downside risk for IREN. We explained that PBR>1 implies expectations for an appreciable book value or a high profitability prospect, both of which IREN does not currently possess, again, due to its no-HODL policy. Fig 7. Sector Mean Reversion on PBR (Author) Can HPC help with valuation? Unlikely as per IREN's own guidance. IREN only expects a 2.5x earnings multiple on the GPUs. IREN stated that it'll take 2 years to recoup the CAPEX on GPUs while the GPUs only have an expected 5-year useful life. The 2.5x earnings multiple on a $19mil profit only contributes $47.5mil of market cap or 3% of IREN's current market cap. Also, many people might argue HPC is a profit-guarantee business. Who would charge a rate lower than the cost? Well, we only have to look as far as RIOT for making significant losses QoQ in its hosting segment. Hence, the HPC segment is not without its risks and does not contribute to IREN's valuation. Verdict IREN is performing exceptionally well on what matters: growing capacity fast while keeping cost basis low. What we think is lacking is a decision to abolish its no-HODL policy. We think that IREN, with a HODL policy, can become one of the most exciting and attractive investments in Bitcoin mining. In this article, we showed how IREN's no-HODL is holding back profitability, destroying shareholder equity, and potentially rendering its 'thousand efforts' (to expand) irrelevant. It is also why IREN's no-HODL is a dealbreaker for us. Therefore, investors of IREN should pay close attention to this particular catalyst, the day IREN HODLs Bitcoin. Meanwhile, IREN could still pump more than other miners on the back of exciting headline numbers (capacity, HPC, etc), but we find little that can support a buy thesis when things go south under current circumstances. Again, we think that all it takes is for IREN to turnaround is a decision from the board. Until then, IREN will only live in our watchlist. For now, we're only looking to tilt our portfolio into MARA and CLSK when we receive our 2 confirmations for a potential bull run by 17th October.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726799-iris-energy-mistake-that-undid-thousand-efforts?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34729671.jpeg

Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, started the third week of October with a 6% daily surge. BTC’s performance has fueled bullish sentiment among crypto investors and market watchers, who suggest it might be ready to move to $70,000. Related Reading: Why Isn’t XRP Price Moving? Crypto Pundit Claims The Answer Bitcoin Reclaims Key Support Levels Bitcoin began the week reclaiming key resistance levels after a 6% surge from Sunday’s price. This performance saw BTC move from the $62,000 support zone to retest the $66,000 support area on Monday morning. Following the recent performance, Bitcoin’s October returns so far have turned green with a 3.17% monthly return, according to Coinglass data. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted Bitcoin’s recent movements, noting that BTC has been able to reclaim a 2-month downtrend as support. Per the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency has retested a downtrend line dating back to late July since October started. BTC successfully retested and bounced from the trendline for two consecutive weeks, turning the range into support. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin has performed several successful retests, including a “volatile retest” of the 21-week Bull Market Exponential Moving Average (EMA). “Notice how the bottom of the green boxed area is confluent with the July Downtrend retest and the retest of the 21-week EMA is confluent with the top of the green box,” the analyst added. Similarly, Ali Martinez highlighted that BTC is currently making another attempt to reclaim the 200-day Moving Average after four consecutive rejections in the past two months. BTC Challenges August Highs Rekt Capital noted that BTC has solidified the $58,000-$61,000 range as a support area throughout the year: “It has done so at a Higher Low compared to last month’s downside wicking lows as well as August’s downside wicking lows.” Moreover, the analyst stated that Bitcoin challenged August highs, at around $64,200, after the recent retests of the key levels. He suggested that BTC’s recent movements are a “clear sign” that August’s level is “weakening as resistance.” Rekt Capital pointed out BTC is retesting the multi-month weekly downtrend channel top, which is also weakening as resistance. The flagship cryptocurrency successfully tested the channel’s range lows as support this month. The range lows have been 7-month confluent support with the previous all-time high (ATH) area. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that BTC must have a weekly close above the downtrend channel’s top to break out of this pattern. A weekly close above August highs, followed by a successful retest of this level, would “pose a significant buy-side pressure on the Downtrending Channel Top,” which could be accelerated if BTC’s daily close sits above $64,200. Related Reading: WIF Bulls Charge Toward $2.89 As Key Resistance Test Looms Moreover, a daily close above $65,000 and a successful reclaim of the range as a support zone could send BTC’s price toward the $70,000 resistance zone.

Ethereum Ascending Channel Could Reveal Its Next Destination In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a pattern that the 1-week price of Ethereum has potentially been following during the last couple of years. The pattern in question is the “Ascending Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which is a type of Parallel Channel. In a Parallel Channel, the asset consolidates between two parallel trendlines, with the upper level connecting successive tops and the lower bottoms. Related Reading: Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top These two levels are slopped upwards in the case of an Ascending Channel, as already hinted at by its name. Thus, an Ascending Channel only forms when the asset sets higher highs and lows. The lower level of the pattern can support the price, while the upper one may act as resistance. If either of these levels break, the asset could see a continuation of trend in that direction; a surge above the top line can be a bullish sign, while a drop under the bottom line can foreshadow a bearish outcome. There is also another type of Parallel Channel, called the Descending Channel, which works much in the same way as the Ascending Channel, except for the fact that it points downwards. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Ascending Channel that the 1-week Ethereum price could be trading inside right now: As displayed in the above graph, the 1-week Ethereum price has recently been retesting the bottom level of this potential Ascending Channel pattern. The analyst has highlighted what happened the last few times that the coin made a retest of this line. “Every bounce off this channel’s lower boundary has historically led to an average 130% price increase for Ethereum,” notes Martinez. Thus, if the Ascending Channel continues to hold for the cryptocurrency, it could benefit from another surge shortly “If this pattern holds, a similar move could push ETH to $6,000—provided the $2,300 support level stays intact,” says the analyst. This support level naturally corresponds to the channel’s bottom line, a drop beyond which could potentially invalidate the formation.

42407360,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGlUt,1728978260,CME's Bitcoin Friday Futures Are Ideal for News Traders: CF Benchmarks,"News-driven traders can set targeted strategies with CME's Bitcoin Friday futures (BFF) contracts.  The weekly expiry limits basis and caps rollover costs, facilitating improved profitability.  Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) bitcoin {{BTC}} futures that expire on Friday are ideally suited for news traders looking to bet on key U.S. economic data releases, CF Benchmarks' CEO Sui Chung said, explaining the performance of the recently launched contracts.  The CME debuted cash-settled Friday futures, sized at one-50th of one BTC with lower margin requirements, on Sept. 30 to make the futures product accessible to retail investors. The so-called BFF contract settles every Friday at 16:00 New York Time and tracks Cf Benchmark's Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York (BRRNY) variant. A new contract is listed Thursday at 18:00 New York time, allowing market participants to trade the nearest two Fridays at any point in time.  The global derivatives giant registered a first-day trading volume of over 31,000 contracts across two different contract weeks, becoming the exchange's most successful crypto futures launch ever.  ""Unlike monthly contracts, which are influenced by a wide range of events over four weeks, the weekly contracts allow investors to better express views on Bitcoin's reaction to specific events, such as U.S. macro data releases,"" Chung told CoinDesk in an interview.  Bitcoin has emerged as a macro asset since the coronavirus-induced crash of 2020, with short-term traders/speculators making bets by following notable news announcements and data releases like the monthly U.S. inflation figures and the nonfarm payrolls data.  The Friday futures provide several benefits to news traders, including low basis or price differential relative to spot prices, lower rollover costs and more targeted trading strategies.  The shorter duration limits the gap between futures and spot prices, ensuring a lower premium than monthly standard and micro futures contracts. The lower premium means the contango bleed, or the cost incurred from moving positions from the impending expiry to the following Friday expiry, is relatively less than extended duration contracts, leading to improved profitability.  ""The reduced time horizon of the weekly contracts generally results in a low basis compared to their monthly counterparts, simplifying analysis for retail traders,"" Chung said.  Chung added that the alignment between the Friday futures expiry and the daily NAV calculation of U.S.-listed spot ETFs, most of which refer to the BRRNY, enhances market liquidity. The more liquidity, the easier it is to execute large orders at stable prices, and the more efficient the price discovery mechanism.  Note that on offshore unregulated exchanges, retail traders prefer perpetual futures, which use the funding rate mechanism to keep prices aligned with the spot market. The funding fee is collected from traders every eight hours. These rates are volatile, adding an element of uncertainty and unpredictability.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/cmes-bitcoin-friday-futures-are-ideal-for-news-traders-cf-benchmarks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c60a2ea5269958bae900451ec4d7ec71e36b796-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34725746,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647960,1728977429,Crypto Prices Go Up: A ‘Cautious Bullish’ Outlook Amid Fed Worries And Market Volatility,"A recent report from centralized exchange (CEX) Blofin highlights a cautiously bullish sentiment among crypto investors, even as macroeconomic indicators and global market conditions continue to inject a degree of precaution into the market. Market Anticipates Limited Fed Rate Cuts According to the firm’s analysis, one significant factor influencing market sentiment is the surprisingly positive Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for September, which has altered expectations regarding future interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Currently, the market anticipates that the Fed will implement a total of only 45 basis points (bps) in rate cuts for the remainder of the year. Moreover, the options market suggests that there may be just one additional rate cut in 2024, likely a 25 bps reduction, followed by a pause in early 2025. Related Reading: Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top This outlook aligns with prior analyses by Blofin, which indicate that the Fed’s capacity for further cuts has diminished, indicating a shift from aggressive liquidity injections to a more measured approach. However, the recent CPI surprise has also intensified market uncertainty, as reflected in the MOVE index, which tracks volatility in Treasury yields. This index surged to its highest level since June 2024, signaling heightened apprehension among investors. Concurrently, volatility indices for other assets have also increased, highlighting a broader trend of rising uncertainty. Despite these challenges, both the US Dollar Index (DXY) and US equities have demonstrated resilience, maintaining strength even amid shifting economic conditions. Yet, a notable decline in equity risk premiums suggests a growing complacency among investors or a diminished reward for taking on equity risk. This reduced premium could expose the market to greater vulnerabilities in the event of unforeseen shocks. Optimism Grows In Crypto Options Market In the crypto space, recent price movements have been notable, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing significant surges. Analysis from GEX points out that there are currently no clear resistance levels in the market, suggesting that price movements might continue without substantial barriers. However, the exchange noted that this lack of structural support also underscores the market’s “inherent fragility.” They contend that if investor sentiment were to shift, the current price levels could be difficult to maintain. Additionally, the options market has seen a shift in skewness toward a more optimistic position, though it remains within a neutral range. This change indicates a growing confidence among crypto investors, albeit without overwhelming bullish sentiment. Notably, tail risk pricing has been on the rise since the end of September. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Giga Pump’ For XRP Price, Here’s The Target Overall, this trend reflects investors’ concerns about potential “extreme negative events,” underscoring that, despite the recent rally seen in the crypto market, uncertainties surrounding future Fed rate cuts and broader macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh heavily on sentiment. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,970, up more than 5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Traders are becoming increasingly optimistic that BTC will challenge its all-time high by the end of the year.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted inflows of $555.86 million on Monday, according to data provider SoSoValue, amid signs of a possible bitcoin rally.  This is a multi-month record for ETF inflows, as the last time the asset class posted higher inflows was on June 4, when it hit $886.75 million.  BTC is up 2.2% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Indices data, matching the CoinDesk 20, an index tracking the performance of the largest digital assets.  As CoinDesk reported earlier, one technical indicator called the ""three-line break chart"" shows Bitcoin could be on track to break past $73,000, signaling a return to an upward trend after months of back-and-forth price movement.  Prediction market traders have become more optimistic about BTC's price potential in the last week. On Polymarket, the 'yes' side of a contract that asks if BTC will hit a new all-time high in 2024 is trading at 64% up 9 percentage points in the last week.  On Kalshi, bettors are giving a 46% chance that bitcoin's price hits $75,000 this year, up 7 percentage points. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of over $71,000 in March of this year.

According to a CryptoQuant analyst, EgyHash, Bitcoin’s open interest—a measure of the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—has reached a new all-time high. This development signals heightened activity in the Bitcoin market and suggests strong sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $62k: Analysts Explain Why The Bull Cycle Is Far From Over Detailing The Open Interest ATH In a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, EgyHash detailed the significance of this new peak in Bitcoin’s open interest. The analyst noted, “Bitcoin’s open interest has reached a new all-time high of $19.8 billion. Additionally, funding rates have hit their highest positive levels since August, indicating that much of this open interest is skewed toward long positions.” Notably, the rise in open interest and increasing funding rates point to a bullish outlook among traders, signaling their confidence in Bitcoin’s continued upward movement. EgyHash further emphasized that this trend in the derivatives market reflects a growing influx of liquidity and increased attention in cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin’s open interest has been climbing, the asset’s price has also seen significant upward movement. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin’s value increased by 5.1%, trading at $65,655, following a brief rally to over $66,000. This price increase has been accompanied by a notable rise in Bitcoin’s overall market capitalization, which currently stands at $1.297 trillion, up from $1.175 trillion just last week. Bitcoin’s trading volume has also surged, doubling from below $20 billion over the weekend to over $40 billion today. Bitcoin Price Outlook The rising market activity and price gains have led several crypto analysts to weigh in on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. One prominent analyst, Trader Tardigrade, shared his bullish outlook, revealing that there has been a breakout in Bitcoin Stochastic. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move?

Samara Targets 1,000 Bitcoin Milestone Publicly-listed asset management firm Samara announced it had mandated investment bank Pareto Securities as a sole manager to schedule a series of fixed-income investor meetings to potentially issue up to a €30 million or $32.8 million Nordic bond. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317% Notably, the proceeds from the bond issuance will be utilized toward expanding Samara’s existing investment portfolio by acquiring additional limited partnership stakes in alternative investment funds. Additionally, the funds raised will help Samara boost its Bitcoin holdings. The firm confirmed it uses BTC as its “primary treasury reserve asset,” and currently holds “around 421 BTC,” according to CEO Patrick Lowry. Commenting on the development, Lowry said: The proceeds will allow Samara to further expand and solidify its already robust balance sheet as we diversify into new emerging technologies through new fund investments. With Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset, we also enhance our liquidity position with bond proceeds. He added that Samara has been holding BTC “for years” and aims to increase its reserves while investing in disruptive technology. Lowry also mentioned that, while it may be challenging, it would “be a dream to stack as much as Michael Saylor,” CEO of MicroStrategy. According to data from CoinGecko, MicroStrategy leads the global list of publicly traded companies purchasing BTC for their corporate treasury. As of October 14, MicroStrategy holds more than 252,000 BTC or approximately 1.2% of the total circulating supply. Saylor has also been quite vocal about sharing ambitious Bitcoin price targets. In September 2024, the MicroStrategy CEO predicted that BTC could soar to as high as $13 million by 2045. BTC Remains The Preferred Digital Asset Ahead Of ETH, SOL Despite the rapid advancements in smart contract ecosystems like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for companies as part of their treasury management strategy. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance in institutional adoption. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has further cemented BTC as a reliable digital asset with regulatory clarity. Although Ethereum ETFs have also received regulatory approval, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has not seen the same level of institutional adoption in corporate balance sheets.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5540 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5550 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5650. A clear move above the $0.5650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.600 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6120, where the bears might emerge. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5440 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.5400 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5252 swing low to the $0.5550 high.

42407357,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGlHf,1728967213,This Chart Indicates Bitcoin May Be Headed for Record Highs Above $73K,"BTC's ""three-line break chart"" suggests a bullish resolution of the seven-month-long corrective trend and scope for a move to record highs.  Candlesticks indicate stiff resistance at around $70,000.  Traders fixated on bitcoin's {{BTC}} daily candlesticks chart may be bored, as, despite Monday's rally, prices remain locked in a prolonged directionless channel. However, a lesser-tracked ""three-line break chart"" now suggests a bullish outlook favoring a move to record highs.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose over 5% to $66,000, registering its biggest single-day gain since Aug. 23, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Still, the daily candlesticks chart suggests a neutral outlook, as BTC remains trapped within a seven-month-long corrective descending channel, identified by trendlines connecting highs reached in March and June and lows registered in May and July.  However, the three-line break chart shows that the breakout of the prolonged descending channel happened on Monday and the broader uptrend from October 2023 lows near $30,000 has resumed. The bull victory could lead to record highs above $73,000.  The three-line break chart might look like the candlesticks chart but focuses on price movements and changes in trend while ignoring time, helping traders filter out erratic price movements and noise while gauging the ongoing trend and potential trend reversals.  ""A Japanese trader described the three-line break chart as a more subtle form of point and figure charts where reversals are decided by the market and not by arbitrary rules, that means we can gear it to the strength and dynamism of the market,"" chartered market technician Steve Nison said in his book ""Beyond Candlesticks"".  The line break chart consists of vertical blocks called lines or bars (green and red). A bullish reversal, represented by a new lineup (green bar), happens when the price moves higher than the highest point of the last three red lines. A new red line (bearish reversal) occurs when the price moves below the lowest point for the previous three green lines.  A bullish continuation occurs when the price moves above the previous green line, confirming an extension of the already-established uptrend. That's precisely what happened on Monday, with the green bar cutting through the trendline off March and April highs, as seen below.  While the breakout on the line break chart indicates the scope for a rally to new peaks, traders should be watchful of two things, the first being the candlestick chart, which shows bulls have consistently failed to secure a foothold above $70,000 since March. Prices could again encounter stiff resistance around that level.  The second thing to watch out for is bullish invalidation on the line break chart, represented by a new red bar taking prices back inside the channel. Failed breakouts often lead to deeper price slides as observed in late September.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/this-chart-indicates-bitcoin-may-be-headed-for-record-highs-above-73k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e0c63cfaf32c09f1513d135ba4f492bdedd627f-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
34720964,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647963,1728966621,Bitcoin Nears Key Breakout: Last Three 200-Day MA Crossings Triggered ‘Parabolic Bull Runs’,"After a brief dip below the $60,000 mark on October 10, Bitcoin (BTC) has regained momentum, inching closer to its all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, reached in March of this year. This price recovery follows considerable volatility experienced by the largest cryptocurrency on the market throughout the year, with significant price swings, including sharp falls of almost 20% on 5 August and 6 September. Despite these setbacks, indicators suggest that the bull run that investors have been anticipating for the last quarter of the year may still be on the horizon. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted BTC’s recovery just below the $66,000 mark, stressing that if this level can be maintained in the coming days, further gains could be in store. Historical Patterns Suggest Bitcoin Could Surge Past $70,000 In a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin is once again attempting to break through the critical 200-day moving average (MA), which currently sits between $63,000 and $64,000 on the daily chart. The analyst noted that after four previous rejections at this level this year, Bitcoin’s repeated attempts to break above this level could signal a significant turning point for the upcoming price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ‘Giga Pump’ For XRP Price, Here’s The Target Martinez also highlighted a historical pattern: each of the last three times Bitcoin successfully broke above the 200-day moving average, it led to parabolic bull runs. This suggests that if Bitcoin can consolidate above this key level for the remainder of the month, the likelihood of exceeding the $70,000 mark for the first time in nearly three months increases significantly. Looking ahead, the analyst has set a target of $78,000 for Bitcoin in the near term. Historical Trends And Election Dynamics Fuel Optimism Bloomberg recently highlighted Bitcoin’s price recovery, linking it to improving expectations around the US regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly in the wake of the upcoming presidential election. Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris announced her commitment to establishing a supportive regulatory framework for crypto, coinciding with outreach efforts aimed at Black male voters as election day approaches. In contrast, Harris’ Republican rival Donald Trump has positioned himself as a strong advocate for the digital asset industry, including promises to make changes to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to establish a Bitcoin reserve for the nation, which Bloomberg believes could resonate with voters in a close race. Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, noted that recent market movements appear to be election-driven. Initially, Bitcoin’s uptick was influenced by Trump’s lead in prediction markets and polls. This was followed by favorable comments regarding crypto from the Harris campaign, suggesting a less restrictive approach compared to the current Biden administration. Although specifics of Harris’s crypto policy remain unclear, the sentiment indicates a potential shift toward a more positive regulatory environment. Related Reading: Why Isn’t XRP Price Moving? Crypto Pundit Claims The Answer In addition, October has historically been a strong month for BTC, with the cryptocurrency gaining an average of 20% during this time over the past decade. Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, pointed out that historical trends suggest that this seasonal strength is typically more pronounced in the second half of the month, suggesting that BTC’s price could see further gains as the month progresses. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,970, up more than 5% in the 24-hour time frame.

34719306,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647914,1728963054,Bitcoin Reclaims $66k But Retail Investors Lag—Is A Final FOMO Wave Coming?,"Bitcoin has recently begun to see a major recovery in its price, reclaiming the $66,000 mark earlier today. This sudden positivity in price performance has prompted debates on whether retail investors and newcomers have returned to the market. Although there has so far been speculation about increased retail participation, a detailed analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility Ahead Of Chinese Stimulus Speculations, Options Expiry A Closer Look At Retail Participation According to a CryptoQuant analyst, BinhDang, in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the trends among smaller retail groups show growth and stagnation in different areas, reflecting a complicated dynamic in the current market cycle. In the post titled “1 Year Change – From Plankton to Fish Addresses,” BinhDang broke down Bitcoin wallet activity into several categories of retail investors, including plankton (addresses holding more than 0 but less than or equal to 0.1 BTC), shrimp (holding more than 0.1 but less than 1 BTC), and fish (holding between 10 and 100 BTC). These smaller groups were analyzed because they better represent retail investors than larger wallet categories like whales or humpbacks, which tend to be dominated by institutional players or exchanges. One of the key observations made by BinhDang is that the growth in retail addresses is uneven, particularly among the smallest investors. The plankton addresses, representing individuals holding tiny amounts of Bitcoin, have shown almost negligible growth from 2023 to the present day. This starkly contrasts previous cycles, where significant price increases were accompanied by a sharp rise in the number of retail investors holding small amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst explained that this slower growth could reflect broader economic conditions, including the global decline in monetary flows over the past few years, which may have discouraged new entrants from investing in Bitcoin. Potential For Future FOMO In Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle The uneven growth in retail addresses points to a cautious return of retail investors to the Bitcoin market. However, there are still positive signs that the current cycle has room to expand. BinhDang highlighted the trend of retail investors, particularly those in the “fish” category (holding between 10 and 100 BTC), who have continued accumulating Bitcoin, suggesting that while smaller investors may be hesitant, more seasoned participants are preparing for the next phase of the bull cycle. The data indicates that while retail participation is not as strong as in previous cycles, there remains the potential for a final wave of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) that could drive Bitcoin to new heights. The analyst particularly wrote in the post: So, the data suggests that future FOMO waves are still possible in this cycle. Based on these observations, I conclude there is still a basis to look forward to a final wave in this cycle.

BTC is now consolidating and might struggle to surpass the $66,400 resistance. Bitcoin is up over 5% and now faces hurdles near the $66,400 zone. The price is trading above $64,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could rally further if there is a close above the $66,400 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Surges Over 5% Bitcoin price formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $62,500 resistance. BTC cleared the $63,500 resistance to move into a positive zone. The price even rallied above the $65,000 and $65,500 resistance levels. Finally, the price stalled near the last key resistance at $66,400. A high was formed at $66,398 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $66,000 level. The price is now approaching the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $62,139 swing low to the $66,398 high.

There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $66,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $66,400 level. A clear move above the $66,400 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $66,850. A close above the $66,850 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $67,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $68,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $66,400 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $65,400 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $64,250 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $62,139 swing low to the $66,398 high. The next support is now near the $63,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $62,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $65,400, followed by $64,250.

Crypto analyst Ali Mаrtinеz weighed in on the coin’s technical landscape, saying Dogecoin’s price could rise to 200% in the upcoming weeks if the current pattern of indicators continues. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? Dogecoin’s Price On The Rise Martinez observed that Dogecoin was able to break out from a multi-year downward trend, noting that this usually led to an upsurge in the meme coin’s price.

After a recent 65% pullback, $DOGE could be gearing up for the next big rally! pic.twitter.com/c93A4Fec7V — Ali (@ali_charts) October 6, 2024 He predicted that Dogecoin could potentially breach the $0.2236 mark, а level not seen since Dеcеmbеr 2021. In late September, the token experienced a breakout, leading to a 25% price surge. However, Dogecoin failed to sustain the price rally, falling off once again to $0.11. Other analysts shared the same forecast saying that if the coin successfully got ahead of the $0.1120 level, it would likely breach the $0.1315 mark easily this month. Howеvеr, analysts urged traders to be cautious with the potential price rally of Dogecoin, noting that а 60% rеtrаcеmеnt usually preceded in previous brеаkouts bеforе it gained momentum for an upwаrd trend. A Key Driver Of Growth An increase in Dogecoin’s active addresses is a primary reason why analysts are banking on a possible huge price rally for the cryptocurrency. Mаrtinеz revealed that аctivе DOGE аddrеssеs recorded its highest level in the last eight months, surging to 133,880. Active #Dogecoin addresses recently surged to 133,880—the highest level in 8 months! pic.twitter.com/DojEsDscXk — Ali (@ali_charts) October 12, 2024 This rise of active addresses indicates that people are regaining their interest in the coin, noting a recent spike of nеw usеrs. It also implies that the additional traders are helping push for the token’s growth. For example, about 110,000 investors flocked to Dogecoin, putting the token ahead of its cryptocurrency rivals Shibа Inu and Pеpе. The growth in trading volume showed that the coin is regaining its appeal to traders seeking for a quick profit.

However, considering the weakness across the board, TON, the native currency, has not been spared the hammering. Although losses might be contained, the coin is down nearly 36% from 2024 highs, finding strong support at around $4.5. TON buyers are confident prices will recover, breaking above $6 in the coming sessions. However, its performance will be shaped by market sentiment and how Bitcoin reacts to local support and resistance lines. TON Sharpe Ratio Rising While there are external factors to consider, one analyst notes that the Toncoin Sharpe Ratio is rising and is now in the “low-risk zone.” Based on the analyst’s assessment, TON offers a favorable risk-reward balance for holders and investors. Related Reading: WIF Bulls Charge Toward $2.89 As Key Resistance Test Looms Analysts use the Sharpe Ratio to gauge the risk-adjusted rate of return. The return is higher when it rises, even after factoring in existing risks. How prices perform depends on, among others, prevailing sentiment and adoption. As of mid-October, 77% of all TON traders expect prices to edge higher, looking at a CoinMarketCap poll. The analyst added that the improvement is noticeably better than last year when the Sharpe Ratio was in a “high-risk” zone. It remains to be seen whether prices will recover in the coming sessions. Toncoin Holders Exceed 90 Million: Will A Bitcoin Rally Spark Demand? Over the past few trading months, TON has grown in prominence, cementing its position in the top 10. The rapid valuation follows the success of some of its protocols, including the tap-to-earn game, Hamster Kombat. At the same time, meme coin interest is taking up shape in Toncoin, looking at trading volume associated with Dogs. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? According to on-chain data, the growth of Toncoin has seen its user base expand. As of early October, there were nearly 90 million TON holders, a 24X rise over the past year. With Toncoin dapps finding adoption, the more users choose to engage, buying TON, pushing prices even higher. If Bitcoin rises, breaking above $66,000 and $70,000 in the coming sessions, the probability of TON rising in tandem will be higher. As mentioned earlier, a decisive breakout above $6 could anchor the next leg up to June 2024 highs.
