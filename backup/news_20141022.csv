42398022,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAUx,1414014630,OKCoin Introduces Bitcoin Futures Trading to Mobile Android App,"OKCoin has officially updated its mobile Android trading app to include futures trading and new candlestick charts.  The new product launch brings features available on OKCoin.com to mobile app users, including 10x leverage on all trades, a profit calculator and bi-weekly, weekly, monthly and quarterly contract types.  In an interview, OKCoin international marketing manager Zane Tackett indicated that the China-based company believes the product will appeal to serious traders who need the ability to manage their positions on-the-go and at all times.  Tackett told CoinDesk:  ""It can be a fearful time when you have a lot of contracts open on margin and you're on the go. Now, it's convenient to monitor, open, and/or close at any time or place.""  Tackett went on to suggest that the company has wanted to have these features on the OKCoin app since August, when it introduced futures trading to its main platform. However, Tackett asserted that OKCoin delayed the implementation to ensure it was delivering a polished app to market, which he feels the company has achieved with its latest update.  OKCoin's Android mobile app now features BTC/USD and LTC/USD trading pairs, updated candlestick charts and a profit calculator while providing access to order and transaction history.  Rise in futures trading  Though Tackett did not disclose specific figures, he suggested that OKCoin's futures platform has seen an increase in usership since its initial launch.  In particular, Tackett indicated that the futures option proved popular during the most recent decline in the price of bitcoin.  ""During the latest price dive and the following return to $380 we saw our futures volume and user count skyrocket,"" he said, adding that he expects the mobile app to encourage further use of its futures platform during times of heavy volatility.  OKCoin's futures trading platform allows traders to enter into contracts to buy or sell bitcoin at a later date and at a specified price. The contract can be used by conservative traders as a hedge against volatility, while more aggressive traders can pursue larger gains through such activities.  Android version only  For now the updated app will be limited to Android traders. Tackett indicated that a new version of the OKCoin app for iOS has been sent to Apple for approval, but that it has not received word as to whether the product will be released.  OKCoin first updated its Android app with a full set of features for live traders in July, and released an iOS version of its app around the same time, becoming one of the first bitcoin apps available on the platform after Apple eased restrictions.

42398004,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAGC,1414006815,Bitcoin 'Ransomware' Freezes Council Offices Across Italy,"Municipal council offices across Italy have had their computer files encrypted by a 'ransomware' virus that is demanding payment in bitcoin.  According to Corriere della Sera, one of the country's top newspapers, dozens of regional office workers are unable to pay bills, issue certificates or access server documents until they pay the digital ransom.  The attackers' fee is currently set at €400 worth of bitcoin, though this amount is said to double after three days.  After launching from a location in St Petersburg, Russia last Wednesday, the virus spread rapidly through the council's computer network through phishing emails. While some machines have been updated with antivirus software to block it successfully, many are still at risk.  How it works  Once the malware gains access to a victim's machine it sends what appears to be an ordinary .pdf file named with a long string of characters to all contacts in their email address book.  On closer examination the file is actually a malicious .exe program. When opened by an unsuspecting co-worker, this program encrypts all .pdf files, photos and Microsoft Office documents on their machine and server, rendering them useless.  After this block is activated, a 'hoax antivirus' invites users to purchase decoding software, providing the step-by-step instructions necessary to complete the procedure.  The hackers behind the attack have even included 'customer support' contact details for those unfamiliar with how to use bitcoin.  ""After we paid they also had the audacity to invite us to contact them in case we have other problems,"" Maria Grazia Mazzolari, a town clerk in Bussoleno, Turin, told the Corriere della Sera.  So far, the stunt appears to be lucrative. Di.Fo.B, an Italian consultancy dealing with cyber crime, says the bitcoin addresses listed by the attackers have received around $100,000 from victims in the last 6 days alone.  In addition, Di.Fo.B expects this figure to rise as public offices still unaware of the virus are targeted.  Ransomware and bitcoin  Although ransomware has been around in various forms since the 1990s, there has been a rise in the number of viruses demanding payment in bitcoin.  In November last year – one month before bitcoin's all-time high – the UK’s National Cyber Crime Unit issued an alert about Cryptolocker, an aggressive breed of ransomware contained in zip files carried by email.  The virus targeted small- to medium-sized businesses, and the crime agency said many millions of email accounts were at risk.  After witnessing an influx of UK buyers wishing to secure enough bitcoin to pay the Cryptolocker ransom, trading site BitBargain made the bold decision to block all new users for fear of being involved in money laundering activity.  Although many Cryptolocker victims reported that their files were not returned after payment, an activity the National Cyber Crime Unit does not endorse, some council workers have reported success after paying the attackers' fee in the latest attack.

42398014,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAQ2,1413999049,Paydici Launches Recurring Bitcoin Billing for Small Merchants,"Merchant billing service provider Paydici has announced a new partnership with BitPay that will enable its small merchant clients to accept bitcoin as payment for recurring bills.  The Oregon-based company offers a comprehensive service for issuing bills on behalf of its US clients and manages payments paid by bank account, credit cards, and now, bitcoin. As a result of the partnership, interested Paydici customers can enable the payment option for clients, who can opt to accept bitcoin for both physical and digital bills.  In an interview, Paydici CEO Eli Alford-Jones described the move as one that would bring bitcoin to small merchants who may not have integrated with a bitcoin processor directly due to the demands of their operations and the variety of payment types they need to manage.  Alford-Jones told CoinDesk:  ""Our target merchants have the need to serve many different kinds of customers and demographics, and our objective at Paydici is to bring a single solution to them that allows them to serve their whole customer base, which includes people who want to pay in bitcoin.""  Alford-Jones described his current client base as comprising mostly of small merchants such as landscapers, plumbers and property managers who work at hands-on businesses that require high-touch billing management.  On a technical level, Paydici has built an API for the front-end of its service to build bitcoin payments into its platform. This, Alford-Jones asserted, means most customers won't notice they're interacting with BitPay and its service.  ""Essentially we've taken their underlying bitcoin processing service and integrated it into our recurring billing system,"" he added.  Access to new community  Alford-Jones went on to say that his company's support of bitcoin will allow it to capitalize on its longstanding interest in the technology, as well as the increasing interest its customers had shown in the technology.  In particular, he noted the passionate nature of bitcoin users as a boon for his clientele, as well as the savings they can now achieve by encouraging more clients to use the payment method. Paydici charges a flat fee for every bill it processes, plus an additional 2.95% fee for online credit and debit card processing.  However, Alford-Jones indicated that his company intends to pass on the inherent savings bitcoin can provide by not adding any fees for accepting the digital currency. Paydici currently charges $2 per bill to clients with less than 2,000 customers. Clients serving more than 10,000 customers, however, are charged just $1.35 per bill.  Customers can also elect to add bitcoin to physical bills, and to customize these statements.  ""Someone could have a bitcoin payment option integrated into the statement design,"" he explained. ""They could call [bitcoin] out with custom content in a different format, and include an actual advertisement that would be distributed with the bill.""  Expanding bitcoin's use cases  BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi, in turn, categorized the partnership as one that would enable new types of merchants to accept bitcoin.  ""We hope to see bitcoin being accepted for memberships, rent, subscriptions and even utilities,"" Gallippi said. ""Paydici will help open the door to spending bitcoin on these types of products and services.”  As for how many merchants will be able to benefit from the option now that the partnership has been announced, Alford-Jones was less clear, adding: ""We don't share our merchant figures now, but we reach around half a million end users.""

42398019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAVw,1413994414,BitFury Invests in GoCoin for Payments Processing Push,"BitFury Capital has announced an undisclosed strategic investment in digital currency merchant processor GoCoin.  The move marks the third investment for BitFury Capital, the venture capital arm of bitcoin mining hardware and services provider BitFury. As part of the deal, BitFury indicated that it will seek to use GoCoin as the default processor for its global vendors.  In an interview, GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard framed the investment as one that would also add new business-to-business (B2B) clients to his company's existing customer base.  Beauregard told CoinDesk:  ""The goal is to bring all of [BitFury's vendors] into the ecosystem and have them accepting payments in bitcoin via our platform. So, everything from the providers of electricity to rack space to hosting services, you name it.""  BitFury Capital managing partner Marat Kichikov stated that the investment also demonstrates that BitFury is committed to building the bitcoin ecosystem – an important part of which, it believes, is payment processing.  Boosting bitcoin's infrastructure  The move marks BitFury Capital's first investment in a payment processor since it began extending capital to the ecosystem this August. To date, BitFury Capital has invested in bitcoin enterprise security firm BitGo and an undisclosed wallet provider.  Representatives from BitFury indicated at the time that both these initial investments were made in bitcoin.  “As the leading bitcoin infrastructure provider and bitcoin transaction processing company, BitFury uses every opportunity to further enable global bitcoin adoption by making as many financial transactions in bitcoin as possible,"" the company said.  At press time, it is not clear if this latest investment was also carried out with bitcoin.  GoCoin gains momentum  The investment is the latest validation of GoCoin as a market leader in the industry's increasingly competitive merchant processing space.  This September, GoCoin was notably added as a processing partner in PayPal's Payments Hub alongside its arguably more visible competitors in the US market, BitPay and Coinbase.  GoCoin's key differentiator is that it allows its merchants to accept altcoins such as litecoin and dogecoin in addition to bitcoin. The option has so far appealed to major merchants such as BTC Trip, CheapAir and Hustler.  However, Beauregard was quick to stress how his system is built from the ground up to enable the addition of more digital currencies as the market requires.  ""We also continue to look beyond just bitcoin to altcoins,"" he said. ""I think that [BitFury and GoCoin] share a vision, that we're all sort of watching out for the next major developments in the digital currency space.""

42398012,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAO4,1413990022,NY Law Panel: Bitcoin Won't Get Banking Without Compliance,"On Tuesday morning, the New York Law School hosted the Bitcoin Law conference, drawing entrepreneurs and enthusiasts from the New York City bitcoin community, as well as many of its own aspiring lawyers.  The event was moderated and largely organized by Houman Shadab, a law professor and director of the school’s Center for Business and Financial Law.  Shadab has researched bitcoin and cryptocurrencies extensively, as well as hedge funds, derivatives, securitization and commercial transactions. Earlier this month he spoke to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission on behalf of the bitcoin community.  Five attorneys took the stage for a panel discussion. They were Blockchain global policy counsel and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman counsel Marco Santori; Jerry Brito, executive director of nonprofit research and advocacy center Coin Center; Brian Koffler, president of Koffler Legal & Consulting Services; American Express VP and senior counsel Emily H Goodman Binick; and CoinComply managing director Brian Stoeckert.  The discussion, titled The New Landscape for Federal and State Regulation of Cryptocurrencies, began by asking 'Is bitcoin money?' However, the panel found, because bitcoin is handled differently by various institutions, it may not matter.  Santori said: “People like to talk about what is holding bitcoin back, and what are some of the biggest challenges today? People usually say things like ‘banking’.”  He pointed out why regulation and compliance are both so critical to how banks approach bitcoin, saying:  “Right now in banks and most financial institutions almost a third of their personnel are dedicated to compliance, and that tells us something: it tells us that these institutions can’t service an industry unless they’re going to service it in a compliant manner.”  Filling a technology gap  One perceived problem with digital currencies is that there is no one actively monitoring transactions.  A July Financial Action Task Force report talking about Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) said “there is no central oversight body, and no anti-money laundering (AML) software currently available to monitor and identify suspicious transaction patterns” related to digital currencies.  “Initially the market first came out with guidance that certain types of digital currency companies needed to be regulated as money services businesses (MSBs),” Stoeckert explained. “The original focus was registering as a MSB, the next focus was on establishing policies and procedures, then the next great focus was know-your-customer (KYC).”  What was left over, he said, was the transaction-monitoring component. There are systems for monitoring transactions, Stoeckert explained, but they’re built against traditional financial services and therefore aren’t as suitable for digital currency services.  He said:  “There’s a gap there that exists, but again that's a technology gap that probably will be filled over a period of time.”  He spoke of an “overriding fear” from the banking and financial services sector that all bitcoin-related transactions through exchanges or processors, regulated or unregulated, are suspicious. Because of this fear, he explained, banks were very reactive in their approach to filing SARs for about 12–18 months – in large part because of their lack of knowledge of the space.  “The culture that’s sort of permeating right now in the law-enforcement environment, as well as in the FinCen environment is that there is a heightened sense of activity and awareness,” he said. “I will say that’s absolutely changing because of the fact that there’s a lot more advocacy on the financial institutions' side to learn and understand digital currency.”  Binick, the American Express senior counsel, added that the technology gap supplements an emerging issue: how larger banking and financial institutions “operationalize compliance with the filing requirement”. Whatever fills the gap should identify which part of a business – any business – looks at the bitcoin transaction and how the transaction should be reported.  Binick said:  “It’s almost impossible to operationalize a reporting structure in a large, already regulated company. Our tax department will see it one way, our AML will see it another way, the lawyers will see it a third way.”  Dedication to compliance  Santori echoed Binick’s sentiments on cross-department conflict, adding that it’s not just internal strife – companies’ compliance obligations differ according to the countries in which they conduct their business.  Calling to mind the many months it took for the US government to adopt the FinCEN guidance on a federal level, he reminded the attendees that “anybody who’s looking to incorporate digital currencies has to have that dialectic before they can start doing anything with digital currencies”.  That includes every bank, financial institution and credit card company – but eventually, Santori said, competing interests will collaborate and progress.  He concluded:  “It’s not as if all these organisations are hostile to bitcoin, they’re trying to make it work […] These are regulated institutions, every dollar is a regulated dollar. So you can’t do something and not do it right if you’re a bank. You can’t move money through your system in a non-compliant way.”  Ripple and the banks  Unusually for a digital currency company, Ripple Labs has managed to form relationships with some banks.  Binick said that from a public relations perspective, Ripple has done well by stating publicly that it wants to remove some layers of payment transactions without replacing or eliminating the regulation.  “They’re a slow, steady, long-term play,” Stoeckert said. “It’s not […] moving as quickly as a lot of the digital currencies and bitcoin are, trying to make this little upheaval of the traditional system, and [Ripple’s] going to just slowly move through the system.”  But from the banks’ side, some may be looking at digital currencies as a market play. Binick said it has been helpful for Ripple that it is not a consumer-facing business.  Stoeckert added:  “Financial institutions want to make money, so they’re looking at this from the perspective of: can they be a market leader in attracting these types of customers? Because at some point, someone’s going to do it. Someone’s going to take market share and the other financial institutions are going to eventually sort of play catch-up.”  Is there a lawyer in the house?  Stoeckert and Binick agreed that regulatory compliance is a major, fast-growing marketplace right now and something all lawyers should be looking into.  As demand increases for in-house lawyers with advanced knowledge of how to operationalize compliance with emerging payments and technologies, including bitcoin, it has become the fastest-growing area in every financial institution, they said.  “Compliance departments – they’re booming inside regulated financial institutions,” Stoeckert said. “It’s a perfect domain. The exit strategy is a lot harder to get in there because there’s a lack of expertise and […] background to maybe plop yourself into that domain.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/22/ny-law-panel-bitcoin-wont-get-banking-without-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cced5957bd12126449c079fe6f1db48287ff291a-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAL7,1413979986,ASIC Design Firm Alchip to Debut on Taiwan Stock Exchange,"Chip designer Alchip Technologies is to debut on the Taiwan Stock Exchange next Tuesday, 28th October.  The Taiwan-based firm, which is known for its bitcoin-mining ASICs, is already a public company and is currently listed on the Taiwan Emergent Market under the stock ticker number 3661.  Although the public offering will bring additional reporting requirements, the move will open the company up to institutional and private investors and also bring a boost to its profile within the industry.  At a time when many bitcoin hardware manufacturers are struggling and facing numerous challenges, Alchip is doing rather well.  The firm's market cap has doubled over the past 12 months and it is currently valued at about $175m. Alchip reported revenue of $113m in the first three quarters of 2014.  Designing silicon for miner makers  Alchip specialises in integrated circuit design, more specifically the company is best known for its CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) and graphics ASICs used in older games consoles such as the PlayStation 2.  Over the past decade, Alchip has received investments from several tech heavyweights, including Acer and Cisco. Notably, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the biggest contract chipmaker in the world, owns a 20% stake in the firm.  In the world of bitcoin hardware, Alchip's rise to prominence is linked to KnCMiner and Avalon. Alchip helped design bitcoin mining ASICs for both firms, using 28nm and 20nm manufacturing processes.  Earlier this year, KnC announced the Neptune, the world's first 20nm bitcoin ASIC. Alchip and Advanced Semiconductors Technology (AST) helped develop and produce the Neptune, along with the 28nm KnC Jupiter miner.  Alchip does not have any chip foundries of its own, relying instead on TSMC and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation foundries for manufacturing.  Secrecy is the norm  Although Alchip is a public company, details on the company's involvement in the ASIC space are hard to come by. Over the past two years, Alchip has issued a number of press releases covering the company's relationship with KnC, but at the same time bitcoin ASICs are not mentioned on the official website or in company brochures.  Bitcoin mining hardware companies tend to be very secretive, but the same is true of all chip companies, as they go to great lengths to keep unannounced products away from prying eyes.  Bitcoin ASICs are just part of the story for Alchip, as the firm is also working on ASICs for cloud computing, ARM SoC designs for Internet of Things applications, wearables, handheld gaming devices and more.

42398013,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAP3,1413972235,Brazil's Tecnisa Becomes the Biggest Bitcoin Merchant in Latin America,"Brazil-based real estate developer Tecnisa has announced it is now accepting bitcoin, making the company Latin America's largest cryptocurrency-accepting merchant by annual revenue.  Figures from the CoinDesk State of Bitcoin Q3 suggest that its revenue figures put Tecnisa among the top 10 largest bitcoin-accepting merchants globally. The publicly traded company boasted net operating revenue of 1.8bn reals in 2013 (approximately $728m).  Founded in 1977, Tecnisa has long been at the forefront of integrating new technologies into its platform, becoming one of the country's first merchants to sell real estate online in 2000 and via Twitter in 2008. Tecnisa even sold apartments via the online virtual world Second Life in 2007.  In an interview, Tecnisa marketing and media manager Gustavo Reis, expressed hope that his company would encourage more widespread bitcoin adoption in a local market still seeking to overcome challenges.  Reis told CoinDesk:  ""We believe that a R$1.8bn, open-capital company like Tecnisa, will push the adoption in all sides the counter: customers will have more options to use and merchants will have more volume of transactions to explore.""  Notably, the move represents a partnership between Tecnisa and local Brazilian bitcoin processor BitInvest, which launched its merchant processing services this summer. With the move, Tecnisa joins Argentinian e-commerce companies Avalancha and OmbuShop as the latest to add bitcoin as a payment option.  Headquartered in Sao Paulo, Tecnisa develops residential and commercial properties, handling all aspects of the process from construction to end delivery to customers.  Embracing new technology  Reis was also keen to note how Tecnisa's use of new technologies has helped it to historically grow its business. Today, he noted, more than 40% of Tecnisa's total revenue is completed through its online portal, but this wouldn't likely have been possible without its early embrace of the Internet.  ""In this context, it’s natural to keep updated about new technologies, trends and forms to enhance the user's experience,"" Reis said. ""Bitcoin fits perfectly in this scenario, because it’s new, it’s growing fast and [has] potential to be a gamechanger in the payment system.""  Tecnisa, he added, has been following developments in the bitcoin ecosystem since 2013, but finally left comfortable with the service provided by BitInvest.  ""BitInvest was the first player that combined a huge knowledge about local business with a consistent platform,"" he said.  Reis went on to cite CEO Flavio Pripas' established history as an entrepreneur, noting he was the founder of fashion-centric social network Fashion.me.  Promise of savings and returns  As with the Internet, Reis believes being early with bitcoin acceptance will position Tecnisa as the leader in the next big technology that could potentially transform commerce.  Still, he acknowledged that the option may now only appeal to early adopters of the technology.  ""We believe that the adoption will be low today, but that bitcoin promises real return,"" he said. ""It’s important to us to be the first mover, putting the brand in line with new trends and bringing the opportunity to bitcoin buyers to find their new homes.""  To incentivize new users to both bitcoin and BitInvest's platform, Tecnisa is offering a promotion that will give bitcoin buyers back 5% over the value they pay in bitcoins on purchases.  BitInvest's big move  While the move is a boon for Brazil's local ecosystem, it also casts BitInvest as an early market leader. BitInvest now provides bitcoin exchanges services and merchant processing in Brazil, and hopes to add a remittance feature soon.  Pripas explained that BitInvest's solution provides a local alternative to US-based merchant processing providers. Like BitPay, BitInvest allows local merchants to either convert bitcoins to Brazilian reals or keep bitcoin directly, however, he said BitInvest has localized its solution.  ""The advantage of what we are doing here is as we know the local market, we are following the local legislation and we are providing for our customers a very strong legal framework to support our businesses,"" Pripas explained.  Pripas indicated that BitInvest intends to focus more on business-to-business partnerships as it grows its solution. In particular, he said it is in talks with local online payment processing providers in the hopes of striking a relationship similar to PayPal's recent deal with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin in the US.  ""It would give us much bigger distribution than going merchant by merchant,"" he added.  Statements by Reis and Pripas have been edited for clarity.

42398011,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAM6,1413942907,New Bitcoin Exchange Says Australia is Ideal Location,"A new bitcoin exchange launched yesterday in Sydney, Australia, with an aim to improving general consumer confidence in the digital currency market.  Called Independent Reserve, the exchange is promoting both itself and its Australian base as secure and well-regulated, saying the country's AAA credit rating and political stability made it the ideal place to locate.  It will aim first at the local and New Zealand markets before expanding overseas to the financial centers of Asia, though says it already has the ability to electronically verify customers in minutes from over 20 countries by working with identity specialists Global Data Company.  Adrian Przelozny, Independent Reserve's co-founder and chief technology officer, told CoinDesk the company has been in regular contact with local financial regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and would adhere to all KYC and AML compliance protocols.  He said:  ""We're very comfortable that we have the right settings here to ensure its safety and success.""  Australian tax issues  A recent ruling by the Australian Tax Office on digital currency use was met with concern from the local bitcoin community, who said the definition of those currencies as akin to barter transactions and not 'money' or 'financial supply' would lead to the 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST, or sales tax) being applied twice – once when purchasing bitcoins and again when using them to purchase other goods.  If passed on to consumers, it would also make bitcoins purchased in Australia 10% more expensive, most likely driving users to overseas exchanges and local companies out of business.  Independent Reserve, Przelozny said, would absorb the GST with its own profits and through the 0.5% brokerage fee it charges Australian customers, keeping its prices competitive.  ""We strongly believe that Australians should not be penalised for the use of bitcoin [...] This would stifle bitcoin innovation in Australia and ultimately force companies to move operations offshore which would have a negative impact on the Australian economy as a whole.""  Financial experience  Independent Reserve is backed by a group of private investors and its executive team has years of experience in the finance and IT industries. CEO Adam Tepper has worked as a software Engineer and Solutions Architect at major Australian companies like ANZ bank, AMP insurance, and the Nine Entertainment Company.  Przelozny worked with Tepper at those three companies and both men were also co-founders and managing directors of Asia Australia Technology, a software engineering firm.  Independent Reserve, Przelozny added, has spent ""thousands of hours on R&D to make sure our platform is completely robust and our proprietary technology includes many levels of safeguards to ensure users are well protected.""  Tepper told the Sydney Morning Herald that the exchange is doing everything it possibly can to mitigate risks and ensure people feel secure about keeping money there. He mentioned that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers would be auditing all Independent Reserve's finances.  Bitcoin in Australia  Australia's international reputation as a stable business and legal environment, and financial services center, could serve digital currency companies well when attracting overseas customers.  It recently called a Senate Inquiry into bitcoin and digital currency use, which has increased confidence in the country's ability to take a sensible approach toward regulation.  While the market in Australia is relatively small compared to North America and Europe, bitcoin brokerages such as CoinJar, Bit Trade Australia and igot have performed well in the local market and payment processors such as BitPOS (as well as CoinJar) are working hard to build a local digital currency-using economy.
