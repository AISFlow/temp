42379206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nXtn,1486143926,Two Hawaiian Politicians Want to Explore Blockchain Tech for Tourism,"Legislators in Hawaii are pushing for the creation of a working group dedicated to blockchain technology.  If passed, House Bill 1481, first filed on 25th January, would lead to the creation of a group dedicated to researching ""the uses of and best practices regarding blockchain technology"". The bill is sponsored by Democratic Reps Chris Lee and Mark Nakashima.  The bill's authors wrote:  ""The legislature finds that highly innovative technologies such as blockchain require an educated and measured approach so that regulations do not stymie innovation and growth in this State.""  The long-term goal, the bill states, is to seek ways for the technology ""to benefit local industries, residents and the State of Hawaii"".  Should the measure be approved, the working group would be tasked with preparing a report that explores potential use cases specific to Hawaii, while also providing information on how the state itself could leverage the tech. Among the areas of interest: tourism payments.  The bill's backers suggest that the state should look to the tech as a means for encouraging visitors from abroad to spend – thereby boosting the local economy.  ""Digital currencies such as bitcoin have broad benefits for Hawaii. A large portion of Hawaii's tourism market comes from Asia where the use of bitcoin as a virtual currency is expanding,"" the bill reads. ""Hawaii has the unique opportunity to explore the use of blockchain technology to make it easier for visitors to consume local goods and services and to drive the tourism economy.""  The bill is the latest legislative effort to emerge on the subject of blockchain tech.  Last year, for example, Vermont lawmakers proposed amending the state’s laws to allow for blockchain data to become admissible in court. Legislative records also show that the Vermont Senate has introduced a new bill that would tweak the state’s financial regulations to account for businesses that work with digital currencies.

42379220,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nYBP,1486138935,"OKCoin Publishes, Then Withdraws Bitcoin Exchange Fee Update","One of China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges issued an update on its fee policies today, only to later remove the statement from its website.  In a post on its China-based website, OKCoin indicated that it would alter its policies to a maker-taker model, one that would offer zero-fee trading to those who provide liquidity to the exchange. A 0.2% fee would still be charged on all other trades.  Notably, the notice no longer appears on OKCoin's website.  If enacted, the move would be the first since 23rd January that finds a major China-based exchange breaking from an informal commitment to charge 0.2% fees on both sides of bitcoin-denominated trades, spurred by scrutiny from the People’s Bank of China.  As previously reported, volume has moved since those developments, largely to other no-fee exchanges based in China.  BTCC CEO Bobby Lee said at the time that the commitment to a standard trading fee policy was meant to keep China's exchange ecosystem ""one step ahead"" of requests by the central bank.  The post is notable, however, even if the fee changes are not enacted, as it suggests that the decline in volumes at major China-based markets may be putting pressure on the exchanges to win back lost activity.  OKCoin did not respond to requests for further comment at press time.

42379217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nYA9,1486135242,Ethereum Payment Channels Could Enter Production in 2017,"A project aiming to scale ethereum via off-blockchain payment channels could enter production this year.  Speaking at Construct 2017, CoinDesk's developer conference this week, Ameen Soleimani, a software engineer at ethereum startup ConsenSys, gave a presentation on Raiden's current status in which he described this as a 2017 goal.  The Raiden network  , an open-source developer effort being spearheaded by developer Heiko Hees, was first discussed as a way to bring micropayments to the platform in 2015.  Soleimani said work on the protocol implementation is ""largely finished"", adding that a minimum viable product is likely to be completed as soon as the end of the first quarter.  The news comes amid broader work on payment channels within the blockchain space, particularly in relation to bitcoin.  Raiden bears similarities to the Lightning Network, a payments channel concept for bitcoin that a number of developers are working on. (San Francisco-based startup Lightning Labs published its first implementation release of the concept earlier this month).  As previously reported by CoinDesk, proponents of the Raiden initiative see it as a way to encourage machine-to-machine payments, using the ethereum blockchain as a settlement layer.

42399580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqF2,1486129249,Litecoin Moves to Adopt Bitcoin's SegWit Scaling Upgrade,"A code update best known for its polarizing role in bitcoin's scaling debate has just made its debut on another blockchain.  As of this morning, miners securing the alternative blockchain litecoin can now begin signaling support for Segregated Witness. Known popularly as SegWit, the upgrade changes the way that data is stored within a digital currency transaction, allowing more transactions to take up less space on the network while adding other optimizations.  The introduction sets up an interesting dynamic as some bitcoin developers now believe the upgrade is perhaps more likely be implemented on litecoin, as voluntary adoption of the change by bitcoin's miners has largely stalled.  After rising quickly to 25% in November, miners are now showing signs their support may be shifting to a user-configured block size by way of Bitcoin Unlimited.  The protracted path to bitcoin scaling hasn’t stopped other digital currencies from adopting the SegWit approach, however. Back in December, word emerged that litecoin would move to adopt SegWit, a direction that creator Charlie Lee later elaborated on in a post on Medium.  At time of writing, just over 11% of the network's miners have voiced their support, while other data sources point to support hovering at over 15%. At least one major litecoin miner, F2Pool, has reportedly indicated that it will support the measure in the near future.  If the network reaches the predetermined threshold of 75% of miners, SegWit will become the law of the land. Bitcoin has notably set its threshold for SegWit higher, requiring 95% adoption for two weeks.  To some observers, the plan could essentially offer a real-world test subject for SegWit, meaning proponents in the bitcoin world will surely be watching.

42399573,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq98,1486127201,Major UK Telecom Seeks Blockchain Security Patent,"One of the UK's largest telecoms is seeking a patent for a security system aimed at preventing malicious attacks on blockchains.  British Telecommunications (BT) PLC submitted a patent application last July for “Mitigating Blockchain Attacks” to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The application, released on 2nd February, details both a system and methods for monitoring transactions on a particular blockchain in a bid to “detect malicious attacks”, the application’s authors write.  The filing is notable given its source, as BT is the largest Internet service provider in the UK, according to recent marketshare data. The patent also represents BT’s first known involvement with the tech.  Threats to security  While the application doesn’t detail which blockchain is addressed by the patent – whether bitcoin, ethereum or some kind of private ledger – it does directly reference mining, or the energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the chain.  The proposed system, according to BT, could be used to create a “a transaction creation profile”, suggesting that it would be applied to a permissioned network in which only certain participants are allowed to submit transactions.  As the application notes:  “Despite the architecture of blockchain systems, malicious attacks present a threat to the security and reliability of blockchains.”  Other threats identified in the application include 51% attacks, through which an entity controlling a majority of hashing power has the theoretical power to start reordering transactions.  ""Other attacks also pose a threat to the blockchain and its users, including: the Sybil attack in which an entity attempts to fill a miner network with clients controlled centrally or pseudonymous miners; and various denial of service attacks such as sending excessive data to a miner to overwhelm the miner such that it cannot process normal blockchaintransactions,"" the application goes on to state.  BT isn't the first telecom to attempt to patent a blockchain-related technology. Last year, AT&T filed an application with the USPTO for a kind of home subscriber server that utilizes a blockchain.

42399578,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqE3,1486123208,Polish Regulator Recognizes Bitcoin Businesses,"Bitcoin regulation in Poland has taken a step forward with the news that the country’s Central Statistical Office (GUS) has recognized the trading and mining of virtual currencies as an official economic activity.  As a result, companies active in the industry will now be able to register with the agency.  Firms involved in virtual currency trade and production can apply to obtain an official PKD 64.19.Z registration when filing their entities with the official court register, the GUS said in a statement.  The development marks a significant advance for industry players in Poland where, to date, the state has not issued any specific legislation that regulates bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  That said, the Polish Ministry of Finance has previously released a number of documents that address bitcoin’s legal status.  In a statement from 2nd November, the ministry said that ""there is a lack of a general, legal definition of virtual currency … in international, European and national law"". It concluded that, while virtual currencies are not subject to any separate regulation under Polish legislation, it is subject to income tax.  The ministry also stated:  ""It should also be stressed here that their use in Poland is fully legal.""  Further exploration  To further explore the legal and financial implications of the use of virtual currencies in Poland, the country's government has established an expert group on blockchain and virtual currencies.  The task force was set up under the auspices of the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs, and it is part of the government’s ""From Paper To Digital Poland"" program that was launched by the Cabinet in June 2016.  The group is responsible for preparing analyses for use by other government entities in their legislative work, and the potential regulation of virtual currencies is one of its fields of interest.

42399570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjq6B,1486119600,Why the Netflix Model is the Future for Enterprise Blockchain,"Matthew Spoke is CEO and founder of enterprise blockchain startup Nuco, and a former team lead for Deloitte's Rubix platform.  In this opinion piece, Spoke looks at the hurdles encountered by enterprises adopting blockchain tech, and predicts more flexible and compatible solutions going forward.  What's a blockchain? Why not use a distributed database? What's a smart contract? What the hell is chaincode?  Among blockchain industry participants, you'll get different answers and different views to all of these questions (and many more).  Almost weekly, we read new blockchain white papers proposing new unique functionalities to solve a problem in a slightly better or different way. Of course, this amount of experimentation and research can only be good for the long-term growth and maturity of our industry, but it’s also made it extremely complicated for potential buyers to make determinations about what fits their needs best.  Although the term ""blockchain"" has generally been used as the umbrella name for a very broad collection of new technologies, it seems to me that our industry has not yet gone through the necessary objective scrutiny to separate the good, from the bad (and the ugly).  Right or wrong, there seem to be some common themes among enterprise companies that became apparent over the course of 2016.  This is not a comprehensive list, but a few worth highlighting:  Companies are looking to build using permissioned blockchain networks (whether as an interim solution or a long-term outcome)  In many contexts, it will be important to maintain transaction privacy  Current transaction performance on the public bitcoin and ethereum networks is insufficient  Smart contracts provide an elegant framework to automate shared business processes.  Ethereum examined  In considering these challenges and how to solve them, a large number of companies have migrated their efforts to ethereum.  It's by no means a perfect solution, but arguably because of its flexibility and because of the organic community of developers surrounding it, it remains unparalleled in the industry.  Rather than look at ethereum as one network, however, many consider it as a template to model, improve, customize and implement in difference contexts.  Ethereum technology, therefore, has found its way into multiple networks serving multiple purposes, although imperfectly.  To better achieve this outcome, I would argue that ethereum needs some rearchitecting to allow for multiple network implementations.  In its current form, it was designed (and continues to be improved upon) as a protocol to power a single global network.  Incompatibility  Having come to the same realization, a number of companies have created versions of ethereum that fit their needs – in many cases with band-aid fixes that can only be described as temporary and imperfect.  Among those companies, there are both startups and large organizations, most of which are primarily interested in one vertical problem set that impacts their industry and their business.  This has led to unnecessary fragmentation and incompatible modifications being made to the ethereum protocol in all these various versions. Contrary to the initial vision of ethereum (of being a general purpose protocol), many of these implementations are being built as single-purpose solutions to power specific industry applications.  As companies get closer to production, this problem is becoming more evident to those involved.  Drawing parallels from the web services ('cloud') industry, I’m convinced that we’ll see a new trend this year.  Rather than end users building their own customized infrastructure, and essentially managing their ""full stack"", a small number of providers will focus on offering modular infrastructure that can be leveraged with little effort by the companies solving challenges at the application layer.  Action ahead  This reorganization of the industry (infrastructure vs app) will allow for specialization and better long-term improvements to the underlying software, while maintaining standards of compatibility.  In the same way that Netflix is built using Amazon Web Services, mature companies emerging in this space will partner with infrastructure providers to scale their businesses more efficiently.  Ideally, as we work towards this model, the resulting infrastructure frameworks will allow for deployments that are fully compatible with 'public ethereum', while also enabling deployments that include custom functionalities required by the user.  One of the great benefits I foresee from this model is that new proposed ideas, which today end up as competing protocols, could become alternative modules compatible with a standardized framework. This will make it easier for companies to adopt improvements without having to rebuild from scratch.  Luckily, this isn't wishful thinking. Some of us are already on our way to making this real.

42399585,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjqIy,1486081235,"Bitcoin's Price Inches Above $1,000, But Will It Last?","Bitcoin prices breached $1,000 for the first time in nearly one month today.  The price saw initial fluctuations around that level before climbing higher, hitting a high of over $1,009 before settling around $1,007 at press time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Yet to analysts, the development raises the question of whether markets will see continued action above the $1,000 mark, and some say the digital currency may need to work its way through significant resistance before it is able to find support at that level.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk:  ""The $1,000 level is a huge level to breach sustainably.""  The desire among traders to book profits could also be a major factor in the trading sessions ahead. Some may feel motivation to sell at price points between $1,000 and $1,200, leading the digital currency to face an uphill fight at these levels, Zivkovski posited.  Market gyrations  The digital currency first broke through $1,000 today at 16:30 UTC, just barely surpassing this level when it reached a high of $1,000.31.  However, bitcoin prices quickly changed direction, falling below $1,000 to reach a low of $999.01 at 17:45 UTC, additional BPI figures show. The cryptocurrency proceeded to fluctuate around the $1,000 level, rising to $1,000.85 by 18:00 UTC and then falling to a low of $999.84 at 18:15 UTC.  But while $1,000-level may be enough to generate significant visibility in the Western world, the ¥7,000 level is just as critical, according to analyst Tim Enneking.  At the time of report, bitcoin had failed to exceed this level during the 2nd February session, having risen to as much as ¥6,976.50 earlier in the day.  Enneking elaborated on the key relationship between the $1,000 and ¥7,000 levels, telling CoinDesk:  ""If it breaks through both and holds, they will turn into very strong support!""  Overcoming negative sentiment  According to some observers, the price could encounter headwinds from negative sentiment that still lingers following the cryptocurrency’s sharp price movements this year – which saw bitcoin rise above $1,150 and then fall close to $200 in an hour.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, attributed this sentiment to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) decision to closely scrutinize the domestic bitcoin exchange ecosystem.  That said, Hayes did offer a positive view of the situation.  ""The market is slowly shedding the fear of drastic action take by the PBoC against Chinese Bitcoin exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk. ""As this fear fades, the price will slowly retrace towards to the all-time high reached in early January.""  Market data, according to sources, bears out that sense of cautious positivity.  Whaleclub sentiment data shows that the market was 89% long torday, representing the third consecutive trading session during which this measure was at least 80%.  In addition, confidence – the extent by which a position size is larger than average – was 82% on 2nd February, after measuring 85% during the prior two sessions.
