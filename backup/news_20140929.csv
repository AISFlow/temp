42397982,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvUD,1412034953,Bankers Debate Bitcoin at Sibos 2014,"The Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, located in the rapidly growing Boston Seaport district, proved a fitting location for Innotribe’s series of digital currency seminars and talks at the Sibos 2014 technology and innovation trade show.  Innotribe’s bitcoin series included talks on regulation, disruption and the future of investment in the space. The crowd, comprised of a mix of digital currency veterans and novices alike, displayed an enthusiasm and critical eye that largely defined the day’s events.  Innotribe  is a startup and innovation project started by financial network operator Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).  Amidst the backdrop of a broader banking trade show and exhibition composed of the banking industry’s biggest players, the Innotribe talks pointed to the next generation of financial technology that, for now, remains just outside the broader financial space.  Opening talk casts wide net  The first seminar offered a broad overview of digital currency development and the issues shaping the industry today, looking at whether the technology represents what panel experts frequently dubbed “the future of money”. The session was co-hosted by Anthemis Group founder Udayan Goyal and banking expert and author Chris Skinner.  Speakers such as Bitcoin Foundation executive chairman Jon Matonis, bitcoin entrepreneur and SecondMarket founder Barry Silbert and Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire weighed in on what’s driving regulation development, consumer adoption and technological advancement in the space.  During the wide-ranging session, the panel – which also included Ripple Labs co-founder and CEO Chris Larsen, colored coins inventor Yoni Assia and SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt – ultimately agreed that almost all areas of technology have the potential to be reshaped by digital currency.  Larsen said during the panel that behind the growing optimism for bitcoin’s use as a globalized currency, many companies are beginning to recognize the benefits that the block chain offers.  When asked where digital currency technology is heading, Assia pointed to projects like his colored coins concept and platforms like Ethereum, Counterparty and ClearingHouse as protocols that can move block chain applications away from currency usage to broader use cases.  “You can use this technology to actually transfer any type of value,"" he added.  Entrepreneurs meet regulators  With regulation no doubt on the mind of most bitcoin business owners and entrepreneurs, Innotribe brought together a diverse mix of leaders and regulators to discuss how, if at all, the technology should be subject to governmental oversight.  Moderated by Promontory Financial Group director Adam Shapiro, the panel touched on regulatory topics such as consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (NYC) standards and the concept of self-regulation as they relate to digital currency.  Matonis  remarked during the opening of the session that a recent publication by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reflected broader problems with the approach that American regulators are taking.  Matonis said:  “It was a little bit disingenuous because it failed to recognize all the other consumer benefits, which you think the CFPB would have an interest in.”  Calling bitcoin a hedge against “monetary aggression”, Matonis added that consumers benefit greatly from using a transaction and value system independent from some of the geopolitical pressures that can harm economies, as demonstrated in recent years by some Latin American currencies.  During the session, the regulatory body was represented by Dirk Haubrich, head of consumer protection and financial innovation for the European Banking Authority, and Anne Shere Wallwork, senior counselor for strategic policy for the US Department Of the Treasury’s Office for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.  Both regulators stressed repeatedly that their respective agencies are interested in providing an avenue for future development, but not at the cost of putting consumers and business at risk.  As Wallwork explained during the session:  “[The US government is] taking a very holistic approach, we see the benefits of the technology, especially as it relates to financial inclusion. But, my office is charged with identifying systemic vulnerabilities both within the US and global financial systems, and so new payment mechanisms, products and services are things that we’re always looking at.”  At the same time, Wallwork said that there could be applications of digital currency technology to her agency’s broader regulatory efforts. She opened the door to potential usage in the future, adding:  “The possibilities are very much on our radar.”  However, Haubrick voiced concern with the possibility that coin developers can anonymously submit or change code. Most financial institutions must follow strict guidelines on when and how financial software can be updated and deployed.  Haubrick queried aloud that there isn’t a clear answer, saying:  “I wonder how this risk ought to be addressed. As a regulator, it’s not a comfortable position to be in to see a payment scheme where the core functionality can be changed.”  Cooperation opportunities  Though the content of the discussion suggested a divide between regulators and digital currency entrepreneurs, the event included a notable show of cooperation between the two groups when Silbert and Wallwork shook hands before the assembled crowd.  Silbert remarked that the rapid evolution of the bitcoin industry has seen a changing of the guard from companies that operated largely in the regulatory shadows to businesses that want to actively engage with regulators.  Silbert told the crowd:  “A lot of [early bitcoin companies] were started by people who had no intention of breaking the law, [but] had no appreciation for any of the rules and regulations for handling money. And a lot of those business went away.”  Silbert added that regulators need to be mindful of the fact that bitcoin’s technological infancy and distributed nature makes it particularly susceptible to stifling rule-making, particularly across national jurisdictions.  The last segment of the panel looked at the issue of self-regulation. Stan Stalnaker, founding board member and treasurer for the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA), discussed how the industry can work harder to interface with governments worldwide to find agreeable solutions.  Stalnaker explained:  “It’s more than just setting standards. It’s about having conversations with regulators and world leaders to find that common ground.”  Industry leaders detail distruption  One of the major focuses at this year’s Sibos gathering in Boston was the role of disruption in financial technology. As one can imagine, this buzzword was on the lips of nearly every panelist, including the session led by a group of bitcoin industry CEOs.  Circle CEO Allaire led a demonstration of his company’s bitcoin banking platform, which formally launched today. He walked through basic functionality, including actually sending transactions, showing the process for attendees.  Explaining that Circle is “taking something that took days or weeks to do and simplified it down to minutes”, Allaire remarked that instant access to deposits through trusted intermediaries will eventually become the norm in the bitcoin space. He also showed off the company’s upcoming mobile apps, which will be available for both iOS and Android phones.  BitX  CEO Marcus Swanepoel previewed his company’s emerging markets-focused bitcoin exchange, telling attendees that “the emerging market is an entirely different system.”  He explained that BitX sees the potential opportunity in working with merchants in markets that do not have much bitcoin saturation.  Swanepoel said that this outlook is buoyed by the fact that banks in these environments are more receptive to block chain integration than institutions in developed economies, saying:  “Some of the big banks are slightly more cautious but are looking at more advanced applications of the block chain protocol. Some smaller banks see it as a way to get a leg-up on larger players in the space.”  Swanepoel also shared details of BitX’s secretive Falcon project, which is a new protocol for fiat-to-fiat transactions that uses the bitcoin block chain as a clearing mechanism. He said that the company has tested the durability of the system with promising results, but argued that conditions in emerging markets aren’t quite ready for broader bitcoin saturation.  Scott Millar  , founder and CEO of digital currency exchange CRYEX, said that the ecosystem in which people buy, sell and trade bitcoins was forever altered by the collapse of the now-defunct Mt Gox bitcoin exchange.  Millar said of aftermath:  “What happened to the ecosystem is that developed into many small marketplaces with small pools of liquidity. It made them reliant on buyers in those ecosystems, making it very expensive and difficult to get out of the ecosystem.”  The goal of CRYEX, he said, is “to pool as much liquidity into one exchange as possible so you can provide order depth” and improve overall confidence in the system.  Ripple Labs’ Larsen also gave a presentation, detailing how his company hopes to disrupt existing models for transaction clearance by bringing real-time settlement to the industry. US banks have already begun using the Ripple protocol, citing its cost-reduction and efficiency-boosting benefits.  He was preceded by Yoni Assia, who detailed the colored coins concept and its potential to push smart contracting into the mainstream.  Can digital currency disrupt – or help – the banks?  Moderated by Dan Marovitz, CEO of Faculty of 1000 Ltd and former Deutsche Bank managing director for global transaction banking, the last session of the day looked at a “post-bitcoin” space in which next-generation protocols and services facilitate new kinds of transactions.  The session, entitled “Disruption, Big Banks & VCs”, featured Richard Ni, Dan Elitzer and Jeremy Rubin, the leadership team behind the MIT Bitcoin Project, and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, as well as a group of developers that included some of those involved with the MIT Bitcoin Project’s recently summer-ling app contest, MIT BitComp.  Rubin told the crowd that, fundamentally, the purpose of the initiative is to give bitcoin a place in which use cases can be created based on demand, stating:  “It’s not about giving bitcoin to every MIT undergrad. It’s about seeing what kind of community develops in a real-life environment.”  Ethereum’s Buterin suggested that from the perspective of banking, next-generation block chains can help connect the underbanked or unbanked to financial pipelines worldwide. Buterin discussed the use of block chain technology as part of a broader network of physical assets.  Further, Buterin provided a walkthrough of the code for a sample smart contract on Ethereum, adding that new intiatives are in the works that will make the protocol even faster – a key factor in whether banks ultimately embrace the block chain as a data mechanism.  Buterin explained:  “We’re also working on a protocol called Whisper in which you can send messages off the block chain.”  Questions and answers  Following the presentations, a panel of banking and venture capital experts answered questions and comments from the assembled crowd. Standard Chartered Bank managing director Gautam Jain and Citi managing director Ebru Pakcan were among those who shared enthusiasm from within their own industry toward bitcoin, but stopped short of endorsing it.  As Jain expalined:  “The whole block chain is extremely interesting. Everyone, traditionally, has struggled with the concept of information exchange in a centralized way. What is being demonstrated here is quite eye-opening and something to watch out for.”  While noting that “there are lots of Vitaliks out there looking for ways to put people of the job”, Silbert said that banks and bitcoin fit well together and can actually significantly reduce the infrastructure costs incurred by banks.  Mircea Mihaescu, managing director for Sberbank Digital Ventures and SBT Venture Capital, told attendees that the level of investment in bitcoin companies needs to rise significantly before banks begin to even consider getting involved.  “We have 40, 50 bit coin startups with funding – we need 500, 2000,” he said. “Then, we will begin to see real change.”  Citi’s Pakcan said that the bitcoin industry needs to understand as a whole that it’s too easy to assume that digital currency can reshape banking for the better. She argued that, to the contrary, many of those who point to specific problems don’t understand the full picutre, saying:  “When someone doesn’t know the complexities here, it’s very easy to say that the solution is in a new technology.”  Mark Buitenhek  , global head of transaction services for Dutch banking group ING, said that there is no timeline among banks for when, if ever, an integration may occur. However, he acknowledged that the industry as a whole isn’t ignoring digital currency.  “We’re certainly interested. We’re not in wait-and-see, but maybe a wait-and-act mode,” he offered.

42397973,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvLM,1412033132,Early Bitcoin Adopter Calls for Multi-Sig Solutions After 750 BTC Theft,"An early bitcoin adopter has made a plea for bitcoin consumers to migrate to more secure bitcoin storage systems after having 750 BTC (about $280,000 at press time) stolen from him while on vacation.  Bitcoin entrepreneur Leo Treasure told CoinDesk his misfortune should serve as a cautionary tale for everyone. Whether they store bitcoins online, on hard drives or in cold storage, he implored users to switch to more secure multi-signature ('multi-sig') wallets as soon as possible.  Though he holds little hope of ever recovering his bitcoins and isn't expecting the authorities to help, he is following the lead of others who have suffered bitcoin-related crimes and promising 50% of the stolen amount as a reward to anyone who can help recover it.  Mysterious transaction  Treasure, a former computer science student and bitcoin entrepreneur from Perth, Australia, told CoinDesk he was traveling in Bali and didn't think connecting to public Wi-Fi could be a security issue as his bitcoins were stored locally.  Upon reading about the 'Bash Bug', he checked one of his bitcoin addresses on the block chain and noticed an unfamiliar transaction.  Once he synchronized the Bitcoin-Qt client on his MacBook, the 'sent' records confirmed the worst. A series of transactions leading to unfamiliar addresses had occurred from his wallet.  It was no small hack – the amount stolen represented the majority of Treasure's bitcoin holdings, leaving him with only small amounts stored elsewhere.  Treasure admitted that keeping such a large stash on his hard drive wasn't a good idea, but confessed to having the ""could never happen to me"" feeling of false comfort that precedes many a disaster, saying:  ""I feel like an idiot being so blasé about computer security and thinking I'd be alright [...] I'd just given a talk at the Perth bitcoin meetup saying how I was going to move all my coins over to multi-sig, but I didn't act quick enough.""  The year of multi-sig  Treasure pointed to an article on Medium.com, which quoted Gavin Andresen's comments in his State of Bitcoin Address in Amsterdam last May.  In the article, CEO and co-founder of multi-sig wallet provider BitGo Will O'Brien wrote that despite Andresen's call over 99% of all bitcoins are still stored in single-signature addresses. Multi-sig addresses, he wrote are ""the only viable solution for securing bitcoins"".  Multi-sig bitcoin addresses are the result of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 16, which was created in 2012 and implements something called 'pay to script hash' (P2SH) technology.  Bitcoin addresses generated using P2SH begin with a '3' instead of the usual '1', and require multiple keys for their balances to be spent.  The standard model is to require two out of three keys to spend from a balance – of those keys, one goes to the user, one to the service (exchange or wallet) provider and another to a trusted third party. A user may choose to keep the third key in a safe place instead.  Therefore, the owner of the coins may access the balance even if the service provider is shut down or goes out of business (or is run by a malicious operator) and, just as importantly, a single device stolen or compromised by a hacker is not enough to steal the coins.  Options available  BitGo published a white paper on the topic of P2SH in 2013 and open-sourced its own code to build trust.  Developer Ben Smith, who created multi-sig bitcoin wallet and social payment system Ninki, agreed this technology would solve a lot of problems. He said:  ""Multi-signature wallets combined with strong passwords and two-factor authentication massively reduce the attack surface, making these simple exploits a thing of the past.""  Unfortunately, security is often something people don't consider until after suffering an attack, and popular services are moving slowly to implement multi-sig.  Besides, BitGo, Treasure cited FrozenBit (still in invite-only beta) and GreenAddress as examples of multi-sig wallet solutions. Another service, QuickWallet, was recently acquired by major Chinese exchange Huobi.  The local-storage wallet Armory, often favored by more tech-savvy and security conscious bitcoin users, has a form of multi-sig called 'Lockboxes'.  Next moves  Treasure's involvement in bitcoin included importing 15 Lamassu ATMs to Australia, and his father Bret is a board memberhttp://www.bitcoin.asn.au/board/ with the Bitcoin Association of Australia and chairman of the Australian Web Industry Association.  He was featured in the following Australian TV news report on bitcoin:  Treasure's trip to Bali involved discussions with Bitcoin Indonesia founder Oscar Darmawan and other participants in the BitIslands project, which aims to turn Bali into a digital currency haven.  He had obtained the majority of his bitcoins by taking out a AUD$20,000 loan. According to a Perth newspaper article, his own stash was in the 1,000 BTC realm.  Treasure's remaining coins are in multi-sig wallets and Casascius physical coins. Treasure said he plans to move all of them to multi-sig alternatives once home again and on a machine he trusts:  ""I don't know if the hacker was only able to remotely get read access to my home directory (which had numerous unencrypted backups) or whether there's a customised root kit avoiding detection and logging my every keystroke. I'm buying a new computer and cloning my hard drive for evidence purposes.""  ""Don't ever sweep cold wallets 'til you're absolutely sure there's no keylogger on your machine.""  He said he ""still believes in bitcoin"" despite feeling initially despondent after the setback, and considers it much more viable than the current banking system. His work in future, he added, is now more likely to focus on developing and promoting security.  Treasure will be speaking about his experience at Perth's 'Bitcoin Australasia' conference on 8th November.

42397972,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvKN,1412025049,Predicting Bitcoin's Next Price Rise,"Daniel Mark Harrison is a financial journalist and entrepreneur who writes a daily column for The Motley Fool UK and whose work has appeared regularly in other mainstream publications, including the Wall Street Journal. Since discovering bitcoin in early 2013, he has had a fascination for the digital currency.  In this article, Harrison examines the many reason touted for the decline in the bitcoin price, debunking a few myths along the way, and takes a look at where the price might be headed in both coming months and years.  The past weekend rounded up the recent trend of brutally high-volume selling on Chinese bitcoin exchanges.  On 28th September, bitcoin dropped to a new five-month low of $372.35. The previous record low for CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), is the six-month bottom reached on 10th April at $360.84.  Meanwhile, trading volumes touched historical highs for the third consecutive week, with 73.8% of bitcoins traded over Chinese exchanges OKCoin, Huobi and BTC China on the weekend.  Touted explanations fall short  One possibility put forward was the principle of asset allocation – effectively, people are finding other places to put their money as the bitcoin price continues its long slide.  Other hypotheses have ranged from Citigroup’s proposal that merchants selling into the market upon accepting bitcoin as payment forced down valuations, to the even more unlikely explanation by the Wall Street Journal last week that Chinese citizens may be converting RMB to USD via offshore bitcoin trades.  In practice, there is nowhere near enough merchant trade to contribute to such a huge increase in volumes, while converting out of RMB in the way that the WSJ reporters speculated would be impossible without Beijing officials noting the yawning gap in underlying yuan outflows on bitcoin exchanges, especially given how closely such activities are monitored on the mainland already.  “[In terms of] getting money out of China, [customers] could sell bitcoins just as well on Bitstamp or any other exchange that is not based there,” Kacper Ciesla, the founder of data provider Bitcoinity, told me.  Other economists argued that a rising US dollar has been weighing on bitcoin, but correlation between such a tiny market and such a giant one doesn’t hold up well, either.  Falling prices vs rising volumes  The reasons behind the selling lie in the glaring conflict of a situation in which there is steady value erosion accompanied by what appears to be progressively increased trading volumes.  As bitcoin has tumbled lately, volumes have made new daily highs, with over 140,000 BTC being traded per day in the last few weeks for US$55m–$60m, according to data provided by Coinity.org. That is twice the $30m daily volume high reached before the summer.  Rising volumes and declining prices do not naturally come together since when an asset is being more heavily sold than it is bought, buyers typically stay away from the market until there are no more sellers left.  While illegal in many regulated markets, price support is not prohibited in bitcoin’s case since the asset is widely unregulated. If carried out for only short spaces of time the practice can be cathartic in that it introduces needed liquidity to exchange floors.  Liquidity is the lifeblood of long-term pricing strength, and thus there is some logic to the idea of large-volume traders and market makers forcing volumes through exchanges by deliberately repurchasing units on the back end and selling them off exchanges, even if this does erode the price in the short run, Cielsa said, adding:  “Bitcoin market seems to have these waves of activity, and when they happen, volume rises on all exchanges [regardless of price direction].”  Hefty margins on OTC transactions  As the value of bitcoin has been tumbling into the zone of pre-December 2013 levels, it appears that there is a big gap forming between what the exchanges in China are reporting and what individual traders are in fact practicing using their own Rolodexes.  Ohio-based trader Dan Mercede buys from exchanges, including Bitstamp and Lake BTC, and sells mostly in the form of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to his own regional customer base of private clients. He said former long-term holders of bitcoin that sold out in weeks past are getting back into the market in a big way now the price is dropping further.  “Demand is really high with low prices and all the sellers that [were] holders before are actually returning buyers again right now,” he said.  Mercede, who is CEO of Cryptocoin Capital Management (CCM), claims he has made an average return of between 8%–15% per day mostly by buying off Chinese exchanges and selling locally, or vice-versa.  “I can get some crazy returns right now,” said Mercede, who cited a trade this weekend where he purchased 20 BTC at $375 and resold the units at $560 to a client within hours. CCM has been executing similar trades for amounts up to 50 BTC per trade a number of times in September, according to Mercede.  It is common practice in North America for retail investors to buy at premiums via local trusted brokers in the case of many asset classes. What is unusual is that customers are happy to pay such large premiums. Many speculate this is the direct result of exchanges being associated with countries such as China and Russia, which do not resonate well with the American public.  CCM is in the process of looking at registering with the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) so that it can expand its product suite, and Mercede is also raising additional cash to service bitcoin arbitrage transactions beyond the borders of his home state.  Waiting game recommended  Holding for the long term is what Roger Ver advises. He is the man who is known among the bitcoin community by the alias 'Bitcoin Jesus', a moniker bestowed for his early role in kick-starting the cryptocurrency by handing out free bitcoins and stirring up sentiment over the virtual payment unit.  Ver told CoinDesk that, while he thinks current levels look quite cheap in terms of presenting buying opportunities, this pales in comparison to the scale of the long-term outlook.  “The horizon should be more like three to four years,” said Ver, referring to the length of time investors should wait to see huge gains again like they did at the end of 2013.  Looking between the averages  In terms of the short-term scenario, data on trading prices when taken together with volume shifts, helps to uncover the true picture.  In the six-month period from 1st April 2013 to 1st November 2013, the average purchase price of bitcoin was $111.56 across the four exchanges participating in CoinDesk’s BPI.  Year to date, the average purchase price shot up dramatically, to $563.68. For the whole 18-month period combined, however, the average purchase price is notably lower at $337.61.  Most sellers who bought at $337.61 or thereabouts over the past 18 months will have sold out at $452 (this is the price of the year-to-date purchase price average of $563.68 minus the six-month prior average of $111.56). This is the exact point at which the currency was sold – once on the way down, and then around a week ago in the course of rising back up.  Offloading in the mid-$400s today yields most 18-month holders an average capital gain of 34%. Buyers have openly said that they were hoping to catch another 10-fold rise in bitcoin. These customers, once they have sold out, appear to be repurchasing at slightly lower levels again.  If the price averages are to be used as a reliable proxy of value going forward, then bitcoin looks ready to fall to around $337.61, and then bounce back up suddenly to over $500.

42397967,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvGR,1412010197,FTC: Butterfly Labs Held Back Shipments for Illicit Mining,"New court documents filed by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against Butterfly Labs allege that the manufacturer mined bitcoins using customer-purchased equipment prior to shipment.  The documents  , filed on 27th September, further allege that Butterfly Labs employees mined bitcoin for personal gain using machines purchased and later returned to the company. The agency says this assertion is supported by the testimony of several former employees.  As a result of the findings, the FTC asked a Kansas City federal judge to impose a preliminary injunction on Butterfly Labs that would extend the temporary restraining order it filed earlier this month. The company will now be controlled by a court-appointed receiver.  The official document reads:  ""[Butterfly Labs] misrepresented the delivery and profitability of the BitForce machine, and then made the same misrepresentations to induce consumers to purchase the Monarch, and did so yet again to sell their cloud mining services. They should not get a fourth change (or a fifth chance, in the case of one of the defendants).""  According to the 17-page filing, Butterfly Labs exhibited a ""repeated pattern of advertising new and allegedly innovative equipment"" and failed repeatedly to deliver on its claims, so closing the company is necessary on these grounds.  The news comes just one week after the manufacturer was shutdown by the US government amid accusations of fraud and public misrepresentation. The FTC was earlier given permission to seize the company's assets and close its operations pending a formal trial.  Butterfly Labs subsequently alleged that the FTC overreached in its decision to close the company's operations, suggesting it was in the process of issuing customer refunds – though these refunds would not negate its law violations.  The FTC strongly rebutted these claims in statements to CoinDesk, asserting it acted in the best interests of consumers.  At press time, Butterfly Labs indicated that it would be issuing official comment on the developments later today.  Mining for profit  The FTC alleges that Butterfly Labs was slow to complete the product of its mining units, and that when it did so, it conducted a process known informally as 'burning in' wherein equipment was tested and the bitcoins mined as a result were kept for company gain.  One former employee, the FTC said, suggested Butterfly Labs would conduct this process with 500 mining machines operating in three separate 'burn-in rooms', meaning as many as 1,500 were in operation in total. Another said that such testing went on for two days – a process that should have taken only 10–30 minutes.  Statements from at least one employee suggest that Butterfly Labs knowingly conducted this process to boost its bottom line. The document reads:  ""One employee inquired with company management as to why they chose to test by mining rather than using the test-net, and was told that the company would not make any money using a test-net.""  The FTC claims that no Butterfly Labs customer ever received products on the shipping date originally advertised. In addition, despite the company's claims that it provided a ""full product shipment or refund"" to customers who ordered between 9th August and 9th November 2013, Butterfly Labs has not provided supporting evidence to this claim.  Deceptive promotional practices  The FTC went on to suggest that Butterfly Labs used deceptive promotional practices to encourage consumer investment in its products.  According to the agency, defendants also posted a mining return-on-investment (ROI) calculator to the company's social media profiles, encouraging potential buyers to use the tool to measure the potential profitability of its mining rigs. It dismissed Butterfly Labs' assertions that it was not responsible for such representations as it did not create the calculator.  Questioning Butterfly Labs' original estimates about the capabilities of its mining hardware, the release stated:  ""A former employee's declaration asserts that the BitForce Mini-rig had less handing power and consumed more electricity than advertised.""  The FTC also attacked the company's claims that Butterfly Labs had a ""reasonable basis"" for the original representations of the estimated delivery dates for their mining rigs.  Further, it suggested that is has firm legal footing to assert that Butterfly Labs could be liable for failing to deliver on its advertisements, citing past precedent.  ""The law is well-settled that the FTC need not prove that defendants acted with intent to defraud or in bad faith to prevail,"" the statement said.

42397975,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvML,1411999776,Alpha Technology Viper Scrypt Miner Shipments Slip to October,"Alpha Technology has confirmed that shipments of its Viper Scrypt miner will suffer delays of up to a month.  The company had previously planned to ship the 'batch one' units in September, but now says the date has been moved to October.  ""We are confident that we will be shipping in the latter half of October 2014, provided everything goes as planned,"" director Mohammad Akram told CoinDesk, explaining:  ""We are doing our best to ensure our customers receive the highest quality of product, which is performing at, if not better the advertised hash rates and power usage requirements advertised and do not want to rush anything which would undermine that.""  The tape-out of the firm's new silicon was a success, according to Alpha, which is currently still testing the hardware. Once the new miner passes quality control, it will move into mass production, followed by shipping.  Furthermore, the first batch will beat its previously quoted performance targets, according to Alpha, although the exact figures have not bee revealed. Four months ago, the spec was revised from original estimates, with the flagship Viper miner claimed to deliver 250 MH/second.  Delays explained  In its latest developmental updates, Alpha Technology shed more light on a number of problems that contributed to the delays.  The company wrote:  “It's absolutely thrilling for us that we are going to be able to ship you your miners at any moment now. However, we do realize that making batch one happen has not turned out exactly as we all had hoped and planned, and just like you: we are very disappointed with that.”  The company started taking orders for the first batch of miners in January and planned to ship the first batch of miners in July. However, that date slipped and, two months ago, Alpha pinned part of the blame on a dispute with PayPal.  Akram said at the time that the delay was due to the company not being able to access customer funds held with the payment provider.  The company then revised its schedule so that batch one of the Viper would ship in September.  Akram explained:  ""We are aware that there [are] some customer complaints regarding the delays etc. However, I would like to point out that we have increased the minimum hash rate tenfold from 5 Mh/s to 50 Mh/s, and 25 Mh/s to 250 Mh/s, and are looking to meet, if not outdo, our estimates on the power efficiency requirements. These changes, together with the problems we have had with PayPal, have naturally resulted in delays, which have been problems completely out of our control.""  Loyalty rewards  The company now says it wants to “give back” to those who have stuck with the firm through the delays, and has launched a new loyalty scheme for all customers who made batch one orders. Alpha originally considered handing out shares to those affected by the delays, but due to potential legal issues it decided to develop an alternative.  The scheme will run for five years and will involve giving almost half of the value of shareholder dividends to first batch customers. Any buyer who purchased 50 MH/s or 250 MH/s Viper miners prior to the 31st August 2014 will be eligible.  Akram said the company has “big plans” for future batches and it is determined to set a high standard in the mining industry for years to come.  “Out of all the startup companies like ours, who had started from scratch in the scrypt mining market, most have been delayed significantly or failed altogether, as a result of some of the high level competition which cropped up from some of the bigger players in the bitcoin market and well-funded companies,” he said.  Altcoin resurgence?  Akram added that Alpha Technology is confident that scrypt altcoins will rise again in value and generate more market opportunities.  “The problem seems to stem from those who are in it for the short term, and only thinking about short term ROI, and are dumping coins as soon as they are mining them. This seems to have had a negative effect on the value of these coins,” said Akram.  “However, in the long term, I am pretty confident that the value of scrypt coins will again rise, and stabilise in the coming years.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/29/alpha-technology-viper-scrypt-miner-shipments-slip-to-october,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91b3cc5346baf2bfa307a133ad84c9999ec26fdd-1314x862.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397981,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvRG,1411992108,Circle Announces Global Launch of Bitcoin Banking Platform,"Bitcoin services company Circle's digital money platform is now publicly available across the globe.  The US-based startup announced the launch in a 29th September blog post.  The company has spent months beta testing its platform, and during the summer Circle steadily expanded its pool of testers and offered sneak peaks of its future products.  With today's announcement, the firm has also outlined key aspects of its initial service, which includes deposit insurance and international language support.  The company said:  ""When we set out to build Circle, we imagined a new kind of Internet-centric consumer financial service, one that the average person would find enjoyable and powerful, and which built on the promises of bitcoin – instant, global, secure, free transactions.""  Circle is formally kicking off its launch at Sibos 2014 Boston, where co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire will speak on several digital currency-focused panels.  Insurance guarantee  Notably, Circle clarified in the blog post that all deposits are 100% insured, explaining:  ""Our insurance broker is Marsh, one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. The underwriters for this insurance are all highly-rated. Insurance on bitcoin is a new market, and we’re proud to be a market maker in establishing this valuable service to users of digital assets.""  The Boston-based startup joins a small number of bitcoin businesses that insure customer holdings. Coinbase announced its insurance broker last month and Great American Insurance Group recently began offering crime insurance coverage to companies that handle digital currency.  International reach  At launch, Circle's platform will include support for seven languages: Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German and English.  Declaring that this enables it to extend its bitcoin services to ""40% of the world's population"", the company noted that language support is part of its broader global focus for the months ahead and will continue adding new languages as new upgrades to the platforms are rolled out.  ""It’s a good start, but we plan to add far more capabilities for international customers over time,"" the startup said.  Circle has long suggested that it will focus on a global customer base at the outset, rather than focusing on national markets like other companies in the space.  In an earlier blog post penned by CEO Allaire and co-founder and CTO Sean Neville, Circle discussed a roadmap to mainstream adoption that pointed to the global nature of the bitcoin market.  The company said at the time:  ""We want to help people store and use digital money anywhere in the world.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/29/circle-announces-global-launch-of-bitcoin-banking-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8aef5e3998b3556adfbc7f914ea45bd93952f51e-1300x975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397970,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvJO,1411983882,Netagio Beats Banking Blues with WalPay Partnership,"UK-based gold and bitcoin exchange Netagio has announced a new partnership with payment services provider WalPay that will give it vital access to the traditional banking system.  The new relationship means Netagio customers can now deposit funds and receive international payments in GBP, EUR and USD. The firm indicates that other currencies are to follow in the future.  Additionally, customers will soon be able to make credit and debit card payments to their Netagio trading accounts. The firm said Visa, Visa Electron, Visa Debit, MasterCard, MasterCard Debit and Maestro cards will be accepted.  While no concrete date is set for the rollout, the firm indicated it plans to have card payments in place during the last quarter of 2014.  Justin Martin, head of business development and sales at WalPay, said:  “We are thrilled to be working with Netagio to secure new robust banking facilities for their customers today, and also to work on introducing credit and debit card payment functionality in the very near future.”  WalPay is an Isle of Man-based payment service provider bringing banking solutions to a variety of European merchants. The firm is licensed by the island’s Financial Supervision Commission.  Banking crisis  The news comes in the wake of recent problems on the Isle of Man, where Netagio's holding company is based.  In mid-September, payment services provider Capital Treasury Services (CTS) announced that it would close all accounts belonging to cryptocurrency businesses.  Until this point, CTS had relationships with a number of bitcoin companies on the island.  While the move sent an initial shockwave through the cryptocurrency space, it quickly became clear that other companies, such as WalPay and Instabill, could possibly step in to fill the space vacated by CTS.  The Netagio announcement is the first sign that, indeed, the Isle of Man's bitcoin companies can still find access to the banking system and that business could soon return to normal.  Simon Hamblin, CEO of Netagio, told CoinDesk: “We have been working with WalPay for about six [or] seven weeks in preparation for the credit and debit card integration and before the CTS issue emerged in the IoM.""  He added:  “We knew that WalPay could also secure European banking relationships, so when UK banks pulled their services from the IoM, we were already well placed to put new systems in place.""  Banking in the Eurozone  Walpay provides Netagio access to European banking via TrustPay, which is authorised and regulated in accordance with the European Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC).  This does mean, however, that Netagio's banking partners are no longer British. As a result, UK customers cannot make domestic bank transfers.  Hamblin explained that ""deposits can be made in GBP, but they have to be made to a European bank and are subject to international transfer fees and time delays (three working days)"".  When questioned about the WalPay relationship, Hamblin moved to instill confidence that it will resolve problems the company had with previous partners, stating:  ""Our banking partners are fully aware that we are a bitcoin business. Across Europe, various local jurisdictions continue provide bank accounts to bitcoin businesses. Sadly, this is no longer the case in the UK.""  Cryptocurrency appeal  In the months before the CTS crisis, the Isle of Man had been touting itself as a cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdiction in hopes of attracting new business to the island.  Not part of the UK or the European Union, the island is a self-governing Crown dependency. It is making moves to set up a regulatory environment that intends to protect consumers but also encourage businesses that work with cryptocurrencies. Additionally, a cryptocurrency incubator has been set up by a consortium of local business to further boost the appeal of the island.  The recent Crypto Valley Summit event was based in the capital, Douglas, but was marred by the news of CTS withdrawal of facilities.  Correction: A previous version of this story suggested incorrectly that CTS did not inform its previous banking partners of its bitcoin operations.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/29/netagio-beats-banking-blues-with-walpay-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54ce59308cbbbf3421a04ec0203dbb0f251a9955-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
