42380954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xTZ,1530565554,Crypto Valley Declares Blockchain Voting Trial a 'Success',"Zug, a city in Switzerland known as the ""Crypto Valley,"" has successfully completed its first test of a local blockchain-based voting system.  As CoinDesk reported on June 11, the Swiss city launched an e-voting pilot platform built on a blockchain as part of the city's efforts to embrace the technology. The voting process took place between June 25 and July 1, and stored both polling information and residents' IDs on the system.  SWI swissinfo.ch, a news outlet owned by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, reported on Monday that the city's head of communications, Dieter Müller, claimed that ""the premiere was a success.""  Following the positive results, Müller said that ""technical details"" of the voting process will be evaluated over the coming months.  According to a press release from the city government on June 25, the goal of building this blockchain-based platform was to make the voting process ""safer and less susceptible to unnoticed manipulation.""  The e-voting system was developed by Luxoft, a software company based in Zug, in partnership with the city and the department of computer science at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences.  At the time, Vasily Suvorov, Luxoft's chief technology officer, said:  ""There are concerns about electronic voting because voting is a fundamental mechanism for direct voting.... That's why we believe that this technology should not belong to a single company. We will build the e-voting platform 'Open Source' so that people can understand what the technology is and how it works. We want to encourage more people to develop blockchain-based applications for governments worldwide.""

The trial tracked meat produced in an unnamed cattle slaughterhouse, providing ""improved transparency"" throughout the supply chain, according to a press release. Both the slaughterhouse and the FSA tracked data provided in the trial.  FSA head of information management Sian Thomas said in a statement that his agency thought ""blockchain technology might add real value to a part of the food industry.""  A slaughterhouse in particular was chosen because its ""work requires a lot of inspection and collation of results,"" he said.  He added:  ""Our approach has been to develop data standards with industry that will make theory reality and I'm delighted that we've been able to show that blockchain does indeed work in this part of the food industry. I think there are great opportunities now for industry and government to work together to expand and develop this approach.""  Following the pilot, additional programs will be tested to give farmers access to data about their animals in July.  While this trial may have been the first time the regulatory agency used a blockchain to monitor food supply chains, various retailers have already begun experimenting with the use case.

Overall, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to $6,661.76 at 13:00 UTC, a 6.37 percent increase from the day's low of $6,262.28, and was last seen trading at $6,613, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The broader market followed suit, as it usually does when bitcoin (BTC) flexes its muscles. Currently, the total value of all cryptocurrencies stands at $270 billion, having jumped $14 billion in the in the morning hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  Looking ahead, the broader market may remain solidly bid as the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization looks set to test the $7,000 mark, courtesy of a bullish continuation price pattern, as seen in the charts below.  Hourly chart  Having faced rejection at flag resistance in Asian hours, the cryptocurrency was expected to revisit flag support. However, BTC unexpectedly picked up a bid at $6,275, setting stage for a big move on the higher side.  The subsequent bull flag breakout, as seen in the chart above, signaled a resumption of the rally from Friday's low below $5,800, temporarily silencing the ""dead cat"" critics. Price action now sets scope to $7,065 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).  What's more, the bullish breakout is accompanied by a rise in volume. So, the gains look sustainable.  Daily Chart  BTC cleared the falling wedge resistance on Friday, signaling a short-term bear-to-bull trend change.  Further, a bullish follow-through to Sunday's inside bar, as seen today, only validates Friday's falling wedge breakout and indicates better times ahead for BTC.  View:  The high volume bull flag breakout seen in the hourly chart has likely put bitcoin on the path to $7,000, proving Friday's rally to be the beginning of something more substantial than initially thought.

Attorney T.J. Jesky and business affairs manager Mark DeStefano allegedly made about $1.4 million in 10 days by selling shares in Hong Kong-based UBI Blockchain Internet, the SEC claimed in a press release Monday. The two received 72,000 restricted shares of the firm's stock last October, meaning they were to be sold at a specific price – $3.70.  However, the two allegedly sold the shares at prices ranging from $21 to nearly $50. The sales were halted when the SEC froze sales of the firm's stock entirely in early January, according to the release.  As reported by CoinDesk at the time, the agency cited unusual movement in UBI's share price and questions about its regulatory filings when it suspended trading of the stock.  In Monday's press release, Robert Cohen, head of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, called the case a ""prime example"" of why retail investors should be cautious about purchasing shares in ""companies that suddenly claim to have a blockchain business.""  He added:  ""This case involved both a trading suspension and people holding restricted shares who attempted to profit from the dramatic price increase with illegal stock sales that violated the registration statement.""  According to the SEC, both defendants have agreed to return the $1.4 million and pay a further $188,682 in penalties, as well as become subject to permanent injunctions.

The nation's military technology accelerator, referred to as the ERA, is launching a special scientific lab to determine whether blockchain technology can be used to identify cyber attacks and protect critical infrastructure, according to Russian daily Izvestia.  The newspaper reported that research has already begun to explore possible applications for blockchain technology, though the lab itself is still being developed.  One of the priorities at ERA is the development of an intelligent system to detect and prevent cyber attacks on important databases, according to the paper. To that end, the organization has formed a team of information security specialists.  Alexei Malanov, an antivirus expert at Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity firm based in Moscow, told the newspaper that blockchain-based platforms can make it more difficult to hide traces of cyber attacks.  He explained that online intruders often clean up access logs on devices to hide traces of unauthorized access to the device. But, by using a distributed ledger, the risk of this happening is minimized.  German Klimenko, a former technology advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin similarly said that work on blockchain studies has been ""useful"" for the cybersecurity industry in the nation.  The lab, which is being built in the Russian coastal town of Anapa, will ultimately fall under the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation's Eighth Directorate, which likewise focuses on information security.

42429327,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTzh,1530545159,"For Litecoin's Price, This Week's Close Could Be Pivotal","Litecoin's (LTC) close this week will likely set the tone for the next major move in prices, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency saw moves both ways last week – prices hit lows and highs of $72.58 and $84.24, respectively – before closing on Sunday on a flat note at $80, signaling indecision in the market. This leaves litecoin at the mercy of the price action this week, meaning a convincing bullish move – preferably above last week's high – could well entice bargain hunters and lead to a notable price rally.  On the other hand, if LTC finds acceptance below $72.58, then more investors will likely liquidate their holding (long positions), yielding another round of sell-off.  At press time, the world's sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $85.00 on Kraken.  Weekly chart  Litecoin created a doji candle last week at the key support of $79.31 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the 2015 low to 2017 high).  A doji candle normally represents indecision, however, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from its record high of $369, the doji could be seen as representing bearish exhaustion.  If the cryptocurrency closes above $84.24 this week, it would confirm a bullish doji reversal (i.e. a bearish-to-bullish trend change). While this scenario may sound exciting to the bulls, they should remember that the 5-week and 10-week moving averages (MA) are still biased to the bears.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is in bearish territory, holding well below 50.00.  And, last but not least, the long-term outlook remains bearish while litecoin is trading below the 50-week moving average, currently at $124.70.  So, a weekly close below $72.58 (last week's doji candle low) would signal a continuation of the sell-off from the April high of $183.00.  View  A weekly close (Sunday, as per UTC)) above $84.24 would confirm a bull doji reversal and open up upside towards the 50-week MA, currently located at $124.70.  A close below $72.58, however, would shift risk in favor of a drop to $50 (psychological support).

According to the Bangkok Post on Monday, the Association of Securities Companies (ACE) – a body that represents the country's securities firms – said it is in talks with regulators about allowing established financial firms to offer crypto exchange services.  Furthermore, the association's chairwoman, Pattera Dilokrungthirapop, said in the article that at least several securities companies are filing a registration application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as preparation for the launch of a crypto exchange.  Dilokrungthirapop explained that, since traditional financial companies need to incorporate new systems to protect investors' assets, and keep those assets separate from their own, they may be better off uniting to build a single platform to ""reduce operating costs and collaborate on sharing innovative technology.""  ACE said the move comes at a time when its member companies have shown increasing interest in stepping into crypto-related businesses, such as offering trading and facilitating initial coin offerings.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Thailand passed a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in May, which is now pending publication in the country's Royal Gazette before becoming law.  Under the new rules, any entity that conducts crypto exchange transactions or initial coin offerings in Thailand must be registered and approved by the SEC.

42429317,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTfh,1530532827,It's Too Soon for On-Chain Governance,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Blockchain governance is hard.  That's the only reliable conclusion to draw from the chaotic, contentious rollout of EOS, the $4 billion project whose consensus model was touted as a way to enable smoother governance and scalability in a blockchain industry beset with conflicts and decision-making gridlock.  First, it took longer than expected for the EOS community to elect the network's 21 block producers, which are paid $10,000 a day to validate transactions. Then, the EOS Core Arbitration Forum, a body set up to resolve disputes, sent out a memo ordering those block producers to freeze 27 supposedly sketchy-looking accounts.  Concerns immediately arose that the ECAF was arbitrarily censoring participants, inevitably raising accusations of centralized control and putting chain immutability into question right at the outset. As an ECAF representative threatened lawsuits against one block producer, and as a separate fake document purporting to be from the arbitration body appeared, one New York block producer threw up its hands and refused to participate.  Now, after Dan Larimer, CTO of founding company Block.one, called the ECAF's order a mistake and argued that its handling of the problem did more harm to confidence in EOS than any lost funds that the suspect accounts might have stolen, his company wants to rewrite the entire EOS Constitution.  Just three weeks into the launch, the spat has provided a popcorn-worthy spectacle for commentators on Crypto Twitter. But, in reality, as a way to assess on-chain governance mechanisms such as EOS's delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism, there's a lot more at stake (excuse the pun) than entertainment.  Along with saga at Tezos, another very well-funded on-chain governance project, which was rocked by disputes between the founders and the first director of the foundation overseeing its $243 million war chest, the EOS disaster offers a strong reminder of how entrenched human mistrust can be difficult to overcome.  To offset the mistrust there must be a sufficient store of shared community trust in whatever mechanism or institution is in place to resolve those problems. That's the case whether the overall system is described as ""decentralized"" or ""centralized.""  The problem is that when large amounts of money are involved, forging that common store of trust in the dispute resolution mechanism is especially difficult.  The best laid plans...  I'm actually sympathetic to the creative efforts of the Tezos and EOS founders – as well as those of a host others, including Decred, NEO and Cardano. In exploring protocol-level solutions such as voting and staking to enable some level of internal, functional democracy, they are trying to help blockchain communities make orderly decisions on important changes and upgrades and to avoid the contentious disputes and chain splits that have rocked bitcoin, ethereum and others.  I'm not willing to say that on-chain governance won't ever work – or that our only choice is to either live with disorder, acrimony and gridlock or turn to external legal solutions that expose user identities and require a dependence on external government bodies. But I think we are getting a very clear demonstration that it's very difficult to design the right algorithm to overcome the toxic mix that money and mistrust create.  We should note that the ECAF, which was formed in the midst of forum discussions among EOS community members before the launch, was conceived as a solution to these problems. Its existence reflects a recognition that disputes would arise and that an off-chain mechanism was needed. But it was very poorly put together, with unclear rules and processes for arbitration.  The question is: Would it have been better designed, more capable of earning the trust of all participants, if the community wasn't founded on a kind of utopian-like blind faith in the DPOS mechanism?  In other words, the root of the problem may be the unreasonable claims being made by on-chain governance proponents.  As it is, the reliability of the DPOS mechanism was tested by the size of the EOS money pot. The giant fundraise fueled expectations of high valuations, which in turn stoked greed and mistrust. It fed the perception, right or wrong, that those who obtain power and influence inside the EOS network might be able to game the system.  Larimer, others from Block.one and many EOS fans swear by the various checks and balances intended to protect users from overly powerful block producers: that it requires agreement among 15 of the 21 block producers to reverse transactions; that ongoing voting holds them to account; and that there's always the option (or threat) of a fork.  And yet, despite all that, the system has clearly generated mistrust and, ultimately, dysfunction.  And that's not for nothing. While he may have been biased against EOS, there was sound logic to ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's warnings in a blog post three months ago of the risk of bribes and collusion among block producers operating across different jurisdictions. Money and power breed corruption. Always.  Buterin's main point, one that he made in support of his Ethereum developer colleague Vlad Zamfir's critique of Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsham's impassioned plea for protocol-based solutions to bitcoin's and ethereum's problems, was that on-chain governance won't work.  In terms of where the technology currently stands, I think that's true. The wellspring of trust in these mechanisms isn't yet strong enough to overcome the problem of cross-user mistrust.  The solution, for now  So, what to do? Bitcoin's drawn-out block-size debate and the contentious hard fork that resulted from it presented an image of dysfunction that undermined mainstream confidence in the technology.  And in ethereum, where there has a long been a clearer sense of identifiable leadership, Buterin is himself often accused of having too much CEO-like power. (The slide in ether's price when he was rumored to have died in a car crash illustrated the problems of perceived centralization that have persisted around ethereum ever since Buterin and others supported the hard fork to rescue funds lost in The DAO attack of 2016.)  Well, for now – and this will be anathema to crypto-anarchists and some blockchain libertarians – the solution likely lies in recognizing the limits of the algorithms and relying instead on human-led, legally defined institutions for dispute resolution and off-chain governance.  While I have been a constant critic of permissioned blockchains, especially of the risk that the consortia that run them can act as colluding gatekeepers to curtail innovation and hold users hostage, they are popular among companies precisely because they operate within a recognized legal structure that they're comfortable with. Legal certainty is valuable.  The failure of The DAO taught us that code is not law. By defining it as a system in which the software superseded all other legal recourse, that project's founders created a model that allowed the thief who destroyed it to argue, quite reasonably, that he or she was not acting illegally. Yet those who lost money wanted recourse, which is how ethereum ended up with its hard fork.  The solution, for now, lies in forming well-designed, trusted mechanisms that reside within a predictable legal framework and which can resolve disputes through fluid, lightweight arbitration rather than being bogged down in courts. They carry the weight of law, but try to avoid the process of it.  Key here are the words ""well-designed, trusted."" Lightweight, off-chain arbitration might have been the intent of those who created the ECAF, but it was not well-designed and clearly hasn't earned the trust of all actors. It's not at clear how social consensus was formed in support of it.  Here, the internet's governance offers a model, as father-and-son team Don and Alex Tapscott laid out in a useful assessment of the outlook for blockchain governance for The World Economic Forum.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) and the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) have worked fairly well as trusted avenues for governance and dispute resolution. Understandably, the United States' historical influence over ICANN has been a bone of contention. Yet, even so, the multi-stakeholder structure of these organizations has mostly assuaged concerns that any one party, government or otherwise, has excessive power of the rules by which internet real estate is managed.  Blockhains, with anti-corporatist, decentralized principles at their heart, can't and shouldn't try to emulate the process by which these internet bodies were formed, which relied upon the bargaining positions of different governments in international forums like the United Nations. But there's still much that can be done by standards bodies and NGOs to forge consensus among a variety of stakeholders in this industry. (The W3C and other standards bodies are already seeking to establish authority here.)  Does this mean immutability and censorship-resistance are impossible? Yes, perhaps, if you think in absolute terms. But these were also aspirational objectives, not absolutes.  What matters is a system that works in the service of the widest possible array of users. And, as of now, on-chain governance models like that of EOS clearly don't.  Cracked window image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | FORKS,Michael J.

42429312,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTZh,1530529809,Self-Proclaimed Satoshi Says Bitcoin Book in the Works,"An individual claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto has announced they are writing a book about bitcoin and its history that will include personal stories of its creator, though it's unclear whether the person is the actual inventor of the world's first – and still biggest – cryptocurrency.  Last Friday, a website named nakamotofamilyfoundation.org posted a letter signed by Satoshi Nakamoto – the (probably pseudonymous) name of the author of the notable 2008 bitcoin white paper, whose real identity still remains unknown.  According to the post, the book, if it ever comes out, will be divided into two parts and named ""Honne and Tatamae,"" according to the results of a ""cryptopuzzle"" published with the post.  An explanation from Wikipedia indicates that the name in Japanese means ""the contrast between a person's true feelings and desires and the behavior and opinions one displays in public.""  Further, the post's author claims the book will contain information about the personal life of bitcoin's creator, saying:  ""But to be certain, there are countless conversations I found to be enlightening that I hope make it to be part of the story. There will be many new names and individuals appearing throughout the book in any case, as it is a story about my personal life.""  Published alongside the announcement is an excerpt from the supposed book, which briefly recaps the development of bitcoin and covers new issues that have emerged since the creation of bitcoin such as scaling, the concept of blockchain and the arrival of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners.  The excerpt also goes on to explain why the name Satoshi Nakamoto was chosen in the first place:  ""I wanted the most common name, which I knew no one outside of Japan had any recollection that Satoshi Nakamoto, was the equivalent of 'John Smith.' It took time for the public to come to this conclusion, but most with direct access to me had figured it out long ago.""  However, whether the post's author is indeed the real Nakamoto cannot yet be verified.  Craig Wright, an Australian academic and chief scientist at nChain, who claimed to be Nakamoto in 2015 (though has not provided proof adequate for most observers), took to Twitter after the book announcement came to light, saying that its author ""cannot get the dates nor technical details correct.""

42429329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxU1h,1530525658,Back Above $6K: Bitcoin's Bull Reversal Is a Work in Progress,"Bitcoin (BTC) has regained poise over the weekend after a drop below $6,000 last week, but a short-term bullish reversal is still not confirmed.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,320 on Bitfinex – up 13 percent from the seven-month low of $5,755 hit on June 24.  BTC was expected to remain on the defensive and drop to fresh 2018 lows below $5,755 over the weekend, having closed below $6,000 (February low) on Thursday.  However, it unexpectedly picked up a bid at $5,780 on Friday, contradicting the bearish technical setup, and rose to $6,545 on Bitfinex on Saturday – its highest level since June 22.  The bounce may be due to sellers running dry, having pushed BTC lower by 70 percent in the first six months of the year.  Further, the repeated rebound from sub-$6,000 levels (February low) have established the area below the psychological mark as a significant near-term support.  Still, it is too early to call a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as the bulls are yet to violate the series of lower price highs and lower price lows, as represented by the falling channel (bearish setup) seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  BTC created a bullish outside-day candle on Friday and closed (as per UTC) well above $6,302 (Friday's high) on Saturday, confirming a bullish outside-day reversal pattern.  However, the follow-through has stalled at the falling channel resistance in the last 48 hours. Hence, we remain cautious and would feel comfortable calling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change only after BTC has crossed the falling channel hurdle in a convincing manner.  That said, the probability of an aggressive move above the falling channel resistance, currently located at $6,450, looks high as the cryptocurrency has created a bull flag – a bullish continuation pattern – on the short duration chart below.  Hourly chart  A break above the flag resistance of $6,416 would signal a continuation of the rally from the recent lows below $5,800, and would open the doors to $7,065 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).  View  The sell-off from the May 21 high of $9,990 seems to have ended. However, only a bullish falling channel breakout would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Should BTC cross the falling channel resistance of $6,450, then resistance lined up at $6,848 (June 19 high) and $7,000 (psychological hurdle) will likely come into play.  On the downside, a break below $6,000 would kill the odds of a short-term bullish reversal.  A daily close below $5,755 would revive the bearish outlook and expose support at $5,400 (Nov. 12 low).

42429326,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTxh,1530522655,Huobi's New Voting Rules Anger Crypto Fund 'Supernodes',"A change to the rules for voting on new token listings has caused a backlash against Huobi's HADAX cryptocurrency exchange platform.  On Friday of last week, Huobi published an update – ""HADAX Super Nodes and Voting Rules Updates and Subsequent Arrangements"" – which outlined that, henceforth, HADAX will rely on two separate groups of funds to help with deciding on new listings.  The company introduced the idea of ""Standing Nodes,"" for which the HADAX platform will invite 14 large, traditional venture capital firms to join, such as ZhenFund, FBG, Unity Ventures, and Draper Dragon.  The new rules will also include 31 ""Selected Nodes,"" which are chosen through an application review process. Based on the announcement, Selected Nodes are smaller, crypto-specific venture firms such as Node Capital, Dfund, and BlockVC.  Huobi launched HADAX in February of this year, allowing users to vote – using its HT token – for new assets to be listed on the platform for trading. The firm later introduced a mechanism that would allow notable venture firms to serve as a supernodes to help HADAX screen new tokens before presenting them for public voting.  With the updated rules, HADAX said that, from now on, ""All projects for the public voting list must be supported by a Standing Node and projects that were not supported by any standing nodes will be removed from the list and votes will be refunded.""  Effectively, Standing Nodes will have a stronger role to play in deciding which tokens can be listed on the HADAX platform.  The move immediately drew backlash from various token funds who felt they had been demoted, accusing HADAX of being ""discriminative and authoritarian.""  Most notably perhaps, Du Jun, founder of Node Capital and also a co-founder of the Huobi exchange, announced through his WeChat platform that, although his firm had been a HADAX supernode, it will withdraw and no longer be involved in the supernode vote.  Illustrating the post with a middle-finger photo, Du replied in this own thread:  ""Fuck the HADAX operation team.""  Node Capital was soon joined by other crypto funds in announcing that they would not tolerate the decision and would withdraw from supernode roles – including Dfund, established by Chinese over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong, as well as Bixin Capital, the venture arm of crypto wallet Bixin.  In response to the crypto funds' departures, Li Lin, co-founder and CEO of Huobi Group, said via his WeChat channel that, while it could have been communicated better, that the move is aimed to ensure the quality of tokens chosen to be traded on the platform.  Li wrote:  ""I apologize for not having effectively communicated with supernodes before publishing our new decision. ... We understand that some selected nodes feel disrespected or their branding is hurt, which led to their respective responses. We build collaborations based on a win-win purpose. Partnership or not is always a free market choice. Huobi always opens its gate for partners. But HADAX must be completely revamped and we will have another major upgrade in July. In regardless of what model it will take, we think being responsible for users is of utmost importance.""  As of press time, the company had not responded to CoinDesk's request for further details on HADAX's future plans around the arrangement.  HADAX is now the 43rd largest exchange on CoinMarketCap with 40 tokens available for trading and $23 million changing hands in the last 24 hours.

42429337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxU3h,1530518452,Charts: SEC Data Shows Token Filing Figures Just Keep Rising,"Regulatory uncertainty or not, data from the SEC indicates the number of filings related to token sales continues to trend upward.  Indeed, a review of SEC data through June indicates that the SEC has received nearly 100 filings for token sales (93) in the past year, beginning with four in August 2017 and building to an all-time high of 15 in May.  Many of the filings reviewed by CoinDesk related to sales of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs, which essentially serve as promises for tokens at a later date. The framework is modeled after the Simple Agreements for Future Equity, or SAFEs, which a funding model popularized by the startup accelerator Y Combinator.  Still, the data from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system shows additional details that provide insight to the trend.  Geographically, it's perhaps no surprise that the U.S. accounted for the majority of the funding, though according to the SEC, Spain, Japan and the U.K. were represented as well.  As for where the startups are incorporating, Delaware was the clear winner, accounting for the lion's share of filings.  Other popular jurisdictions included the Cayman Islands, Estonia and Bermuda, the latter of which has been publicly seeking to attract startups and innovators of late.  The growth in filings comes in spite of what some sources say is scrutiny of the SAFT model by SEC officials. As CoinDesk previously reported and quoted from a knowledgeable source: ""The SEC is targeting SAFTs.""  However, it remains to be seen what will take place over the latter half of 2018, as recent remarks from the SEC perhaps hint at a softer tone that could do much to propel new filings.  For example, there's SEC chairman Jay Clayton's statement in June where he told CNBC that token sellers should ""come see us"" if they plan to sell tokens. Further, later that month, an SEC official provided what was a moment of market clarity when he stated that he doesn't believe ether and bitcoin, the market's two largest assets are securities.  While the verdict is still out for ICOs, it seems the current lack of clarity is doing little to stem or slow the tide of token offerings.

42429325,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTvh,1530511205,BTCC Relaunches Crypto Exchange With Plan for Own Token,"BTCC, one of the longest-running and once top-three trading platforms in China, has announced that it's relaunching its exchange business with a plan to issue its own tokens.  The company said Monday its revamped crypto exchange is now up and running with new trading pairs including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin, as well as crypto-to-crypto trading options.  As part of the plan to revive its business, BTCC said it is introducing a system by which users can be rewarded with points by signing up, completing ID verification and trading. The points, according to the company, can be fully converted into BTCC's tokens, which will be tradable on its platform.  However, the company has not revealed a concrete timeline for its token issuance, only saying it will be launched in the next ""a couple of months."" The firm also indicates that the point supply will have a limit, though it has not yet decided at the moment on a hard cap or a ratio for how the points can be transferred into its token in the future.  Further down the road, BTCC said it is planning to add more cryptocurrencies and it's also open to listing more ERC-20 based tokens.  BTCC's relaunch plan comes nearly a year after it suspended Chinese yuan trading against bitcoin in September 2017, following the People's Bank of China's clampdown on initial coin offerings and fiat-to-crypto exchanges.  Although the firm shifted its headquarters to Hong Kong and maintained a crypto-to-crypto platform called DAX, that offering was also suspended in December. Meanwhile, BTCC's regional rivals such as Huobi and OKCoin successfully pivoted to crypto-to-crypto platforms and rejoined the ranks of the world's largest exchanges by trading volume.  BTCC's new way of rewarding traders also comes at a time when a new revenue model called ""trans-fee mining"" has emerged among Chinese crypto exchanges. The system reimburses users' transaction fees with a platform's own tokens – a model that appears to be somewhat similar to what BTCC is planning, except that its tokens can only be redeemed at a later stage.  Commenting on that, the firm's vice president of international business Aaron Choi said that, since BTCC will have zero trading fees in the first three months after relaunch, its model is more of a giveaway.  However, Choi admits that trans-fee mining could be an option in the future for BTCC, as the firm is yet to decide on the issuance model of its tokens.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There's still a business risk so our management is reviewing this model, how it can be sustained in a long term. So giving away points for trading that can be converted into our token in the future is what we think makes sense for now.""  Currently, BTCC has diversified its business to three main areas: the exchange, a mining pool and its Mobi wallet. The company was acquired by a Hong Kong-based blockchain capital firm in January of this year.  Just last week, CoinDesk also reported that the firm is planning to sell 49 percent of its equity in the mining pool business to a financial asset management firm based in Hong Kong.

42429314,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTXh,1530504032,"Crypto Startups Don't Need Sandboxes, They Need Greenhouses","John Collins, is an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University and former head of policy for crypto exchange Coinbase.      I've written before about how I believe regulatory ""sandboxes"" for financial services innovation serve a useful function and, in absence of federal action in the U.S., states should establish them.  Since that time Arizona passed legislation to establish a sandbox, other states are trying, and there are continuing and active discussions in my home state of Delaware around how to support financial services innovation.  During my testimony at a Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission hearing on cryptocurrency, I took the opportunity to give a plug for regulatory ""sandboxes"" because I think crypto and blockchain projects are excellent candidates for such programs.  With that in mind, I read with great interest a recent speechhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/statements/st180606_exchequer_club.pdf by Maria Vullo, the Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services.  She touched on a number of different topics across the financial services landscape (including the state's BitLicense regulations) and the speech is largely a rebuke of the current administration, its policies, and its overall regulatory worldview. It's an excellent and provocative speech and I urge everyone to read it.  However, one passage, in particular, caught my attention:  ""There are those who argue that the mere utilization of financial technology alone somehow grants them an exemption from the rules that banks and other financial institutions follow to manage risk and protect consumers. I have been highly vocal on myriad fronts in my opposition to this view, which would permit any company that calls itself a fintech to engage in a form of regulatory arbitrage, either with no regulator or in a so-called sandbox.""  She followed with this memorable line:  ""A sandbox is where toddlers play. Adults play by rules and if you engage in banking activities, that means you are responsibly regulated in order to protect the customers. Period.""  I don't disagree with the overall sentiment of Vullo's statement (and should note than Jan Owen, head of the California Department of Business Oversight made a similar remark a few weeks later): the financial services industry is highly regulated for a reason, and the responsibilities of a financial services company should be higher than that of a photo-sharing app. (I stole this line from Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire.)  Where I disagree with Vullo is in the representation of so-called ""sandboxes"" as a no-man's land of unregulated financial services offerings and the companies who want to discuss new ways of testing financial technologies as ""toddlers.""  No one serious is arguing for that type of construct — and if they are, they should stop. And while many of these companies have too many people riding scooters, they aren't toddlers.  Her description of ""sandboxes"" sounds more like quicksand. It's dangerous. In my view, it doesn't accurately reflect what market participants need or desire — and it doesn't accurately represent what governments are implementing around the world.  Bad nomenclature  I've come to the conclusion that the term ""sandboxes"" is a bad one. It reinforces the visual that Vullo portrays in her speech and it portends a lack of seriousness that is needed when discussing about financial services.  I have stolen the term ""Greenhouse"" from Rob Morgan and my former colleagues at the American Bankers Association. I think it more accurately represents what is being attempted. Namely, it's a place that financial technology solutions can be safely seeded, fed, and controlled.  Those that grow to potential are moved to the real world. Those that fail are filled in with new seeds. And the weeds are cut down.  Fundamentally, these greenhouses aim to relieve the tension between innovation and technology. As technology has (for the most part) finished its disruption of unregulated industries, it has now moved on to the regulated ones.  Testing is inherently necessary for the development of good technology. Disallowing it inhibits innovation, increases the chance of poor technology, and pushes innovators into gray areas that provide little or no transparency for regulators and makes fulfilling their mandate more difficult.  Rather than a ""trust but verify"" model whereby the regulator accepts an application, allows the business to operate, and checks compliance after operations begin, a greenhouse allows for the solution to be examined in real time.  A few months ago, the UK Financial Conduct Authority published a report detailing its ""lessons learned"" from experiences over the past several years.  There are certainly problems in the implementation and execution of such programs: Jackson Mueller of the Milken Institute has opined on some of these issues, which include: picking winners and losers, maintaining fairness, finding solutions that actually need such a construct in order to do testing, etc.  Primarily, however, it appears the exercise promotes a two-way conversation between regulators and industry, forces government to make guidance easier to find and understand, and helps companies lower the cost of compliance or quickly pivot away from solutions that might not work, avoiding the waste of time and precious investment dollars.  These are all things we should be promoting. No matter what we call it.

42429310,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxTTh,1530496810,'Secret Contracts' Developer Engima Launches Test Blockchain,"A built-from-scratch blockchain aiming to enable private contracts between users has officially entered testing.  Announced Saturday  , the news marks the latest step in a journey for startup Engima to launch its own technology – developed at the MIT Media Lab, the project is based on a white paper published in 2015. Initially aimed at the hedge fund sector, Enigma now brands itself as a protocol for ""secret contracts,"" which it demonstrated last month at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 event.  As such, the announcement means that the technology, a form of modified smart contracts designed to obfuscate the origin of a transaction, as well as allow a blockchain to compute contracts without decrypting them, is now closer to real-world use.  However, in remarks, project leaders were quick to caution expectations.  Stressing the novel nature of the technology, they wrote:  ""We acknowledge that development of these types of innovative technologies is non-linear and an ongoing, iterative process. We're not simply forking an existing platform – we're building something completely new and essential, something that will take (and has taken) many people and many days and nights to build.""  Still, signs are others are beginning to take an interest in the technology, even at this early stage.  Earlier this month, Enigma announced it was working with technology giant Intel to further develop its platform, as well as applications to run on the protocol.  After the testnet launch, Enigma plans to prepare for a mainnet launch within the next three months, according to its roadmap.
