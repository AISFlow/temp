42426977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyEBh,1469223881,"Moody's Clients Working on 120 Blockchain Projects, Report Shows","As many as 120 blockchain-related projects are being undertaken by governments and companies rated by credit agency Moody’s, new data shows.  Many of the projects have been publicly disclosed, and the report cites initiatives like the Hyperledger Projects as well as both regional and global finance consortiums as major drivers of issuer participation. A number of public sector initiatives are also cited.  The report  also centered on smaller, more focused initiatives, including one by Allianz that saw the creation of a prototype for handling the trade of catastrophe swaps and bonds.  Other items included the calculation aren't so certain, however.  The report cites work by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the Chinese central bank, to explore the development of an electronic currency. Though a blockchain-based digital currency is believed to be under consideration, signs indicate that the PBoC might ultimately look to other technologies.  That said, it’s too early to say what shape this or other central bank projects might take.  For its part, the credit agency argued that in spite of the activity among financials around the world, shortcomings remain.  ""There is significant enthusiasm for the potential of the technology, but there is still a limited track record of large-scale blockchain implementation in a regulated environment, and many hurdles lie ahead before we see widespread applications,"" Robard Williams, an SVP for Moody’s said in a statement.

42426978,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyEFh,1469221380,Ether Withdrawals Slow as Millions in DAO Funds Remain Unclaimed,"Millions of dollars worth of ether remain unclaimed from a smart contract established for the purpose of allowing investors in The DAO to recover funds compromised in the project's demise.  Of the 11.6m ETH moved to the contract by way of a change to the underlying ethereum platform's code earlier this week, just over half (about 60%) of the funds, or about 6.85m ETH, have so far been withdrawn.  The remaining 4.75m ETH, worth about $68m at today's USD exchange rate, continues to be available to potential investors. However, the withdrawal rate, at press time, seems to have slowed noticeably.  Within hours of the hard fork more than 40% of the 11.58m ether had been withdrawn, leaving 6.6m in the account, according to figures from CoinDesk. Twenty-four hours later, 5.2m remained.  At press time, roughly 60% of the total funds have been withdrawn, up from 52% observed yesterday.  var embedDeltas={""100"":592,""200"":482,""300"":441,""400"":427,""500"":400,""600"":400,""700"":400,""800"":386,""900"":386,""1000"":386},chart=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-f8dyA""),chartWidth=chart.offsetWidth,applyDelta=embedDeltas[Math.min(1000, Math.max(100*(Math.floor(chartWidth/100)), 100))]||0,newHeight=applyDelta;chart.style.height=newHeight+""px"";  // ]]>  The number of withdrawals seems, at press time, to follow a similar pattern.  More than 5,000 withdrawals were made at the end of the first day funds were available. This was followed by a similarly strong 6,430 withdrawals on 21st June.  However, data from 22nd June suggests just 1,215 contract withdrawals were initiated today.  Should each withdrawal represent a single DAO investor, this would mean that just over 12,500 investors, or half of the roughly 23,500 investors, have so far received funds. It is, however, likely that some investors manage multiple addresses.  Representatives from the ethereum development community state the funds are expected to stay in that account until they are withdrawn.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42427011,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyE7h,1469210440,RBI Calls on Indian Banks to Explore Blockchain,"One of the Reserve Bank of India's deputy governors has encouraged local banks to work with a research outfit previously established by the central bank on blockchain projects.  In a speech during an event at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) on 19th July, Deputy Governor Rama Gandhi said banks should work to develop applications for digital currencies and distributed ledgers.  The speech focused on banking technology more broadly, but according to Gandhi, the IDRBT is an effective means to test possible applications.  He told event attendees:  ""Cloud-based computing, blockchain processing technologies and virtualization of IT systems are a few examples which hold potential for being used in a big way ... Banks and IDRBT can work together to study these, test them out and adapt for best use.""  Gandhi has spoken on the topic in the past, arguing last summer that digital currencies can fuel money laundering efforts during a banking event in India. Deputy governor Subhash Sheoratan Mundra said at the same event that financial institutions should collaborate on use cases.  The Reserve Bank of India has been investigating applications of the technology, including the possible issuance of its own digital currency, since as early as 2014, according to reports at the time.  Central bank governor Raghuram Rajan said later that year that the institution could release its own digital currency, but that such an issuance could take years to undertake if attempted.

42426968,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDrh,1469208034,Bitcoin Developers Warn Ethereum Fork Sets Unsettling Precedent,"The ethereum ecosystem is returning to normalcy following a high-profile hack last month that resulted in nearly $60m worth of investor funds ending up under the control of an unknown group or individual.  The 'theft', as some would label it, was eventually reversed through what's known as a hard fork, a change in the code, 'approved' by an informal community vote, that effectively moved the disputed funds to a new account where investors could withdraw their original investments.  But while the immediate impact was limited to the ethereum platform, the implications of its decisions have echoed across the blockchain community, influencing everyone from already ardent ethereum developers to bank consultants seeking to build private blockchain solutions.  Joining this larger discussion have been bitcoin's software developers, many of whom have publicly claimed that ethereum's decisions not only permanently alter the value propositions of its platform, but have generated negative publicity that could harm all blockchain applications.  Unlike traditional database technology, one of the distinguishing features of a blockchain is that its ledger of transactions is distributed among all users, which gives participants involved the confidence of knowing they’re using the same record of credits and debits.  But these developers and infrastructure architects are growing increasingly concerned that now that ethereum has set a precedent for consensus formation based on the leadership of individuals, other blockchains might be compelled by regulators to make additional changes.  Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd told CoinDesk:  ""This is potentially a very negative thing for bitcoin because it sets a precedent that an option to go deal with one of these failures is to go reset the chain, reverse things, and so on. It really calls into question the immutabilty of all these systems.""  The self-fulfilling prophecy  Todd isn’t alone with his concerns.  Fellow bitcoin developer Eric Lombrozo is also troubled that the ease with which the ethereum blockchain was forked might be seen as evidence by investors and regulators that other forks might be possible given the right motivation.  In the case of ethereum, Lombrozo, an early contributor to the ethereum project as well, argues that the democratic process by which consensus was achieved was more of a plurality because so few people voted.  Indeed, a minority of ethereum users continue to mine the original chain, under the prior consensus rules, an advent some say points to the difficulty inherent in digital consensus, and that some have used to question whether distributed ledgers are even ledgers at all, given that they are susceptible to revision by social forces.  Lombrozo contends that Vitalik Buterin and other influential voices in the ethereum community would have been able to elicit any decision they wanted from voters.  The decision to hard fork in this way, Lombrozo said, was ultimately wasn't surprising.  ""It's possible for a small group to economically coerce others to either not vote or vote against their long-term political interests,"" he said.  He later indicated that it wasn't the hard fork, but the method in which it was executed that was the issue, likening it to a bailout of funds that goes against the fundamental principles the underly the bitcoin network.  He said:  ""Even if we could do this stuff without a hard fork it would be unthinkable in bitcoin.""  Setting a precedent  Such a top-down structure of influence is one that Coin Sciences founder Gideon Greenspan is concerned could ultimately lead to struggles within digital currency as an investment vehicle.  Greenspan is currently working to construct an open platform for building, managing and deploying blockchains, and he is concerned that if ethereum contracts become a ""popular investment vehicle"" in the future, the precedent could lead to ""endless contention further down the line"".  He added:  ""My personal view is that it's the wrong decision for the long term. It has created the expectation that a bail-out can and will happen again in future, perhaps the next time a popular smart contract doesn't work as expected.""  Such statements echo those made by Buterin, who stated that the community must now be cognizant of the expectations the hard fork sets with users.  Bitcoin's fork history  The question of whether bitcoin has ever executed a hard forked intentionally remains a matter of deep debate in the community.  An unintentional hard fork occurred in March 2013, that was later revised through efforts by the community. Further, there is debate about whether any hard forks were executed by bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days of bitcoin, prior to bitcoins having any market value.  Todd distinguishes between early bitcoin hard forks and the etheruem hard fork on Wednesday because of the amount of money involved in the projects when the splits occurred.  Whereas ethereum had a market cap of about $1bn at the time, with more than 10% of that locked up in The DAO, bitcoin’s hard forks occurred under very different conditions, he said.  ""Back then, the market cap of bitcoin was zero,"" said Todd, adding:  ""When you don’t have any money on the line you can do anything and it doesn’t matter.""  An opportunity to learn  The concern of the Bitcoin Core developers is perhaps not surprising, given the implicit competition between blockchains for adopters, even if multiple blockchains end up coexisting.  One influential observer of digital currency, Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer, told CoinDesk the mood is ""generally quite positive"" in the ethereum community following the hard fork. Speaking from an ethereum developers conference he's currently co-hosting, he said that the ability of a community using a blockchain to come to consensus was a sign of strength.  An outspoken critic of The DAO, which he blames for releasing unvetted code for public use, Gün Sirer sees the hardfork as a learning opportunity.  ""There are a lot of lessons to learn from this, and not just for ethereum,"" he said. ""In fact, not at all just for smart contracts and the ethereum system, but for bitcoin, there are lots of lessons.""  In particular, he cites the longstanding ethereum bounty offered to coders who help debug the network as a lesson bitcoin developers can learn from.  ""Every coin without a bounty is vulnerable, and I don’t know that bitcoin has one,"" he said. ""So they are very, very confident, quite cavalier, in their abilities and don’t seem to have established a bounty.""  Damned if you do...  Another bitcoin supporter took a different stance while still expressing concerns over the potential impact of the hard fork on bitcoin.  Principal architect of bitcoin sidechain startup Blockstream, Christopher Allen joined both Todd and Lombrozo in saying that the decision to hard fork was made in what the ethereum community seems to agree was in its best interests and that ""every answer had risks associated with it"".  But he added that if the hard fork hadn’t been implemented it would have likely resulted in regulatory involvement that would impact all digital currencies.  Even after expressing some support for the decision he doubled-down on similar concerns that the hard fork could have long-standing repercussions elsewhere in the industry.  Allen concluded:  ""It affects us either way. Lets say that they didn’t do anything and everybody lost all their money and the attacker managed to sneak out the money he illicitly earned, it would raise a lot of questions by regulation and other people, and that could potentially reflect poorly on bitcoin.""  Correction: There remains contention surrounding whether a 'hard fork' has ever been intentionally executed on the bitcoin blockchain. CoinDesk has revised language to better illustrate this debate.

42426962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDhh,1469199426,"So, You Want to Use a Blockchain for That?","Antony Lewis is a bitcoin and blockchain consultant and blogger, who previously served as the director of business development at bitcoin exchange itBit.  In this article, Lewis attempts to break down some of the more misunderstood questions circulating among institutions seeking to adapt distributed blockchain tech for alternative uses.  There are good reasons and bad reasons to use blockchains.  In conversations with people considering blockchain use cases, I have noticed common confusions arising from certain words. At issue, is that they were initially used in a narrow context (usually to describe bitcoin's blockchain), and are now being interpreted more generically for other blockchains, in cases where they may no longer apply.  In this post, I hope to untangle some of these common misconceptions.  Theme: Blockchains are secure  Writing data  Bitcoin has specific security features for writing data due to the burden of proof-of-work consensus. That is, in order to add blocks of transactions to the blockchain, you have to validate all the transactions within the block (easy) and then perform repeated calculations (called hashing) to find a magic number that makes your block valid and acceptable to the other participants according to the rules of the network (easy, but computationally expensive, therefore energy intensive, therefore expensive). This proof-of-work burden combined with the longest chain rule makes it expensive to mine your own subversive chain.  Private blockchains on the other hand, with known block validators, may have other mechanisms replacing proof-of-work that limit the ability of others to subvert the chain.  These rules can specify that blocks need to be signed by a limited, known list of signatories. The round-robin fashion by which entities take it in turns to write blocks is enough to discourage or limit unilateral bad behavior.  Reading data  Bitcoin, and blockchains, do not have inherent security against read access. Indeed, blockchains are mechanisms for copying data to all relevant participants – this is what consensus is all about.  If you think you have cybersecurity headaches controlling read-access to one central database, then multiply that by the number of nodes in your blockchain to get the new attack surface area of your blockchain.  You can control read-access to some degree by encrypting certain elements on your blockchain and handing out the keys to the relevant participant. But, consider the threat of industrial espionage where keys are sold to a rival organization who also runs a node – now the rival can read your data without even penetrating your system, because the blockchain is copying the data right into his data centre!  There may be solutions here involving key-rotation, but historical data also needs considering. The value of the third party is that they can control access to the data more finely. They also provide a single entity to litigate against if they expose private data or they breach their contractual obligations.  Denial of service  Blockchains are more resilient than centralised systems against denial-of-service attacks, due to their peer-to-peer, multi-redundant nature. If one node is taken offline, the others keep working.  Users connected to the disabled node will be unable to connect, unless there is a mechanism in place for them to find other nodes to fall back to.  Theme: Blockchains are encrypted  There can be confusion between the cryptographic methods used in bitcoin (hashing, digital signatures) and data on blockchains being encrypted (data stored as cyphertext).  This can lead people to think that data on a blockchain is by default encrypted.  In fact, data on blockchains is by default unencrypted, especially data that needs to be validated by the nodes. In bitcoin, transaction data is not encrypted, as you can see by looking at any transaction in bitcoin's blockchain. (For a deeper explanation of the specific elements in a bitcoin transaction, see here).  The most apparent problem with encrypting data on a blockchain is that the encrypted data can’t be validated, because nodes need to know what they are validating.  For example, if I am validating the legitimacy of your payment of 2 BTC from your wallet, I need to know the contents of your wallet (ie your previous inbound transactions) and the fact that you are trying to spend 2 BTC (and which ones).  In a private chain, if all validating nodes can decrypt your data by having decryption keys, then you need to consider why you are encrypting it in the first place.  There are solutions emerging from primary cryptographic research that allow for facts to be proven about data without knowing the underlying data itself, known as zero-knowledge proofs, but this technology is not currently mature.  If privacy is important, then consider what needs to be encrypted: All data at rest? Data in motion? The whole database? Data within specific database fields? And who will be able to decrypt it and when? How will permissions be granted? Can permissions be revoked? What happens if a third party gets a decryption key through a rogue staff member? What happens if a legitimate user loses a decryption key?  Key management is a crucial part of data security – even more so when the data is freely shared between (usually) competitors in an industry, and it needs to be carefully considered in a blockchain solution.  Theme: Using a blockchain allows better access to data  Many existing centralised solutions already do an excellent job of allowing access to data, with carefully controlled read and write access, and also a layer of accountability on the central owner of the data who can react to either moral imperatives or legal directives.  Facebook, for instance, is quite accessible globally, and it can take down hate speech or copyrighted material.  Blockchains can make access control to data more complex, and immutability is not without its downsides. In many potential use cases, nodes are run by a separate entities or groups (if they’re not, then consider why you’re using a blockchain in the first place), and each entity controls and manages its own access control to the data.  There may be challenges around managing access control across all entities that have a copy of the blockchain data.  Theme: This blockchain allows end users to do [x] peer-to-peer without a middleman  This narrative seems to have come from bitcoin’s whitepaper, which describes the purpose of bitcoin to allow people to send digital cash from person to person without a specific financial intermediary.  If you count the miner adding the block as an intermediary who collects fees and rewards for his work, then there are intermediaries in bitcoin. But, the point is that they are not specific (one miner can substitute for another), and you are not beholden to a specific miner for your transactions to work or not.  For many private blockchains currently being described in industry, there are middlemen – these are the participants running the nodes, or the technology vendors clipping tickets to monetize their blockchain solutions.  Theme: Users will run their own blockchains on their phones  I have occasionally heard ideas where users need to store blockchain data on their phones (especially for use cases where users should own their own data).  Beware the mobile phone blockchain, as it implies that the phone will be constantly chatting to the rest of the network, downloading and uploading other people’s data non-stop to remain in consensus.  Theme: The blockchain will be an immutable record of all events  In bitcoin, where old transactions need to be tracked in order to figure out the validity of new transactions, this is the case.  It is also the case that a bitcoin transaction only ""happens"" or settles if it is broadcast to the bitcoin network and is accepted into a block. Each event in bitcoin is a necessary event to build up the picture of the state of the ledger.  This does not mean that if you throw a blockchain at a random problem, you will immediately accurately capture every single event.  Events need to be input by someone or something and then broadcast and accepted for them to be recorded.  Data on a blockchain doesn’t imply accuracy – events need to be recorded accurately in the first place. This is even more important when the record may be immutable.  Theme: Because it’s on a blockchain, it’s true  This is a confusion around use of the word ""true"".  In bitcoin, ""true"" means that the network has agreed that a transaction has taken place, and nodes are in agreement or consensus that this has happened.  The concept of ""truth"" as applied to blockchains doesn’t extend to other meanings of ""true"". If a heart-monitoring piece of hardware becomes faulty and records incorrect heart-rate readings onto a blockchain, do the readings become truth? Clearly not.  On a registry of car ownership, a blockchain may immutably record that a car has changed owner. If this transaction was made in error or fraudulently due to a hacking of the owner’s phone, what is the state of the truth? If the transaction was found to be fraudulent by the police and needs to be ‘unwound’, then how will that be done, given the cryptographic security of digital signatures? (There are solutions, but they just need to be thought through).  In the case of blockchains, truth just means ""what was originally recorded and agreed as valid by the majority of the nodes"".  Valid doesn’t necessarily mean true. Don’t confuse blockchain truth with ""The Truth"". For a trivial but concrete example of an immutable lie on multiple levels, see here.  Theme: Data stored on a blockchain  This is prevalent in the blockchains-for-KYC and blockchains-for-document-storage space.  Comments such as 'This is stored on the blockchain' can cause confusion when a hash of a document (PDF, JPEG, etc) is published to a blockchain. A hash is not an encrypted version of an original file; and when a hash is stored, you can’t retrieve the original by decrypting the hash. The hash of a fingerprint of the data, and if it is stored on a blockchain, someone who has kept an exact copy of that data (off chain) can prove that that specific data existed at the timestamp when the hash was stored on the blockchain.  While you can store whole documents on blockchains (after all a blockchain is just a database coupled with software that validates and shares new entries to the other participants), passing large chunks of data around at speed can create its own set of problems.  Theme: Participants to a blockchain  There can be confusion when the word ""participants"" is used.  Generally speaking, there are three main types of participants to blockchains:  Participants who write blocks (in bitcoin, these are called miners and they crunch numbers)  Participants who maintain the entire blockchain and validate and propagate new entries (in bitcoin, these are generally called 'full nodes')  Participants who are the end users of the functionality of the blockchain, usually accessing the blockchain by connecting to a full node (in bitcoin, these are generally called users)  It may be best to always spell out exactly which participants are being referred to.  Theme: Well, what should I use a blockchain for?  Blockchains are great when multiple parties need to read the same information, but for whatever reason there can’t be or shouldn’t be any specific individual party in control of that data.  Gideon Greenspan has written a great article about avoiding the pointless blockchain project, and later described some genuine use cases in a follow-up post.  Theme: If I use the word ‘blockchain’ I can get budget  Go for it!  The only way the technology will improve is by people trying it and adapting it to fit problems better.  Try to understand and be aware of the limitations and complexities early and be careful about over-fitting a trendy technical solution to a problem.
