42398003,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAFD,1414101331,Sidechains White Paper Imagines New Future for Digital Currency Development,"A group of bitcoin core developers and cryptographic technology experts have released a new proposal that could reshape the digital currency ecosystem if implemented.  The sidechains concept has long been argued as a solution to what many see as a volatile and self-damaging sector of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Described by some as the ""altcoin killer"", sidechains allow for the creation of multi-block chain ecosystems in which assets can be exchanged and transferred.  The paper's authors consist of a broad team of digital currency researchers and developers – including Adam Back, Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, Andrew Miller and Gregory Maxwell. Several members of the authorship team are co-founders of digital currency startup Blockstream, which provided support for the project and is in the process of raising millions as part of a major funding round.  If instituted, the sidechains concept would allow assets to be exchanged across multiple block chains, with bitcoin serving as the likely ""parent chain"", according to the paper, which was released on 22nd October.  But unlike the current means of acquiring the assets of an alternative block chain – purchasing altcoins on an exchange – bitcoins swapped with a sidechain's assets wouldn't necessarily be subject to the frequent price fluctuations inherent in the altcoin market. If one transferred their bitcoins to a sidechain's asset, it would still hold the value of a bitcoin because of a two-way peg linking the block chains.  The authors propose:  ""Conceptually, we would like to transfer an asset from the (original) parent chain to a sidechain, possibly onward to another sidechain, and eventually back to the parent chain, preserving the original asset. Generally we can think of the parent chain as being bitcoin and the sidechain as one of many other block chains. Of course, sidechain coins could be transferred between sidechains, not just to and from Bitcoin; however, since any coin originally moved from bitcoin could be moved back, it would nonetheless remain a bitcoin.""  Paper cites need for change  Sidechains represent a restructuring of bitcoin's infrastructure that could take years to implement, given the consensus- and experimentation-driven nature of core development.  Yet in the white paper, the authors argue that if bitcoin is going to succeed in the long-term, there need to be solutions brought to the table that address long-standing concerns regarding scalability and capability. Rising usage and global attention has shined a light on the weaknesses in bitcoin's design, they write, requiring innovations that push the technology even further.  The altcoin market, the paper continues, became the effective laboratory for new ideas to be developed. It cites structural and behavioral weaknesses including opaque code development, speculative market fluctuations and the risk of manipulation as reasons why technical innovations arising from the space are few in number and often tied to driving speculation.  ""This is dangerous not only to those directly participating in these systems, but also to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,"" the authors say.  In order to counteract these problems, the paper continues, a system of ""interoperable block chains"" known as pegged sidechains could be established that enables development outside of bitcoin but without the need to generate and support a new currency. This new infrastructure, the authors say, would allow much of the same activity you see today in the altcoin market.  The paper explains:  ""Because sidechains are still block chains independent of bitcoin, they are free to experiment with new transaction designs, trust models, economic models, asset issuance semantics, or cryptographic features.""  Infrastructure overhaul  The infrastructure envisioned by the sidechains development team is a multi-block chain network in which digital assets can be created and exchanged while still remaining tied to the value of a bitcoin.  Pegged block chains would be connected to one another via special outputs that receive proofs certifying that a designated amount of bitcoin is being exchanged for the asset native to that sidechain. The two-way peg maintains the value between those assets, basing it on whichever parent chain is established.  Transactions initiated between chains would be subject to what the authors call a contest period, during which the exchange may be invalidated if there is network consensus that the original proof is fraudulent.  The authors suggest two potential implementations – symmetric and asymmetric two-way pegs – which envision different ways for parent and sidechains to validate one another.  With a symmetric peg, each chain would require proof validation when exchanging between chains. An asymmetric latter peg means that proofs are only required when transferring back to the parent chain. The paper notes that the latter concept carries security risks and, in later discussion, refers primarily to the symmetric two-way peg.  The concept also calls for a firewall to be instituted for the parent chain. This, the authors say, would protect the basis of value for the chain ecosystem and those taking part in the system.  Smart applications  If implemented, sidechains would allow for smart transaction functions being developed today under the crypto 2.0 umbrella, but without tying those actions to the bitcoin block chain or relying on the stable value of an asset unpegged to bitcoin.  Further, sidechains could create and issue assets that are transferable across multiple chains. As the authors explain:  ""To this point, we have mostly been thinking about sidechains which do not need their own native currency: all coins on the sidechain are initially locked, until they are activated by a transfer from some other sidechain. However, it is possible for sidechains to produce their own tokens, or issued assets, which carry their own semantics. These can be transferred to other sidechains and traded for other assets and currencies, all without trusting a central party, even if a trusted party is needed for future redemption.""  These assets can be used like those found on existing platforms such as Counterparty, Mastercoin and others – to represent contracts, claims or IOUs – and exist alongside whichever native currency is linked back to the parent chain.  Mining centralization, fraud risks  Putting sidechains in place wouldn't be a risk-free process, however.  According to the paper, the implementation of sidechains may require the need for merge mining, a process by which miners provide 'proof of work' to multiple coin networks, thus certifying transactions. Otherwise, miners would have to choose which chain to support, thus creating potential security headaches.  The authors acknowledge the risk of centralization that would arise from this kind of mining ecosystem, as miners would bear the operation cost of supporting multiple chains. They add that this arrangement could result in competitive pressure on small-scale miners, saying:  ""Smaller-scale miners may be unable to afford the full costs to mine every block chain, and could thus be put at a disadvantage compared to larger, established miners who are able to claim greater compensation from a larger set of block chains.""  The paper also identifies risks of fraudulent transactions across sidechains and the potential impact on both associated sidechains and the parent chain itself. Though stating the unlikelihood of these given the ability to create built-in security mechanisms, the authors outline the ways in which a potential 'chain run' could be launched or coin supply imbalances created during cross-chain transfers.  Community reacts  Since its release yesterday, the white paper has jumpstarted the public conversation surrounding the sidechains concept. A Reddit AMA hosted by the sidechains team included questions about the nature of the project, the intended goals and those supporting it, and a number of well-known developers in the space have weighed in on social media.  Supporters of the idea, which has been subject to significant debate among bitcoin developers and community members in posts on Reddit and discussions on IRC, say the proposal would still enable much of the experimentation and innovative projects present in the altcoin market today. Critics say that the implicit support of centralization sets a dangerous precedent and carries both short- and long-term risks for digital currency development.  In the Reddit AMA, Wuille remarked that ultimately, the goal is to create a means for developers to experiment with block chain technology while avoiding the pitfalls associated with the altcoin market.  ""What we hope to accomplish is allow more innovation in the bitcoin ecosystem, without needing a different currency,"" he said.

42398008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAK8,1414099509,Payments Veterans Discuss Bitcoin vs Apple Pay at NY Law Conference,"The buzz surrounding Apple Pay may have initially startled some bitcoin enthusiasts, but industry experts continue to speak out on why the latest mobile payments solution is only passively interesting.  At the Bitcoin Law conference, an event held at New York Law School this Tuesday, American Express VP and senior counsel Emily Goodman Binick called Apple Pay exciting because it will lead more consumers to make purchases with their phones.  A common perspective that emerged is that while Apple Pay is not exactly innovative, it will encourage mainstream consumers to embrace mobile payments – a step that needs to take place if bitcoin will ever be more broadly adopted as a currency.  “I don’t think it’s ultimately going to be that transformative from a fees perspective or that it has the same transformative opportunities as bitcoin,” Binick said. “It’s just another player in the value chain rather than eliminating folks from the value chain.”  The conference assembled a number of legal experts in bitcoin and payments for a morning of discussion on the regulatory outlook for digital currencies.  Organized by New York Law professor Houman Shadab, who has been a leader in the field for the bitcoin community, the event also discussed banking and compliance challenges facing the industry.  Overlapping demographics  CoinComply  managing director Brian Stoeckert reiterated the importance of acquainting the general public with mobile payments, as well. In his remarks, he emphasized that younger consumers will be the most likely target for both bitcoin and Apple Pay, as this demographic is general quicker to adopt digital technology.  Stoeckert said that, at some point, bitcoin could even power products like Apple Pay, but that for now, Apple's product will do a lot to further the adoption of mobile payments.  “It’s accelerating moving your traditional wallet over to your smartphone at the end of the day,” he said. “If it does in fact take off, it’s going to help mass adopt more use of cellular technology and smartphone applications for day-to-day use.”  He went on to note that most young people today are comfortable conducting financial activities online – they use mobile banking apps and websites, for example, to see the status of a paycheck that’s been directly deposited into their bank accounts.  Binick said that from a practical perspective, there hasn’t really been a consumer value proposition for paying with a phone.  She said:  “It doesn’t seem any easier. So, I think that’s exciting, I’m looking forward to seeing how this is tested. […] Ultimately, I don't see Apple Pay disintermediating … I think it’s a good thing but because there’s just another person taking a piece of the pie, Apple is not going to help us much.”  Marketing and scale  To Binick’s point, Brian Koffler, president of Koffler Legal & Consulting Services, raised the fact that Apple Pay isn’t the first payments solution from a major tech giant, citing others before it like Google Wallet and Visa Checkout – products that never became highly adopted but show that the technology has existed.  It’s a public relations issue more than anything else, according to him, and the same issue affects bitcoin.  Koffler said:  “This point really highlights the impact of marketing and public relations in financial services and bitcoin generally. […] Apple’s an excellent marketing company, they packaged it in a nice package and I think people are going to start using it more.”  Jerry Brito  , executive director of nonprofit research and advocacy center Coin Center added that there’s also a case to be made for the scale of Apple’s business. The reason other payments solutions haven’t taken off the way Apple Pay could is that they’re “small and fragmented”, he asserted.  “Everybody’s got their own solution,” he said. “Apple, because it’s such a huge integrated company has the scale to … sign up all the banks, all the credit card networks and turn it on in the same day.”  If anything, Brito concluded, Apple Pay will get people use to paying with their phones – and that’s going to be good for bitcoin.

42398005,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAHB,1414094731,Mercator Report Finds Conflicting Bitcoin Regulation Harmful to Industry,"Mercator Advisory Group has published a research note on global bitcoin regulation, making it the latest established name in the financial industry to release a report on bitcoin.  The note, titled 'Global Digital Currency Regulations: Divergent Paths', examined trends in digital currency regulation and concluded that industry development is currently hampered by a lack of regulatory consistency.  “The global payments industry has been taken aback by the rise of the new payment technology represented by bitcoin and other digital currencies, which at its core has the potential to radically change the paradigm in which electronic payments are handled,"" the report read.  However, the author warns that the response to digital currencies among regulators has been mixed, as true understanding of the benefits, opportunities and disadvantages of the technology is still lacking.  Mercator Advisory Group  is an established advisory and consultancy firm in the financial industry that specializes in payments and banking analysis. The group began studying block chain technology earlier this year and this is its first report on subject.  A second research note, focused on remittances, is already in the works.  Regulation hampered by confusion  In an interview with CoinDesk, Tristan Hugo-Webb, associate director of the group's International Advisory Service, and the author of the research note, discussed the group's findings and forecasts.  Tristan said he was surprised by the spectrum of regulatory proposals issued by various jurisdictions around the globe. Financial regulators tend to be evenhanded when crafting policies, he said, but consistency is lacking in digital currency regulatory frameworks.  ""In general, payment regulation tends to be copycat,"" said Tristan. ""You will usually see countries following other countries.""  However, that is still not the case in the digital currency space, as different jurisdictions tend to propose divergent solutions. Hugo-Webb thinks it will take a ""couple of years"" before we see governments understanding the benefits of digital currency. He added that more consistency will be possible once regulators fully understand digital currency technology, but that this may take a while to achieve.  ""If you were to talk to regulators, I bet you not many of them would understand how bitcoin works,"" Hugo-Webb said.  Divergent approach to regulation  Hugo-Webb attributes much of the confusion in regulatory circles to a lack of understanding and experience with the technology. Therefore he does not expect a lot of progress on the regulatory front in the short term.  He believes some jurisdictions will be in a better position to pass favorable regulation, however. Europe could potentially benefit from EU-wide rules, argued Hugo-Webb, but relatively small jurisdictions could decide to embrace digital currencies – with the Isle of Man as a good example.  ""It all depends on what sort of regulation emerges. From how I see it, there are five categories that have come up so far,"" said Hugo-Webb.  Jurisdictions that actively promote digital currency, like the Isle of Man and to some extent Ecuador, are in the first category. The second category is reserved for jurisdictions that choose to tax bitcoin transactions, while jurisdictions with transaction reporting requirements make up the third category. The fourth category includes jurisdictions that have issued public warnings about digital currency, but stopped short of taking any action on the regulatory front. Jurisdictions openly hostile to digital currency, like Russia and Bangladesh, belong in the fifth category.  Hugo-Webb expects most countries will eventually become more open to digital currency:  ""I really think that over time we will see more countries move from having a neutral stance toward embracing digital currency one way or the other. The future of digital currency is bright. It will take time, but digital currency has a place. It is not going to be a fad that fades out over the next few years.""  Hugo-Webb pointed out that Mercator is not interested solely in bitcoin, which he described as a first-generation cryptocurrency, but in digital currency technology in general.  Competitiveness and adoption  The varied approach to regulation also makes some jurisdictions more competitive than others, as digital currency companies are more likely to incorporate in areas with a clear regulatory framework. The question of compliance costs cannot be ignored, as inadequate or burdensome regulation could render digital currency less competitive.  ""It is going to face compliance costs, it is going to face pressure from the payments industry, which will demand a level playing field,"" Hugo-Webb argued.  However, properly regulated digital currency services will gain, too, as companies operating in reputable jurisdictions with effective regulation will benefit from higher levels of consumer trust, thus attracting more business and offsetting compliance costs.  Hugo-Webb found that the financial industry remains divided into two distinct camps – companies that do not want to have anything to do with digital currency due to reputational risk concerns and companies willing to explore the new technology as a way of cuttings costs.  As far as the financial industry is concerned, digital currency remains a divisive issue and Mercator does not expect this to change anytime soon.

42398017,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFATy,1414090229,Blockstream SEC Filing Reveals $15 Million Raised in Funding Round,"UPDATE (24th October 10:02 BST): Chief executive Austin Hill originally told CoinDesk that Blockstream's SEC filing was an ""incomplete and inaccurate notice"". He has since clarified that the SEC filing is complete and accurate, but does not ""portray the whole picture"" at this point in the company's fundraising process. This article has been updated accordingly.      Blockstream has raised at least $15.18m toward a major funding round expected to close in the coming weeks, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.  The filing also shows that Reid Hoffman, a partner at venture firm Greylock Partners and co-founder of LinkedIn, will take a seat on the startup's board of directors.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Blockstream chief executive Austin Hill stressed that the funding round is still open and that it will close this week. He declined to provide more details until the fundraising round is complete.  The SEC filing is dated 1st October and signed by Blockstream's chief financial officer Hammie Hill, but the CEO implied that its contents may be deficient, saying:  ""The SEC filing doesn't accurately portray the whole picture of our fundraising at this point in the process.""  Despite Hoffman's presence on Blockstream's board, he said Greylock is not participating in this fundraising round.  Hoffman currently sits on the boards of Airbnb, Swipely, Kiva and Mozilla Corporation. He has been a director at mobile gaming giant Zynga and payments pioneer PayPal.  Form D is a disclosure form used by companies that raise funds without receiving prior approval from the SEC. Businesses that do so are required to file a Form D within 15 days of their first security issuance.  Blockstream's mission  After months of relative silence, the Canada-based company has entered into the industry conversation following the Wednesday release of a white paper that proposed a new way of transferring assets across multiple block chains. The much-hyped work was supported in part by Blockstream, a company founded by several of the paper's authors, though it builds on past proposals.  The executive team will also include Hill, former HashCash developer Adam Back, Osler and Hoskin & Harcourt LLP managing partner Shahir Guindi, and Zero-Knowledge Systems co-founder Hammie Hill, the document states.  Blocksteam has long been an anticipated project in the bitcoin community due to Austin Hill's background. The founder of anonymous networking and privacy technology Zero-Knowledge Systems, he raised more than $80m for the project in the late 1990s. Current Blockstream executives Hammie Hill and Guindi were also involved with the company.  Blockstream further boasts a team of veteran developers on its staff, including Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell, Jonathan Wilkins, Matt Corallo and Pieter Wuille, Freicoin project leader Jorge Timon, and former NASA engineer Mark Friedenbach.  Publicly, the company has been less visible, with Austin Hill notably pulling out of a speaking slot at The North American Bitcoin Conference in July, at the time, giving only a humorous response on Twitter to explain his absence.  Divisive entrance  Aside from the debate surrounding the sidechains white paper, Blockstream itself has also sparked conversation on Reddit regarding how block chain technologies should be funded and developed.  Some commentators, for example, have taken issue with the company's market strategy, which seemingly seeks to use a for-profit model to fund sidechain development. Bitcoin Core development, by contrast, is managed by both the Bitcoin Foundation and developers employed at major bitcoin companies like Blockchain and BitPay.  Detractors allege that Blockstream is a potential threat to bitcoin's decentralized nature, with others praising it as a necessary step given the concerns that bitcoin's core technology has suffered from a lack of well-funded developers.  At press time, representatives from Blockstream have not responded to further requests for comment.  Stan Higgins and Joon Ian Wong contributed reporting.

42398006,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAIA,1414076800,"Saxo Bank Event Panel: Block Chain Intriguing, Bitcoin a Fad","Bitcoin was labelled a ""fad"" yet also ""interesting"" in a panel discussion at Saxo Bank's Trading Debates event in central London yesterday.  Held in the British Library, the event was attended by more than 300 people from the world of traditional finance, including bankers, traders and other financial services professionals.  The panel discussion Fintech Boom – An Opportunity or a Threat for Financial Services? was moderated by Anna Irrera, trading and technology reporter at Financial News.  Panellist Javier Tordable, senior vice president at German derivatives exchange Eurex Exchange, tentatively labelled bitcoin a ""fad"" before clarifying he doesn't think much of it as an alternative currency, but believes in it as a method of storing and sharing data.  ""We are very interested in the technology behind it, the block chain,"" he said.  Tordable said he was very much interested in the idea of storing data in a ""multi-channel"" or distributed manner, rather than trusting one source to store it.  Also on the panel were Gerald Brady, managing director at Silicon Valley Bank; Ian Morgan, director of financial services sector at Google UK; Peter Randall, consultant at Social Stock Exchange Ltd; and Matteo Cassina, head of business lines at Saxo Bank.  Click below to view images from Saxo Bank's Trading Debates event and the British Museum's display on bitcoin:  Block chain potential  Randall agreed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer something extremely interesting to the world of finance in the form of permanent data storage and tracking.  ""Things like crowdfunding need to have the ability to [track] where assets actually are and the block chain represents an opportunity to do that very, very cheaply and very, very efficiently,"" he said.  While he's not convinced cryptocurrency's current forms necessarily provide the ultimate solution, he does think there are ""elements of the technology that can be used, will be used and are being used to effect solutions to particular problems"".  One of these problems, he explained, is the clearing and settlement of funds and assets – the use of a block chain would enable traders and financiers to record where assets actually are, and have been, at any point in time.  Saxo Bank's Matteo Cassina said he also believes bitcoin is an interesting technology, but he doesn't think it can exist without some form of centralised control. He explained:  ""Ultimately, you will always need to have someone centrally holding the keys to the code, whether it's a central bank as we define it today, or something else. But it will be regulated somehow. Someone will hold the keys and issue them.""  A positive view  This isn't the first time a senior staff member at Saxo Bank has spoken publicly about cryptocurrency.  Back in March, the Danish investment bank's CEO and co-founder Lars Seier Christensen revealed he had bought bitcoins and that his company was exploring the digital currency's potential use. ""I've taken a personal interest in understanding the space better,"" he said.  Christensen went on to say that, while Saxo wasn't looking to ""take the lead"" on getting involved in the bitcoin space, it is ""not dismissing it out of hand for regulatory reasons or other reasons that banks would completely ignore it.""  However, a few months later, he said he believes the main reason banks are steering clear of bitcoin is because of its extreme volatility and lack of liquidity.  None of these issues were touched upon in yesterday's panel discussion, but Randall did suggest those in the existing financial world would be foolish to ignore bitcoin and developments involving block chains.  ""I think there are a whole series of incumbents that have a lot to be thinking about in that space,"" he concluded.  Bitcoin on show  The British Museum was a fitting venue for the event as it currently houses an exhibition on the evolution of money. Earlier this year, the museum added a section about bitcoin to the exhibition.  Among the items featured are a copy of Bitcoin Magazine, a QR code, a paper copy of the bitcoin white paper and a tablet showing information about altcoins and bitcoin price charts.  A member of the museum's team explained the difficulties faced when trying to put together a display on digital currency:  ""I hit the unavoidable question of how do you explain digital currencies with objects? Is it even possible? Objects are at the heart of everything we do in the museum. At present I have […] paper receipts from bitcoin transactions and copies of the Bitcoin Magazine, but am struggling to think of other appropriate physical objects.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/23/saxo-bank-event-panel-block-chain-intriguing-bitcoin-a-fad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4dcfd3778ec67875ed51840fb2c19c3132f1b92-1267x495.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The feature went live yesterday, making CoinCorner one of very few places in the British Isles to accept direct card payments for cryptocurrency. Bittylicious, a similar exchange, launched card payments back in May.  Traditional bank transfer methods are still on offer for users who do not wish to rely on cards to deposit funds with CoinCorner.  Charlie Woolnough, CEO of CoinCorner, told CoinDesk that there are some limitations to the service, however:  ""We accept credit and debit cards that are 3D secure or where the issuing bank is willing to take liability and skip 3D secure. We are working with WalPay to help facilitate this.""

42398015,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAS0,1414065606,Lamassu Partners with IdentityMind to Offer Enhanced ATM Compliance,"Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures has announced a new partnership with e-commerce compliance specialist IdentityMind Global.  First revealed informally on 5th October, the integration with IdentityMind will provide Lamassu bitcoin ATM owners with built-in anti-fraud and know-your-customer (KYC) services, automated suspicious activity report (SAR) filings, sanctions screening and transaction monitoring.  Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey characterized the deal as one way his company is seeking to better respond to ""increasing scrutiny"" from US and international regulators, as well as the recent guidance issued by the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA), a traditional ATM trade association.  Harvey said:  “It has always been important for us not to burden the end-users of our machines with a complicated or intrusive compliance solution. This integration allows us to provide our operators with an affordable and quality solution that fits the Lamassu user experience.”  IdentityMind’s solution will allow Lamassu customers to scan the matrix (2D) barcodes on the back of ID documents, which can then be verified against third-party services.  Since launching last year, Lamassu has emerged as a market leader in the bitcoin ATM space. As of September, 40% of all active machines were made by the company.  Responding to customer needs  The update will likely be welcomed by Lamassu operators, many of whom have gone to lengths to ensure the compliance of their units in the past.  For example, the operator of the first Lamassu installed in the US notably indicated that he needed to supervise all transactions completed on the machine, manually recording customer names and addresses to ensure AML compliance.  By comparison, competitors such as Robocoin and BitAccess have long touted their AML and KYC compliance, although their machines retail at higher price points. Robocoin's two-way physical 'bank branches' retail for $15,000, while Lamassu's standard one-way bitcoin vending machines sell for $6,500.  For customers desiring a two-way option, Lamassu's cash-despensing ATM stand will set them back a further $5,500 – narrowing the price gap between the two companies' products.  Robocoin, Lamassu’s foremost competitor in the market, has also visibly struggled of late, with a number of customers voicing concerns on Reddit in recent weeks about the company’s delivery times and customer relations efforts.  IdentityMind expands  The move is also the latest for IdentityMind, the California-based compliance services company that began extending services to bitcoin businesses this April.  At that time, IdentityMind announced its Ignite product would be available for small bitcoin startups looking for complete compliance-as-a-service solutions, although the company said it had been previously active in the industry’s exchange sector.  IdentityMind president and CEO Garret Gafke suggested that the partnership with Lamassu will allow it to demonstrate the capabilities of its product in yet another vertical.  “This integration provides a great opportunity to showcase the effectiveness of our platform,” he said.  The Ignite product costs $150 a month for a full AML (anti-money laundering) program that includes KYC services and transaction monitoring.
