42428357,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7S9h,1514676021,China on a Blockchain? Maybe in 2018,"Chun Yin Cheung is a partner in PwC China's risk assurance practice, based in the Shanghai office, and a committee member of VeChain Foundation.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review, and represents the author's personal view, not necessarily the opinions of his employer.      In 2018, I forecast China will surprise the world (again) and change the crypto world.  I personally believe in 2018 China will be the first major country to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), and that we will also see a large-scale blockchain implementation in the retail and logistic industry with a blockchain solution developed by Chinese companies.  Now, I'll unpack my predictions.  A Chinese CBDC  Although cryptocurrency exchanges were banned from China in September this year, the country has always taken a positive attitude toward central bank digital currency and blockchain, actively carrying out relevant research.  In Feb. 2016, for example, People's Bank of China (PBOC) president Mr. Zhou Xiaochun admitted during an interview that the Chinese government has been investigating the adoption of CBDC for a long time. On Dec. 27 of that year, blockchain was written into the ""13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization."" The government affirmed the value of blockchain, and it has since risen to the level of our national science and technology strategy.  Technically, China is ready to launch the first CBDC, as the PBOC has set up a dedicated digital currency research group in 2014 to study both digital currency issuance and the business operation framework that would need to support the launch of such technology.  In January 2017, China's central bank successfully tested the digital notes exchange platform.  According to a paper published in Tsinghua Financial Review, a digital currency was used to exchange notes between commercial banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, WeBank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Bank of Hangzhou.  In July, the Central Bank Digital Currency Research Institution officially began operating as a separate business unit within PBOC.  A strategic play  Strategically, the launch of the Chinese CBDC is in line with the Belt and Road Initiative, an integrated upgrade of China's international cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union, China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Area and other areas.  It enables China to exert its geopolitical advantages, and is an important platform for cooperation.  Transactions with digital currency are more efficient and convenient, eliminating the third-party reconciliation and the automated implementation reducing payment costs and error rates. It increases the chances other countries would pay with RMB in transactions, which increases the liquidity and internationalizes the RMB.  From risk management perspective, the Chinese CBDC may first be launched through a pilot program to manage the risk and public expectation. A Chinese CBDC may first be limited to banks for intra-bank transactions so that existing foreign exchange and capital controls can still be imposed without radical changes.  It also avoids the worry that RMB paper notes or metal coins will be abolished (like what India did) and lead to financial instability. The general public and commercial world also needs more time to understand the technology and develop the associated applications.  Business progress  I also expect we will see some high-profile adoptions of blockchain technology in retail and logistic companies.  Startups like VeChain launched the first commercial blockchain platform through which a Chinese state-owned enterprise is now tracking and managing red wine imported from overseas. Customers can use their mobile phones to scan the IoT tags attached to the wine bottles to access to information shared by manufacturers, logistic companies and distributors through blockchain.  We will also see global luxury brands, automobiles and wine manufacturers use blockchain and IoT technologies developed in China to tackle counterfeiting and introduce completely new experiences to customers.  I am also aware that a major Chinese Internet company established a blockchain laboratory last year. In 2018, they plan to launch a blockchain platform to integrate their B2C, B2B, logistic and financial business units so as to share data with their suppliers and business partners.

42428364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7SLh,1514650506,What DAO? Charting Ether's Epic 2017 Price Climb,"For ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum network, 2016 was defined in part by the creation and subsequent collapse of The DAO, the blockchain-based investment vehicle that raised more than $150 million at then-current prices.  Yet as 2017 comes to a close, the cryptocurrency is closing the books on a banner year for its value, having surged from less than $10 one year ago to more than $700 as of press time. Buoyed by the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.  In this article, we look at some of the major market moments seen in the past 12 months, culminating with the cryptocurrency's temporary push above $800.  Slow start  Ether was in a rough spot as 2016 came to a close, dropping to a 7-month low at the beginning of December. That state of affairs continued as the days progressed, though the cryptocurrency's price was above $8 at the start of 2017.  Yet as the chart above shows, the price of ether would slowly but surely, passing above $10 during the first week of January. That trend largely continued, advancing above that level once again two weeks later – a move that represented the last time the global market for ether below that figure.  The watershed moment in that period came in early March, when the price of ether shot above $20. Indeed, that month saw budding interest from institutional investors in the market as well as the announcement that regulators in New York had approved U.S.-based startup Coinbase to begin trading ether in the state.  By the time March came to a close, the price of ether was trading above $50, according to market data.  Up and down we go  By the latter half April, the price of ether was still trending above $40, leading some market observers to speculate that a floor was beginning to take shape.  Come May 1, the price of ether would strike a new all-time high at $80, setting the stage for continued action over the following month beneath the $100 mark. A move to that level was predicted by some analysts at the time, though others suggested that it might not happen overnight.  That bearish take was upended just days later when ether's price surpassed $100 for the first time. Ultimately, by the time June rolled around, the market was up roughly 3,000% since the start of the year, having ended the prior month above $200. The market was such that some observers began predicting the so-called ""flippening,"" during which ethereum's market capitalization would surpass that of bitcoin.  Even still, the weeks to come would see significant declines in overall cryptocurrency prices. On June 21, a stunning flash crash on Coinbase's GDAX exchange saw the price shoot down to $13. That move came as the ethereum network saw record high transaction activity a day prior.  Despite continued volatility in June, ether prices were back above $300 by months' end. But within weeks the price had lost that support, and by the middle of July ether had fallen below $190 amid wider market declines.  Indeed, that week saw what could be described as a yo-yo effect for crypto-prices, given that significant declines were followed by subsequent jumps in the overall value of the cryptocurrency market.  The ramp  If July represented a reversal of fortunes for ethereum, August saw markets return to a period of growth.  The second week of August saw ether prices hit a 30-day high above $300, and they continued inching closer to the $400 level as the days went on.  Yet by the time September came, prices seemed to struggle to advance past those earlier gains. As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote at the time, early September seemed to represent a make-or-break moment at which the market could keep climbing – or succumb to some of the weaknesses suggested in the charts. A week later, ether was back below $250.  That malaise persisted until the $300 level was broken once more at the end of that month. And though prices dipped in the wake of South Korea's ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), they shrugged off the pressure once more to push above $300 once again.  October saw some jitters around a planned hard fork of the ethereum network, but ultimately the price was largely unaffected by the technical considerations at hand.  It was November, by comparison, that saw ether's price undertake a veritable surge, passing $440 by Nov. 24 and $500 just days later. And by the middle of December, ethereum was trading above $700, ultimately pushing to its high above $800 on Dec. 19.  As shown by CoinDesk's ether price data, the cryptocurrency's value has fallen since then, and at time of writing is still above $700. Like other cryptocurrencies, ether was caught up in the 30% decline on Dec. 22, which saw the cryptocurrency market capitalization fall by billions over the course of that day.

42428351,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7S1h,1514642429,2017: The Year Crypto Became a New Asset Class,"Hunter Horsley is the co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency specialist asset manager which launched the first cryptocurrency index fund earlier this year.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      2017 has been a watershed year for crypto assets.  The combined market cap rocketed from $15 billion in January to over $600 billion by year's end. And in doing so, crypto assets crossed another kind of threshold, transforming from something easily dismissed to something hard to ignore.  The multiple-thousand percent price appreciation has been accompanied by trade volumes well over $1 billion since May, continued low correlations to other assets and sharpe ratios that compare favorably despite high volatility. Unsurprisingly, this is now attracting the interest of new market participants, retail and institutional alike.  The spectrum of new investors ranges broadly — tech-savvy teenagers, busy mothers thinking about how to invest their savings, individuals disenchanted by central institutions, high-net worth professionals, nimble family offices, financial advisors on behalf of clients, and even sophisticated hedge funds and institutions. People are taking note of the returns, headlines in the media and stories of new millionaires being minted overnight.  But they are also emboldened by low correlations, bitcoin’s eight-year track record of security, technical developments around protocols and an emerging ecosystem of companies working on crypto assets.  To be sure, crypto assets are still in an early, immature, evolving stage of their existence.  But this year was a milestone. As we head into the new year and take stock of 2017, I think we’ll regard it as the year that crypto assets officially became a new mainstream asset class, one with a distinct set of opportunities and challenges.  Fragmentation  As this new set of stakeholders contemplates investing, it has drawn into focus the challenges to accessing the market today. 2017 has been a year of tremendous growth for crypto assets, but also of increasing complexity and fragmentation.  The fragmentation is a big deal. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin had always been 85% of the total market cap of all crypto assets, that is until this year. As of May, bitcoin’s proportion has dropped to around 50%. Not because it’s lost value —it's up over 1,000% on the year— but rather because a number of other assets have appreciated to significant sizes.  There are now over 10 crypto assets with a total supply valued upwards of $5 billion. Some are competing with bitcoin, while others are endeavoring to do different things, each with their own communities, contributors, advocates and critics.  The implication for investors is that there’s a lot more research that needs to be done to understand the landscape.  Prior to this year, an investor who wanted to invest in the crypto assets as an asset class might feasibly just buy bitcoin. But today, to bet on the asset class rather than picking winners you’d need to buy a portfolio and actively manage it as things change. Both of which are increasingly hard.  What assets should an investor hold, in what allocations, where can you buy them, and what information do they need to monitor? All are new and pertinent questions for those seeking exposure to the space.  Complexity  This brings us to the second point, which is that the complexity of the space is immense and has increased tremendously this year.  Different coins are tackling different use cases: some coins are focused on storing value like gold, some on private transactions, some on fast transactions, some on allocating resources like computation, etc. Methods for fundamental analysis to value assets are not yet agreed upon or well developed, and the approaches that do exist vary depending on the type of crypto asset.  You have to consider the trustworthiness of counterparties like exchanges, public figures in the media, informational sites and wallets.  And there are frequent, relatively abrupt events you have to work to stay abreast of: hard forks, airdrops, regulatory developments (domestic and international), partnerships, new listings on exchanges, changes to algorithms and security vulnerabilities.  Navigating all of this is incredibly laborious and risky.  While many enthusiasts navigate these details either professionally or as a passion, it's a huge barrier to most. If you’re looking to make a 1 to 5 percent allocation of your portfolio into crypto, as many new to the space now are, it’s just not feasible.  Returns  That's not to say there aren't solutions. In response to this combination of interest and obstacles, 2017 has been an unparalleled year of new investment vehicles and services seeking to abstract away the complexities.  New vehicles have spanned the gamut: actively managed crypto asset hedge funds, futures, single coin investment trusts, passive index funds, funds of funds and dozens of applications for exchange-traded products. Several custodians are working to help non-crypto asset-only funds buy and store crypto assets. And many wallets and exchanges are now offering the ability to trade additional coins.  Above all else, though, 2017 was the year of new actively managed crypto asset hedge funds.  Morgan Stanley Research estimates there were over 84 new funds formed this year, up from 11 in 2016, managing an estimated $2 billion in capital. Some crypto asset hedge funds are focused on ICOs, some on active trading, some on picking the best long positions. At a high level, all are focused on delivering exposure to crypto assets and abstracting away the complexities of participating directly.  According to the HFR Cryptocurrency Index, which tracks the performance of active crypto asset hedge funds, these funds averaged over 1,600% return on the year as of November, before fees. This compares to over 850% for bitcoin, over 6,500% for ether and over 1,200% for the HOLD 10 Index, our product that offers exposure to the 10 largest coins over the same period.  Looking ahead to 2018, if demand sustains itself, we will continue to see growth in the number and variety of vehicles and services seeking to provide exposure to crypto assets while handling the complexities for investors.  That will mean both more of the vehicles and services we’ve seen already, as well as new approaches.  Think a certain crypto asset is bound for success in 2018? CoinDesk is accepting submissions for its 2017 in Review. Email news@coindesk.com to learn more.

42428359,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7SDh,1514637018,Blockchain Asset Registries: Approaching Enlightenment?,"Juan Antonio Ketterer and Gabriela Andrade specialize in financial markets for the Inter-American Development Bank, the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Improving access to productive finance in Latin America and the Caribbean is the bottom line of our work.  The reason is simple: access to finance is essential for an economy and, therefore, a key determinant of its productivity and economic growth. The problem is that the financing of productive activities, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), can be jeopardized by issues related to the quality of information and contract execution, which hinder the tasks of credit selection, monitoring and asset recovery.  This, in turn, drives up financing costs and sometimes it makes financing inviable. This problem is particularly prevalent in Latin America and the Caribbean, where it's critical development challenge that needs to be solved.  It is thus not surprising that over two years ago we got very intrigued, and eventually rather enthusiastic, about the potential of blockchain to address these problems. We became the first among multilateral development institutions to entertain the idea that if there was one strategic use case worth piloting, it was blockchain for asset registries.  Importantly, though, we were not restricting our thoughts to land registries. These class of registries have been one of the most discussed applications, but they face severe challenges in our region given the particular nature of that specific asset and the registry: blockchain cannot not solve the ""original owner"" problem should disputes arise.  We refer here to a broader class of assets, such as moveable assets, warehouse receipts, invoices, etc., that could be used as collateral to access finance but remain largely untapped because their registries are untrusted and costly to operate, the information is difficult to verify and are prone to fraud.  Enter blockchain.  The promise  At a conceptual level, it is not difficult to see why the properties of blockchain make it particularly suitable candidate for the task of maintaining a collateral or asset registry:  The system is resilient, without a single point of failure or corruption  Cryptographic proofs provide integrity to the information contained in the ledger  The information is traceable and auditable, thereby providing enhanced transparency.  Moreover, smart contracts can further contribute to the efficiency of asset registries by allowing automatic execution of pledged collateral or its automatic un-pledge and re-pledge. These properties can dramatically decrease the costs associated with collateral management and improve efficiency.  The premise then, seemed clear: More transparent and more efficient registries of assets pledged as collateral could diminish constraints rooted in information asymmetries and thus facilitate access to finance.  In other words, if blockchain could facilitate more accurate and trusted information regarding borrowers and contract execution, there would be many more SMEs in the economy that could access credit. This quickly evolved into a project with a vision: support the development of a foundation for a public, open-source infrastructure for asset registries using blockchain designed to support different applications for different type of assets, and implement a pilot to test it.  What ensued was a journey that, frankly, was very similar to the famous Gartner hype cycle in the sense that while we began intrigued, we quickly got very excited and eventually a bit disillusioned.  The certification problem  There were different drivers that took us to the ""trough of disillusionment,"" continuing with the analogy.  First, the avalanche of positive news that started in mid-2016 regarding the successful use of blockchain in different applications contributed to our inflated expectations.  But, we soon discovered that this news mostly referred to proof-of-concepts that were far from being piloted in real life, let alone in production. While this did not affect our intention to continue with the project, it showed us that there were not that many precedents we could built on.  Second, during the process of actually designing the project, we started to realize that the devil is in the details, and that very few people were talking about these details. For instance, the ""garbage in-garbage out"" problem is not easy to solve. The objective is to have more trusted and transparent asset registries, but it all depends on whether the initial information registered is correct or has not been altered.  The problem is that, at least at the entry point, we still need to engage and trust third parties that the technology is touted to eliminate. And while there are interesting and novel ways to use different technologies to put a limit on potential corruption at entry, at the end of the day this problem is not fully solved, and if garbage gets in, it will get out, and possibly on a higher standing as it was ""blockchain certified.""  Nonetheless, if the entry point issue is solved, then the system is indeed helpful as it will provide integrity to the information.  Practical concerns  More broadly, though, there are several issues arising from the ""off-chain/on-chain"" interactions, especially when the main data resides, and the main transactions occur, off-chain.  A promising avenue to address this problem is to design the off-chain transaction systems in such a way that they automatically generate smart contracts to settle the transactions on chain, but this is the subject of further research that we are conducting.  Another major, practical, issue relates to the costs and uncertainties when undertaking a pilot in the real world, even more so in the context of a developing economy. Let's start with transactions costs. Imagine we want to use the bitcoin blockchain.  Well, the price per bitcoin has increased more than 2,000 percent since we started thinking of the pilot, and despite batching and other techniques, the price increases and volatility of public blockchains affect transaction costs for a project like this, and they are not easy to plan or budget.  This holds true even in hybrid models because even if most activity occurs in the private blockchain, a reference still needs to be registered in a public blockchain. But well beyond these transactions costs, running a blockchain pilot does not come cheap.  A pilot, by definition, entails a small-scale, short-term experiment undertaken to learn how it might work in practice. This means that whatever system is built to be piloted, it would need to operate as a mirror of current systems.  Furthermore, a pilot like this needs to connect the systems of several stakeholders (for instance financial institutions, government dependencies, users and other players, depending on the use-case), which is usually not easy or cheap.  Charging ahead  Yes, undertaking a blockchain pilot entails investing a non-trivial amount of resources. Moreover, there is a multiplicity of risks to plan for and the reality is that the conclusion of the pilot might not be positive.  So, is the endeavor worth the cost and the trouble?  We think it is indeed. Not only because the potential development gains can be very high if it works, but because right now there is need for more basic research and experimentation with blockchain without worrying about direct commercial applications.  Moreover, the timing is ripe for pursuing an initiative aimed to support and test an open-source, public infrastructure that allows for greater innovation at the edges (i.e. the application layer), while offering the opportunity to start thinking about standards at the foundational level.  Also, the trait of an extensible, open and public infrastructure is very relevant for applications that entail public interest or development objectives, as the main code can be reused, improved, and adapted to the specific needs of different countries.  As such, and considering that many asset registries would benefit from enhanced auditability, traceability, and transparency, through this project we seek to contribute to the pioneer testing of blockchain in registries with high development impact potential.  We are hopeful that, if all works as intended, we will be able to enter a plateau of productivity sooner than later.

42380196,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MNAD,1514592049,What Wall Street Said About Bitcoin in 2017,"Is bitcoin in a bubble? Or will its price continue to increase through 2018?  Notable bankers, economists and investors have all weighed in over the past year. But views vary: some believe investors should hold their funds; but many have also sounded the alarm on bitcoin while expressing doubts on other cryptocurrencies.      The Bears  Peter Schiff  One of the few who predicted the 2008 housing crisis, Peter Schiff, President and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, may be a gold bull, but his love of hard money doesn't extend to bitcoin. And while some people can benefit from bitcoin, the investment advisor does not expect most people to sell in time to do so.    He told CoinDesk on Aug. 17, when bitcoin was trading at $4,000:  ""There's certainly a lot of bullishness about bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and that's the case with bubbles in general. The psychology of bubbles fuels it. You just become more convinced that it's going to work. And the higher the price goes, the more convinced you become that you're right. But it's not going up because it's going to work. It's going up because of speculation.""  Jamie Dimon  On Sept. 12, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase was speaking at a Barclays event when he doubled down on his criticism of bitcoin.  At the time, bitcoin was worth still around $4,000. Since then, he's taken aim at bitcoin in a few more occasions, which sparked a wave of comments from Wall Street figures.  And the CEO said he's now done talking about bitcoin.    “It’s a fraud … It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed."" - Dimon on Sept. 12      ""Right now these crypto things are kind of a novelty. People think they're kind of neat. But the bigger they get, the more governments are going to close them down."" - Dimon on Sept. 22.    ""If you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day."" - Dimon on Oct. 13.    Ray Dalio  Ray Dalio  , founder of the hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates said in an interview on Sept. 19 that the speculation around bitcoin coupled with its lack of broad adoption are preventing it from becoming a true currency.  Bitcoin stayed at around $4,000 at the time.  ""It's not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold. Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble.""  John Hathaway  Two days later on Sept. 21, John Hathaway, a gold investor with Tocqueville Asset Management referred to cryptocurrencies as “garbage” during an interview, saying they were not taking attention or investments away from gold.    ""Sure you can make money in bubbles any time but you have to get out. Let's not forget that the total market value of these cryptocurrencies is $180 billion or so, maybe a little less now – that's tiny compared to gold.""        Jordan Belfort  Jordan Belfort  , the “Wolf of Wall Street,” backed up Jamie Dimonon on Sept. 27 after the latter’s infamous “fraud” comments. Bitcoin hovered around the $3,910 mark throughout the day.  ""I'm not saying you should or shouldn't buy bitcoin, but [what] I'm saying is I personally, myself, would be very, very careful about investing a lot of money in something that could vanish very quickly.”  Warren Buffett  Warren Buffett  , the billionaire investor and perhaps the most notable figure of all listed here, called bitcoin ""a real bubble"" on Oct. 26 during a question-and-answer session he hosts every year.  At the time, bitcoin stayed close to the $5,700 mark.  ""People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates … You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.”  Tidjane Thiam  The following week on Nov. 2, CEO of Credit Suisse Tidjane Thiam, weighed in on the topic at a press conference, where he noted that bitcoin’s ability to facilitate anonymous transactions made it a challenge. At the time, the cryptocurrency was floating around the $7,000 mark.  ""From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.""  Carl Icahn  Another billionaire investor Carl Icahn, also the founder of Icahn Enterprises said in an interview on Dec. 1 that bitcoin looked like a bubble to him, comparing it to the Mississippi land bubble just prior to its collapse.  Bitcoin jumped to $10,000 at the time.  ""I got to tell you honestly, I don't understand it ... I just don't get it. I just stay out of something if I don't understand it.""  The Bulls  Bill Miller  Yet the legendary hedge fund investor Bill Miller stood by a different view.  He doubled down on his belief in cryptocurrencies as his MVP1 fund had increased its weight on bitcoin and bitcoin cash to nearly 50 percent. In mid December, he said in a podcast that his fund bought in around 2013 and 2014 when the bitcoin price was at $350 in average. At that time, the bitcoin investment only accounted for 5 percent of the pool.  Miller also took aim at those who have criticized the cryptocurrency, including Warren Buffet and Jamie Dimon above. According to Miller, neither of them had fully thought the topic through.  ""I'm highly confident to say that not one of them had actually studied it carefully,"" he said during the podcast. ""That is to say, they have strong opinions about something they haven't really looked at.""  Mike Novogratz  A former principal at Fortress Investment Group, long a fund with an interest in bitcoin, Mike Novogratz takes a more opportunistic approach.  While agreeing that bitcoin may have entered bubble territory in 2017, the billionaire investor announced on Sept. 26 he would launch a $500 million hedge fund focusing on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  Bitcoin climbed back to $3,000s that day after the tumble amidst China's crack down on ICO.  ""This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes. Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.""  He has since called plans off for the fund, but remains bullish on the technology.  The academics  While experts from the academic world didn't go as far as the financiers who largely have cast doubts on the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, they nonetheless raised questions on the bubble as well as whether cryptocurrencies can truly be evaluated in a rational model.  Aswath Damodaran  Known as the Wall Street’s ""Dean of Valuation,"" Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business wrote on Oct. 25 in a blog post that that he does not think cryptocurrencies would ever be an asset class. Nor could it be a commodity.  ""Bitcoin is not an asset, but a currency, and as such, you cannot value it or invest in it. You can only price it and trade it.""  Nouriel Roubini  Nouriel Roubini  , economics professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, referred to bitcoin as a “gigantic speculative bubble” on Nov. 8 during an interview with Business Insider Poland.  Bitcoin reached nearly $8,000 at the time.  “What’s more – it is also used by criminals, for their shady business. I think that more and more countries will start to make cryptocurrency exchanges illegal like China did. New regulations will be adopted. So, this will find its end.”  Joseph Stigliz  Joseph Stigliz  , former chief economist at the World Bank and now a professor at the Columbia University said on Nov. 29 he believes digital currencies should be controlled by the government, calling bitcoin’s price increases unsustainable.  At the time, bitcoin was jumping around the $9,900 mark.  ""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight … So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed. It doesn’t serve any socially useful function.""  Robert Shiller  Robert Shiller, Nobel prize-winning economist somehow echoed with a similar view on Dec. 19. He said in an interview that investors in the cryptocurrency are not making rational decisions when it comes to bitcoin investment since there's not way to evaluate the cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed to almost $20,000 over the prior weekend.  ""I think the value of bitcoin is exceptionally ambiguous,"" he said. ""You might think people who are educated will transform the decision problem into something precise ... But it doesn't seem like the brain is doing that.""
