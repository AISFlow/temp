42419313,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBeH,1698708590,Sam Bankman-Fried's Post-Collapse Media Blitz Has Clearly Backfired,"A reminder, dear reader: If you're accused of committing massive fraud and risk facing the rest of your life in prison, you should probably turn down that interview with ""Good Morning America.""  Such advice might've served Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto founder who couldn't keep quiet last year following the collapse of his FTX crypto empire, after he allegedly stole billions of dollars of customers' money.  Latest News: LIVE: Sam Bankman-Fried Retakes Stand After Rough Cross-Ex in FTX Fraud Trial  To the chagrin of his lawyers (Asked by journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin on Nov. 30 if his attorneys were ""suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking,"" he replied: ""No, they're very much not.""), the crypto founder went on a media blitz following FTX's collapse – seemingly desperate to dish out his side of the story to practically anyone who would listen, be they journalists, Twitter personalities or vexed crypto day traders.  Bankman-Fried was asked during his direct questioning last week why he spoke to so many journalists. ""I felt like it was the right thing for me to do,"" he told his lawyer.  Right or wrong, the FTX founder's media strategy seemed as perplexing as ever on Monday, when prosecutors spent hours peppering him with questions about potential criminality at FTX — using his countless post-collapse interviews as corroborating evidence.  The bulk of Bankman-Fried's exchanges with Danielle Sassoon, the assistant U.S. attorney who led the questioning, followed a strikingly similar pattern. Sassoon would ask the defendant a question: ""In private, you said things like 'f–k regulators,' didn't you?"" Bankman-Fried would respond to the effect of ""I don't recall saying that,"" or in the case of the comment disparaging regulators: ""I said that once.""  Then, whether or not Bankman-Fried could remember making a statement, Sassoon was always ready with receipts – like the defendant's ill-advised, viral text exchange with a Vox reporter expressing his distaste for regulators.  SBF's friendliness with journalists  Bankman-Fried's proclivity for speaking with the press had worked well for him historically. His trademark curly mop of hair, T-shirt and cargo shorts were complemented by a nerdily irreverent speaking style that lent him an air of earnest eccentricity in interviews.  This public image was beamed around the world by his frequent media appearances, which may have played a key role in helping him woo users and investors to FTX. Bankman-Fried acknowledged as much during his trial, confessing that he became the public face of FTX by happenstance after it became clear that he had a knack for press.  In the lead-up to Bankman-Fried's cross-examination this week, prosecutors have scrutinized his policy of customarily deleting written communications – a practice he testified to picking up during his time as a quantitative trader at Jane Street, where junior employees were advised to consider the ""New York Times Test.""  ""Anything that you write down,"" he recalled during his direct questioning last week, ""there's some chance it could end up on the front page of The New York Times."" He added: ""A lot of innocuous things can seem pretty bad"" without context.  Bankman-Fried had an odd interpretation of this rule. While he set most internal FTX chats to ""auto-delete"" — apparently to prevent them from showing up in The New York Times — he often spilled his secrets directly to the Times and other news outlets. The results of these post-collapse conversations, when presented in a courtroom, still looked ""pretty bad.""  Sassoon's grilling excerpted interviews with Sorkin of The New York Times, George Stephanopoulos of ""Good Morning America"" and Bloomberg's Zeke Faux, among others – just a handful of the journalists Bankman-Fried spoke to immediately after FTX's fall.  At least five journalists whose names showed up in pieces of evidence pulled up for the jury Monday were physically present at the Manhattan courthouse.  Although he left prosecutors with a sparse written record of his conversations at FTX, his press appearances after FTX collapsed, wherein he walked step-by-step through the fall, contained more than enough material for Sassoon to puncture his credibility, and to rip apart the sympathetic image he painstakingly constructed for himself in early media interviews and hours of direct questioning from his own lawyers.  Another inconvenient interview  A key moment in Monday's cross-examination revolved around the allegation that Alameda Research, a trading firm Bankman-Fried founded before starting FTX, had ""special privileges"" on the exchange that allowed it to steal billions of dollars in user deposits.  Bankman-Fried has generally been evasive when asked if Alameda had special privileges on FTX, since admitting that would be a huge boon to the government's case against him.  ""Isn't it true that as CEO of FTX you were aware that Alameda had more leeway than other traders on the exchange?"" Sassoon asked him at one point on Monday. Initially, he pushed back: ""Not in those words specifically, and I don't know what context it was in.""  With some prodding from Judge Lewis Kaplan, Bankman-Fried conceded that Alameda had ""put on a far larger position than I had anticipated"" but he said it was due to a banking relationship between Alameda and FTX that he maintains was kosher. He made no mention of any Alameda special privileges or extra ""leeway.""  Sassoon drilled further: Alameda's large position ""was also the result of the margin rules that did not apply to Alameda, correct?""  ""I'm not sure that's how I see it, no,"" Bankman-Fried responded.  Sassoon, unphased, moved right ahead with her questioning. She pulled up an interview between Bankman-Fried and Bloomberg's Faux. The article was dated December 2022, a few weeks after FTX fell apart: ""When I ask if Alameda had to follow the same margin rules as other traders, he admits the fund did not,"" Faux wrote. ""'There was more leeway,' [Bankman-Fried] says.""  Although most of his internal communications have been deleted – perhaps a wise move depending upon what they contained – a remarkable amount of the prosecution's evidence was drawn from media appearances like this one that Bankman-Fried did after he stepped down from his role at FTX. Had he stayed quiet – adopting some variant of the New York Times Test to avoid letting his words come back to haunt him in court – one imagines this portion of the case could have taken a strikingly different course.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/30/sam-bankman-frieds-post-collapse-media-blitz-has-clearly-backfired,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8270298d5159d7a1241558a543221e3aa213671a-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The latest figure which shows a decreased participation from investors could have long-running significant implications for the SHIB price. SHIB Burn Rate Drops From 7,700% Spike Over the last 24 hours, Shibburn has shown that the SHIB burn rate has been less than encouraging. The burn tracker revealed a total of 106.72 million tokens burned in the 23-hour period, which is a significant decline of almost 60% from the prior day’s figures. Related Reading: The End Is Near For Trellor (TRB): Crypto Analyst Says Prepare For 50% Drop Now, the interesting thing is not just the fact that the Shiba Inu burn rate plunged but how far it plunged. Coming out of the weekend, the burn tracker had flagged an over 7,700% spike in the burn rate, which makes the current deceleration concerning. Source: Shibburn There were only a total of five transactions that burned SHIB in the last 24-hour period, with one wallet “0x75d9” doing the majority of the work at this time. The wallet address alone had 100 million tokens, accounting for around 98% of the total burn figure. At the time of writing, there has not been a single Shiba Inu burn transaction in the last 8 hours amid the slowdown. However, there has been an uptick on the weekly chart which suggests the current deceleration might be localized to just the 24-hour period. Shibburn shows an increase of 151.4% over the last 7 days, bringing the total burned figure to above 620 million. SHIB bears tussle with bulls for control | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu Sustains Rally Despite the decline in the burn rate, the Shiba Inu price remains resolved to go the other way. The altcoin’s price crossed the $0.000008 mark and bulls have demonstrated a strong hold on the coin. This has resulted in an 11.75% rise in the last day compared to a 9.38% increase in the last week. Daily volume for the digital asset is down 14.75% though, so it could mean that this rally is destined to be short-lived. However, if the SHIB price can maintain its hold above the 50-day moving average, then it will provide the momentum needed for the rally to continue. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Called Bitcoin’s Parabolic Rally Picks Altcoin Set To Pop The recovery is also closely linked to the Bitcoin price recovery, which means a drawdown in Bitcoin could also mean a drawdown in the SHIB price.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Selling, While Long-Term Holders Are Still Quiet As explained by analyst James V. Straten in a new post on X, the short-term holders are currently participating in one of the strongest profit-taking events of the past couple of years. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to all those Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. This group comprises one of the two main divisions of the BTC market, with the other being called the “long-term holders” (LTHs). Statistically, the longer an investor keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. Because of this reason, the STHs are generally the weak-minded hands of the sector, while the LTHs are the strong, persistent holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below $35K – Here’s What Could Trigger Bearish Reaction Whenever the sector goes through any significant FUD or FOMO, the STHs budge and participate in at least some amount of selling. The LTHs, on the other hand, usually show little reaction. Since the Bitcoin price has enjoyed a sharp rally recently that has taken its price above the $34,000 level, the STHs would naturally be selling now. One way to track whether this Bitcoin group is selling their coins can be by tracking the volume that they are transferring to exchanges. In the context of the current discussion, Straten has decided to choose the version of this indicator that specifically tracks the transactions from investors who are in profit, as profit-taking is generally the behavior of focus during rallies. In contrast, loss transactions play a greater role in price slumps. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the metric for the Bitcoin STHs over the past two years: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin STHs in profit have sent large amounts to these centralized platforms since the latest rally in the asset. This confirms that these weak hands have been selling recently. As mentioned before, it’s not unusual for such a thing to happen, but the scale of the profit-taking this time around is particularly significant.

From the chart, it’s visible that there have only been a few times in the past couple of years where the STHs in profit have transferred comparable or higher volumes to exchanges.

42419308,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBZ7,1698701670,Ethereum Has Layer 0 Power. But It Could Still Blow It,"If there is ever a theme you can detect from my writing and point of view, it’s that the technology world loves a standard, and Ethereum has become that standard.  Additionally, as I never tire of pointing out, once a standard gains a large foothold, it’s remarkably difficult to dislodge it, even when something better comes along. From operating systems to paper checks (or cheques if you’re in the U.K.), once something becomes “good enough”, tools and pathways are built around them.  There are a few illustrations of the power of technology standards and path dependency that can match the enduring existence of paper checks in the U.S. financial ecosystem.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Once upon a time, the infrastructure that supported paper checks included networks of overnight flights and all-night data processing centers in banks. Those are all gone today, in favor of digital image processing systems. It’s not uncommon to both send paper checks from your bank through online banking and bill pay and then deposit received checks by scanning them with your smartphone. The absurdity of going from digital to analog to digital to close the loop on a payment made between two entirely digital banking systems is truly testament to the power of path dependency.  Ethereum is certainly on a path to becoming not merely a global standard but a deeply entrenched one in the global business and financial infrastructure. However, it’s not quite there yet, and the ecosystem needs to carefully avoid what I think are three risks that could make a significant opening for an alternative solution. All of these involve negotiating a middle path between extremes.  Avoid centralization  1. The most important and urgent path for Ethereum is to avoid either excessive centralization or decentralization. The entire value proposition of blockchain technology is built upon decentralization. For the more politically inclined, they see it as censorship resistance. For those of us in business, the value proposition is about monopoly resistance. We live in a world of extractive technology monopolies we don’t need anymore.  The current risks posed to Ethereum by immensely powerful staking systems are a case in point. Even well-intentioned entities that inadvertently develop immense power can represent a single point of failure and can morph into forces that can tilt the ecosystem into one direction or another. Systems like quadratic voting can and should be used to prevent any single entity from gaining excessive levels of ecosystem control and dominance.  Excessive decentralization poses a smaller, but still, a risk. An ecosystem without larger entities may struggle to find clear leaders or use cases that can lobby for constructive change.  Reasonable people are the key more than any technology or strategy  Avoid idealism  2. Ethereum can best be described as ideological excess. The internet in its glory expansion years was seen by many as the perfect tool for democratization of both business and personal expression. Some people today see those goals as having failed. Governments and large companies have carved out significant exceptions, building monopolies, filtering content, and spreading propaganda online. Idealists could look at this as a complete failure, but it’s really just partial success.  There is a real risk that as regulators and governments crack down on unauthorized securities sales and money laundering in the crypto-ecosystem, idealists will resist any effort at accountability or lawful limitations. The result might feel like victory, but it would make Ethereum unpalatable for enterprises, public sector, charities and banks with mass market access.  If Ethereum is captured by all-or-nothing idealists, we will surely end up with a world based on centralized, state-controlled “blockchains” not an imperfect global public blockchain. The internet we have today is a far cry from the global, borderless free enterprise and free-speech ecosystem I once hoped we’d have, but I would take it any day over a patchwork of tightly regulated private or government networks. The same goes for Ethereum.  Read more: Paul Brody - Eventually, We Are All Ethereum  Avoid technological calcification  3. The final risk for Ethereum is technological calcification. Ethereum does not need to be a nimble technology startup, but it must not grind to halt either. Winning technology standards are never the best available technology. I dare someone to tell me that the desktop operating systems we use today represent the best possible experience human ingenuity can come up with. Go ahead and @me (@pbrody).  Indeed, I like to joke that we know with certainty that once upon a time, someone came up with something better than the wheel. We’ll never know what it is, but we can be sure this is true because all ground transportation is based on wheels today. Seriously, I think this is very funny, and I don’t know why nobody laughs at this joke. Too nerdy?  So, while Ethereum (and technology standards like desktop operations systems) doesn’t need to be the best of all possible experiences, it cannot stand still. Technology standards that survive are the ones that adapt. Maybe not quickly, but they adapt, nonetheless.  Cool features introduced by upstarts today are, eventually, incorporated into the core platform. Ethereum did not pioneer proof-of-stake, for example, and didn’t get there quickly, but it did get there eventually. The enduring dominance of current standards from TCP/IP to IBM mainframes isn’t possible without continuous improvement.  So far, Ethereum has been successful with all these tests and I’m not forecasting failure by any means, just highlighting the risks. Indeed, I think the secret power of Ethereum is very similar to that of the internet. It’s what people have been calling the Layer 0 power: the social network that underpins the technology. Time and again, people I have met in the Ethereum ecosystem have struck me as an excellent blend of visionaries, intelligent and reasonable people.  To win, Ethereum must keep charting a middle path through these minefields. Reasonable people are the key to that more than any technology or strategy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/30/ethereum-has-layer-0-power-but-it-could-still-blow-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/463ee8c8dbdfa6b99128660e3e64d57fcf21b9af-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A notable crypto analyst, Pentoshi, shed light on the asset’s price trajectory, suggesting a possible uptick in value if current conditions prevail. It is worth noting that this analyst’s predictions come at a time when Ethereum trails behind Bitcoin’s recent price rally. Notably, while Bitcoin has recorded a 12.5% increase over the past week, Ethereum’s gains are modest, rising by 8.4% during the same timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Resilient Above $1,800 Pre-FOMC Meeting – Details Ethereum Price Bracket Significance According to the analyst’s post, Ethereum’s immediate future could see an upward trend if it manages to close the week within a specific price range. The suggested target zone, between $1,796 and $2,148, is critical, as highlighted by Pentoshi. Should ETH’s closing price fall within this bracket, the analyst posits a potential path cleared for Ethereum to reach or even surpass the $2,200 mark. While Ethereum lags Bitcoin’s recent performance, the analyst remains optimistic about its prospects. Pentoshi indicates that Ethereum is approaching a “demand zone,” on the BTC/ETH ratio. Notably, this could stimulate buying activity and influence its price positively. $ETH Closing this weekly back inside the range opens up the doors to $2,200 Despite it severely underperforming BTC it’s now beginning to enter the demand zone on the btc /eth ratio BTC is bullish as long as above the 31.5-32.5k area thus I’ll continue to have bullish bias… pic.twitter.com/Hwoi8jwr2O — Pentoshi 🐧 euroPeng 🇪🇺 (@Pentosh1) October 29, 2023 Bitcoin’s Bullish Standpoint Maintained Pentoshi is bullish on Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, provided it remains above a particular threshold. The $31,500 and $32,500 area is highlighted as Bitcoin’s support zone. The analyst maintains that staying above this range could sustain the positive outlook on Bitcoin. However, a dip below these levels would suggest re-evaluating this bullish analysis. Regardless, Bitcoin does not currently appear to be moving towards any support but instead seems to be pushing above any resistance. In just four days, the asset has climbed from a trading price of $34,000 last Thursday to a present trading value of $34,760 at the time of writing.

According to real-world asset (RWA) monitoring platform RWA.xyz, the tokenized Treasury market surged to $698 million as of Monday from around $100 million at the start of the year. The expansion was spurred by new entrants into the space as well as from existing platform growth, Charlie You, co-founder of RWA.xyz, noted in the Our Network newsletter.  Existing protocols including Ondo Finance, Maple and Backed enjoyed a sizable increase over the past few months, RWA data shows. Meanwhile, new protocols launched just in September such as Tradeteq and TrueFi's Adatp3r offering attracted $4.5 million and $8.5 million deposits, respectively.  Ethereum [ETH] has recently toppled the Stellar [XLM] network in value of Treasury tokens on-chain, while later entrants Polygon [MATIC] and Solana [SOL] also attracted over $40 million of assets combined, according to blockchain data. This indicates ""a diversifying blockchain landscape for tokenized assets,"" RWA.xyz's You said.  Permissionless yield-bearing stablecoin alternatives emerged as a fresh avenue for tokenization, You added, as Ondo Finance debuted its USDY token and Mountain Protocol unveiled USDM. These offerings differ from leading stablecoins – Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC – in that they directly pass on the yield earned from the backing assets.  Tokenization of Treasuries was spearheaded the effort to put real-world assets to blockchain rails. Crypto investors seek these offerings in order to capture higher returns as global interest rates soar alongside declining decentralized finance yields.

19618192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558194,1698696034,Is Bitcoin Top Here? This Metric Would Say Otherwise,"The Bitcoin MVRV ratio, an on-chain indicator, could suggest the asset may not have hit its top for the current rally just yet. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Says Market Isn’t Overheated Right Now According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, past bull markets hit their peaks when the MVRV ratio crossed the 300% mark. The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The “realized cap” here is a capitalization model for BTC that calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by assuming that each coin in circulation is worth the same as the price at which it was last moved, rather than the current spot price. As the price at which a coin was last moved on the blockchain was likely the price at which it changed hands, the realized cap can be interpreted as the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the asset. Related Reading: November Outlook For Bitcoin Price: Another Pump Or Retrace? The MVRV ratio compares the price of the coin (the market cap) with the realized cap, so it can tell us whether the investors are holding more or less than they put in. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been going up in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X In the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio is shown as a percentage. At the 100% mark, the two capitalization models approach a equal value, suggesting that the market as a whole is just breaking-even. Above this threshold, the investors are holding a net amount of profit, while below they are carrying loss. From the chart, it’s visible that the BTC MVRV ratio has remained above the break-even in recent months as the asset’s price has observed a rally. At present, the metric is floating about the 150% level, suggesting that the market cap is 50% more than the realized cap. Historically, the larger the investors’ profits have gotten, the more likely they have become to take part in a selloff. Because of this reason, tops have generally formed when the MVRV ratio has hit high levels. IntoTheBlock notes, however, that the bull markets in the past have usually only hit their peaks when the indicator has crossed the 300% mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised For Another Surge Like Last Week: Here’s Why Clearly, the indicator is still a significant distance away from this mark at the moment. This could be a potential sign that the Bitcoin rally hasn’t reached a state of overheat yet and thus, there might be more to come for the cryptocurrency’s price in terms of bullish momentum.

But a foundation devoted to supporting Starknet is already allocating the tokens to early developers and other contributors, as incentives for them to help build out the network.  The 11-month-old Starknet Foundation announced Monday that it had allocated some 50 million STRK tokens to a new Early Community Member Program, or ECMP for short.  According to a blog post, the program's focus is on individual contributors, including those who have:  ""significantly contributed to technical discourse.""  are involved with key projects in the ecosystem.  organized events such as meetups, conferences and workshops.  ""Regularly published Starknet-branded content.""  The application process runs through Nov. 19, with decisions made by Dec. 29.  The Starknet Foundation's tokens come from its original grant of 50.1% of the initial minted supply of 10 billion STRK, so that works out to a hoard of about 5 billion STRK.  Since the tokens aren't trading, there's no easy way to estimate the value – especially with any potential payday still many months away.  But the awards could help Starknet grow and retain its community, especially during the current ""crypto winter"" where resources are tight – and as rival projects including Arbitrum, the biggest layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum, move forward with their own incentive programs.

Initially developed by the crypto startup StarkWare, certain responsibilities for the network were turned over to the foundation after it was launched in November 2022 with the mission of ""supporting a thriving Starknet.""  Mandates for the foundation, which is overseen by a seven-member board that includes StarkWare co-founder and President Eli Ben-Sasson, include ""fostering the community of Starknet users, developers and researchers"" along with ""overseeing the continued development of the network and advancing research,"" according to a blog post at the time.

42419307,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBY5,1698692652,Marshall Islands Further Strengthen's Law That Made DAOs Legal Entities,"The Marshall Islands has taken its bid to become a global hub for the incorporation of DAOs one step further.  The tiny island nation between Australia and Hawaii strengthened a previous law that recognized DAOs as legal entities, last week.  The parliament of the Republic of the Marshall Islands passed legislation last week that takes its already advanced law for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) a step further, according to the two authors of the bill, Member of Parliament David Paul and Adam Miller, the CEO & Co-Founder of MIDAO.  MIDAO is a public-private partnership between the Marshall Islands and MIDAO Directory Services, a Marshall Islands corporation. MIDAO act as an extension of the registrar's office for DAOs and Web 3.  The amended Decentralized Autonomous Organization Act of 2023 is different from the Act of 2022 because it's the ""most comprehensive law for DAOs globally"" and it will be a ""blueprint for the rest of the world for regulating DAOs,"" Miller told CoinDesk.  In February 2022, the group of tiny islands, a close ally to the U.S., and geographically between Hawaii and Australia, became the first nation to recognize DAOs as legal entities. Since 2021, under the previous act, the Marshall Islands has incorporated almost 100 DAOs.  The original law stated that DAOs would not need a board of directors, written or paper records wouldn't be required if they were on the blockchain, and, except for one person, every member of the DAO could be anonymous. The person who wouldn't be anonymous wouldn't need to be in the Marshall Islands but would need to provide KYC details.  The amended law strengthens the benefits of the original law by providing a faster registration time – a maximum of 30 days instead of 30-60 days. It also provides that DAOs will not be held responsible for the use of open-source software just because they created it. Additionally, the law provides that most governance tokens are explicitly not securities ""if they don't confer any economic rights, which is different from possible financial gain,"" Miller said.  To open a DAO in the nation, you need to go to MIDAO.org and hire MIDAO as a registered agent to complete the process. DAOs or the specified member of the DAO would not need to open a local office or hire a local law firm.  The move also makes the Marshall Islands the first to bring into law Series DAO LLCs. It is common practice for DAOs to have a DAO within a DAO, also known as a sub-DAO. The Series DAO LLCs allow for the sub-DAO to have separate assets and liabilities.  ""This one is the truly groundbreaking crypto law because it addresses every major issue that lawyers from around the world have brought up related to Web 3 and in particular, DAOs,"" Miller said.  The Marshall Islands, unlike individual U.S. states, is not subject to U.S. federal laws while still having access to the U.S. Postal Services, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Military.

19616199,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558241,1698692431,"Solo Bitcoin Miner Snags $200,000 Block Reward, How Did They Do It?","A solo Bitcoin miner has struck gold after successfully claiming a $200,000 block reward. The considerable achievement has captured the attention of fellow miners and crypto enthusiasts, highlighting the potential for lone miners to effectively compete with larger mining operations Lone Bitcoin Miner Hits Jackpot On October 28, a software engineer of Bitcoin CGMiner and an admin of Solo Ckpool, Dr. Con Kolivas congratulated a lone Bitcoin miner in an X (formerly Twitter) post for accomplishing a rare milestone by solving the 278th solo block at Solo Ckpool. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Uniswap’s UNI As The Next Coin Primed For Breakout The lucky miner used 11 PH/s of hash power to discover block 814,308 and claimed a $200,000 (6.25 BTC) block reward. “Congratulations to miner 3KCykmdpBpNKTtZJAvp3u2N2EQjGzbUF7c with ~11PH for solving the 278th solo block on solo.ckpool,” Dr. Kolivas stated. Presently, large-scale mining operations and pools are dominating the Bitcoin mining industry. When blocks are discovered, these mining companies often share the rewards. In contrast, mining pools like Solo Ckpool offer lone miners a higher level of independence allowing them to earn almost all rewards when they discover a block. This recent solo mining achievement has not been the only accomplishment this year. In August, a solo Bitcoin miner solved block 803,821, claiming 6.25 BTC worth $160,000. Multiple solo miners have also discovered substantial blocks and reaped significant rewards in the last few months. The lure of solo mining pools is growing as many miners are looking to increase their chances of earning large rewards while reclaiming a sense of independence in the competitive Bitcoin mining market. BTC Mining Hashrate On The Rise Bitcoin Hashrate has continued to increase following the recent surge in the value of BTC. Earlier on October 12, the hash rate saw an alarming increase to 456 exahash per second (EH/s). Following this increase, the hash rate stabilized slightly dropping down to 443 EH/s sometime on October 28. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Crypto Spot Trading Volumes Climb To 8-Month Highs Despite the increased level of mining difficulties, hash rates are rising. Bitcoin hash rate is slightly back up today to 452.63 EH/s with an estimated difficulty adjustment of 12.78% and network difficulty of 62.46T. The average block time for mining is also approximately 8 minutes and 52 seconds. In the past month, mining hash prices fell to significant lows, depicting the possibility of chain validators experiencing higher mining difficulties and pressure. Now, hash rates are on the rise and Bitcoin miners are taking advantage of these opportunities to increase their earnings.

42419311,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBbB,1698689589,Crypto Winter Is Over,"Bitcoin is up 28% in the last month. BTC exchange-trade funds (ETFs) are coming sometime soon. Crypto investment funds saw their largest weekly inflows last week since mid-2022. Meme coins are making a comeback. And the chastening trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is almost over, giving crypto the chance to start anew.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As we head into winter in North America, is “crypto winter” just about done?  It certainly looks like it.  Crypto winter isn’t quite a technical term (like a “recession” is a fall in economic output for two successive quarters). There’s no accepted definition. But anyone who is in crypto knows what it is and what it feels like. During winter, crypto prices are falling, crypto’s critics are on the warpath, VC dollars dry up and everyone’s looking for a new narrative.  Recently, that new narrative has returned.  Wall Street is getting into bitcoin in a big way, promising billions in new investment through ETF vehicles. The story is now about how mainstream institutions are going to save the digital assets industry, by making tokens safe for investors and bringing greater regulatory clarity. In the wake of FTX and other major scandals, it is said that the adults are coming back into the room, promising more focus on what actually works. Wall Street’s agenda now is about finding sustainable products. It’s all about ETFs, tokenized securities and stablecoins. Not the fluff-and-nonsense of meme coins and over-priced NFTs that we saw during the COVID-era run-up.  You may not like the new narrative, believing it departs from the purpose and origin story of crypto (which was to provide an alternative to mainstream finance). But it’s assuredly the reason why people are getting excited about crypto again.  Part of this is driven by macro factors, like the instability of the Middle East and the renewed threat of inflation. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, described the recent rally in bitcoin as being driven by a “flight to quality” – the hunkering of investors for safety in times of uncertainty.  See also: What Will Wall Street’s Bitcoin Narrative Be? | Opinion  “I think there are more people running into a flight to quality whether that is in treasuries, gold or crypto – depending on how you think about it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight to quality,” he told Fox Business earlier this month.  Fink, of course, used to be an avowed crypto skeptic, someone who was more interested in Bitcoin’s environmental footprint than its potential as a safe-haven asset. Now this bellwether Wall Street figure is trumpeting Bitcoin live on national TV. And actually crypto winter may have ended before last week, if we’d paid more attention. Warmer times were already on the way back in January, according to Noelle Acheson, the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, who now writes the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter.  “Since [January], we've had significant regulatory progress outside the U.S., big legacy banks building crypto teams, new funds emerging with significant capital, broader tokenization experimentation and the deepening participation of both financial and technology giants in blockchain-related services,” she tells me over email.  “It is true that the interest pick-up has been tentative in some quarters, and the regulatory landscape in the U.S. does not look warm and sunny, but for the crypto ecosystem as a whole, the ‘green shoots’ of spring have been evident for months,” she adds.  “Since January, new layer 1s have emerged, layer 2 value has more than doubled, Google/Mastercard/Fidelity and other household names are diving deeper into crypto services, massive fund managers have tokenized products, and the largest asset managers in the U.S. are looking to create crypto-linked products.

19614077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558271,1698688830,"XRP Price About To See “Face Ripping” Rally, Legendary Trader Weights In","The XRP price continues to enjoy positive performance as the crypto market trends to the upside. The current rally confluences with the sector’s historical performance; thus, cryptocurrencies could extend their bullish trend. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakout Soon? Analyst Points To Bullish Structural Signs As of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.58 with a 5% profit in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency recorded an 11% rally and stood as one of the best performers in the sector over the same period, along with Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). XRP Price Bull Run Incoming? As XRP and other trend upwards, legendary trader Peter Brandt share his positive views on the nascent sector. Brandt has been known for expressing his views on BTC and crypto without reservations, and this time, the forecast is bullish. On social media platform X, the legendary trader dismissed market actors trying to predict future performance. However, Brandt dared to make three predictions regarding Bitcoin: first, the cryptocurrency is likely to hit bottom, which will lead it to new all-time highs, as seen in the chart below. This bullish price action is based on the cryptocurrency’s historical performance. Each time the BTC market drops around 78%, Bitcoin bottoms and re-enters price discovery. The XRP price, Ethereum, and other altcoins follow the trend. In 2017, when BTC went into a bull run, the XRP price reached an all-time high above $3. If history repeats, and based on the fundamentals supporting XRP’s bullish momentum, the token could hit a similar level. XRP In The Short Term, Levels To Watch The optimistic forecast in the traditional financial market supports this scenario. If stocks and Bitcoin see further profits, everything will align for XRP and other altcoins to hit their previous all-time highs. In short timeframes, a pseudonym analyst indicated that XRP formed a bull flag pattern. This bullish market structure hints at a potential run of the high area around $0.66. However, bulls must maintain the token above $0.52 and $0.54 to prevent a run of the lows. Related Reading: DOGE Breaks Free From Multi-year Descending Order, What’s Next?

42419314,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBfJ,1698688287,What Will Wall Street’s Bitcoin Narrative Be?,"With the surge in spot Bitcoin ETF applications, Wall Street is poised to engage directly with Bitcoin. While traditional financial institutions are likely to promote it as a risk-off safe-haven investment, ETFs offer a different type of Bitcoin investment than what’s available on a traditional crypto exchange. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not offering a decentralized, censorship-resistant bearer asset.  Dave Birnbaum is the product director at Coinbits, a Bitcoin investment platform, and a prolific inventor, with patents in fintech, VR, communications and more. David Waugh is a business development and communications specialist at Coinbits. He previously served as managing editor at the American Institute For Economic Research.  Wall Street cannot market these values of Bitcoin because it cannot offer them. However, companies specializing in Bitcoin technology and custody can use Wall Street’s marketing campaign to highlight their comparative advantage and gain market share. These Bitcoin companies should plan for such marketing, identify the gap between the ETF narrative and reality, and capitalize on the difference.  The Wolves of Wall Street  ""There's blood in the water. Let's go kill!"" screamed former CEO John Mack on Morgan Stanley's trading floor in the 1980s. Although new regulations and a softer corporate environment have tamed its culture, Wall Street's objective remains the same: earn money selling financial products. A spot Bitcoin ETF is no different.  Selling Bitcoin products poses a unique challenge for these incumbents because it forces them to promote a technology that threatens their role as financial intermediaries. And so they must create products that capture Bitcoin's allure while obscuring its core tenets. Think of it as ""Bitcoin Lite"": digestible for investors, tamed for regulators, and lucrative for issuers. It's a narrative that turns Bitcoin from a revolutionary tool to just another item on the financial menu.  Drawing upon proven marketing narratives for existing ETFs, Wall Street marketing teams are already formulating narratives about why people should buy shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF.  What are they likely to be?  Narrative 1: “If you hold bitcoin in self custody, your coins could be lost or stolen.”  Wall Street will weave a narrative about Bitcoin ETFs based on the successful promotion of gold ETF products starting in 2004. They will frame self-custody as risky and inconvenient, just as holding gold oneself is risky and inconvenient.  This narrative will allude to the complexity and unfamiliarity of holding your private keys with Bitcoin hardware wallets and seed phrases. Following the playbook of Celsius, a scandal-ridden and now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, it will highlight the estimated millions of bitcoins permanently immovable due to the destruction or loss of private keys.  Bitcoin companies will need to counter thus: Although users must learn the process for custodying Bitcoin, holding private keys at home or in a safe deposit box can be secure and easy. Consumers can now use innovative “collaborative custody” apps that securely distribute private keys among household members. These apps allow each person to recover funds without anyone having the ability to move them without others’ permission.  Narrative 2: “If you hold bitcoin on an exchange, your coins could be lost or stolen.”  Another tactic will be to highlight the recent insolvencies and fraudulent practices of crypto exchanges such as FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and BlockFi. Expect Wall Street executives to use buzzwords like ""under-regulated,"" juxtaposing their firms with crypto exchanges.  Wall Street spends tremendous time and money on compliance. Despite consumers bearing these costs, incumbent financial firms do appear safer than the recently fallen crypto platforms in the eyes of consumers.  Bitcoin companies must explain that there are sources to obtain Bitcoin other than exchanges that hold a fraction of customer deposits on hand, namely bitcoin-only brokerages and peer-to-peer transactions. They must also frame self-custody as a ""third way"" with manageable risks but overwhelming advantages.  Narrative 3: “Nervous about market volatility? Move into bitcoin with a click.”  Despite past criticisms, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink now sees money moving into Bitcoin as a ""flight to quality."" He repeated the phrase several times in a single interview, pointing to this phrase being part of an explicit marketing narrative promoted by the company.  Fink's interview marks the first step in a broader strategy to shift Bitcoin's correlation from investor greed to investor fear. The new narrative shows that BlackRock recognizes Bitcoin's potential for storing value during volatile market conditions. Remember, asset managers primarily make money on flows, not gains. If the marketing narrative of a ""flight to safety"" dominates, firms like BlackRock on Wall Street can take advantage by encouraging people to move in and out of Bitcoin as the fear and greed index oscillates.  As Wall Street makes the case against institutional custody by promoting Bitcoin as a risk-off asset, Bitcoin companies can directly benefit. While asset managers spend the marketing dollars to promote this narrative, Bitcoin firms can reuse what works and build upon it to teach our customers the true value of owning physical Bitcoin.  Narrative 4: “With bitcoin available through regulated brokerages, there is no longer a reason for individuals to self custody.”  Regulators are setting the stage for a national security narrative, with Wall Street likely to follow suit. With ownership of bitcoin by elite Americans already widespread, a viable option to “access” Bitcoin through regulated brokerages is necessary before momentum for banning self-custody can build.  Bitcoin companies must prepare for a battle of ideas by explaining that the right to use Bitcoin emanates from natural law, freedom of speech, privacy, and property rights. Bitcoiners are already discussing these issues. Thought-leaders can win the public's hearts and minds, but we must anticipate that Wall Street's marketing engine, easy-to-use financial products, and regulatory pressure will pose significant challenges.  The marketing narratives promoting spot Bitcoin ETFs will obscure this groundbreaking innovation in money technology – Bitcoin – as a traditional financial product. Although Wall Street may characterize Bitcoin with half-truths, or even misleading narratives, the marketing dollars they spend will generate interest. Bitcoin companies will have the unique opportunity to harness the public's attention and offer a complementary narrative about Bitcoin as a decentralized, censorship-resistant bearer asset.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,"Dave Birnbaum, David Waugh",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/30/what-will-wall-streets-bitcoin-narrative-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b2e3bf7dfadfb12dd329ba1d89bf17743f0b9ea-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19611969,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558255,1698685210,RSI Records Major Golden Cross: XRP Predicted To Cross The $1 Mark In 16 Days,"Crypto analyst Crypto Insight recently predicted that the price of XRP could be preparing to go past the $1 mark in just 16 days as the XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and open interest continue to gain momentum indicating a bullish trend. XRP Weekly Relative Strength Index On Sunday, October 29, the crypto analyst shared his predictions on X (formerly Twitter) highlighting that XRP might be prepared for a significant upward trajectory due to the strength of the XRP’s weekly RSI, as it gains traction toward entering a bullish zone. Related Reading: XRP Price To Go Parabolic, Here’s When This is because the momentum of an asset’s price movement is measured by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). There are two indicator feature lines in the RSI chart and these include the RSI line (purple) and the RSI-Based MA line (yellow). In the RSI chart, an indication of rising momentum and a bullish cross is produced whenever the RSI line crosses above the RSI-based MA line; as seen in the XRP weekly chart posted by Crypto Insight on X. XRP experienced the cross for the first time in the first week of July, and after this happened, the cryptocurrency experienced a great surge in price by July 13, which led to XRP’s yearly high of $0.93. However, during the correction that followed, the RSI line fell below the RSI-based MA line. According to crypto insight, the line is once again attempting to traverse above the RSI-based MA line as of the time of his discovery, and the crossing has been realized. As of the time of his revelation, the RSI line was sitting at 53.91, while the RSI-based MA line was sitting at 51.01 presenting a bullish sign. The crypto analyst further shed more light on the timing for these potential developments. Crypto Insight speculated that XRP might be touching a resistance level as of the time of his disclosure, and the resistance level could be a vital point for XRP price movement. He also added that a bullish cross for the RSI could buttress both bulls and punters to engage in the market and stake their bets. Notably, this surge in trading activity could provide XRP with the force it needs to swiftly break out into the target range. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Blast Off In 18 Days, Here’s Why So far, the target range that was set up by the crypto analyst in his chart was between $0.8875 to $1.3617. He believes that XRP could hit this price range in the next 16 days since the rally in July, saw the XRP price almost claiming the $1 mark, but failed due to the significant resistance it faced. The crypto analyst also pointed out the XRP’s open interest in his projections. He highlighted that open interest has room to rise significantly, and it seems to be developing higher highs. Open Interest is the overall number of pending futures contracts for a particular cryptocurrency. Therefore, an increase in open interest can indicate growing market participation and keenness among investors, and it can also lead to increased liquidity and potentially trigger a price rally for a cryptocurrency.

42419306,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBTx,1698684870,Do Kwon's Terraform Labs Seeks Early Court Rejection of U.S. SEC Case,"The Terraform securities fraud case pursued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has reached the expected pre-trail stage at which the company made a motion asking the court to rule it should win without trial.  The company contends the SEC didn't make its case that unregistered securities were being offered.  Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, are asking a federal judge to side with them in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fraud case, arguing that the regulator hasn't managed to prove the crypto company was offering securities.  ""After two years of investigation, the completion of a discovery period that resulted in the taking of more than 20 depositions, and the exchange of over two million pages of documents and data, the SEC is evidentiarily no closer to proving that the defendants did anything wrong,"" Terraform contended in its motion for summary judgment – a formal request to Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that he decide the SEC hasn't sufficiently demonstrated its case to justify a trial.  The $40 billion disaster at stablecoin issuer Terraform in 2022 marked a big first domino in a series of prominent crypto firms going under, and the company is now one of several crypto businesses currently fighting with the agency over core questions underpinning the digital assets industry. After the company's TerraUSD stablecoin [UST] and its Luna cryptocurrency collapsed, it faced SEC accusations that the company and Kwon sold unregistered securities in a massive fraud that cost investors billions.  The firm is also asking the court to toss out the views of experts the SEC enlisted to make its case, including the ""conceptually flawed"" analysis of a Rutgers University professor.  An earlier attempt to get the case dismissed outright was rejected by the court, with Rakoff noting the SEC made a ""plausible claim"" that Terraform had offered investment contracts, meaning the case would correctly have been within the reach of the agency's securities enforcement jurisdiction.  A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment on the latest filings.  Kwon has asked the same court to reject the SEC's request to question him in the U.S. about the catastrophic crash of his company's tokens. Kwon's lawyers are opposing any opportunity for the stablecoin creator to offer testimony, arguing that it would be ""impossible"" to bring Kwon to the U.S. because he remains detained in Montenegro. Both South Korean and U.S. authorities have requested his extradition.

The key reason behind the move, according to CoinShares, is the rally in prices fueled by growing optimism the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  ""We do believe a spot-based ETF is now highly likely in the coming months, and will represent a step-change for the industry from a regulatory perspective,"" said James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research.

42419310,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBcD,1698681600,OKX Latest Proof of Reserves Shows Exchange Over-collateralized,"It's the one-year anniversary of Proof of Reserves (PoR) becoming a post-FTX industry norm, and OKX's latest published PoR shows the exchange has $12.5 billion in assets and is over-collateralized.  OKX's now 12-month-long series of PoRs shows the exchange has maintained a reserve ratio exceeding 100% for the last year in the market's 22 most important assets, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tether (USDT), the company wrote in a blog post.  ""Customers often express concerns in person about centralized exchanges, highlighting issues with security, solvency and downtimes, even if they don't always voice these concerns digitally,"" OKX Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Raifique points to a consensus amongst OKX users. According to a survey it did earlier this year, 84% said that publishing Proof of Reserves is very important to assuaging fears of solvency.  Nic Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, has ranked OKX highly using his PoR valuation framework. Carter, however, did note that OKX could improve their score within that framework by improving language in its Terms of Service that specifically outlines the segregation of client funds and operating capital.  Then there's the use of custodians by exchanges, which entered the spotlight post-FTX. Japanese customers, for instance, were quickly made whole due to rules the nation's regulators made in the aftermath of Mt. Gox, which required the use of third-party custodians to segregate customer funds. Others didn't fare as well.  Rafique explained that OKX uses a ""hybrid custody model"" that incorporates cold wallets – air-gapped and contained within OKX's control – and warm wallets, which are stored with third-party custodians.  ""In the future, we will likely have more custody partners based on jurisdictions or customer type,"" he said. ""For instance, we might use one custody partner for institutional clients and another for retail clients due to differing use cases.""  Are DEX's Eating the Lunch of Centralized Exchanges?  Although in the immediate aftermath of FTX there was a concern that Sam Bankman-Fried had made the case for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) – and those fears still resonate with some consumers – the data shows that centralized exchanges (CEXs) are very much alive and well.  ""I think there are advantages of being a centralized exchange for a trader for an investor,"" Rafique said. ""Centralized exchanges have the ability to work with market makers and cater to a diverse customer base, including retail, institutional, and high net worth customers, while also having better order execution efficiency due to centralized order matching.""  One advantage that DEXs have over their centralized counterparts is that they allow traders to beta-test assets that might not be ready for a prime-time.  ""DEXs allow for the trading of newer assets that might not be immediately available on centralized exchanges, which typically offer these assets once they mature and have a built community,"" he continued.  For now, DEXs and centralized exchanges are complimentary, he said, and not in competition with one another.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/30/okx-latest-proof-of-reserves-shows-exchange-overcollateralized,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7af27a5b42bca78491b6760bc8ff9049bdc5d372-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, considering macro conditions like rising interest rates, a sinking stock market, and mounting ting debt, bears aren’t ready to throw in the towel. But they might want to after seeing this chart. Bitcoin Price Chooses A Direction: Up And Away Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are normally notoriously volatile. But volatility has dwindled to next to nothing since the FTX collapse struck. Few have been willing to take the risk on BTC and altcoins while macro conditions are this on the edge of collapse. It resulted in a big move off the bottom, but also more than six months of consolidation and confusion. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Price Could Double To $60K In A Flash But after several months of sideways price action, Bitcoin appears to have chosen a direction and broke out to form a new trend. Bears, however, remain stubbornly short per market sentiment. Bearish traders might want to reconsider their positioning after taking a look at the Directional Movement Index. There is no denying: Bulls are in charge | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bullish Directional Movement Is Anything But Average The Directional Movement Index is typically found bundled with the Average Directional Index, and consists of a negative and a positive directional indicator. The tool’s premise is simple: when DI+ (green) is above DI- (red) the asset is bullish and DI- is above DI+ when bearish. This technical analysis indicator is currently showing the DI+ soaring, while the DI- is falling and below the 20 line. The 20 line is notable more for the ADX, which isn’t pictured. When the ADX rises above 20, the tool suggests a trend is active and strengthening. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Could Buck Downtrend With Move To $42,000 Bitcoin isn’t above 20 on the weekly yet, but has begun to do so on lower timeframes. With how strong the recent move was, the ADX could confirm above 20 over the next week or two. At that point, bears might finally be forced to concede that a new bull trend has blossomed.

The sudden upward trajectory of these digital assets has raised questions about the underlying factors driving this extraordinary momentum. While the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly expanded in recent times, its intersection with the world of cryptocurrencies has become a focal point of interest and speculation. The surge in AI crypto coins, including Injective (INJ), The Graph (GRT), Render (RNDR), and Fetch.ai (FET), has been remarkable over the past 24 hours and the last seven days. Notably, Fetch.ai (FET) has surged by an impressive 55.16%, followed closely by Injective (INJ) at 43.86%, Render (RNDR) at 28.19%, and The Graph (GRT) at 21.93%. These substantial gains indicate a growing trend in the market, reflecting an increasing demand for AI-focused digital assets. Investors are drawn to the potential of these tokens, recognizing the unique opportunities they present within the ever-evolving landscape of AI technology and blockchain integration. Related Reading: Ethereum Resilient Above $1,800 Pre-FOMC Meeting – Details The Artificial Intelligence Advantage In The Crypto Space The recent surge in AI crypto coins can be attributed to various factors, including the rapidly expanding influence of AI technology across diverse sectors. The marriage of AI and cryptocurrencies presents a promising synergy, with AI’s capabilities enhancing the efficiency and security of various blockchain-based systems. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, AI crypto coins leverage advanced algorithms and data-driven insights to optimize performance and facilitate more robust decision-making processes. Furthermore, the growing investment interest in AI startups by tech giants such as Google and Amazon has significantly fueled the momentum behind AI-focused digital assets. Google’s recent $2 billion investment in Anthropic, an AI startup, and Amazon’s substantial $4 billion investment in the same company in September have sent a clear signal to the market. These investments not only demonstrate the confidence of tech industry leaders in the potential of AI but also underscore the significance of AI’s integration with various technological domains, including the cryptocurrency space.

Also, on the weekly chart, DOGE shows signs of a breakout pattern as more buyers continue to accumulate the tokens. According to crypto analyst Ali Chart, Dogecoin has broken out of a multi-year descending triangle pattern on the weekly chart. The analyst believes this confirms a buy signal for the asset on the weekly timeframe, making its future outlook bullish. DOGE Breaks Out Of Descending Triangle Pattern DOGE entered a descending triangle pattern from July 2023 as bearish conditions in the market forced a decline. However, the buyers forced a breakout from this pattern in October as the general market moved into an uptrend. Remarkably, DOGE flipped the $0.067 resistance level into support, rallying to the $0.071 resistance level. Furthermore, DOGE has formed two consecutive green candles on the weekly chart, confirming its break out of the descending triangle. Related Reading: Ethereum Resilient Above $1,800 Pre-FOMC Meeting – Details Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a value of 51.8 in the neutral zone and moving sideways. It implies that while the buyers are dominant, some traders are beginning to make a profit, leading to a slight decline. However, if the RSI moves to 55, the buyers will likely resume the accumulation phase. Also, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line, displaying a buy signal on the weekly chart. Moreover, the green Histogram bars confirm that the buyers are not yet done with the accumulation of DOGE. If DOGE breaks above the $0.071 resistance level, it will likely continue on its rally in the coming weeks. Whale Movement Aiding Dogecoin’s Price Gains According to the crypto tracking platform Whale Alert, a dormant address holding over 5.39 million DOGE tokens valued at $372,461 has been reactivated. Notably, this address remained inactive for almost 10 years, with its last activity in 2013 when DOGE launched in the public market. Whale Alert confirmed that this whale transferred 392,000 DOGE to a new blockchain address. Also, a massive 350 million DOGE tokens were transferred to the crypto exchange Robinhood on October 27 from a whale address. These transfers are likely aiding Dogecoin’s rally in the past week due to increased on-chain activity. Also, the general price uptick in the crypto market led to a rally for meme coins. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Uniswap’s UNI As The Next Coin Primed For Breakout Furthermore, Dogecoin’s profile as one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap is aiding its price rally.

42419319,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBjR,1698673974,"Sam Bankman-Fried Grilled by Prosecutor, Who Points Out Contradictions in His Testimony","NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried's risky choice to testify in his fraud and conspiracy trial exposed him to a tough line of questions Monday from prosecutors, focused on a core question: Did the former FTX crypto mogul lie to customers, investors, the public and even Congress?  Following dozens of questions from Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, Bankman-Fried said he did not remember telling FTX customers that his exchange was a safe place to trade, that customers would be protected or that Alameda Research (his trading firm that played a central role in the former billionaire's demise) did not have special privileges on the platform.  Unfortunately for him, the U.S. Department of Justice has receipts; Bankman-Fried's prolific tweeting caught up with him. Sassoon repeatedly cornered the FTX founder on his public statements both before and after the crypto empire's collapse about his involvement in Alameda and the safety of FTX customer assets.  The prosecutor immediately demonstrated that what he was saying in public diverged from his private statements, whether it was about the role of regulators or about the strength of FTX's risk engine, which was one of the exchange's internal tools intended to prevent major losses by automatically liquidating untenable positions.  While Bankman-Fried was more careful in his replies on Monday than he was Thursday when testifying without jurors present – many of his Monday answers were initially just variations of ""yes"" or ""no"" – he still gave off the impression he resented having to answer some of these questions.  The former FTX CEO was less loquacious during cross, dishing out curt, one-word affirmatives and the occasional denial. When he spoke about his companies' operations in more than just those clipped utterances, his answers usually riffed on the same chord: He simply couldn't remember what he’d said prior to his companies' collapses.  Around 30 minutes into his cross-examination on Monday, Sassoon asked Bankman-Fried repeatedly if he publicly said FTX's international arm was ""safe relative to other crypto exchanges."" Sassoon offered to jog his memory, summoning a message Bankman-Fried tweeted to his followers in August 2021: ""As always, our users' funds and safety come first."" After several non-answers, including one where he said he didn't understand what she was referring to, even Judge Lewis Kaplan told Bankman-Fried to just answer the questions being asked.  But the main theme of Sassoon's rapid-fire questioning on Monday was clear: Bankman-Fried was not telling customers or investors the truth when discussing Alameda's access to FTX, his role overseeing the company or the safety of customers' assets.  To this point, Sassoon pulled up multiple exhibits listing both his public and private statements saying Alameda operated by ""the same rules as other traders"" – which wasn't true, the DOJ has spent weeks arguing in court.  The early hours of the government's cross-examination were punctuated by quips from the government's lawyers that might have felt out of pocket at other criminal trials. At one point, when Sassoon proposed showing a piece of evidence to the jury, one of Bankman-Fried's lawyers piped up to remind the court that the evidence be entered ""not for its truth"" but rather for the simple fact that the defendant had said it.  Sassoon agreed with the defense: The evidence – Bankman-Fried's sworn testimony before Congress – did indeed contain ""inaccurate"" statements from the defendant, she offered dryly.  The ghost of publicity tours past  Following the collapse of his crypto empire last year, Bankman-Fried couldn't seem to keep quiet. Instead, to the possible chagrin of his lawyers, the FTX founder went on a media blitz – seemingly desperate to dish out his side of the story to practically anyone who would listen, be they journalists, Twitter personalities, or vexed crypto traders.  Bankman-Fried's post-collapse press tour came back to bite him on Monday, with the bulk of his exchanges with Sassoon following a strikingly similar pattern. Sassoon would ask the defendant a question: ""In private, you said things like 'f**k regulators, didn't you?"" Bankman-Fried would issue a response to the effect of ""I don't recall saying that,"" or in the case of the comment disparaging regulators: ""I said that once.""  Then, whether Bankman-Fried could remember making a statement or not, Sassoon would jump to show the jury her corroborating evidence – like the defendant's ill-advised, viral text exchange with a Vox reporter expressing his distaste for regulators.  Sassoon's grilling excerpted interviews with Good Morning America's George Stephanopoulos, the New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin and Bloomberg's Zeke Faux, among others – just a handful of the journalists Bankman-Fried spoke to in the immediate wake of FTX's collapse.  At least five journalists were physically present at New York's Southern District courthouse on Monday when their names were included in evidence shown to the jury.  SBF's lawyer wraps up questioning him  Before Sassoon's cross-examination, Bankman-Fried's lawyer finished up questioning him earlier Monday.  Continuing a trend from Friday, when Bankman-Fried's lawyers kicked off their direct examination, the FTX founder corroborated some details from company insiders who testified against him earlier in the trial while providing alternate explanations – downplaying his culpability – for certain key events.  Toward the end of his defense lawyer's questioning, Bankman-Fried walked the jury through the events of August through November of 2022, when FTX rapidly descended into bankruptcy.  Bankman-Fried zoomed in on the aftermath of a Nov. 2, 2022, CoinDesk scoop that revealed Alameda's secretly precarious financial position, characterizing the events that followed as a ""run on the bank,"" an interpretation that prosecutors moved to strike for the jury. (It was the same phrase former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling used to explain his company's spectacular collapse to Congress more than 20 years ago; he ended up serving 12 years in prison for fraud.) The defendant rephrased his description as a ""run on FTX,"" which the judge accepted.  Bankman-Fried also defended an infamous subsequent Twitter thread shown by prosecutors in which he told the world that ""assets are fine"" – a seeming plea to slow down withdrawals from the platform just days before it filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, and failed to return billions of dollars in user deposits.  Bankman-Fried has argued throughout his testimony that he had a vague picture of his empire's finances in the run-up to FTX and Alameda's collapse, and he said that by November 2022, when he tweeted, he still believed that FTX didn't have any ""hole"" in its balance sheet, and Alameda still had assets in excess of liabilities.  Bankman-Fried's read on the direness of the situation only changed a few days after his tweet thread, he testified, when key assets on Alameda's balance sheet – namely FTX's FTT token and Solana's SOL token – dropped drastically in price.  SBF started testifying to jurors on Friday  The one-time crypto exchange CEO began sharing his story with a jury of New Yorkers on Friday, arguing that FTX's collapse was the result of mistakes, including by some of his lieutenants who held key positions running the companies, including former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison. He'd previously testified before Judge Kaplan on Thursday without jurors present, though much of that testimony won't make its way to the jury.  ""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market, an exchange that would combine the elements that we thought were best from traditional financial products with the elements we thought were best from the big crypto ecosystem, that it could move the – move the ecosystem forward,"" he testified Friday. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that.""  The MIT graduate walked through his work at Jane Street and the origin of FTX and Alameda, before delving into some of the missteps he said led to last year's bankruptcy. These included Alameda's lack of hedges against the risks it was exposed to.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Throws Caroline Ellison Under Bus in Testimony  Bankman-Fried also walked through some of his companies' investments, his political donations and other issues prosecutors have said show he intended to defraud his customers and investors. At points, the FTX founder seemed to contradict testimony provided by government witnesses – namely, his friends and former executives like Ellison and FTX Head of Engineering Nishad Singh.

Under the plan, Animoca will build Web3 service capabilities with global commercial applications alongside NEOM to support its aspirations as a futuristic tech hub.  A prominent name in the Web3 investment sector over a number of years, Animoca was valued at $6 billion in July 2022 with Singapore's state investment fund Temasek among its backers. The firm was targeting a raise of $2 billion for its metaverse fund the following November, however expectations were tamped significantly after the collapse of FTX, and Animoca reduced the target to $800 million in March 2023.  Animoca is now attracting investment from state-backed funds once again in what may be a sign of a turning tide in the Web3 venture capital sector amidst broader indications of the crypto winter thawing.

The timing of the transfer is interesting, as Bitcoin is currently trading in a range and is looking to break the $35,000 resistance level. The big question is whether the whale behind the transfer plans to hold or sell, but recent price action points to the former. Massive Amount Of BTC Leaves Binance Recent data has shown Bitcoin trading volume on crypto exchanges recently hit its highest point since March, as trading activity increased in the overall crypto market. Whale activity, in particular, has grown exponentially.

This massive movement of digital currency has led analysts to speculate about the implications. JUST IN: 19,197 Bitcoin ($652M) has been withdrawn from Binance — Whale (@WhaleChart) October 29, 2023 Some believe transactions like these signal that whales see bullish things ahead for Bitcoin and want to hold their assets using their own private keys. Now, while the whale tracker didn’t provide the transaction address for an in-depth analysis, the transfer was probably into a cold wallet. This is most likely the case as on-chain data points to an ongoing intense buying pressure from the bulls to drive up Bitcoin’s price. Trigger For Bitcoin Recovery? When large amounts of BTC are moved off exchanges, it shows that investors are holding their coins long-term. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $34,611, and its price action is forming a flag in a 4-hour chart timeframe. Using the Fib indicator, a breakout above $35,000 puts the next target at $38,000. A more convincing breakout might bring the price of Bitcoin to $40,000. On the other hand, the creation of a lower low below $33,500 would render the flag invalid, and we’d most likely witness a retracement from that point to $31,000.

42392174,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2F3L,1698669929,"Bitcoin Shows No Signs of Overheating, Despite Doubling This Year: Analysis","Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has doubled this year to over $34,000. Still, the market shows no signs of overheating, a positive sign for traders anticipating unabated gains, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  The firm’s view is based on an on-chain indicator called the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, which measures the spread between bitcoin’s market capitalization and realized capitalization.  The ratio currently stands at 170% or significantly lower than the 300% threshold, historically marking major market tops.  ""The bitcoin market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio shows that despite reaching yearly highs, bitcoin is not as overheated yet as during previous bull markets,"" blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter.  “Historically, bitcoin bull markets have peaked around 300%+ MVRV, which, in comparison to the current 150% value, suggests the bull market has room to run further,” IntoTheBlock added.  Market capitalization refers to the total dollar value of the supply in circulation, as calculated by the daily average price across major exchanges. The realized value, considered a relatively better gauge of fair value, approximates the value paid for all existing coins by adding the market value of coins when they change hands through an on-chain transaction.  Very high values indicate bitcoin's market price is overvalued relative to its realized or fair value, while extremely low values suggest otherwise.  Another factor suggesting bitcoin's peak may be higher than the recent high of $35,000 is the low investor interest in trading meme cryptocurrencies like SHIB.  While bitcoin has surged 27% this month, the notional open interest or dollar value locked in the number of active SHIB perpetual contracts on Binance remains flat at around $35 million, according to Coinglass data. Past data show that bitcoin peaks when meme coin frenzy grips the market, with open interest in SHIB rising above $100 million.  That said, investors should be vigilant about the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions and continued oil rally, with prices topping $100 per barrel. These developments could lead to broad-based risk aversion and put downward pressure on bitcoin.  “Macro forces and potential black swans could bring a correction following the recent appreciation,” IntoTheBlock noted.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/30/bitcoin-shows-no-signs-of-overheating-despite-doubling-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/444d082332486dde0f14efbcc67da1bcca5efa54-5000x3750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392173,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2F8T,1698668700,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Ticks Along Above $34K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in the same buoyant mood that saw it gain around 15% last week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has held steady above $34,000 in Asian and European trading hours, sitting at just over $34,500, up about 1% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, is up around 1.4% on the day and over 11% in the past week. The crypto market’s upward trajectory has been carried by enthusiasm at the prospect of a BTC spot ETF finally being approved in the U.S., though this week eyes may turn to the Fed’s interest-rate decision. ""While a pause seems the most likely scenario, with cuts seemingly still a while away, crypto watchers will no doubt be seeing this as another pivotal milestone as the crypto winter continues to thaw,"" Simon Peters, a markets analyst at eToro wrote in an emailed bulletin. Should crypto’s rally hold firm against a neutral Fed announcement, it could be a sign of further thawing and increased resilience in digital assets.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is now the second-largest bitcoin futures exchange, with only Binance holding a greater market share, according to data from Coinglass. Notional open interest (OI) – the value locked in the number of active or open contracts – on CME reached $3.54 billion compared with Binance’s $3.83 billion. Open interest in CME’s cash-settled futures contracts surpassed 100,000 BTC for the first time and the exchange’s share in the BTC futures market rose to a lifetime high of 25%. The ascent of a regulated, mainstream financial exchange is a sign for some observers that the recent rally in the crypto market is institutionally led.  Thai bank Kasikorn, also known as K-Bank, said it has acquired a 97% stake in crypto exchange Satang at a valuation of 3.705 billion Thai baht ($102.8 million), a month after the creation of its $100 million fund targeting Web3 and fintech investments. Following the closure of the deal, Satang will be re-branded to Orbix, along with three new subsidiaries: Orbix Custodian, fund manager Orbix Invest and blockchain tech developer Orbix Technology. K-Bank rival Siam Commercial Bank has also been targeting inroads into the digital asset industry, last month inking a partnership with Hashed, one of Thailand’s biggest Web3 investors.  Chart of the Day  The year-on-year percentage change in the U.S. consumer price index from 2013 to date looks eerily similar to the 1970s.  If history is a guide, inflation may rebound in the coming months, boosting demand for perceived store-of-value assets.  Bitcoin, widely considered digital gold, is set to undergo its fourth mining-reward halving in April next year. Reward halvings have historically presaged major bull runs.

The report said an e-HKD could add unique value to the payments ecosystem, but further investigation is needed.  A retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) could add value to the payments ecosystem and enable new types of economic transactions, but further investigation and evaluation are required to determine large-scale and real-life applications, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said.  The authority has not decided whether to introduce a digital Hong Kong dollar, or e-HKD, according to a report published after phase 1 of a pilot program. But Hong Kong's ambitions to become a virtual-asset hub have been apparent ever since it implemented a new regulatory regime in June. It granted the first set of licenses for crypto trading platforms in August. The HKMA embarked on the feasibility study known as Project e-HKD in 2021.  The report said the pilot found that an e-HKD could add value in three main areas – programmability, tokenization and atomic settlement – with the potential to facilitate faster, more cost-efficient and more inclusive transactions. However, the program's 14 pilots with 16 participating firms were conducted on a small scale under a controlled environment, the report said.  ""The potential and prerequisites for realising such unique value at scale to substantiate the issuance of an e-HKD are subject to market development and further investigation,"" the report said. ""Minor frictions identified during the pilots could become more apparent or even unacceptable to users in the production environment.""  Phase 1 of the pilot involved diving into full-fledged payments, programmable payments, offline payments, tokenized deposits, settlement of Web3 transactions and settlement of tokenized assets. Hong Kong will now ""explore new use cases for an e-HKD and delve deeper into select pilots.""  This will involve understanding the e-HKD's role in facilitating new ways of transacting goods and services while ensuring financial stability.  The bank's position on a retail CBDC appears to be in the middle of a multinational debate. The U.S. hasn't made any major decision on CBDCs, with the subject becoming a controversial presidential election issue; India has gone ahead with plans for a retail CBDC and Australia has said its CBDC is likely some years away because of unresolved issues.

The resurgence of the DeFi market is based on two factors: rising asset prices and fresh inflows from participants that aim to generate a yield through staking and lending.  Over the past two weeks, ether [ETH], the asset that underpins the majority of the DeFi market, has rallied from $1,590 to $1,810, while the likes of lido [LDO] and aave [AAVE] have posted 25% and 34% moves to the upside respectively.  Alongside a hike in asset prices, transactional volume across DeFi protocols rose to its highest point since March, with $4.4 billion recorded on Oct. 24, according to DefiLlama.  Solana’s most extensive lending protocol, Marinade, experienced a 120% jump in total value locked (TVL) this month following the release of its native staking product, which offers yields of 8.15% APY to complement its 7.7% rate on liquid staking. Marinade’s rival protocol, Jito, has risen by 190% to $168 million in TVL in the same period.  On Ethereum, meanwhile, the amount of capital on Enzyme Finance, Spark and Stader have all risen by between 37% and 55%, outpacing the rise in asset prices to illustrate fresh inflows.  Recently released layer one blockchains Sui and Aptos have also experienced positive growth this month, TVL on Sui has jumped from $34 million to $75 million. Aptos has been spurred by increased activity on lending platform Thala, with its overall TVL also hitting the $75 million mark this month.  Despite a fruitful month, risks remain across the DeFi sector, as even the slightest slide in the price of ETH would trigger notable on-chain liquidations. Currently, there is a $76.2 million position on Aave that will be liquidated if ETH crosses $1,777, with over $100 million set to be liquidated if the price falls by 20%.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | APT,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/30/defi-market-recovers-from-30-month-low-as-volume-hits-highest-point-since-march,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49b6622ade0b7b8b26a3b3bb520fd941111b02a5-1542x866.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19602008,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558203,1698667244,XRP Price Breakout Soon? Analyst Points To Bullish Structural Signs,"In a detailed analysis shared on social media today, renowned crypto analyst Egrag points to several bullish indicators in the XRP price structure, suggesting the potential for an imminent breakout. Egrag evaluated various timeframes, identifying a series of technical patterns and formations that bolster the bullish outlook. XRP Shows Strong Bullish Structural Signs “Last week’s candle closed within the confines of the Yellow structural formation,” Egrag tweeted with regard to the weekly XRP/USD chart, emphasizing the significance of recent movements within the timeframe. This observation is instrumental in understanding the underlying market structures influencing the upcoming price action. Related Reading: SEC Demands $700 Million Settlement From Ripple, Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals Next Steps The implication? If another weekly candle were to affirm its position within this formation, the odds of a bullish trend continuation could significantly increase. “To confirm a bullish trend continuation, we need to see another weekly candle close with a full body inside this structure,” Egrag added. Next, his insights extend further to the three-day chart, where he keenly observes, “In just 16 hours, XRP is poised to complete the second full body candle within the structural formation, signaling a strong bullish sentiment.” This near-term projection underscores a sense of momentum that appears to be building within the XRP market. The 1-day chart, too, garnered Egrag’s scrutiny. He highlighted the imminent completion of the seventh full-body candle within the current structure, stating this indicates an “extremely bullish trend.” This observation suggests that XRP’s bullish behavior isn’t just a fleeting phenomenon but has consistency across varying timeframes. For traders with a penchant for shorter timeframes, Egrag’s insights into the 12-hour chart are particularly salient. While there have been multiple closures within the structural formation, he singled out the importance of the ongoing momentum: “The current candle and the next one are pivotal as they form a symmetrical triangle.” Related Reading: XRP Price Could Blast Off In 18 Days, Here’s Why He elaborated on the implications of this pattern, saying, “Typically, symmetrical triangle breakouts have a 50/50 chance, making this a decision point for XRP.” XRP Price Targets Circling back to a tweet from October 27, Egrag had demarcated significant price zones, highlighting the “$0.54 to $0.58” range as a make-or-break threshold. Beyond this, he indicated the “$0.63-$0.70” range as a pivotal indicator of market sentiment shifts. For those with an eye on the psychological dimensions of trading, Egrag’s mention of the “0.93-$1” bracket is noteworthy. He cautioned traders about this zone, advising them to “Stick to your plan and resist the temptation to let emotions or impatience dictate your actions.” In sum, Egrag’s comprehensive analysis blends technical data with trader sentiment and psychology, providing a nuanced and detailed perspective for those invested in XRP. The coming days are likely to be watched with bated breath as traders anticipate the next big move. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5595.

OPNX is associated with three crypto entrepreneurs with a history of helming bankrupt companies: Mark Lamb of CoinFLEX; and Su Zhu and Kyle Davies of defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

19599934,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558191,1698663650,"Ethereum Resilient Above $1,800 Pre-FOMC Meeting – Details","Ethereum (ETH), one of the leading cryptocurrencies, is displaying remarkable resilience in the face of recent market fluctuations. Despite experiencing relatively modest gains compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and other major altcoins, ETH has managed to consolidate its position above the $1800 mark. The big question on everyone’s mind is whether Ethereum can sustain this level or if it will succumb to the prevailing market sentiment. In the world of cryptocurrencies, prices are highly susceptible to market sentiment. Cryptocurrencies often exhibit dramatic price swings based on the emotions and perceptions of investors and traders. Positive sentiment tends to drive prices up, while negative sentiment can lead to sharp declines. In this particular instance, the catalyst for market sentiment is the upcoming US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Related Reading: Charting The Dogecoin Path: More Gains On the Horizon? The Role Of FOMC In Influencing ETH And The Crypto Market The FOMC is a key division of the US Federal Reserve responsible for setting monetary policy in the United States. One of the primary tools at its disposal is the adjustment of interest rates. When the FOMC meetings take place, the decisions made regarding interest rates can have a significant impact on various financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. If the FOMC decision leans towards a hawkish stance, implying an increase in interest rates, it could result in a surge of bearish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. In such a scenario, Ethereum sellers might exert pressure, potentially pushing the altcoin below the $1700 mark. Conversely, a dovish or unchanged policy stance could lead to a more positive sentiment, allowing ETH to maintain its current position and even experience upward momentum. Source: Coingecko As of the latest data available on CoinGecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,816, showcasing a 1.8% gain over the last 24 hours and a notable 8.8% increase over the past seven days. While these gains may appear modest when compared to the cryptocurrency market’s usual volatility, they reflect Ethereum’s capacity to maintain a steady footing in turbulent times. Related Reading: Pepe Conquers The Weekend Charts With 61% Rally – Here’s Why Ethereum currently trading at $1,826.1 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions Break Records A noteworthy development in the Ethereum ecosystem is the remarkable performance of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. These scaling solutions are designed to alleviate Ethereum’s network congestion and high gas fees. Recently, L2 solutions set a new all-time high in Total Value Locked (TVL), briefly touching $12 billion before stabilizing around $11.89 billion. This achievement surpasses the previous historic high registered back in April at $11.85 billion, signifying the increasing adoption of Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions. Source: L2Beat. With the $1,800 threshold serving as a crucial psychological barrier, the ultimate direction of Ethereum’s price movement hinges on the delicate balance between market sentiment and the decisions of key financial institutions.

Tokenization, which digitizes real-world assets using the blockchain, is all the buzz among banking giants and institutions worldwide with major economies testing bond issuance and fund tokenization to potentially improve the efficiency of global financial markets.  Project Guardian is focused on discussing the legal and accounting treatment of digital assets, identifying potential risks and gaps in policy, as well as developing common standards for digital asset market design and best practices across jurisdictions.  The project will also look to facilitate industry pilots for digital assets through regulatory sandboxes, according to MAS' announcement.

Why Uniswap Is Poised For A Breakout In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Martinez noted that the majority of UNI holders were positioned ‘Out of the Money,’ which suggests that the token was preparing for a breakout. Accompanying his post was data from the crypto analytics platform Intotheblock based on the ‘Historical In/Out of the Money’ metric. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Crypto Spot Trading Volumes Climb To 8-Month Highs The data shows that over 75% of the token holders are ‘out of the money’, which means that they were yet to break even in their investments as the average cost price at which they bought these tokens is greater than its current price. More addresses are out of the money | Source: IntoTheBlock Furthermore, the crypto analyst explained that selling pressure has gotten exhausted and that the UNI token has been able to build “an important support” level at around $4. This could serve as a lift-off point for the altcoin. Key Supply Walls UNI Needs To Break To further support his breakout theory, Martinez noted two supply walls that UNI “needs” to overcome in order to signal a bullish breakout. According to him, one of these supply walls is at $4.23, where data from Intotheblock shows that 7,000 addresses have bought 14.24 million worth of UNI. The other supply wall is at $4.45, where data from Intotheblock shows that 2,000 Uniswap addresses have accumulated 10.28 million worth of UNI. Whales and institutional players may also be aware of this potential breakout and may be looking to position themselves, as Martinez noted. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Points Out Incoming Mega Bounce, Here’s The Target The crypto analyst also recently commented on a potential Ethereum breakout. In a different post on his X platform, he said that the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap will need to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960, where data from Intotheblock showed that 1.14 million addresses bought close to 33 million ETH. Meanwhile, Martinez believes that now is a good time for people to accumulate Bitcoin based on his examination of the past two cycles from the market bottom and the present Bitcoin trend. According to him, a similar trajectory points to the next Bitcoin market top being around October 2025.

42392161,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2E3n,1698660000,Sam Bankman-Fried Implied His Friends Lied About His Role in FTX's Collapse,"Sam didn't do it. He didn't defraud anyone, he didn't steal customer funds – he just built a company which ""turned out basically the opposite"" of the product he envisioned when he founded FTX: ""A lot of people got hurt – customers, employees – and the company ended up in bankruptcy."" At least, that's his story.  ""The biggest mistake was we did not have a dedicated risk management team, we didn't have a chief risk officer,"" he told the court Friday. ""We had a number of people who were involved to some extent in managing risk, but no one dedicated to it, and there were significant oversights.""  Bankman-Fried – finally – took the stand to try and convince the 17 people overseeing his criminal fraud trial that FTX and Alameda Research's collapse were the result of screw-ups and errors, and of his hand-picked lieutenants' screw-ups and errors – not a deliberate fraud committed by the 31-year-old. Bankman-Fried's testimony echoed key parts of his attorney Mark Cohen's opening statement from the beginning of this month – issues happened because ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison didn't hedge, because FTX was a fast-moving company doing big things quickly, because a number of market shocks hit and because Sam was just one person who couldn't be everywhere or do anything. We got a preview of sorts on Thursday, but Friday was the first time we saw Bankman-Fried really present his own case for why he shouldn't go to jail.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The first half of Friday's testimony was basically ""A History of FTX, presented by Samuel Bankman-Fried."" For those following the case over the past year, nothing new. For those of us who have been tracking FTX since its founding, maybe a bit of useful detail but basically really nothing new. But we're not the intended audience – the jury is. One audience member in the overflow room, who said she did not have much familiarity with FTX or Bankman-Fried, said she found it useful. And I overheard a few people at the end of the day Friday say they found Bankman-Fried's version of events plausible.  Shortly after lunch, Bankman-Fried's defense team's strategy continued to become clearer: It's not just that Sam didn't do it, it's that the Department of Justice's key witnesses are all lying. Bankman-Fried didn't say that, of course, but that seems to be the implication with a number of details.  Take FTX's insurance fund. Former Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang told the court on Oct. 6 that this was functionally a random number that was posted to FTX's website and later posted to social media. Bankman-Fried said he did not calculate the numbers – implying what, I'm not entirely sure. My interpretation is he's implying someone else had the idea of putting a random number on the site.  Or maybe FTX's 2021 revenue. Former Head of Engineering Nishad Singh testified that Bankman-Fried directed him to find a way to show that the company had generated over $1 billion in revenue for the year, and to backdate revenue details to do so – which he ultimately did by marking staking rewards from EcoSerum to FTX's balance sheet, at Bankman-Fried's direction.  ""Sam proposed charging EcoSerum to the account that paid the interest,"" he said.  On Friday, Bankman-Fried said he ""had not thought of EcoSerum staking"" at all, and that he did not remember discussing backdating any documents tied to this.  On hedging, Bankman-Fried said he discussed Alameda's risks with Ellison, the company's CEO at the time.  ""She ultimately said that she would look into [hedging Alameda's exposure] but I interpreted her to be far less enthusiastic than I was about it,"" he said. And while he discussed hedging with her ""every month or two"" through June 2022, this ultimately never happened.  The June 2022 spreadsheet that keeps coming up this trial documenting Alameda's balances and liabilities once again showed its face (though not the infamous one that ultimately led to last year's bankruptcy). Ellison said on Oct. 11 that Bankman-Fried ""suggested I should prepare some alternative ways of presenting"" information about the figures, which led to her creating a sheet with seven alternative presentations. She later reiterated that ""it was Bankman-Fried's"" idea to do this.  On Friday, Bankman-Fried said it was Ellison who ""had thought about a few different ways of constructing"" the balance sheet.  Intriguingly, Bankman-Fried said he didn't find out about Alameda's $8 billion hole, as documented by the fiat@ftx.com account, until October of 2022.  But there are also parts that – at least as of Friday – have not yet been addressed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos asked Wang why Bankman-Fried said Alameda Research should take on loss from a MobileCoin exploit during their discussion about the insurance fund.  ""He said that FTX's balance sheets are more public than Alameda's balance sheets, that investors have access to FTX's finances but not Alameda's finances,"" Wang said. While Cohen asked Bankman-Fried about Alameda taking on the MobileCoin loss, the topic of investors having access to FTX's finances did not come up.  And Ellison had previously testified that while she and Bankman-Fried had discussed hedging Alameda's risks, and that Bankman-Fried blamed her for not hedging, in her view it was his decision to make venture investments and other financial decisions which put Alameda in an unrecoverable position by the fall of 2022.  ""I felt that the fundamental reason we were in the situation was that we had borrowed these billions of dollars in open-term loans and used them for illiquid investments,"" – all of which were Bankman-Fried's idea, she said.  Ellison had also testified that Bankman-Fried knew the only way for Alameda to pay its lenders was using the line of credit, which meant ""using FTX customer assets."" Again, these specific details did not come up.  There's also the various group chats and written documents prosecutors have tied Bankman-Fried to, such as the one Singh testified about where Bankman-Fried, Bankman-Fried's brother, former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame or political consultants organized political donations.  On Friday, Bankman-Fried said he did not direct Salame or Singh to make specific donations, but he did hire political consultants (such as Guarding Against Pandemics, which his brother helped run).  Bankman-Fried is going to continue his testimony on Monday, with Cohen estimating maybe two more hours of direct examination. Unfortunately for Bankman-Fried, and maybe the narrative he's crafting, that means that he'll again face Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon – you know, the prosecutor who figuratively punched him in the face repeatedly last Thursday – for what she described as a ""significant cross-examination."" She said she doesn't think the cross will take a day and a half but it'll certainly go into Tuesday.  — Nikhilesh De  Courtroom scenes  Bankman-Fried's eyes flickered rapidly between the jury and the back of the room throughout his testimony on Friday – not necessarily weird or unusual in and of itself, but certainly noticeable.  Bankman-Fried also continued his trend from Thursday of using many more words than he needed to answer the questions posed, to the point where a short-tempered Judge Lewis Kaplan and Cohen both tried repeatedly to just get him to answer the frickin' question please.  I've been keeping a rough tally of how many people are attending. On days without Bankman-Fried or Ellison, it's been relatively uncrowded. There was a small crowd for Ellison. On Thursday, the first day people expected Bankman-Fried to testify, there were under 70 people in line by 9:00 a.m. ET. On Friday, there were well over 100.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  The latest plan in what's frankly a pretty dynamic situation is this:  Cohen will continue his direct examination of Bankman-Fried on Monday and expects to wrap up before noon.  Sassoon will start her cross-examination and that will wrap up sometime Tuesday.  AUSA Thane Rehn anticipates a two-hour rebuttal case. In other words, that'll probably go through to the end of Tuesday.  Roos and Cohen both anticipate about two or three hours for their respective closing arguments.  There will then be a charge conference, which Judge Lewis Kaplan ""anticipate[s] might be somewhat protracted,"" which is where everyone will argue over their various proposals for jury instructions.  Judge Kaplan will deliver said instructions and jury deliberations may begin sometime Thursday, Friday or ""conceivably Monday.""  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/30/sam-bankman-fried-implied-his-friends-lied-about-his-role-in-ftxs-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392166,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2ETR,1698658661,"U.K. Publishes Final Proposals for Crypto, Stablecoin Regulation","The government published its proposals for regulating the crypto ecosystem following industry complaints it was dragging its feet  The government says it wants to make the U.K. a preferred destination for the industry.  The U.K. government published its final rules for the crypto ecosystem, saying it plans a phased introduction of regulation, with legislation for fiat-backed stablecoins being introduced early next year.  Other crypto areas, such as algorithmic stablecoins, will follow as the government brings activities like lending and trading into the fold of conventional financial regulation, according to an update published Monday. These rules will bring relevant activities under the purview of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The plans are in line with an April 2022 policy set out by Rishi Sunak, then finance minister and now prime minister, to make the U.K. a crypto-asset hub and are likely to be welcomed by an industry that has complained the government has been dragging its feet.  In a statement accompanying the document, Treasury Minister Andrew Griffith said he was ""very pleased to present these final proposals for cryptoasset regulation in the U.K."" The finalized framework would mean ""the U.K. is the obvious choice for starting and scaling a cryptoasset business.""  The Treasury, the government’s finance arm, published a crypto consultation in February and the consultation closed in April. Parliament passed the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 in June, enabling crypto to be treated like a regulated activity.  The government has already set out that it wants to bring crypto within the fold of traditional financial service regulation – but Griffith has now modified some of his proposals clarifying the treatment of cryptoassets it already considers traditional financial instruments as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  ""The proposed regime does not intend to capture activities relating to cryptoassets which are specified investments that are already regulated,"" such as traditional securities, the government document said, adding that unique NFTs that are akin to collectibles or artwork ""should not be subject to financial services regulation."" However, NFTs used as an exchange token, for example when a large number are released at once and do not vary much in price, might fall within future financial services rules.  The FCA will soon consult on an authorization regime for crypto companies, the document said. And the government also plans on formulating equivalence measures for overseas firms: An overseas-regulated trading venue could apply to authorize its U.K. branch, the government proposed, but it will be up to the FCA to determine what this looks like.  The government also said it does not intend to ban decentralized finance (DeFi), pointing out it's premature to regulate that aspect of the industry.  Further documents published by the government set out that issuance or custody of stablecoins backed by fiat currency will become regulated under existing 2001 rules designed for financial services, with further rules to ensure that any digital payment system can safely fail without bringing down the financial system. The central bank first launched its consultation on a regime for systemic stablecoins in May.  The government's plans have not been without controversy. Lawmakers in the House of Commons' Treasury Committee have previously argued that regulating the likes of bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] on the lines of conventional financial services could lull users into a false sense of security, and the government has previously rejected calls to treat crypto like gambling.  The crypto industry, meanwhile, has complained of delays and poor feedback from the FCA, while recently introduced rules restricting crypto promotions have led some well-known firms to cut U.K. services altogether.  UPDATE (Oct. 30, 10:36 UTC): Adds extra context, quote from Griffith, details of proposals in paragraphs 7-11.

The number of transactions processed on the Bitcoin blockchain involving a movement of at least $100,000 worth of BTC rose to a year-to-date high of 23,400 last week, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  The cryptocurrency's price topped the $35,000 mark last week, reaching the highest since early May 2022, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency has since traded sideways, around $34,000, boasting a 107% year-to-date gain. Prices have surged 27% this month, supposedly on the back of spot ETF optimism and increased haven demand.  ""The bitcoin spot ETF applications appear to have increased whales' and institutions' appetite for bitcoin,"" IntoTheBlock said in a newsletter on Friday. ""Transactions of over $100k had previously spiked in late June after Blackrock's ETF filing and have now surpassed that level as Bitcoin sets new yearly highs.""

19596010,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558168,1698656452,Bitcoin Price Poised For Another Surge Like Last Week: Here’s Why,"In a recent statement via X (formerly Twitter), Alex Thorn, head of firm wide research at digital asset firm Galaxy, highlighted the potential for another Bitcoin gamma squeeze similar to the one witnessed last week. BTC gained 15% last week. He remarked, “The Bitcoin gamma squeeze from last week could happen again. If BTCUSD moves higher to $35,750-36k, options dealers will need to buy $20m in spot BTC for every 1% upside move, which could cause explosiveness if we begin to move up towards those levels.” Elaborating on the mechanics, Thorn explained the behavior of dealers in relation to gamma and delta. “When dealers are short gamma and price moves up, or when they are long gamma and price moves down, they need to buy spot to stay delta neutral. Last week’s expiries will dampen potential explosiveness, but it’s still in play.” This essentially means that the actions of options dealers, driven by the need to maintain a neutral position, can amplify price movements. Will Bitcoin Price Rally Like Last Week? Thorn also emphasized the importance of on-chain data in understanding these dynamics. He mentioned a continued divergence between the supply held by long-term holders and the supply that has moved in less than 24 hours. This divergence, which has been growing over the past year, indicates a decline in on-chain liquidity, suggesting that long-term holders are not selling their holdings, potentially leading to a supply squeeze. Related Reading: Bitcoin Season: Leading The Charge In The Crypto Market Furthermore, Thorn pointed to the 4-year rolling Z-score of the ratio of market price to realized price, a variation of the MVRV ratio. This metric provides insights into Bitcoin’s valuation relative to its historical average. A high positive Z-score indicates potential overvaluation, while a negative Z-score might suggest undervaluation. Thorn’s observation that the pattern is beginning to resemble those seen before previous bull runs is particularly noteworthy. Another crucial observation made by Thorn pertains to the compression of relative cost bases. He noted a tightening pattern that has historically been observed during bear or accumulation periods that precede bull markets. This compression suggests that there is a consensus among different types of holders about the value of Bitcoin. Related Reading: The Hidden Signals: Bitcoin’s On-Chain Data Points To Bullish Outlook, But There’s A Catch Thorn’s analysis of the Bitcoin supply by the price at which each coin last moved is particularly illuminating. He observed a sparse cost basis between the current price of $34,591 and the $38,400-39,100 range. Moreover, with 83% of the supply not having moved since prices were lower than today and nearly 70% of the supply stagnant for over a year, it’s evident that long-term holders are in profit and are likely waiting for even higher prices before selling. Last week, as reported by NewsBTC, Thorn had accurately predicted a gamma squeeze. He had emphasized the significant role the options market played in influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Thorn warned, “We are approaching max pain for gamma shorts.” In summary, while Thorn does not make a direct prediction about Bitcoin’s near-term price, his analysis on X provides a comprehensive overview of the current market dynamics. The combination of potential gamma squeezes, declining on-chain liquidity, and historical patterns all point towards a favorable environment for Bitcoin bulls. At press time, BTC traded at $34,249.

Over the past two years, DOGE has exhibited a strong affinity for an ascending trendline, which has played a pivotal role as a dynamic support mechanism. This trendline, indicative of the coin’s consistent upward trajectory, has become a defining feature of the meme coin’s journey. In the last six months, the price of Dogecoin has entered a consolidation chapter, repeatedly rebounding off the ascending support trendline situated in the $0.055-$0.06 range. The significance of this pattern lies in the coin’s resilience to market fluctuations, bolstered by the unwavering support from its community of investors. Related Reading: Pepe Conquers The Weekend Charts With 61% Rally – Here’s Why As of the latest data from CoinGecko, DOGE is currently trading at $0.068750, with a 0.6% gain in the past 24 hours and an impressive 10.8% surge over the past week. This upward momentum reflects the coin’s resilience and growing appeal among traders and investors. Dogecoin Potential Upsurge A notable technical pattern that has emerged is the formation of a double bottom, signifying a potential bullish trend. This pattern suggests that DOGE’s price could experience a substantial 20% rally, contingent on buyers maintaining support above the immediate threshold of $0.067. The recent surge in meme coins, including DOGE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki Inu (FLOKI), has added to the excitement in the cryptocurrency sphere. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.0685. Chart: TradingView.com The growing enthusiasm can be attributed to the buzz surrounding the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (BTC ETF), which has sent ripples across the crypto market and turned it a vibrant shade of green. Understanding The Ascending Trendline The significance of DOGE’s affinity for the ascending trendline cannot be overstated. This trendline serves as a visual representation of the coin’s consistent bullish trajectory over the past two years. As the price of DOGE hovers in the $0.055-$0.06 range, it reaffirms the coin’s resilience and stability, making it an attractive option for both long-term and short-term investors. The formation of a double bottom pattern in DOGE’s price chart is a promising development for traders. This pattern typically suggests that the coin is on the verge of a bullish trend reversal. If buyers manage to uphold the immediate support level of $0.067, there is a potential for DOGE to embark on a significant 20% rally, offering traders an enticing opportunity for profits. Related Reading: Crystal Ball For Solana: Envisioning A Staggering 2030 Valuation DOGE’s sustained journey along its ascending trendline, coupled with the potential of a double bottom pattern, paints an optimistic picture for the coin’s future. As the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a surge in meme coin popularity, driven by the BTC ETF hype, DOGE enthusiasts eagerly await what the future holds for this beloved meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

19591952,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558120,1698649250,November Outlook For Bitcoin Price: Another Pump Or Retrace?,"November has often been a standout month for Bitcoin, with historical data indicating an impressive average price jump of 43%. This would propel Bitcoin to around $48,000. But with October already showing a significant price increase, the question arises: Will Bitcoin continue its bullish trend, or is a retrace on the horizon? November Monthly Returns November has been particularly bullish for Bitcoin over time, with an average of 43% of price increases over the years. If this trend holds true for this year, we might see Bitcoin touching $48,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Reach $170,000 in 2025 – Mathematical Model Predicts However, it’s worth noting that this very high average is significantly influenced by the extreme 453% surge in 2013. If we exclude this outlier, the average settles around 11.54% This leads to a more conservative forecast, pointing to a potential rise to around $38,000. Bitcoin monthly returns over the years. Source: intothecryptoverse Diving deeper into historical data, 8 of the past 13 years have shown price increases in November, making another increase this month seem plausible. Yet, a closer look reveals that 4 of the last 5 times in November there was a price dip. In 2022, the FTX collapse played a pivotal role and 2021 marked the peak for Bitcoin, suggesting that these decreases might be outliers rather than indicative of a changing trend. For a closer comparison, 2019 stands out as it too was a pre-halving year, just like 2023. That year, after a promising October, Bitcoin saw a 17% dip in November, which would equate to a value of $28,000 if repeated this year. Bitcoin Price Action In 2023 Through 2023, Bitcoin has demonstrated a recurring behavior following significant price increases of more than 20%. Typically, these surges have been followed by consolidation periods, and subsequently, a retrace to at least half of the initial increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Season: Leading The Charge In The Crypto Market Take January, for instance. Bitcoin’s price increased from $16,500 to $24,000, only to decline to $20,000 by March – a retrace of 60% from the initial increase. One particularly extreme example was in August when Bitcoin retraced the entirety of a prior 20% rise. Bitcoin price action in 2023. Source: BTCUSD from TradingView It’s noteworthy that these retraces haven’t always been immediate. After the rise in March, it wasn’t until June – a span of three months – that the price saw a 50% retrace. On average, this year’s price retraces have taken between 1 to 3 months to manifest post-rise. Furthermore, before any retrace occurs, there’s still room for additional upside. To illustrate, after the aforementioned March rise, Bitcoin experienced an additional 10% increase before eventually retracing the initial surge. Potential Scenarios For November Using the above, potential scenarios for November are listed below: Very bullish scenario: Bitcoin rises by 10-20%, potentially reaching up to $42,000. Bullish scenario: Bitcoin rises by 1-10%, potentially reaching up to $38,000. Bearish scenario: Bitcoin decreases by 10%, dropping to around $31,000. This would mean a 50% retrace of the surge in October. Very bearish scenario: Bitcoin decreases by 20%, dropping to around $28,000. This would mean a 100% retrace of the surge in October. In conclusion, given past trends and current market behavior, November promises to be a pivotal month for Bitcoin.

42392158,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2DtX,1698646770,CME on the Cusp of Replacing Binance as Top Bitcoin Futures Exchange,"Notional open interest on CME has risen to $3.54 billion, the second-highest among exchanges offering trading in standard bitcoin and perpetual futures.  Analysts are split on whether the CME’s rise represents increased institutional buying.  The regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is climbing ranks on the list of largest bitcoin (BTC) futures and perpetual futures exchanges by open interest in a move reminiscent of the early stages of the 2020-21 bull run.  With a notional open interest (OI) of $3.54 billion, CME is now the second-largest bitcoin futures exchange, up from the fourth position seen weeks ago, according to Coinglass. Notional open interest refers to the U.S. dollar value locked in the number of active or open contracts.  Keeping the top spot is the offshore unregulated exchange Binance, with an open interest of $3.83 billion. That’s 8% higher than the CME.  Open interest in CME’s cash-settled futures contracts recently surpassed the 100,000 BTC mark for the first time on record. Similarly, the CME’s share in the BTC futures market rose to a new lifetime high of 25%.  CME’s standard bitcoin futures contract is equivalent to 5 BTC, while the micro contract is sized at one-tenth of 1 BTC. The standard ether futures have a contract size of 50 ETH, while micro futures are equivalent to one-tenth of 1 ETH. Most open interest in offshore exchanges is concentrated in perpetual futures rather than traditional futures contracts. Perpetuals are futures with no expiry and use the funding rate mechanism to keep perpetuals in sync with the spot price.  Per some observers, CME’s ascent is a sign of an institutional-led rally. Bitcoin has risen 27% this month amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and spot ETF optimism.  Retail investors, too, seem to have played their part, as evidenced by the uptick in the futures-based ETFs. The rolling five-day volume in ProShares’ industry-leading bitcoin futures ETF jumped by a staggering 420% to $340 million last week, according to data provided by Matrixport. The ProShares ETF invests in the CME bitcoin futures.  André Dragosch, head of research at Deutsche Digital Assets, suggests otherwise. Per Dragosch, CME’s rise results from the unwinding of bearish bets on offshore exchanges.  “CME’s share in $BTC futures OI might have increased relative to other exchanges, but the aggregate amount of BTC futures & perps OI has not increased in BTC terms, implying that long futures positions were not the main driver behind the recent surge,” Dragosch said on X.  “Price spike was rather induced by short squeeze w/ a reduction in aggregate open interest,” Dragosch added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/30/cme-whisker-away-from-replacing-binance-as-top-bitcoin-futures-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c60a2ea5269958bae900451ec4d7ec71e36b796-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19589408,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558144,1698644438,Crystal Ball For Solana: Envisioning A Staggering 2030 Valuation,"A recently released report explores the future potential of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on the revival and growing influence of Solana (SOL) in the crypto market. Asset and mutual fund manager VanEck disclosed one key driver of Solana’s influence is its advancements in Smart Contract Platforms (SCPs), defined as systems that execute contracts on a blockchain without requiring third-party involvement. Although other SCP-compatible blockchains exist, such as BNB Chain and Ethereum (ETH), Solana has notably dominated this sector. VanEck’s analysis suggests that this sector, particularly SCPs, is poised for significant adoption in the future, positioning Solana as a prominent player in the blockchain industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Braces For $50 Billion Influx Following ETF Launch, Bitwise CEO Says Solana’s Dominance In Smart Contract Platforms Solana’s emergence as a dominant force in the SCP realm is reinforced by its high throughput and scalability, surpassing many existing blockchain networks. Its ability to process a high volume of transactions quickly and at a lower cost compared to some competitors has been a pivotal factor driving its influence and potential for widespread adoption. Total crypto market cap currently at $1.24 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Additionally, Solana’s ecosystem has seen a surge in decentralized applications (dApps) and projects leveraging its infrastructure, further solidifying its position as an attractive and viable platform for developers and users alike. This growing adoption and technical superiority hint at a promising trajectory for Solana, suggesting it may remain a key player in the expanding landscape of blockchain technology. The VanEck report underscored the undeniable dominance of Solana in the SCP sector. But despite these existing alternatives, none have managed to rival Solana’s current supremacy within the field. VanEck further highlighted the sector’s imminent surge in adoption, foreseeing a promising growth trajectory by 2030. Source: VanEck However, the report also emphasized the necessity of a groundbreaking application for exponential expansion. According to VanEck, among the contenders, Solana stands as the most fitting platform with the potential to fill this pivotal role, positioning itself as the likely candidate to lead the sector’s transformative growth. VanEck observed that the blockchain hosting the groundbreaking application could experience substantial benefits from the app’s generated activity. The analysis presents a scenario where Solana becomes the pioneering blockchain to support a single application that brings on board over 100 million users.

According to a filing, the deal has a valuation of 3.705 billion Thai baht ($102.8 million) and was done via a new K-Bank subsidiary called Unita Capital, which has a mandate to invest in digital assets companies.  Once the deal closes, Satang will be re-branded to Orbix. The new company will also have three additional subsidiaries: Orbix Custodian, Orbix Invest (a digital asset fund manager), and Orbix Technology, a blockchain technology developer.  The announcement comes a month after K-Bank launched a $100 million fund targeting web3, fintech, and AI. K-Bank’s rival, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is also making aggressive moves into web3 and crypto.  “K-Bank is intensifying its efforts in the cryptocurrency sector, positioning itself alongside SCB.
