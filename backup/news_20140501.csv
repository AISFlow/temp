Candidates needed at least 52 votes to be elected to a seat, however, no-one passed this voting threshold, election results show.  However, despite no candidates being elected, clear favorites for the positions did emerge.  BTC China CEO Bobby Lee received 44 votes, while venture capital Brock Pierce and Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham finished second and third in the voting, capturing 34 and 21 votes respectively.  The foundation will now hold a run-off election featuring only these three candidates.  The Bitcoin Foundation had earlier reported that 75% of its industry members had voted in the initial round, and that 102 out of the possible 137 ballots had been submitted by eligible voters.  Fifteen candidates  were nominated for position, including Huobi CEO and founder Leon Li and BitcoinBlackFriday organiser Jon Holmquist, among others. All candidates received at least one vote.  Election committee chair Brian Goss indicated that details on a planned second round of voting would be released next week.

42425617,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebdh,1398981023,Mt. Gox Settlement Decision Delayed As Trustee Seeks US Bankruptcy Approval,"The latest hearing in the ongoing legal case surrounding Mt. Gox today did not result in the approval of a proposed plan to revive the troubled Japan-based exchange, as presiding Judge Gary Feinerman decided to delay further deliberation of the matter until 13th May.  The delay was requested by the defence, which argued that the settlement would stay the litigation against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and the exchange's parent company Tibanne KK, thereby preventing these parties from fighting their case in court for an undefined period of time.  The news comes amid growing uncertainty regarding how the case will evolve in the coming months and whether a proposed effort by major bitcoin investors to revive the troubled exchange will be approved by the necessary legal authorities.  For example, on 30th April, Mt. Gox's Japan-based bankruptcy trustee told The Wall Street Journal he is looking to secure approval for the company's Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the US, as the request has not yet been formally approved.  In other news, former exchange owner Jed McCaleb, a Mt. Gox equity stakeholder who will be removed as a defendant in the class action should the proposal be approved, moved to disassociate himself from the exchange, telling ArsTechnica he was not involved in operations following the sale.  Today's hearing took place in a federal court in Chicago, Illinois.  Defence argues for extension  The hearing began with lawyer Eric Macy, the representation of Mt. Gox KK and Mark Karpeles, taking aim at the proposal, alleging that it would keep the entities involved in the lawsuits for an unspecified amount of time, thus delaying the ability for these entities to clear their names, an audio recording suggests.  Mt. Gox's legal defence further took aim at the fact that Sunlot Holdings – the firm involved in the plan to revive Mt. Gox – has not yet purchased the exchange, arguing that this ""has not happened yet"", and by extension may not become reality. Further, he alleged that it was also not clear that continued action would be sought against these parties, or as to which entities would pursue claims.  However, US class action lawyer Jay Edelson told CoinDesk he believes the claims amount to a ""crazy argument"", and that both the new Mt. Gox and the former exchange users will be able to pursue claims against Karpeles and Tibanne KK.  Edelson explained a new Mt. Gox would likely seek to sue Karpeles for employment violations, such as breach of fiduciary duties among other related concerns, while former exchange users would pursue personal claims.  However, Mt. Gox's legal defence was able to lobby for any formal decision making to be extended due to its concerns.  Chapter 15 approval  It still remains unclear what the next steps might be in the approval of the revival proposal.  The lawyer for Japanese bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi told the Journal that clarity as to the status of Mt. Gox's Chapter 15 filing would give him “more authority” over developments in the US, including the proposed Sunlot deal.  The Financial Times  has indicated that Kobayashi will at least need to give additional credibility to the deal.  Mt. Gox KK, the exchange's Japanese entity, has been awarded a preliminary relief order in the US that has thus far granted it protection from certain fact-finding.  The decision regarding whether this relief would be permanently extended was originally set for 17th June, but has been the subject of debate. A US judge had previously threatened to remove this protection should Karpeles fail to travel to the US to be formally questioned in the case.

42425625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebvh,1398979874,Canadian Exchange CAVIRTEX to Launch Bitcoin ATMs Across Canada,"Canadian digital currency exchange CAVIRTEX has announced plans to relaunch a balance deposit feature and establish a new network of branded ATMs.  The company revealed the plans in a 1st May message to customers, outlining a number of future services improvements, which include a new trading API and merchant user interface.  CoinDesk spoke with CAVIRTEX business development manager Reed Holmes, who framed the choice to relaunch the bill deposit option as a bid to make it easier for people to move their money into the marketplace:  ""We’re very excited to offer this service again. We feel like it’s something our customers really liked when we had it before, and we hope that they’re excited to see it again.""  From cash to coins  The planned in-person bill payment deposit option, which does not have a set launch date, was initially offered to customers in 2013 before being discontinued last September. Under the service, customers can make deposits via Money Mart, a consumer financial services chain.  Customers need to have a verified account to use the in-person bill payment option, which generates an invoice for the deposit amount.  Users can then bring this invoice to a Money Mart location, which processes the invoice and completes the deposit. There is a deposit limit of CA$9,500 per day, with a monthly maximum of CA$90,000.  Although there is no set launch date yet, Holmes said the company planned to accept in-person bill payments “soon”.  Plans for future ATM network  CAVIRTEX is also in the early stages of planning a bitcoin ATM network.  Holmes told CoinDesk that right now, the company is focused on researching the idea and determining how exactly the network would be composed:  “There are a lot of different moving parts there – who’s going to be operating, where are they going to be operated from – there’s quite a bit, obviously as you can imagine, that goes into it. We’re still getting all that stuff together.”  Holmes added that the company is in contact with several ATM manufacturers but has not made any purchase decisions. Additionally, CAVIRTEX has no concrete timeline for when the ATM network would begin to be deployed.  The exchange is also in the process of vetting potential ATM operators.

42377208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziTh,1398971138,How Auroracoin is Forcing Digital Currency Discussion in Iceland,"Auroracoin, dubbed 'a cryptocurrency for Iceland', has reached 10% of its total 'Airdrop' distribution goal.  Although news about the digital currency has been quiet since its nationwide dissemination, the project will soon launch a gateway that will better integrate with the country's ID system in order to streamline the process via which Icelandic residents obtain auroracoin.  Furthermore, recent developers suggest that the altcoin is quietly increasing awareness about Icelandic monetary policy, and generating new discussions about the role digital currencies can play in the country's financial future.  As an example, one of the largest banks in Iceland recently held an educational session on bitcoin, with one bank executive saying that it is closely paying attention to decentralized forms of money.  Icekey  Iceland's Islykill (Icekey) national registry provides a unique identifier that is now being used to verify Icelandic residency and thus qualification for the auroracoin Airdrop distribution.  Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson, auroracoin's founder, said that he applied to the government to integrate with this system, and it was accepted.  This means that the coins will be more widely disbursed to the people of Iceland, he explained, adding:  ""It means 100% of people will be able to claim, if they so choose. Parents will be able to claim for their children and so forth.""  The application was put in with the government weeks before Airdrop, the initiative to disburse the coins, was launched. However, there was a considerable delay in getting it approved, according to Óðinsson.  A volatile past  The auroracoin Airdrop has been able to dispense 1,049,527 coins to Icelanders so far – 10% of a total 10,500,000 AUR to be distributed, according to its official website.  Auroracoin was launched in February to raise awareness of the capital controls that have been in place in Iceland since the global financial crisis of 2008. So, far it has been proven to be an interesting economic experiment thanks to its unique distribution method, one that other altcoin creators have been quick to reproduce.  Prior to Airdrop, investors were speculating on auroracoin's future, which led to heavy trading on a relatively thin market since most of the coins were being held for distribution.  While at one time auroracoin was third in market capitalization when compared with other cryptocurrencies, it has since dropped down to 34th overall, according to Coinmarketcap.com.  That speculation in auroracoin resulted in a huge price spike prior to Airdrop with the value of one coin exceeding $97 in early March before beginning a long slide downward.  After the Airdrop disbursement initiated on March 25, the price of auroracoin dropped by 50% as those receiving coins cashed them out – mostly for bitcoin on digital currency exchanges.  Novel approach  Auroracoin planned to give each person in Iceland with a registered Icekey number 31.8 AUR, available via a registration page on its website that was only accessible in Iceland. The day prior to Airdrop's initial distribution on 25 March, those coins would have been worth $385.  Today, with the auroracoin price at approximately $0.56, the same amount is worth less than $20.  A number of people within the industry had mixed opinions on whether auroracoin's unique method of distributing coins would be effective. Even more of an issue was the true utility of the coin as a form of value.  The main concern some levied is that auroracoin is not permissible as a form of payment in Iceland, which might make it a purely speculative instrument and not an alternative to the country's national currency, the krona.  Effectively, the Icelandic government's heavy-handed control of the country's banking sector means the krona is the only legal payment option within the country right now.  So, people aren't spending auroracoin, and instead they are selling it. The main factor that leads to this conclusion is that heaviest trading for auroracoin didn't occur in its speculative pre-Airdrop phase. It actually happened the week after the coin was released to Iceland residents, who then promptly cashed them out.  Banks investigate bitcoin  While Iceland's parliament has been discussing what to do about auroracoin and other digital currencies, one of the country's largest banks, Íslandsbanki, recently held an educational session on the subject of bitcoin.  Held by Íslandsbanki's wealth management unit, the event was reportedly one of the first to ever publicly discuss digital currencies in Iceland. The meeting was held in a Reykjavik concert hall, just down the street from the country's central bank.  A number of Íslandsbanki executives spoke, and there were some panels consisting of economists and leaders from the country's payments industry. One attendee at the event was able to provide translated quotes to CoinDesk.  Sverrir Þorvaldsson, the director of risk at Íslandsbanki, told the audience early on:  ""The bank is not a participant in the bitcoin community in any way, but we keep a watchful eye.""  During the session, Þorvaldsson later added that bitcoin's value is still deeply tied to traditional money:  ""I think it is interesting to shine a light on the role of these exchanges for bitcoin, and the fact that it seems that these coins are still very dependent on people being able to exchange them for traditional currencies.""  Þorvaldsson aslo mentioned auroracoin, saying that its ties to government-backed money is also the reason it is successful.  Capital controls  Íslandsbanki holding a meeting about bitcoin is significant since Iceland's capital controls limit the ability for financial institutions to have access to global markets. And those restrictions have largely insulated the country from cyrptocurrencies before aurorcoin was launched.  During the global financial crisis in 2008, global cross-border capital flows were reduced significantly.  Although it did trend back up in 2010, capital flows have gone back down during the past few years that such information has been available.  This is an interesting metric that can only be attributed to government-backed money since decentralized forms of value have no borders and are currently not encumbered by banks susceptible to monetary policy.  Iceland's capital controls were enacted to protect the country's interests from outside forces and create a stronger internal economic environment.  Óðinsson, auroracoin's founder, thinks that the restrictions have gone on for far too long:  ""The longer the capital controls remain in place, the harder it will be to get rid of them. They were only supposed to last a few months initially, now we are closing in on six years.""

42377196,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziDL,1398967055,Robocoin to Rebrand Bitcoin ATMs as Online Bank Branches,"Las Vegas, Nevada-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin has announced it will soon launch Robocoin Bank, a new project that will find its physical bitcoin ATMs becoming Robocoin Bank branches that integrate online banking features.  Robocoin indicates that Robocoin Bank will incorporate new features such as cryptographic provable reserves, instant bitcoin-to-cash withdrawals and the ability to send cash internationally as part of an effort to build what it calls ""banking and remittance 2.0"".  Jordan Kelley, CEO of Robocoin, told CoinDesk that the new service brings the company closer to its original goal of making bitcoin more user-friendly for mass-market consumers and the underbanked, adding:  ""We realized very quickly that we needed to build an online bank. That way our customers don't have to worry about private keys anymore.""  Bitcoin as a backbone  By adding functionality and terminology that is similar to an existing service, online banking, Kelley noted that he hopes to remove the complexity and pain points associated with bitcoin transactions, instead using the technology as a backbone for more traditional financial services:  ""The idea that bitcoin is going to be this big game-changer for remittance is absolutely factual, however, thinking that a Mexican immigrant is going to be sending bitcoin back to his family is really far-fetched.""  Kelley indicated users will now be able to send both bitcoin and fiat currency to recipients using any Robocoin branch. After money is sent, recipients will receive an SMS confirming the transaction and can then withdraw the funds at a local machine.  Operators, Kelley said, will gain increased information about their customers, as they will now know where money is being sent via their machines.  ATMs rebranded  With the launch Robocoin is also rebranding a number of its existing services. For example, Robocoin Kiosks will now be referred to by the company as Robocoin Bank Branches.  The company is also updating the terminology related to how consumers interact with its devices to bring clarity to its service changes. Robocoin noted that consumers will no longer 'buy' and 'sell' bitcoins on the service, but rather deposit and withdraw bitcoin or fiat currency.  Further, customer public bitcoin addresses will now be referred to as Robocoin accounts, where customers store and access their wealth using a combination of their phone number, PIN number and biometric identification, explained Kelley, adding.  ""The phone is now acting as the username, the PIN that customers create is the first part of the password and their palm is password part two. My bitcoin is now accessible from the online banking portal or any ATM around the world.""  About Robocoin  The company is one of several in an increasingly competitive marketplace which includes Lamassau, both of which recently launched ATMs operating in London.  Robocoin has also run into its share of problems. Most notably, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisor Commission moved to block its efforts to launch ATMs in that country, saying that the required authorization would not be granted if requested by the company.

42374514,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCbN,1398954203,How Deep Web Scams Helped Silk Road 2.0 Turn Crisis into Opportunity,"The online trade in illicit drugs is bigger than ever, according to a new report published this week.  This is despite the closure of the original Silk Road marketplace by the FBI in October last year, and a crisis in the Internet's underworld following arrests, scams and hacking attacks.  Last Sunday, CoinDesk reported on how, when US authorities closed Silk Road and arrested its alleged mastermind Ross Ulbricht, it didn’t spell the end for online drugs markets. Silk Road reopened, new marketplaces quickly materialised, and existing ones grew to accommodate displaced buyers and sellers.  Now, despite the theft of thousands of bitcoins in February, Silk Road 2.0 is seeing an influx of customers jaded by scams and hacks on other sites, and trade is even better than in the heyday of the original site.  Underworld shocks  The thoroughly researched report released yesterday by the Digital Citizens Alliance – an organization that campaigns on Internet safety – provides a history of the anonymous deep web marketplaces, background on the main players, statistics about the online illicit drug economy and more.  It explains that once Silk Road was shut down, other marketplaces stood to profit as newly 'homeless' users and sellers drifted over. Black Market Reloaded (BMR) and Sheep Market, they say, were key players.  Soon afterwards, another similar site, Atlantis, closed in what many considered a scam that left it holding customers' bitcoins. Around this time, version 2.0 of Silk Road got up and running again – but this time playing catch-up.  Both Sheep Market and BMR benefitted greatly from these tumultuous events, the report explains, adding:  ""Within two weeks of Ulbricht’s arrest, the sites experienced serious growth. BMR saw the number of drug listings rise from 3,075 to 5,104, representing a 70% increase, while Sheep Marketplace showed explosive growth with the number of drug listings increasing from 855 to 4,165-an almost 400% increase.""  However, in late 2013, Sheep Market ""committed the largest scam in the history of anonymous drug markets,"" it says.  Like Atlantis, it went offline for good, alleging that it had been robbed of $6m in bitcoins by one of its sellers via a security vulnerability in the site, but making off with $44m in bitcoin from the site’s users.  It was starting to look like marketplace users had more to fear from the site administrators than they did from law enforcement agencies.  Market leader once again  Ironically, it seems the shock caused by its rivals’ two big scams undermined the confidence of buyers and sellers alike, and quickly helped Silk Road 2.0 leap back to the top of the pile:  ""A series of scam markets, which appeared as opportunists tried to fill the void while the original Silk Road was shut down, created distrust among customers after the operators allegedly stole tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. It is speculated that the resulting distrust may be one of the factors helping Silk Road rebuild its user base so quickly.""  This effect was likely boosted by sensible policies at Silk Road. Most significantly, soon after February's hack, the site's operators announced that they would pay back bitcoins lost by customers.  Silk Road's moderator Defcon said at the time: “We are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year.”  In anonymous drugs marketplaces, as in any market, confidence is key, it seems.  Booming marketplace  Currently, Silk Road 2.0 provides 5% more listings for drugs than its predecessor at the time of the FBI bust, with over 13,000 listings. According to the report, Silk Road’s closest competitor, Agora, has only just over half of that amount with approximately 7,400 drug listings.  📷  Now, the report says, ""Silk Road and other deep web marketplaces continue to do steady business despite the arrests of additional alleged operators who authorities say worked for Ulbricht"".  It remains to be seen how the imminent introduction of two new marketplaces – DarkMarket and OpenBazaar – will affect the current players.  If there is one thing we can learn from this story, however, it is that the key factor in the success of any online drugs market – somewhat incongruously – is trust.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/01/how-deep-web-scams-helped-silk-road-20-turn-crisis-into-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a0be1137bc0462f709fe114032d6060895cdd2f-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zi8J,1398946334,Canadian Central Bank Not Worried by Bitcoin,"Representatives from the Bank of Canada claim the institution remains unconcerned by the advent of bitcoin and digital currencies in general.  Speaking at a session of the Senate banking committee, central bankers said it is simply too early to predict whether digital currencies will gain traction from mainstream users.  Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz added that digital currencies are still in their infancy and have not progressed to the point where he would call them money, reports Global News.  “We’ve got a ways to go before we need to be thinking about policy implications,” he said. However, Poloz said the bank is tracking developments in the field.  Cash is remarkably durable  Tiff Macklem, the bank’s outgoing Senior Deputy Governor, told the committee that he’s been with the bank since 1984 and had heard many predictions involving the imminent demise of cash, but none of them panned out.  Macklem pointed out that the amount of cash in circulation is still going up:  “Cash has been remarkably durable, even with the introduction of credit cards and debit cards and tap-and-go cards. If you look at the growth of cash in the economy, it’s grown roughly in line with the growth of nominal income.”  He said that bitcoin is simply not in a position to threaten the official money supply and that it may never be. Therefore, any potential implications are purely speculative at this point.  Not impossible, but very improbable  Macklem pointed out that if digital currencies catch on in a big way, they could have an effect on the bank’s ability to regulate the money supply, but at this moment it seems “pretty far off”.  However, although he does not expect digital currencies to have a significant impact on Canada’s monetary policy, Macklem admits that they have a few beneficial qualities for payments and remittances.  Low transaction fees make them appealing, too, but security issues remain a concern.  Canada’s position on digital currencies has been neutral so far. Earlier this year the country’s finance minister Jim Flaherty announced plans to regulate digital currencies in order to prevent their use for illicit activities such as money laundering.  The country’s attitude towards digital currencies is somewhat more liberal than in the US and regulators have treaded carefully, refusing to stifle innovation in the field.

42377200,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziH7,1398940623,Hyper-Anonymising Bitcoin Service 'Dark Wallet' Launches Today,"The alpha version of Dark Wallet – the hyper-anonymising bitcoin wallet – goes live today.  Created by Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet provides new tools for financial privacy, including in-built coin mixing and 'stealth' wallet addresses.  As well as making it easier for people to disguise their transactions from the government, Dark Wallet is also a torpedo aimed at those in the bitcoin community who have embraced co-operation with regulators.  Conceived last year and partly funded by $50,000 raised on Indiegogo, the wallet was developed by unSystem, a collective of anarchist bitcoin developers. It represents an ethos that has been largely excluded from the mainstream discourse around bitcoin.  In January of this year, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk that bitcoin was “absolutely” moving away from its libertarian roots, and described attempts to avoid the regulation of bitcoin as playing into the hands of “anarchists and criminals”, adding:  “If your goals are to create a sort of shadow financial system that runs in offshore jurisdictions and is attractive for anarchists and criminals, then maybe [regulation] is not important.”  Alternative view  Cody Wilson represents the polar opposite of that argument. Integration into the mainstream runs counter to the core values of bitcoin, he says. Indeed, in his view mass adoption isn’t all that desirable.  “If you have a large division of the world's population using bitcoin it certainly bodes well for the price [...] but I think it bodes better for the technology as a marginal currency, a currency of ‘the other’.”  He points to the recent debate surrounding the use of the word 'dark' in relation to bitcoin tools, specifically the decentralised marketplace DarkMarket, which has been relaunched by others under the name ‘OpenBazaar’:  ""The bitcoin community, with its insistence with neutral euphemistic language, [has] an ideology of integration, which is kind of scary. We think bitcoin is valuable because it's not capable of being or shouldn't be integrated into the current dynamic of capital.""  Stealthy transactions  Dark Wallet certainly isn’t the product of “an ideology of integration”. The online wallet has two features that will make it nearly impossible for the government, or anyone else, to track payments on the block chain.  A feature called CoinJoin, first conceived by bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell last year, automatically combines your payment with another random Dark Wallet payment under one transaction, meaning it is hard to tell whose money has gone where.  The further along a transaction chain you go, the less and less confidence you can have that the coins belong to the person you are trying to track. After just eight transactions, for example, the coins could have ended up in 256 different locations.  In future, CoinJoin may even combine your payment with more than one other payment – if you can even find an address in the first place, that is. Dark Wallet implements 'stealth addresses', where coins sent to a stealth address by Dark Wallet users are automatically redirected to another bitcoin address, which remains hidden from view.  This allows people to advertise a public Dark Wallet address without the risk of providing a window into their finances.  'Back into the dark'  The development of these tools comes as others are creating new methods for tracking and analysing bitcoin transactions.  Wilson, who first came to prominence with a 3D-printed gun, hopes that these features, which are open-source, will become standard for bitcoin wallets:  “Stealth addresses and CoinJoin will become default privacy features for the privacy conscious in bitcoin [...] this is an open-source project, there's the total invitation for people to take this code and make their own of it.”  As bitcoin has grown in popularity and received venture capital backing, its backers have sought to move the discussion away from an anti-government narrative towards a pro-business narrative. Wilson is unfazed by this shift, he talks about “going all the way with bitcoin”:  ""Going all the way means being upfront about our intentions about a dark bitcoin, a bitcoin that evades regulatory oversight [...] Going all the way for us is pursuing still further bitcoin as a means for financial anonymity and privacy.""  And in doing this, Wilson believes he, Amir Taaki and the rest of the unSystem group are returning bitcoin back to its true, cryptoanarchist roots.  “Everyone is trying to take bitcoin and make it something less than bitcoin. In our mind bitcoin has to move back into the dark.”  Dark Wallet's developers have urged users to test the software with playmoney via their testnet, as the wallet isn't currently stable and using it with real funds ""will be a risk"".",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/01/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d61f27081af86d99be42391f165a44166cdb616-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the last panel discussion of the afternoon, three speakers participated in the debate titled ‘Are Cryptocurrencies a Ponzi Scheme or a Real Currency Alternative?’  The panel comprised of the following members:  Sean Park, Founder of Anthemis Group, a digital financial services investment and advisory firm  Steven Englander, Currency Strategist at Citigroup  David Birch, Consultant at Consult Hyperion, a consultancy specializing in electronic transactions  The discussion was moderated by Izabella Kaminska of FT Alphaville.  Good PR?  The debate kicked off on the back of yesterday’s news that Bloomberg is now listing bitcoin prices on its financial terminals. The speakers largely agreed that it did not mean legitimization for bitcoin.  “What does it mean? Frankly, nothing,” said Birch, adding that it was good for companies' publicity.  Using the example of the local merchants now accepting bitcoin he said:  “There are many shops that take bitcoin where you can buy pizzas. Nobody [uses bitcoin to buy goods], but you get featured on the BBC. If you are one of those places, it’s good publicity.”  Park added that Bloomberg was “late to the game”.  History lesson  In lieu of the fact that this event was held at the British Museum, which is home to some eight million pieces from all continents documenting human life from its beginnings to present, many references were made to the evolution of money from coins to paper to digital currency.  “If we would be having this conversation 400 years ago,” said Birch, “people would say, ‘you know what, that central bank idea sounds absolutely lunatic’.”  Topics like bitcoin and crime, its volatility and deflationary nature, and technology behind cryptocurrencies also came up, as they do at many bitcoin events and talks.  However, when one of the panellists polled the audience to see how many people understood the technology behind cryptocurrencies, at least 80% of the room did not put their hands up.  Explaining the technology  The debate was poised to discuss the question if crytpocurrencies like bitcoin are an alternative for fiat currency but it turned out to be more of a high-level introduction session for the uninitiated in the audience.  In fact, one member of the audience said in the question round following the debate:  “You guys have been talking Chinese.”  Naturally, a lot of time was spent explaining cryptocurrencies and the technology behind it.  When Park was trying to draw the distinction between the Bitcoin protocol and bitcoin as a currency, he got the two mixed up himself. He said ""Big B was the currency and small b was the bitcoin protocol.""  In the end, the general consensus of the panel was that they thought that bitcoin – particularly the block chain – as a technology was promising, but they did not say it would replace fiat currency.  Support for bitcoin  That was probably good news for many people from the banking industry in the audience.  Some prominent members of London’s financial community were present at the event, including Lars Seier Christensen, the co-founder and co-CEO of Saxo Bank.  Christensen made headlines earlier this year when he revealed his support for bitcoin and acknowledged that his online investment company was exploring bitcoin’s potential use.
