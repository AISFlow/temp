42382174,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnRd,1561064447,Libra Could Be Unbalanced by Indian Crypto Laws,"Facebook’s rollout of Libra may be steamrolled in India by existing regulatory constraints, reported the Economic Times.  Despite cryptocurrencies’ precarious standing within Indian law, the media outlet reports “Facebook has not filed any application with RBI (Reserve Bank of India) for its cryptocurrency in India,” according to an anonymous source with direct knowledge of the situation.  Another anonymous source said Calibra may be excluded from markets where “cryptocurrencies are banned or Facebook is restricted from operating in.”  The social media juggernaut told the Economic Times, “We expect Calibra to work on WhatsApp and be available globally.” India has 400 million WhatsApp users, according to Statista.  While peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions are currently allowed in India, in April 2018, the RBI passed a deadline initiative to prevent certain corporate entities from dealing in digital currencies, due to associated financial and social risks. The ban is being contested in the Supreme Court, with the next scheduled hearing on July 23.  Calibra is a Facebook subsidiary that will provide a platform for financial services involving Libra in Facebook’s ecosystem. The currency itself is developed by a consortium of 28 corporate, nongovernmental, and financial backers. Though Libra intends to decentralize in time, it is unclear how the Indian government may classify the arrangement.  Whatever the court’s decision, the distinction between personal and business use may be moot according to Tanvi Ratna, a policy analyst and fellow at New America. “If the government brands it criminal activity then obviously Facebook is knowingly committing an offence” no matter how Libra is utilized.  Indeed, the current zeitgeist within the ranks of India’s government is that cryptocurrencies enable tax evasion, money laundering, and fraud. A draft bill, dubbed “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019,” reportedly received support The Department of Economic Affairs, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority in April.  Pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, Libra may see further challenges in that India’s laws do not discriminate between digital assets operating in isolation within a network, and digital assets interacting with fiat currency such as the rupee.  “If Facebook were to design the Libra to be a closed system, only to be transacted on its network and not beyond, RBI should ideally be less concerned, since the coin does not engage with the external economy,” said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of Ikigai Law, a technology-focused law firm. “If it is not meant to operate in a closed system, then it is exactly the kind of digital asset that concerns RBI.”  One expert said under provisions in Section 79 of the Indian IT Act, Facebook is already obligated to take ‘all due care’ to ensure its network or platform is not used for illegal activities like dealing in cryptocurrencies. He also said the law is given extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning even multinationals can be brought to court.

42382169,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnK5,1561061477,"Lightning Labs Mobile App Gets 2,000 Downloads in 24 Hours","San Francisco-based Lightning Labs, focused on a layered scaling solution for bitcoin, released its first mobile app on Wednesday.  According to Lightning Labs application developer Tankred Hase, roughly 2,000 users downloaded the app across both iOS and Android. Both his inbox and the inbox of his colleague, developer Valentine Wallace, were flooded with support requests.  “We got a ton of feedback,” Wallace told CoinDesk.  This bitcoin wallet is a noncustodial way – meaning users hold the keys to their assets – to send nearly instant payments worth less than roughly $1,500. The startup put a cap on transaction amounts (one-sixth of a bitcoin) while working out the kinks.  For now, the app’s Autopilot setting relies on the startup’s in-house cluster with three full nodes and is mostly useful for sending bitcoin. Users can only receive as much money as they’ve sent with the app. However, more tech-savvy users are able to use a manual function for setting up their own payment channels and connecting to their own nodes.  Hase said, there are plans to reduce reliance on Lightning Labs as soon as Bitcoin Core updates to the Neutrino protocol, which allows the app to tap into an external node that would otherwise be too “heavy” for a mobile device.  The next step on the developers’ roadmap is enabling users to easily receive payments with a process called Lightning Loop.  New revenue goals  This app launch also kicked off the startup’s first monetization strategy: A liquidity service that utilizes Lightning Loop.  Looking forward, Hase said, Lightning Labs will offer a monetized service for merchants and other power-users that frequently receive funds.  “It’s non-custodial, we don’t hold their funds, but it is a paid service because it requires us to use funds for liquidity and to allow that on the backend,” he said. “I like the Amazon Web Services analogy because it allows the other startups to focus on their business logic while Amazon takes on the infrastructure.”  Stepping back, the Lightning Labs team is also working closely with Jack Dorsey’s fintech startup Square. Dorsey, who is an investor in Lighting Labs, said in February that lightning-enabled features were eventually coming to Cash App. Yet, as Wallace pointed out, this app services a distinct function compared to Dorsey’s app.  “It makes a lot of sense for our values as a company to have a wallet that’s totally under our control,” she said, adding the Cash App bitcoin feature is primarily a custodial conduit for purchasing bitcoin.  Speaking broadly to how this new app, which admittedly has a long way to go until it can easily send and receive diverse bitcoin transaction types, plays into the startup’s long-term plan, Hase said:  “Our strategy is to become an infrastructure provider that other apps and merchants can integrate.”  Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/06/20/lightning-labs-mobile-app-gets-2000-downloads-in-24-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/400b82872fd2f92adeb3681058d5d6af6730ad6d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qn7V,1561060259,Craig Wright Offers New Details on Bitcoin Trust at Heart of Billion-Dollar Lawsuit,"New details have emerged in the ongoing lawsuit in the U.S. filed last year against Craig S. Wright, the technologist who claims to be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.  A redacted declaration filing from Kleiman v. Wright surfaced today, which details Wright’s purported ownership and the trustee scheme of the Tulip Trust, which supposedly holds over one million bitcoin. According to the filing, access to the holdings of the trust requires participation of all trustees, at least one of whom he hasn't been in contact for several years.  The court document was originally filed on May 8, and also points to the existence of a second Tulip Trust, known as Tulip Trust II.  Days before the document was filed, a federal courtordered Wright to disclose his bitcoin addresses in the ongoing lawsuit. Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman. The nChain chief scientist is accused of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”  Kleiman is seeking half of the 1.1 million bitcoins the two are said to have mined together, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for infringement of intellectual property. The initial complaint did not seek to ascertain whether Wright is the person behind the Nakamoto identity, stating that “it is unclear whether Craig, Dave and/or both created Bitcoin.”  According to the declaration released Thursday, the Tulip Trust consolidated the bitcoin Wright mined and purchased between 2009 and 2011.  The trust first came to public attention through a leaked document on December 9, 2015. Allegedly written in 2011 by Dave Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator and author, the document describes a trust fund containing exactly 1,100,111 bitcoin, “to be managed by at least three people but not more than seven at any time.” The document also declares the bitcoin holding is to be returned to Craig Wright on January 1, 2020.  These new developments come amid an ongoing mediation process, which as of June 18 has yielded no results -- in the words of the mediator, as reported by attorney Stephen Palley, ""we are at an impasse.""  As it stands, Wright is due for deposition in Florida on June 28.  Trust details  According to Wright's court declaration, seven trustees were named, including Craig Wright, David Kleiman, and Ms. Uyen Nguyen -- whom Wright claimed he has had no contact with since 2016. That said, Kleiman was the initial, and sole, trustee before others were appointed.  Panopticrypt Pty Ltd, an Australian entity now in liquidation was also named alongside an unnamed Seychelles entity and CO1N Ltd., a U.K. entity liquidated in 2017.  “The contacts at CO1N were Dave Kleiman and Ms Nguyen, who was terminated as director on June 1, 2016. Presently, there is no one other than myself who was a contact for this entity.” Nguyen was allegedly terminated as director of CO1N in June 2016.  The final trustee listed is “the holder of PGP key IDs, which is Satoshi Nakamoto,” with Craig Wright parenthetically related.  In the past, Wright has said that the trust is encrypted using a a method called Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm. The only way to access them, he's said, is to accrue the collective private keys in order to decrypt it.  Wright complied with the directive pursuant to a court order to produce bitcoin holdings for all bitcoin Wright mined prior to December 31, 2013. The filings were subsequently sealed.  The Tulip Trust II was settled in 2014 in Seychelles with Equator Consultants listed as a trustee. Wright and his wife Ramona Watts are the primary beneficiaries. The holdings of this second trust are unknown.  Wright also hinted at an inaccessible trove of bitcoin mined between 2011 and 2013 by staff at HighSecured and Signia Enterprises under his direction, to be held on behalf of the original Tulip Trust. Wright alleges the principles of HighSecured were arrested in 2015.  Wright has claimed in the past the Tulip Trust is currently inaccessible. In the court document Wright said:  “Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and combination of trustees reference in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on Shamir scheme.”  Dave Kleiman passed away in 2013. Last December, the court denied Wright’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that he “converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts.”  The court filing can be found below:    6/20 Filing by CoinDesk on Scribd    Justice statue image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/20/craig-wright-offers-new-details-on-bitcoin-trust-at-heart-of-billion-dollar-lawsuit,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42382164,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnIp,1561059950,Rep. Waters: US Can't Let Facebook's Crypto 'Compete With the Dollar',"The chair of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is doubling down on her calls for Facebook to pause development on its new blockchain, Libra.      Two days after calling for a hearing, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) appeared on CNBC Thursday afternoon calling for a “moratorium” on Libra development.      “It’s very important for them to stop right now what they’re doing so that we can get a handle on this,” Waters said of the social media giant. ""We’ve got to protect our consumers. We just can’t allow them to go to Switzerland with all of its associates and begin to compete with the dollar.”      CNBC’s Waters interview made it clear her concerns are more with Facebook than with the company’s announced cryptocurrency project. Waters highlighted an ongoing investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into potential privacy violations concerning consumer data. She also mentioned a Department of Housing and Urban Development lawsuit that accuses Facebook of violating fair housing laws.    ""And while we’re doing that they have moved on to develop this cryptocurrency,"" Waters said on CNBC. ""We’re now going to move and we're going to move aggressively and very quickly to deal with what is going on with this new cryptocurrency.""    Waters isn’t alone in calling for public hearings on Facebook’s crypto aspirations, which were announced Tuesday. The U.S. Senate's banking committee has already scheduled a July 16 hearing on Libra. Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus is reportedly expected to testify, according to The Verge.    You can watch the full interview below.

The new tool allow users to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency transactions they make, providing ""independent, substantive evidence of the 'private key and public address pairing'"" to establish ownership of cryptocurrency and gather information about blockchain transactions and balances, according to the company.  PwC is now using the product in auditing those clients that transact in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, litecoin, ethereum, OAX and XRP. The tool is additionally being offered to firms that don't have a direct relationship with PwC, ""helping them to implement the processes and controls they will require in order to obtain assurance reports from their auditors,"" PwC's press release states.  “It is important as companies continue to digitize we, as auditors, keep up with technology changes in the market, continue to develop audit tools that meet the needs of emerging technologies and serve the changing and developing demands of our stakeholders,” James Chalmers, PwC's global assurance leader, said a statement.  As previously reported, PwC has been working as an auditor with Tezos Foundation and the Hong Kong stablecoin project Loorping Foundation.  In addition to auditing blockchain companies, PwC did some crypto investigation itself and reported in March about finding out that two Iranians under the U.S. sanctions have been using the Russia-originated crypto exchange WEX, the successor of the now defunct BTC-e, allegedly to launder money.  Some of the firm's employees have shifted into roles in the blockchain industry itself as well. Roman Schnider, co-creator of PwC Switzerland's blockchain initiative, left the ""Big Four"" firm to become Tezos' CFO in June. Earlier this year, PwC's blockchain principal Grainne McNamara left to join auditing firm EY, which also does work in the space.

42382161,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnBH,1561051524,Ethereum Classic's Next Crypto Code Upgrade Set for September,"In a public call Thursday, Ethereum classic developers recommitted to releasing a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, to the blockchain's main network in September.  The targeted block number for the so-called Atlantis activation is 8,772,000, which is expected to hit at roughly 12:00 UTC on Sept. 17.  After a disagreement in May about the contents of the Atlantis upgrade, developers agreed last Thursday about the 10 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) set for inclusion in what will be the blockchain network's first hard fork in over a year.  Atlantis, paired with a later upgrade called Agharta, is intended to boost chain interoperability between the ethereum classic and ethereum networks. Starting with a bundle of EIPs activated on the ethereum blockchain back in 2017, Atlantis is the first step towards ensuring that the migration of decentralized applications (dapps) from either chain is smooth and seamless.  However, today's decision to recommit to a hard fork activation date in mid-September was not reached without a fair amount of controversy and debate between developers.  Classic conflict  Ethereum classic is by far the most infamous and long-running competitor to the ethereum blockchain. Created in 2016, ethereum classic is essentially a version of the ethereum blockchain that did not restore stolen funds back to users following a major code exploit in the DAO – a now-defunct smart-contract-based funding vehicle.  While ethereum classic doesn't come close to matching the near $30 billion valuation of the ethereum blockchain, it is one of the top 20 performing cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization.  What's more, ethereum classic developers are now working towards updating the network to resemble a feature set that mimics the ethereum blockchain more closely.  Earlier this month, San Francisco-based startup Ethereum Classic Labs announced in a blog post its intention to implement Atlantis on the ethereum classic mainnet by July 1 instead of the previously agreed upon activation date for September. Ethereum Classic Labs maintains the most popular software client implementation of ethereum classic, called Classic Geth.  The announcement of a July 1 hard fork activation date was reportedly pushed as a result of strong sentiment from miners and cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia wanting to see the Atlantis upgrade sooner than September.  ""People in Asia are eager for this hard fork,"" said Asia community manager for the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, Christian Xu, during a developer call on Thursday. ""In each of our articles, we say that Atlantis will happen on July 1. We did a lot of meetups around cities in China. Even more than 20 cities, we have visited.""  In light of the communication that went out for a July 1 hard fork, ethereum classic developers reached consensus that same day to speed-up testing for the Atlantis upgrade. Given a faster testing timeline, certain community members noted that mainnet activation of the upgrade could also be bumped up and executed a month earlier than originally planned.  However, since then, other community members including Tang and Roy Zou – founder of blockchain research startup Gödel Labs – have accused Xu of falsifying claims about the ethereum classic community in Asia.  ""We asked them about Atlantis. We got the normal 'don't care' response,"" Tang told CoinDesk. ""But several exchanges/miners also said that they're not aware of this before. That makes me feel suspicious.""  Both Tang and Zou have insisted there's no pressure from the ethereum classic Asia community to speed up a hard fork activation date, while Xu maintains the support is unrelenting for a faster launch date in August.  Last week, members of Ethereum Classic Labs, including CEO Terry Culver, were resistant to the idea of delaying an August activation of Atlantis.  ""I strongly disagree,"" Culver said on the call last Thursday. ""We can't subscribe to that schedule. We stick to the schedule that we originally agreed upon.""  Since then, Culver and the broader Ethereum Classic Labs team have come around to the idea after further discussion with the community. Yesterday, the team released a public blog post to affirm the new hard fork roadmap.  ""We look forward to our continued cooperation with the ETC community,"" the blog post reads. ""ETC Labs will work jointly with all developers and teams to successfully complete the hard fork, making ETC stronger.""  Now, with rough consensus from the entire ethereuem classic community, today's call affirmed the official ""accepted"" status of the Atlantis hard fork and its delayed mainnet activation date to mid-September.  ""We can move forward with [Atlantis] then and start preparing clients,"" concluded ethereum classic developer ""soc1c"" during Thursday's call.

42382156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnA1,1561050608,‘Billions’ May Be Saved By Tokens Backed With Central Bank Money: BoE Chief,"Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that distributed ledger tech (DLT) projects have the potential to ""unlock billions of pounds in capital and liquidity"" -- and that they might one day see closer cooperation with the central bank itself.  Carney spoke on June 20 during an appearance at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, according to published remarks. In the speech, which centered on new forms of financial products and services, Carney stated that ""the Bank of England is announcing plans to consult on opening access to our balance sheet to new payment providers,"" going to on remark that ""this access could empower a host of new innovation.""  It was at this point that Carney invoked work being done on the blockchain and DLT front, telling attendees:  ""In wholesale markets, consortia of broker dealers are working to develop settlement systems using distributed ledger technology that could overhaul how markets operate. These consortia, such as [Utility Settlement Coin], propose to issue digital tokens that are fully backed by central bank money, allowing instant settlement. This could also plug into 'tokenised assets' – conventional securities also represented on blockchain—and smart contracts. This can drive efficiency and resilience in operational processes and reduce counterparty risks in the system, unlocking billions of pounds in capital and liquidity that can be put to more productive uses.""  On their face, the comments offer a hint -- however brief -- that companies using DLT might one day be able to tap directly into the Bank of England's services.  Fnality  , the firm behind the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) initiative, raised just over $63 million in new funding, as The Wall Street Journal reported in early June.  During his appearance, Carney returned to a topic he touched on earlier this week: the subject of Facebook's newly-unveiled cryptocurrency, Libra. In the wake of the announcement, Carney remarked that he expects Libra to abide by high standards of compliance and regulation, and on Thursday, he restated that sentiment.  ""The Bank of England approaches Libra with an open mind but not an open door, said Carney. ""Unlike social media for which standards and regulations are being debated well after it has been adopted by billions of users, the terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance of any launch.""  Libra, if it achieves its ambitions, would be systemically important,"" he went on to say, continuing:  ""As such it would have to meet the highest standards of prudential regulation and consumer protection. It must address issues ranging from anti-money laundering to data protection to operational resilience. Libra must also be a pro-competitive, open platform that new users can join on equal terms. In addition, authorities will need to consider carefully the implications of Libra for monetary and financial stability.""  ""Our citizens deserve no less,"" he concluded.  On Wednesday, Carney's American counterpart, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, said that Facebook had met with representatives of the Fed and that the project was ""something we’re looking at.""  ""I would echo what Governor Carney said which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations from a safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint if they do decide to go forward with something,"" Powell said during a press conference.

42382172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnQN,1561032052,Roll Wants to Take Power From YouTube With Cryptos for Content Creators,"Social currency startup Roll has raised a $1.7 million seed round to help content creators monetize relationships with their fans.  ""From our perspective, the most important thing is that creators have to be in control of this economy,"" Bradley Miles, one of Roll's co-founders, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Roll's seed round was led by Arthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMEX. Other investors include Gary Vaynerchuk, Techstars Ventures, Hustle Fund and Techstars NYC.  ""I am really excited to work with Roll,"" Hayes said in a statement. ""I believe in their vision that allows influencers and artists to better monetise their contribution to the world economy using digital tokens. It is a worthy vision and a concept that will prove successful.""  Vaynerchuk is a digital media and marketing entrepreneur who has also made a number of early investments in major companies, such as Snap, Twitter and Venmo. In crypto, Vaynerchuk previously invested in Coinbase.  Currency for 'creators'  Miles described Roll as ""a blockchain protocol and platform that creates social money.""  Content creators – the popular term for online personalities on YouTube and other platforms – often need ways to incentivize their fans to take helpful actions. With Roll, creators could create a specific currency that carries their own brand, running on ethereum.  ""Social money gives them a simple way to repeatedly generate social activity,"" Miles said.  So, for example, a creator with a podcast could create a co-branded currency. A news show, for example, might call the currency it creates on Roll ""mics."" With Roll, they would create a supply of ""mics,"" with a limit enforced by its smart contract, and then start creating a market with their users for earning mics and spending them.  They could give users five mics if they posted about one of their episodes on Twitter. Then later they might let people join a private video chat with the hosts at a cost of 75 mics. They could also be redeemed to, for example, cut the line at a live event, get a special autograph or other unique things that a random person might not care about but a super fan would value a lot.  So the tokens end up having a real value but it's defined by the creator and the token's market is likely to revolve around that creator.  The idea is that it gives creators a way to activate their fans in a variety of ways that aren't controlled by the platform they are sitting on. On YouTube, for example, there's the familiar refrain to ""like and subscribe,"" but with a loyalty points system that the creators control, they might be able to move fans onto other platforms as well or help give them an incentive to do things in real life.  ""We’re excited about Roll and the potential for social money to alter the dynamics of social media as it exists today, giving much more control to creators,"" Phil Toronto, VaynerX's SVP of investing, told CoinDesk via email.  Roll's Miles said the company is looking for creators who interact heavily with their fans. They expect to see a lot of early adopters in very interactive online entertainment verticals like beauty vloggers, gaming streamers and fitness personalities.  Previously, another token-based startup aimed at this same space first dramatically slowed its rollout plans before ultimately shutting down in June 2018.  De-platforming  ""We've seen creators over the last few years become unsatisfied over the level of control they have over the platforms,"" Miles said.  By using a blockchain, Roll hopes to build units of value that can exist independently of a creator's chosen media platform.  Siddharth Kalla, another co-founder of Roll, told CoinDesk:  ""Coming from a philosophical perspective what we are most interested in is the creator should be able to own that relationship with the fans irrespective of the platform.""  Describing Roll as a product for the long tail of content creators, the company's business model is based on this economy growing. Roll will hold a small pool of tokens minted by each creator. Down the road, Roll might work to get its tokens listed on exchanges or create its own. For now, it's just facilitating their creation.  Said Miles:  ""In the next decade, we see Roll serving as the social money layer that really wraps around the web.""  Correction (June 20, 14:38 UTC): Gary Vaynerchuk invested personally in Roll. The funding was not made through his VaynerX parent company, as was reported in an earlier version of this piece.

42382171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnNr,1561028703,QuadrigaCX CEO Set Up Fake Crypto Exchange Accounts With Customer Funds,"QuadrigaCX's late founder and CEO used customers' funds to trade for his own account on other cryptocurrency exchanges, the Canadian firm's bankruptcy trustee said.  In a bombshell 70-page report released Wednesday, Ernst & Young claimed that Gerald Cotten, who apparently died last December, transferred millions of dollars in crypto out of customer accounts and into other exchanges, with the funds being used to furnish Cotten's personal lifestyle and trading habits. Overall, it appears that Cotten effectively stole more than $200 million USD from his customers.  ""Significant volumes of Cryptocurrency were transferred off Platform outside Quadriga to competitor exchanges into personal accounts controlled by Mr. Cotten,"" the report said. ""It appears that User Cryptocurrency was traded on these exchanges and in some circumstances used as security for a margin trading account established by Mr. Cotten.""  Fees and trading losses ""appear to have adversely affected Quadriga's cryptocurrency reserves,"" while other sums were sent to wallets whose owners EY could not confirm.  Between 2016 and the end of 2018, Cotten transferred 9,450 bitcoin, 387,738 ethereum and 239,020 litecoin out of his exchange's accounts (respectively, $88 million, $105 million and $33 million USD at present market prices, though their values have fluctuated – and increased dramatically – over that time).  Cotten also appears to have created fake accounts on Quadriga, credited them with fiat amounts that did not actually exist, and use this fake fiat to purchase actual crypto from customers, with the largest account using the name Chris Markay.  More losses  Later, the report says that Cotten margin traded zcash, dash, dogecoin and omisego, where he ""generated substantial losses.""  An unidentified third exchange received 21,501 bitcoin ($201 million in today's prices) into an account under Cotten's name. All but 8 bitcoin were liquidated, netting some $80 million CAD ($60.4 million USD).  While this exchange is not cooperating with EY, it is cooperating with local authorities in its jurisdiction. EY is now looking to open ""formal channels"" with these authorities.  Evan Thomas, a litigator with Osler Hoskin & Harcourt in Canada, told CoinDesk that ""based on the report, what [Cotten] did was clearly fraudulent and betrayed the trust of Quadriga users.""  Cotten's actions could not have been an accident, Thomas indicated, saying:  ""It’s possible that he got in over his head and was trying to trade his way out out of a deficit using other people’s money, but given that the fake accounts have existed since at least 2016 and he misappropriated funds for luxury travel and real estate investments, it seems more likely that this was a calculated and deliberate fraud.""  QuadrigaCX filed for protection from creditors in January, owing customers $190 million worth of crypto and fiat, most of which it could not access because only its late CEO Gerald Cotten knew where the private keys were.  EY's hunt for the missing funds, first as court-appointed monitor and then as trustee when QuadrigaCX formally entered bankruptcy in April, has largely been fruitless.  As of May, the estate had just $21 million of assets to cover $160 million in remaining liabilities, though the most recent report brings the sum closer to $24.5 million.  The U.S. FBI is looking into the losses, as are Canadian authorities.  Other issues  EY's report also detailed rampant mismanagement and poor practices, noting that Quadriga did not keep administrative logs and had no contingency plan for the loss of funds or its leader.  What's more, the exchange seemingly engaged in poor accounting practices.  For example, the exchange paid two of its nine payment processors $11.8 million CAD (roughly $9 million USD) in fees alone.  Quadriga did not maintain any documentation, however.  ""The Monitor has been unable to locate any accounting with respect to the pooled Quadriga Funds,"" the report said. ""The Monitor notes the TPP accounts were used to process User Fiat transactions, fund general Quadriga operating costs and on multiple occasions funds were directed to Mr. Cotten, parties related to Mr. Cotten or counsel/parties acting on his behalf.""  It went on to add:  ""It appears that as and when operating expenses were required to be paid, or when Mr. Cotten desired funds to be transferred to himself or related parties, he simply instructed TPPs to issue payments with no oversight.""  EY also believes that properties in Nova Scotia, properties in British Columbia, investment securities, cash holdings, a boat, an aircraft, luxury vehicles and gold and silver coins that purportedly belonged to Cotten, and now belong to his widow Jennifer Robertson were paid for using Quadriga's customers' funds, and therefore should be liquidated.  ""As Mr. Cotten’s and Ms. Robertson’s personal expenditures and the accumulation of their personal assets since 2015 was sourced from Quadriga funds, the Trustee intends to seek the recovery of the Preserved Assets subject to the Asset Preservation Order back to the Estate for immediate liquidation on the basis that the funds which Mr. Cotten directed be paid to them constitute preferences or transactions at under value under the BIA and may be subject to other causes of action asserted by the Trustee,"" EY wrote.  The proceeds from these sales, if successful, will go to the creditors' estate, and could total as much as $12 million CAD ($9 million USD).  Customer claims  In a separate filing  , EY outlined the process that former QuadrigaCX users who lost money when the exchange went belly-up should follow to file claims.  ""Users will be requested to complete and deliver their Proofs of Claim to the Trustee prior to 5:00 p.m. (Halifax time) on August 31, 2019 (the 'Claims Submission Date'),"" EY said.  EY acknowledged in the filing that creditors have encountered difficulty finding the information they need to prepare claims because Quadriga's website has been down since January.  A committee and lawyers representing users ""have expressed concern with the platform site being offline as Users cannot access statement details or information necessary to complete their claims,"" EY said.  In response, EY says it worked with the creditors' lawyer to help users find ways to retrieve account balance information.  That process involves an online portal where users are asked to type in their QuadrigaCX account number and first name.  ""If a match is found, your balances will be displayed,"" the EY-built web page says, warning: ""Be sure to print or screen capture the results.""    EY added that it is ""mindful of User privacy concerns which [were] also taken into account in preparing the claims process.""    Special form      The auditing firm has also modified the standard form for bankruptcy claims ""in order to fit Quadriga’s unique circumstances of having claims against it denominated in Cryptocurrency and Fiat,"" EY said.  The form, which misspells the word ""ethereum"" and is interrupted by a page break in the filing, looks like this:  Thomas told CoinDesk that based on the new reports, there may not be much for customers to recover.  ""Right now, it looks like the primary source of recovery for creditors will be the fiat and the frozen assets,"" he said, concluding:  ""The report doesn’t address potential damages claims against other parties but that may be something the trustee will consider.""

42382179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnVP,1561028423,Bitcoin Price Rally Stalls as Open Futures Hit Record Highs,"View  The bitcoin price rally seems to have stalled near $9,300 with the price-volume analysis suggesting scope for a minor pullback to $9,000-$8,700.  Record open interest in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange indicates a surge in institutional interest. So, pullbacks, if any, will likely be short-lived.  The long-term technical charts indicate scope for a rally to $10,000 and above.  Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to find acceptance above $9,300 even as futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are witnessing record open bets.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,250, having hit a high of $9,362 earlier today, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  Notably, the cryptocurrency has failed at least two times in the last four days to hold on to gains above $9,300.  For instance, prices hit a high of $9,318 at 08:00 UTC on June 16 only to fall back to $9,040 by 10:00 UTC. Similarly, the rise to $9,366 seen in the U.S. trading hours on June 17 was short-lived with prices falling back to $9,000.  While bitcoin bulls seem to be having a breather, the open bets in CME futures have hit record highs for two consecutive days.  The open interest – the number of contracts or commitments outstanding in futures at a given point of time – jumped to a record high of 5,311 contracts or $250 million on June 17 and hit a new lifetime of 5,391 on the following day.  It is worth noting that open bets have continued to rise along with the price this year and are currently up almost 80 percent from the levels seen in June 2018.  A rise in open interest along with the rise in price mostly indicates long (buy) positions are being built up. As a result, bitcoin’s recent rally looks sustainable – more so, as the CME has associated record open bets with an increased institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency.  Further, JPMorgan Chase recently pointed to the difference between trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges and CME as a sign of increased institutional activity in bitcoin.  Therefore, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $10,000 and may possibly break higher, as suggested by long-term technical charts below.  Monthly chart  The falling channel breakout confirmed in April indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in October 2015 was followed by a 2.3-year bull run.  Also supporting the case for a rise to $10,000 and above is the bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-day moving averages.  The long-term bullish outlook would be invalidated if the price finds acceptance below May’s low of $5,350, although that looks unlikely.  That said, the rise to $10,000 could be preceded by a temporary price pullback.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows sell volumes (red bars) have been bigger than buy volumes (green bars) over the last four days on major exchanges included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real” bitcoin trading volume.  As a result, the price may fall back below the support at $9,000. That would expose the ascending trendline, currently located at $8,690.  The case for a pullback would weaken if the price finds acceptance above $9,300 on the back of high volumes.

42382159,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnF3,1561021201,MIT's 'Fiat Cryptography' System Automates the Process of Securing Almost Anything,"The Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT designed a system to run complex mathematical algorithms to secure online communication. ""Fiat Cryptography,"" as the code is called, currently secures about 90 percent of Google Chrome communications.  Researchers presented their paper at the EEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May, though the technology was originally theorized and deployed in MIT labs in 2018.  Fiat Cryptography is designed to automatically generate -- and simultaneously verify -- optimized cryptographic algorithms for all hardware platforms, a process which used to be done by hand.  You heard that right: as recently as a year ago the internet’s data encryption was achieved by a gaggle of cryptographers who would write and rewrite algorithms, manually weighing various mathematical techniques and chip architectures to optimize for performance.  Apart from the obvious issue of human-introduced bugs and nonoptimal algorithms, overtime, the maths or chip architecture the algorithms were written for would become obsolete, meaning pen would have to scratch paper again.  Researchers looked for a solution first in C programming and assembly languages, and transferred those techniques to their code library -- a list of best-performing algorithms for each architecture.  Using a compiler to convert programming languages into code the algorithms are then automatically proofed with Coq, a mathematical theorem prover. Each iteration is tested before the best-performing one is selected for a particular chip architecture.  During the process researchers leveraged the body of human written code already in existence, and found that the automated process of generating keys and certificates for data encryption matches the performance of the best handwritten code, but completes it much faster.  ""It's basically like taking a process that ran in human brains and understanding it well enough to write code that mimics that process,” said Adam Chlipala, a CSAIL researcher who worked on the project, in an interview with MIT News.  Fiat Cryptography has since been deployed by Google's BoringSSL, an open-source cryptographic library used by Google Chrome, Android apps, and other programs.  Chlipala was joined by CSAIL graduate students Andres Erbsen as first author and Jade Philipoom and Jason Gross as co-authors, as well as Robert Sloan, an engineering graduate student.  The researchers are currently working on ways to make their compiler run even faster in searching for optimized algorithms.

LINE is close to winning a crypto exchange license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), which could issue the approval as early as this month, the news outlet reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  With that regulatory clearance, LINE would be able to launch the platform – called BitMax– in a few weeks to offer cryptocurrency trading services to its 80 million users in Japan, the report added.  In July of 2018, LINE launched a cryptocurrency exchange dubbed BitBox based in Singapore, which excludes users from the firm's home nation due to lack of regulatory clearance.  As of March this year, only 19 cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan had received a license from the FSA as the agency had tightened up its scrutiny following the $530 million Coincheck hack in January 2018. Coincheck obtained a license from the FSA earlier this year.  Bloomberg further said LINE now has another banking license pending in Japan, which is unlikely to be issued until next year. Under such a banking license, LINE would be able to create a cryptocurrency payments tunnel for other services like online shopping.  In March, the FSA granted a license to cryptocurrency exchange Rakuten Wallet, which was rebranded from a bitcoin exchange called Everybody's Bitcoin Inc that was acquired by Japan's e-commerce giant Rakuten in 2018.

This strategic round of funding comes on the heels of the company’s partnership with Mastercard. Token is working to develop a connectivity layer for the legacy payments processor’s open banking hub ""that will help third parties establish and maintain communication with banks for data and/or payment,"" said Token representative Erin Lovett. The partnership represents ""the first movement in open banking by a large infrastructure provider.""  Combining open APIs, cryptographic security features, and programmable money to develop new banking applications, the company said it assists banks aggregate client account information from multiple external sources, initiate bank-direct payments, and reduce the cost of payment acceptance.  An API also provides compliance with PSD2 obligations, a regulatory directive in the EU.  Through SDK’s, Token removes the need for businesses to store customer or bank details on site and integrates with commercial websites to provide a ‘one click’ checkout. It also collects customer spend data.  Apart from the data platform, Token has developed an eponymous cryptocurrency, Token X, which they claim is the first stablecoin designed for “instant payment execution.” It runs on Stellar and Ethereum, but is designed to be ledger agnostic. In function, TokenX performs like Facebook’s Libra.  The token is backed 1:1 by fiat money and has been independently audited to confirm that assets in escrow match the outstanding stablecoins, the company alleges. Additionally, transactions using TokenX are screened for AML and sanctions, and those purchasing or redeeming the currency are meant to follow KYC processes.  Token was founded in 2015 by Steve Kirsch and currently works with 4,001 banks, including Tandem Bank, Think Money Group, An Post, Sberbank Croatia and Slovenia, and Khaleeji Commercial Bank.  The firm raised $18.5 million in Series A in 2017, and an additional $16.5 million in June 2019. Lovett said Token plans on doing a Series B round early next year.  The latest round of funding will support Token’s expansion and connectivity to banks across Europe, in both open banking and digital money solutions.

42430627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVZh,1560992427,Video Startup YouNow Files With SEC to Give Away Crypto,"YouNow  , a video platform that aims to reward active users with its own cryptocurrency, is taking a belt-and-suspenders approach to compliance.  The New York-based startup has filed a Reg-A+ offering circular for its Props token with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – even though it isn't selling them to investors, accredited or otherwise. If approved by the regulator, the qualification would clear YouNow to distribute Props to content creators, network transaction validators and others without registering the tokens as securities.  The key difference between this token and other efforts? ""No funds will be raised through the public offering, created to allow compliant 'mining' of Props in [the] US,"" says the company.  Instead, YouNow will disperse millions of Props, an ERC-20 token that runs on the ethereum blockchain, to users of its app.  Previously, YouNow raised $25 million through the sale of Props, $20 million of that via a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT), a legal structure devised at the height of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom.  But while the 178 million Props allocated for the current ""offering"" have a nominal price (13.6 cents apiece, or $24 million total), the only consideration YouNow asks is participation in its platform.  From the release  The Props Tokens cannot be purchased as part of this offering, but can only be earned by apps, users and validators that will contribute to the Props Network. YouNow, the first app on the network, intends to distribute a significant portion of its own tokens to millions of its users. Tokens are to be allocated to users based on their current status (“level”) on YouNow, which signifies the contribution they have made to the network to date. Upon qualification, YouNow users may earn Props Tokens by, for example, creating content on the app. Users hold Props to get in-app benefits and real upside potential.  Props is backed by Union Square Ventures, Comcast Ventures, and Venrock, among others and is planning on giving away tokens as grants to programmers on the platform and for popular users.  “Over the past two years, the team focused on launching Props in a manner compliant with US regulators and now, pending final approval by the SEC, there is the opportunity for apps to integrate and 'mine' a legally compliant digital token and obtain a stake, for both the apps and their users, in the network they contribute to,"" said Venrock's David Pakman. ""This visionary new model is ushering in a new era of transparent and more equitable distribution of value, and sharing that value with end-users.”   Photo by Tyler Nix on Unsplash",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/20/video-startup-younow-files-with-sec-to-give-away-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e225e8bbf841960688b0652683b8a06c8554f6f-1704x836.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
