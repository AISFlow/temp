42425042,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2vh,1375133856,"Bank of Thailand allegedly declares bitcoin illegal, Thai exchange suspends trading","A Thai bitcoin exchange has suspended trading alleging that the Bank of Thailand has declared the cryptocurrency illegal, throwing the community into heated debate.  Bitcoin Co Ltd, a Thai exchange, posted a note on its websitehttps://bitcoin.co.th/trading-suspended-due-to-bank-of-thailand-advisement/ saying that the Bank of Thailand held a conference earlier today to discuss the exchange's business operations.  ""At the conclusion of the meeting senior members of the Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department advised that due to lack of existing applicable laws, capital controls and the fact that Bitcoin straddles multiple financial facets the following Bitcoin activities are illegal in Thailand,"" says the post. It outlined the purchase or sale of bitcoins themselves as illegal, alongside the buying and selling of goods or services in exchange for bitcoins. Sending or receiving bitcoins to or from anyone outside Thailand would also be illegal.  ""Based on such a broad and encompassing advisement, Bitcoin Co. Ltd. therefore has no choice but to suspend operations until such as time that the laws in Thailand are updated to account for the existance of Bitcoin,"" the exchange said.  Debate heated up on the online forums, with some agreeing with the statement, and some arguing that senior officials at a bank agreeing on something doesn't make it law.  ""Bitcoin was not ruled illegal in Thailand. There is poor reporting and interpretation going on. The Bank of Thailand has no legal power,"" said one commenter.  ""When a senior official at a central bank tells you point-blank, 'buying or selling bitcoins is illegal', unless you have a seriously large legal fund and willing to fight all the way to the constitutional courts if necessary, you take it seriously,"" said another. ""They made no comment about these laws (or lack of laws) being enforced; so I would assume the blackmarket will still operate business-as-usual""  What is known is that the Bank of Thailand, a non-government agency under the Bank of Thailand Act, acts as a regulator for various aspects of the Thai financial industry.  Bitcoin Co is not the only bitcoin exchange in Thailand. Bahtcoin was still trading as of 5:10 EST today, and so was Coinmill, which trades in Thai Offshore Baht.  The Bank of Thailand's New York office refused to comment on the issue when contacted today.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/29/bank-of-thailand-allegedly-declares-bitcoin-illegal-thai-exchange-suspends-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2df4be62175ddc134850bbcfed02bcd8eff96de7-1000x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425053,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq3Fh,1375120084,Why is bitcoin so susceptible to fraud?,"Bitcoin is trying hard to grow up. As we have seen, when the price of bitcoin rises, there inevitably comes real money to invest in its future. There are still many skeptics out there that don’t believe in bitcoin. They don’t think that it is real money. They don’t think that it has any value. And to be sure, there just aren’t enough real ways to spend it yet.  Bitcoin Savings and Trust  All of these aspects of Bitcoin seem to bring to it a fraudulent, secretive element. It’s harder to trace bitcoins in smaller amounts, so any scammer looking to make some cash from bitcoin would do well to solicit payments for an “investment” similar to a Ponzi scheme, where the initial investors are paid proceeds that come from the successive investors.  Recently the SEC indicated a man doing just that with bitcoin. Trendon Shavers from McKinney, Texas, solicited investors from the Bitcointalk forums by promising them a 7% weekly return from something called bitcoin arbitrage. At 7% per week, this means that investors in Shavers’ “Bitcoin Savings and Trust” were expecting a 364% annual return, and that’s not even calculating compounding interest.  Shavers’ strategy, arbitrage, is a method of buying low and selling high between different exchanges. The problem is that this hardly can be profitable unless you posses a lot of buying power. And even then it is hard to make money on several different markets since the overall volume for bitcoins is still relatively low. It is for this reason that anyone who thought Shavers had some sort of method for arbitrage unavailable to anyone else would have been sadly mistaken.  Arbitrage  The unfortunate truth is that Trendon Shavers will not be the last person to promote the supposed benefits of arbitrage. And while it is a successful strategy in high liquidity capital markets, there just is not enough volume in bitcoin trading to successfully move money that easily. In fact, companies like BitInstant have promoted this concept to their customers. It’s no wonder why they would do that: at a 4% processing fee for each transaction, arbitrage would make them solid money no matter the result for an investor.  Others have promoted the simplicity of arbitrage to bitcoin investors with a degree of enthusiasm to deflect the real truth in that it isn’t really that easy. BTC Trader is another example whereby the claim is “Bitcoin Arbitrage Made Easy”. But one look at the interface tells you that while arbitrage is possible, it doesn’t appear easy.    BTC Trader Screenshot. Source: Bitcoin Magazine    New technology and fraud  In announcing their indictment of Bitcoin Savings & Trusts’ proprietor, the SEC at that time released a summary report regarding fraudulent activity and virtual currencies. One of their most interesting statements in the report was that new and innovative technology is specifically ripe for fraudulent activity.  “As with many frauds, Ponzi scheme organizers often use the latest innovation, technology, product or growth industry to entice investors and give their scheme the promise of high returns. Potential investors are often less skeptical of an investment opportunity when assessing something novel, new or ‘cutting-edge’, the SEC report states.  This results in an interesting trajectory: as bitcoin ascends and becomes increasingly well known, it means that the potential for scams to appear increases. The more money that is involved in bitcoin, the more opportunity there is for fraudsters to rip unsuspecting bitcoiners off.  Bitcoin versus traditional banking  Many in the bitcoin community continue to expound the virtues of bitcoin as if it is some kind of currency that can somehow thwart bad guys. The recent news regarding charges being filed against five men regarding a grift on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars on the credit card companies highlight this.  But in actuality it is bitcoin’s inability to reverse transactions that scares the credit card companies and processors like PayPal away from adopting it. And in this case where information on at least 160 million credit cards were stolen, major companies in the financial and insurance industries are going to have to pay that stolen money back.  It took web-based bitcoin wallet Instawallet 91 days to run through a reclamation process for its customers. This occurred after someone had breached the site’s infrastructure was able to access all of the unique URLs that hosted wallets and thus bitcoins.  Instawallet is no longer around, although one of the founders, Jan Vornberger, has gone on to start Bridgewalker, which is an Android-based wallet that makes fast Bitcoin transactions possible by using something called the green address approach.  Bridgewalker is also decidedly security-focused after what happened with Instawallet, according to Vornberger. “Green addresses (Bridgewalker recognizes Bitcoin ATM, merchant recognizes Bridgewalker) would allow the whole process to be fast without compromising security - meaning no need to wait for confirmations at any point”, he says.  Protecting investors  Wallets, exchanges and mining are all bitcoin-related businesses. And they all face the threat of hacking and scamming. That’s true whether you are in the business of bitcoin or if you are just a customer. It’s no wonder, then, that the Bitcoin Foundation is trying to do its best to interface with legal and regulatory officials regarding guidelines on virtual currencies going forward.  Regulators realize that these decentralized systems for money are only going to proliferate over time. The problem, in their view, is rampant fleecing of unsuspecting investors. If there are no checks on the system, authorities will be overwhelmed with cases of fraud. The general consensus, then, is to find ways to operate while protecting the average person from having their money stolen. It’s a tough job, as technological advancement keeps moving one step ahead of law enforcement and regulatory personnel.  What do you think about scammers using bitcoin to take money from people? What is the best way to educate the public about bitcoin, to give it a better reputation?

42425044,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2zh,1375109966,Bitcoin debit card iBTCard will offer lower processing fees for merchants,"A new way to pay by bitcoin is on the horizon, a bitcoin debit card called iBTCard. That name stands for International Bitcoin Transfer Card. The company behind the project, Tradecoinz LLC, is hoping to provide an alternative payment method to VISA and MasterCard, but in a way that most people can recognise and understand.  We spoke to the founder and CEO of Tradecoinz, Cameron Halter, who told us that iBTCard will register with FinCEN as a money services business (MSB). He also stated that there will be policies in place to prevent theft and money laundering. One of those methods is a numerical one-time password (OTP) embedded on the card itself.  Halter is looking to undercut the incumbents of the payment card world (i.e. MasterCard and VISA) by offering lower fees for merchants – between 0.5% and 1.25%. In addition to lower fees, Halter said that iBTCard will control the fees placed on card holders and that because it's independent, VISA and MasterCard would not be able to shut the service down.  The service is also planned to be merchant friendly. For example, it will provide subscription payments so that consumers can be automatically billed in bitcoins. Halter also states that iBTCard will be able to integrate with existing point of sale (POS) systems.  Halter went on to tell us, ""Though many benefits exist, it doesn't change the difficulty developing such a system. We need to convince both merchants and consumers to use our card. In addition, we will need to convince POS manufacturers to integrate our services. However, if the community wants bitcoin to be a respected currency, you need to increase its usage and acceptance. Integrating with pre-existing technologies people understand is a great way to do that"".  If you're interested in jumping on board with this, then you'll have to wait a little. Signups for the card begin in a few days – 1st August. Halter also told us that iBTCard will begin fund raising ""in a few weeks"" to expedite its development phase. The investment will follow the now familiar pattern of, ""Merchants and consumers who donate a certain amount will be given early access and receive an iBTCARD"", Halter told us. He also said that he is actively looking for ""experienced investors and business partners to help the company grow"".",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/29/bitcoin-debit-card-ibtcard-will-offer-lower-processing-fees-for-merchants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5c5f71711f79d2afd1284b9b22fae58ad9901eb-352x226.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422989,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yvHh,1375096368,"Reviewed: Bitcoin apps for iPhone, Android and Windows Phone","Whenever bitcoin reaches mainstream usage, it's likely that people will be paying via their smartphones. So what is the current state of bitcoin apps? We offer reviews of three apps from the top three smartphone platforms: Android, iOS and Windows Phone.  Android Bitcoin Apps  Blockchain  This app can import private keys, as well as authenticating to the Blockchain website (through a special ""Pairing"" process). It also has a QR code with a Blockchain bitcoin wallet address, but it can also generate QR codes with requests for specific amounts of bitcoin. You can also send bitcoin by typing (or pasting) an address or by scanning a QR code. It also has more basic and very useful features like displaying a list of your transactions, and a PIN lock to make sure nobody accesses your wallet. You can also pick a fiat currency to display on the main screen of the app to show what your bitcoin balance is worth.  Mt. Gox [official]  The official Mt. Gox app for Android takes you through a tricky process of authenticating to the website by creating an API key which is put onto your smartphone by scanning a QR code. However, once this is done, the app consistently crashes when opened. At least it did on our Nexus 4 which was running stock Android 4.2.2. We couldn't avoid mentioning this one, but it has to be with a warning to avoid it.  Bitcoin Wallet  Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach is the definitive bitcoin wallet app for Android. If you have a bitcoin wallet created by another app (e.g. bitcoin-qt on the desktop), it can be imported with ease via the backup menu. However, this is not compatible with the backup files created by the Blockchain app. The app features a pivoting list of your transactions, switching between received, sent and all. It also allows you to create and manage multiple receiving addresses. It also supports QR scanning for sending and requesting bitcoin.  Bitcoin Paranoid  This is an app for those who are avid bitcoin watchers and need up-to-the-minute prices. This doesn’t give you an app or a widget. Instead, it provides a permanent entry in Android's notification shade with the current exchange rate in your chosen currency. Conveniently, it not only shows what 1 BTC is worth in your fiat currency, but it also shows how much one unit of your fiat currency is with in BTC. E.g. One pound sterling is worth around 16.16 mBTC.  iOS Bitcoin Apps  Blockchain  This is the official Blockchain app for iOS – again made by Qkos Services Ltd. who made the Android version. However, this app has a distinctive style that sets it apart. Its curved tool bars eat into the iPhone's screen real estate, which makes viewing the list of transactions feel quite cramped even on an iPhone 5. Just as with its Android counterpart, you are saved the hassle of logging in with a username and password. Instead, you 'pair' the app with your Blockchain.info account by scanning a QR code from your desktop browser.  Once paired, the transaction list looks identical to that of the Blockchain website, including tapping transaction values to toggle between BTC and fiat values. The lower toolbar lets you access pages for sending and receiving payments. Fortunately, there is an option to send payments by scanning a QR code too. The toolbar also lets you access your settings page on the Blockchain website. Overall, the app works very well, and the Blockchain.info website provides a pretty secure solution for keeping your wallet in the cloud. As such, this is my favourite app for handling bitcoin on iOS devices.  CoinWatch  This free app for iOS lets you keep your finger on the pulse of the cryptocurrency world. The first of four screens is a calculator where you may enter your holdings in several cryptocurrencies, and the app will calculate the total USD value. The next screen shows you regularly updated prices of bitcoin to USD and euro on several exchanges; it also lists Litecoin, Novacoin and Terracoin. The ""Details"" screen shows the high, low and volume (etc) of USD trades for bitcoin on Mt. Gox. The final screen shows Bitcoin and Litecoin news from several sources including Reddit and The Bitcoin Magazine. It doesn't include CoinDesk yet, tut tut!  BitcoinViewer  With only two wallet apps on iOS, the options are limited. BitcoinViewer is a very limited form of wallet app in that, when supplied with a bitcoin address, it will display a QR code, current balance with the total sent and received bitcoin amounts. Fortunately, you can monitor more than one address too. The other section of the app shows a copy of the charts from Bitcoinity. At least you can use this to receive money, but you'll have to find some other way to actually pay with your iPhone.  Windows Phone 8 Bitcoin Apps  The so-called third ecosystem isn't without bitcoin apps either. Predictably, the options are thinner on the ground here, and not all apps work that well.  Mt. Gox  First up with an unofficial Mt. Gox app, called mt. Gox. The app allows you to place, buy and sell orders. It will also show you a summary of the currently open bids and ask orders that you have. Usability isn't great, as you have to paste in the API key and secret text from Mt. Gox – compare this to Android and iOS where you can authenticate your account by just scanning a QR code. For this app, the best way is to email the API key and secret text to yourself, then copy and paste them into the app from your Windows Phone email app.  Mt. Gox Live Tile  This app does just what its title suggests. It provides a live tile giving market details of what the USD price of Bitcoin on Mt. Gox is currently doing. The app supports all three tile sizes of Windows Phone. The smallest size just shows an arrow to show whether the price is up or down. The largest will show the current price with the most recent highs and lows.  Blockchain  As the name suggest, this is the Windows Phone app for accessing your wallet in the Blockchain cloud. The app faithfully works within the signature design of Windows Phone by pivoting between views for your wallet and your transaction history. The wallet screen displays a QR code so others can easily send bitcoin to you. That is about all it does. In comparison to the official Blockchain app for Android, this incarnation is quite limited. There's no PIN lock, and there's no way to send money to other users.  Conclusion  Overall, Android has the best support for not just bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies in general. Both iOS and Windows Phone have promising apps, but they are still missing key functionality that cryptocurrencies will need to put digital spending power in the hands of ordinary users.
