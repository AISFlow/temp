42396654,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4bgd,1635810765,"Coinbase Revenue Could Hit Nearly $50B by 2025, Investment Firm Says","Coinbase is the best-positioned cryptocurrency-related company to benefit from the industry’s soaring growth, Hayden Capital said on Monday in a memo on the crypto exchange.  Coinbase could reach $49.2 billion in revenue in 2025 under a bullish outlook of mass crypto adoption, rising interest among institutional investors and the sector growing to $6.8 trillion in total size. Under a more conservative crypto market cap estimate of $3.4 trillion, the firm would more than double revenue to $21.3 billion by 2025.  Hayden’s prediction for 2021 revenue of $8.8 billion is higher than other analysts’ estimates; Coinbase is projected to generate about $7 billion in revenue this year, according to the analyst consensus estimate reported by FactSet.  Hayden Capital believes Coinbase will hold its market share lead over other crypto exchanges while also fending off competition from other fintech firms, including Robinhood and PayPal.  In addition, Coinbase also contains a “much larger share of the regulated spot markets in the U.S. than is widely understood, as opposed to looking at the usual trading volume leaderboards” on which most analysts are focused, the letter said.  Founded by former New Street Research and JPMorgan small-cap equity fund research analyst Fred Liu, Hayden Capital is a value-oriented investment firm, with holdings mostly concentrated in six to 15 core positions, according to its website.

Ever since smart contracts debuted on the blockchain, high traffic has been anticipated for the network. Smart contracts on Cardano had been in the works for quite a while and were one of the most anticipated upgrades in the space. Now that this is a reality, the developer has had to move on to building further capabilities to accommodate the anticipated traffic increase. Hydra was built to make room for increased traffic on the network. A Layer 2 solution like Hydra provides the much-needed scalability to maintain high throughputs for the applications on the blockchain. Hydra will also help to regulate fee rates on the blockchain. Thereby providing acceptable fee structures for the users. This makes it a very useful solution and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has reiterated the importance of the solution to the network. Hoskinson Says Hydra Is Vital For Cardano Charles Hoskinson organized an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on YouTube where members of the community were able to send in questions they would like answered. It was during one of these questions that the importance of Hydra was emphasized by the founder.

42396667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4bqT,1635806846,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rangebound as Traders Expect Strong November,"Bitcoin has traded in a tight range over the past few days. It appears that extreme bullish sentiment is starting to cool after BTC reached its all-time high of around $66,900 two weeks ago. For now, traders are gearing up for a strong November and expect positive crypto returns heading into the end of the year.  Still, some analysts see room for a slight pullback as open interest rises in the bitcoin futures market. “[Rising open interest] is typically a bearish signal as it means there is more leverage in the system – this increases the chance of a liquidation event where traders are forced to sell and the price cascades lower,” Marcus Sotiriou, a sales trader at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “Aside from open interest, the euphoria seen from the rise in meme coins last week, notably SHIB, could contribute to a leverage flush in the short term, due to the increase in retail traders,” Sotiriou wrote.  In observance of the U.S. Election Day, a CoinDesk company holiday, Market Wrap will not be published on Tuesday.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,135.37, +0.55%  Ether (ETH): 4,355.40, +2.38%  S&P 500: 4,613.67, +0.18%  Gold: 1,793.47, +0.74%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.56%  Seasonal strength for bitcoin  Bitcoin tends to gain 11%-18% in the fourth quarter, which is one reason why some analysts have maintained their bullish outlook on crypto prices for the remainder of the year. It appears that BTC has followed a seasonal pattern with a sell-off earlier this year and a volatile September, although the downside was limited as traders entered to buy on dips.  Despite wild price swings, bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains intact. And generally, analysts view cryptocurrencies as an early-stage investment. “Crypto is still under-owned and there is still a large knowledge gap,” but the industry is rapidly gaining traction among professional investors, crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.  Bullish Tuesdays  Here is another interesting stat for traders. CoinDesk Research analyzed bitcoin’s average daily returns since 2010 and found that Tuesday is the most bullish day of the week, followed by Wednesday.  Crypto fund inflows slow  Digital asset investment products saw a total of $288 million in inflows during the week ended last Friday, a report Monday by CoinShares showed. That’s down from a record $1.47 billion during the prior week, but it helped to push inflows to $8.7 billion year to date.  As in the previous week, the majority of new investments went into bitcoin-related funds, at about $269 million.  The decrease in flows coincided with a market pause as bitcoin (BTC) hit its all-time high of $66,974 on Oct. 20 but retreated last week.  Meme tokens rallied in October  Popular meme tokens saw large gains in October as cryptocurrency market sentiment improved, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. The dog-themed coin SHIB’s 765% gain in October made it the month’s top-performing cryptocurrency among those with a reported market capitalization of at least $10 billion.  And last Thursday, dogecoin reached its highest level since Aug. 20, trading near $0.30. It finished the month with a market cap of $36 billion.  Within the CoinDesk 20, a group of 20 curated digital assets, the top performing coins in October were Polygyon’s MATIC, which climbed 56%; Polkadot’s DOT, up 36%; and Ethereum’s ether (ETH), which rose by 30%.  Altcoin roundup  Avalanche developers and investors form $200 million investment fund: A group of former Ava Labs and Avalanche Foundation staff has launched “Blizzard,” an AVAX-focused venture capital and incubation fund, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. The fund raised $200 million in an initial seed investment that included participation from the Avalanche Foundation, Ava Labs and Polychain Capital, among others. The fund will invest in early-stage projects across the Avalanche ecosystem, including decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, social tokens and more.  DeFi startup Notional launches V2 upgrade: Fixed-rate cryptocurrency lending startup Notional has launched its V2 upgrade in an effort to boost its decentralized finance (DeFi) presence, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reported. The company said the new iteration of its platform has improved security and liquidity. Notional, which closed a $10 million Series A funding round in April, offers fixed-rate debt using an on-chain automated market maker (AMM) to let users borrow USD coin (USDC) and DAI for up to one year and bitcoin (wBTC) and ether (ETH) for up to six months.  SQUID token developers leave the project after token crashes: The developers behind a play-to-earn token SQUID inspired by Netflix’s show “Squid Game” have left the project after the price crashed to nearly zero, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported. The project gained instant popularity after its release and rose by more than 35,000% in just three days despite several red flags. At press time, the project’s official website and its account on Medium were down and the account was temporarily restricted by Twitter for “unusual activity.”  Relevant News  Binance Temporarily Disables All Crypto Withdrawals, Cites Backlog  NFT Platform OneOf Signs 3-Year Deal With Grammys  Genesis Digital Expands in US With 300MW Bitcoin Mining Facility in Texas  November Is Crypto Literacy Month  Other markets  Most digital assets in the CoinDesk 20 ended the day higher.

42394374,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcjcT,1635801473,Why Stablecoin Regulation Isn’t ‘Urgent’,"A new report and recommendations on the regulation of stablecoins issued today by a coalition of U.S. financial authorities is, on the whole, sensible and contains a lot of elements that crypto advocates taking the long view should support. But it strikes a worrying tone of urgency that could lead to a regulatory power grab in the almost-certain absence of clear action by legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.  Stablecoins, such as tether and USDC, are cryptocurrency tokens tied to a basket of assets meant to “peg” each token’s value to a stable currency, such as U.S. dollars. By far the most worrisome element of stablecoins is that the assets backing them are not subject to consistent oversight, raising serious concerns about their quality and, yes, stability. In the event of a broad market downturn, a supposed stablecoin backed by fragile instruments could instead lose value rapidly in the crypto equivalent of a bank run.  David Morris is CoinDesk’s chief insights columnist  The new report, a joint project of a Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, broadly proposes rigorous new oversight of stablecoin backing. The report goes so far as to suggest bringing stablecoin issuers into the U.S. federal deposit insurance system, making them very close equivalents to traditional banks, “subject to supervision and regulation at the depository institution level by a federal banking agency and consolidated supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve at the holding company level.”  That recommendation represents a welcome acknowledgment of the validity of stablecoins as a potentially useful financial and technological innovation. The report even hints at a path for existing traditional financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, which could be a significant net positive for the growth of cryptocurrency as an element of the broader financial system.  (The report does not address so-called “algorithmic stablecoins.” I’m still convinced they’re financial magic beans, but they are far less-widely used than backed stablecoins. This omission should be welcomed, as it gives these Baron Munchausens of crypto more runway to prove they can somehow hold themselves up by their own bootstraps. Or not.)  There are portions of the report that seem more debatable, particularly those focused on the technological and operational risks of stablecoins. Without downplaying the real risks, it’s hard to imagine a federal regulator qualified to oversee those elements of a stablecoin, and the report does not show awareness of the potential for robust oversight of the systems and code by the industry and public. The phrase “open source” does not appear.  The most worrisome part of the report, though, is the real-world path to regulation that it implies. To its credit, the report leads off its recommendations with a call for legislative action, which would involve more public debate, oversight and room to capture the operational nuances of a new technology than if agencies were to regulate stablecoins through existing law drafted for fundamentally different kinds of systems.  Unfortunately, this legislative focus feels like window dressing in what could very well wind up a regulatory power grab. Given U.S. legislative dysfunction, the report’s call for new laws covering stablecoins may not lead to much productive action, and the report seems well aware of this. In the final section, it states that “in the absence of congressional action, the agencies recommend that the [Financial Stability Oversight] Council consider steps available to it to address the risks outlined in this report.”  In other words, if Congress doesn’t act decisively (which the report’s authors certainly know it won’t), the report urges regulators to enact its recommendations anyway.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  It repeatedly suggests that stablecoins pose an immediate threat to consumers, if not the financial system as a whole. It describes the situation as “urgent,” for instance stating that “legislation is urgently needed” to address the issue. But the language of urgency in regulation and legislation is almost always reason to worry about a power grab in the making.  In this case, the sense of urgency also seems clearly wrong. Stablecoins are still an extremely niche financial instrument, in usage if not in overall value. Serious oversight is justified in the long term if stablecoins become more widely adopted as a consumer payments instrument, which could expose everyday users to serious and hidden risks. But right now they are overwhelmingly used by speculative traders who, it must be said, should be well aware of their inherent risks and seem to simply not care.  Read more: What Stablecoins Might Become - Bennett Tomlin  Even assuming that the collapse of a stablecoin like tether would impact the market for bitcoin, only about 14% of Americans currently own bitcoin, and they should know it’s still a speculative investment (especially now that the Federal Trade Commission has warned crypto exchanges against downplaying risks in their marketing).  I am personally very worried that financial instability could lead to the rapid and chaotic unwind of stablecoins, with serious consequences for crypto-assets up to and including bitcoin. But regulators shouldn’t be in the business of preventing people from losing money when they make risky bets.  There is no reason to believe that even a legislature disproportionately made up of grandstanding, self-interested blowhards doesn’t have a decent amount of runway to learn more about a novel, niche instrument before trying to impose one single vision of how it should work.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,David Z.

The provider of diversified digital infrastructure services said Monday the ETF, which will be the first product offered by its Cosmos Asset Management unit, will be named Cosmos Global Digital Miners Access ETF and listed under the code “DIGA.CXA.”  The ETF will track the performance of the Global Digital Miners Index, which is managed by Standard & Poor’s, according to a statement. The press release didn’t specify when the ETF will start trading.  The ETF’s top three holdings will be Galaxy Digital with a 20% allocation within the fund, while Hut 8 and Marathon Digital will both have a 14% weighting, according to the Cosmos Asset Management website.  The ETF comes amid a recent flurry of new cryptocurrency-related ETFs that have launched in the U.S. and in other countries.  “The Cosmos Global Digital Miners Access ETF is designed to provide access to global leaders listed on national exchanges with a focus on cryptocurrency asset mining and infrastructure,” Mawson founder and CEO James Manning said in a statement.  Other ETFs that have heavy exposure to crypto miners include Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF (RIGZ), which is up 74% since its inception in July, and Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which has climbed 24% since launching earlier this year and, according to an announcement on Monday, has surpassed $100 million in assets under management.

42424382,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2o0Bh,1635799611,Pension Funds Wade Gingerly Into Crypto Investments,"The Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF) made news recently when it announced it was investing $25 million in bitcoin and ether, marking what was believed to be the first time a U.S. pension fund had put cryptocurrencies directly on its balance sheet.  Of course, $25 million is only a drop in the bucket compared to the $5.5 billion in total assets held by the fund – more precisely, it represents just 0.5% of its portfolio. But it still was a notable first step by the historically conservative investment fund. And if other pension and retirement funds follow suit, it could open up a huge source of additional demand for cryptocurrencies, with the funds collectively controlling trillions of dollars in global assets.  To be sure, the HFRRF was not the first U.S. pension fund to invest in crypto more broadly. That distinction appears to belong to the Fairfax County Police Officers Retirement System and Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System, which in 2018 began investing in funds managed by Morgan Creek Digital that would eventually add up to a combined $73 million. The Morgan Creek funds leaned more toward blockchain technology than bitcoin, however, so the pension funds considered the moves venture capital investments.  In September, news broke that the pension funds, which manage a combined $7.2 billion in assets, were planning to make a$50 million investment in Parataxis Capital Management’s main fund, which buys digital tokens and cryptocurrency derivatives. The investment has since been approved by the funds’ board.  Asked if the funds are considering further crypto investments and whether direct investments were on the table, Katherine Molnar, chief investment officer for the police officers retirement fund, said her organization is “considering further investments in the crypto/digital assets space.”  “We have not made a final decision as to what form that might take. We remain constructive on the expected growth of this area,” Molnar told CoinDesk in an email.  Growing investment trend?  Last week, Bank of America weighed in on pension investments in cryptocurrencies in a digital assets-focused research note.  “Our discussions suggest that many pension funds are still in the exploratory stage. State pension funds in the U.S. are significantly underfunded with ~$1.25 [trillion] in unfunded liabilities as of the end of FY19, which has led many to attempt to make up the shortfall between plan assets and obligations through investments. Pension funds globally held $35 [trillion] in AUM [assets under management] at the end of 2020, illustrating the potential tailwinds for digital assets if more pension funds begin to add exposure,” wrote analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss.  BofA referenced the HFRRF and Fairfax pension fund investments and noted that Queensland Investment Corporation, Australia’s fifth-largest pension fund, has expressed interest in cryptocurrency investments.  On the other hand, pension funds in South Africa could be prohibited from investing in cryptocurrencies under a rule change proposal published last week. Other overseas pension investments also face potential limitations on their ability to invest in crypto.  In the U.K., for example, pension funds hire specialized investment managers to invest on their behalf, with fund trustees unable to participate in the day-to-day management of the fund, Kerrin Rosenberg, CEO of U.K.-based pension management firm Cardano Investment, which is unrelated to the blockchain, told CoinDesk.  “I am not aware of any U.K. pensions actually considering a strategic allocation to cryptocurrency as an asset class. I would expect that most of the asset allocation models used by consultants don’t cover cryptocurrency, and, if asked, the consultants would probably argue,” Rosenberg wrote in an email.  “However, cryptocurrency investment could be made on a more tactical basis by investment managers as part of a wider mandate,” Rosenberg added.  James Stickland, CEO of London-based digital asset trading infrastructure developer Elwood Technologies, was also skeptical that the U.S. pension investment trend would make it to the U.K.  “In the U.K., we’re seeing rising institutional demand from banks, hedge funds, private companies and even family offices. Yet, it is unprecedented to see pension funds weighting even a small percentage of their portfolios to risk assets like bitcoin. I don’t think we will see them following the lead of pension funds in the U.S. anytime soon, but it’s certainly possible if inflation continues to be a concern,” Stickland said via email.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | RESEARCH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/01/pension-funds-wade-gingerly-into-crypto-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/effc2c5f6c9d33eb850b2a5a628af299e6e568d5-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411149,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kiI,1635796131,Most Influential 2021: Vote Now,"CoinDesk’s annual list of the “Most Influential” people in the cryptocurrency industry has been a year-end holiday tradition since 2014.  It’s our way of raising and praising the finest, those shipping the most-used products, onboarding those who need crypto the most and setting a high bar for us all. For a long time we have celebrated people who were admired in crypto circles but hardly well known in the world at large.  This year is a little different. We’re still publishing the list in December, but the tenor has changed. Crypto, in 2021, went from a niche financial asset to a global phenomenon. It is entangling, disrupting and beginning to replace all others (just a little hyperbole for listicles).  In the past, “influence” in crypto meant having an impact on a relatively enclosed system. Now it could mean changing the world.  Take non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. While still very much a medium for speculation, this general purpose technology is finding a big fit with culture makers. Esteemed media brands like The Economist, The New Yorker and Fortune (to name just a few) are experimenting with these unique digital assets to raise money for charity and – more significantly for a beleaguered but vital publishing industry – their business operations. The same might be said for any number of musicians, artists and scientists.  Last year, bitcoin ended up on the balance sheet of a few Fortune 500 tech companies. This year it’s a treasury asset for a nation-state.  The rise of stablecoins, or crypto assets designed to maintain a consistent value, are pushing governments to update their money for the 21st century. While only a few countries have issued central bank digital currencies (CBDC), just about all are considering them.  People deep into crypto have a habit of measuring success by looking at which legacy institutions are getting on board. So-and-so minted an NFT. XYZ bank has a crypto play. This or that company is integrating Lightning payments. The rapid pace of adoption this past year has strained that mode of thinking; the details get lost as trends emerge.  And yet, there are still real people behind the revolution who work every day to bring the biggest ideas to life. CoinDesk’s eighth “Most Influential” series, arguably the most significant to date, is an attempt to recognize those individuals.  Determining who was Most Influential this year is hard – and we could use your help. Below is a survey of about 100 contenders determined by CoinDesk editors and reporters. Cast a vote to help us narrow the list to the final 10 (you’ll be able to nominate your top five).  More important, if you think we missed anyone, please write in their names. Things are moving fast and some people may have escaped our attention. (That said, we try not to repeat anyone from previous lists – so if you’re confused why Vitalik Buterin isn’t long-listed, it’s because he was Most Influential before this year.)  Crypto is indisputably changing the world, but that may not always be for the best. The industry has serious problems it needs to reckon with – an inexcusable gender imbalance, a troublesome carbon footprint and a habit of harboring scammers, to name a few.  The same may be said for those on this list. You may disagree with their views or loathe their impact but influence is not a value judgment. It’s the power to effect change – for better or worse.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/01/most-influential-2021-vote-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b84c63f5f98d3be997bce867c05bb0a59f039550-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424393,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2o0Nh,1635795807,Biden Administration to Congress: Put Stablecoins Under Federal Supervision – Or We Will,"A group of U.S. regulators urged lawmakers to subject stablecoin issuers to the same strict federal oversight as banks, in a highly anticipated report released Monday.  Congress should also require custodial wallet providers to be regulated by a federal agency and limit stablecoin issuers’ interactions with non-financial companies such as tech or telecom providers, the President’s Working Group for Financial Markets said. The latter recommendation appeared to be aimed squarely at Diem, formerly Libra, the controversial stablecoin project created by Meta, the social media giant previously known as Facebook.  The report is part of an escalating effort by policymakers to rein in this $138 billion segment of the broader crypto market to mitigate the risks they believe stablecoins pose to consumers, markets and the financial system. Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of another asset such as the U.S. dollar, have seen explosive growth over the last two years despite lingering questions about their backing.  “Without the safeguards, I think the industry and regulators alike think we might miss out on some potential benefits of financial innovation,” Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang told CoinDesk. “So I think there’s a common appreciation of needing a framework that isn’t too onerous, provides protections and can keep the innovation moving forward.”  If Congress fails to pass such laws, the regulatory agencies have the authority to take their own measures. However, the group gave the impression it would prefer that it doesn’t happen.  “We believe legislation is important,” Liang said. “This is a new technology, a new innovation. It shouldn’t be surprising that the current regulatory framework isn’t set up to address some of the new kinds of risks that this could pose.”  Congress may be willing to get involved. Members of both the Democratic and Republican parties have been engaged in discussions around regulating cryptocurrencies at large and stablecoins in particular, Liang said.  The working group is nominally composed of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam. Each of these individuals could designate a representative to participate in the group.  Other bank regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, were also represented in the group.  A footnote to the report notes that stablecoins are used for trading, lending and borrowing, but the report added that these tokens may eventually become a means of payment for businesses and households.  Another footnote specified that the report is not addressing any potential stablecoin issues under federal securities or commodities laws, but the report itself did acknowledge the SEC and CFTC’s authority to oversee stablecoins that meet the provisions of these laws.  The legislation would apply to stablecoin issuers that are headquartered in the U.S., operate stablecoins that people in the U.S. can access or otherwise have a strong tie to the U.S.  Congressional entreaties  The group’s chief recommendation is that Congress draft and pass legislation that would ensure a federal regulator can oversee the stablecoin industry.  “To address the prudential risks of payment stablecoins, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets … recommend[s] that Congress act promptly to enact legislation to ensure that payment stablecoins and payment stablecoin arrangements are subject to a federal prudential framework on a consistent and comprehensive basis,” the report said.  Treating stablecoin issuers like other federally regulated insured depository institutions would address risk concerns, the report said, going so far as to say that these types of institutions should be the only entities able to issue stablecoins.  “In particular, with respect to stablecoin issuers, legislation should provide for supervision on a consolidated basis; prudential standards; and, potentially, access to appropriate components of the federal safety net,” the report said. “The legislation would prohibit other entities from issuing payment stablecoins. Legislation should also ensure that supervisors have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.”  The report notes that a single entity might not be responsible for all parts of a stablecoin’s operations. It broke the stablecoin process down to three components: the token’s issuance, how it’s exchanged and how it’s stored.  Legislation should address all three components and allow each part to continue to be conducted by a different entity, the report said.  To that end, the report also recommends that Congress specifically address custodial wallet providers, placing them under a federal regulator as well. At the moment this recommendation is limited to wallet providers that specifically offer stablecoin services, a senior administration official told CoinDesk. Custody of non-stablecoin digital assets and custodial wallets that don’t offer stablecoin services are not covered by this recommendation.  At the moment, Anchorage, Paxos and Protego are the only crypto companies overseen by a federal regulator. All three companies have conditional trust charters through the OCC. Exchanges and other stablecoin issuers are otherwise overseen at the state level in the U.S., with companies like Gemini issuing stablecoins under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services.  Tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC), the top two stablecoins by market capitalization, are not issued by federally regulated companies, although Coinbase and Circle (the companies behind USDC) are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.  USDT, issued by a company incorporated in Hong Kong that has settled two different investigations by U.S. agencies, makes up half of the overall stablecoin market, with $71 billion of tokens in circulation at press time. USDC brings another $33 billion to the sector, according to CoinGecko.  In contrast, the Binance and Paxos dollars, both of which are issued by Paxos, account for about $14 billion, or around 1/10th of the overall stablecoin market.  Other stablecoin issuers remain largely outside the supervision of any U.S.-based regulators.  “Because payment stablecoins are an emerging and rapidly developing type of financial asset, legislation should provide regulators flexibility to respond to future developments and adequately address risks across a variety of organizational structures,” the report said.  Despite the central role stablecoins play in decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing and lending, the report does not address these projects specifically. While DeFi is mentioned in the document, it is “not the subject of the recommendations in this report.”  Still, the report details how stablecoins fit into DeFi, including through automated market makers.  Carrot and stick  The stablecoin report goes to great pains to emphasize that Congress should enact legislation giving a federal regulator the authority to oversee stablecoins.  Should Congress not act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) could designate some stablecoin activities as being “systemically important payment, clearing and settlement activities” (PCS activities), which would give federal agencies the authority to draft their own regulations around stablecoins. The council, created in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, is made up of financial regulators from different agencies and chaired by the Treasury secretary.  “Financial institutions that engage in designated PCS activities also would be subject to an examination and enforcement framework. Any designation would follow a transparent process,” the report said.  Even before this happens, agencies like the SEC and CFTC as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could take advantage of a number of consumer finance or financial regulation laws to enforce risk protection rules against issuers.  The report also notes that stablecoin transactions could fall under the aegis of “money transmission services,” subjecting these entities to anti-money-laundering and Bank Secrecy Act regulations.  While the report seems to threaten that FSOC or other federal agencies can take independent action, the authors indicate that this is a contingency plan if Congress does not act on its own to enact legislation in line with its recommendations.  “The rapid growth of stablecoins increases the urgency of this work. Failure to act risks growth of payment stablecoins without adequate protection for users, the financial system, and the broader economy. In contrast, a regulatory framework that supports confidence in payment stablecoins, in normal times and in periods of stress, could increase the likelihood of stablecoins supporting beneficial payments options,” the report said.  Risks  The group’s recommendations are borne out of three main risks identified by the report, ranging from the personal to the systemic.  The report identified what it described as “key gaps” in how regulators could oversee stablecoins, particularly with regard to banking regulations.  “These prudential recommendations apply to ‘payment stablecoins,’ defined as those stablecoins that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency and, therefore, have the potential to be used as a widespread means of payment,” the report said. “These stablecoins are often, although not always, characterized by a promise or expectation that the stablecoin can be redeemed on a one-to-one basis for fiat currency.”  According to the document, stablecoins pose risks to users through the possibility that they may break their peg, which could lead to a run on the stablecoin, which could further harm any investors who expect the token to maintain price parity with the fiat currency to which it’s pegged. The document cited concerns such as the possibility that stablecoins are backed by commercial paper and other risky securities rather than cash.  “If stablecoin issuers do not honor a request to redeem a stablecoin, or if users lose confidence in a stablecoin issuer’s ability to honor such a request, runs on the arrangement could occur that may result in harm to users and the broader financial system,” the report said.  There are also payment system risks, including credit, liquidity, operational, governance and settlement risks. These issues could appear as financial shocks or reliability concerns for individuals using stablecoins as a means of payment.  Stablecoins could one day pose a systemic risk to the U.S. financial system as well, the report said.  “The failure or distress of that entity could adversely affect financial stability and the real economy,” the document said.  A stablecoin issuer and wallet provider working with a commercial entity could amass outsized economic power, a scenario the report likened to mixing of banking and commerce interests, which U.S. law has largely forbidden since the 1930s.  This type of union could let a party use information like credit ratings or other data to restrict how a customer could access goods and services.  “This combination could have detrimental effects on competition and lead to market concentration in sectors of the real economy,” the report said.  A long time coming  The working group announced in July it was examining stablecoins and their potential risks to the financial sector with an eye to mitigating any potential financial stability risks.  It’s not a new concern. The group met under former President Donald Trump at the end of 2020, announcing concerns about the scale of stablecoin payments and the potential risks they posed.  In preparing the report, members of the group spoke to representatives from stablecoin issuers including Tether, Paxos, Gemini, Coinbase, Circle and the Diem Association, the document said.  Digital asset custody providers like Anchorage and payment providers like Visa, Mastercard, Square and Stripe also provided input, as did trade associations, third-party experts, academics and banking organizations.  Some industry participants have had only a limited voice in this process, complained Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who drafted an open letter to Treasury Secretary Yellen last month asking for greater consultation with the sector.  The administration official told CoinDesk that the group held a handful of roundtable discussions with industry participants and the other experts tapped.  Stablecoins have been on the regulatory radar for over two years now, but attention to this segment of the crypto industry has ramped up in recent months as regulators around the world began publishing their conclusions.  Last month, the Financial Stability Board, an international body, published a report finding that some nearly 50 different nations have “gaps” in their regulatory framework for stablecoins, which could allow entities to engage in “regulatory arbitrage,” referring to businesses that jump from a jurisdiction with a stringent regulatory framework to one with fewer rules.  Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements, a central bank for central banks, argued that countries should require stablecoin issuers to comply with existing international payment, clearing and settlement rules.  Reading the fine print  Monday’s report is specific to stablecoins and how they might fare if they are treated like banks. However, the footnotes hint that more may be to come from the Biden administration.  One such note said the administration will continue evaluating cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology at large, emphasizing how today’s document is restricted to stablecoins.  And while the report did mention DeFi and non-bank regulators, it hinted that there may be more specific proposals or suggestions around these aspects of the crypto market and regulation as well.  “While the scope of this report is limited to stablecoins, work on digital assets and other innovations related to cryptographic and distributed ledger technology is ongoing throughout the Administration,” the document said.

42421037,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHen,1635793851,Identity Thieves Exploit El Salvador’s Chivo Bitcoin Wallet’s Setup Process,"At first, Cynthia Gutierrez refused to download Chivo, the digital wallet developed by El Salvador’s government for the use of bitcoin throughout the country and released on Sept. 7.  She decided to open the app on Oct. 16 after learning from fellow Salvadorans that hackers had activated wallets associated with the nine-digit numbers on their identity cards, known as DUI for its acronym in Spanish.  “This was growing more and more, reaching into my close circle,” Gutierrez, 28, told CoinDesk.  When Gutierrez entered her personal information, a screen popped up saying her document number was already associated with a wallet. Immediately, she took a screenshot, fearing that her data would be used for illicit purposes.  Gutierrez’s case is one of the hundreds that Salvadorans have reported on social media and to local advocates since September, when bitcoin was established as legal tender and Chivo started being massively used in the country.  Between Oct. 9 and Oct. 14, Cristosal, a human rights organization in El Salvador, received 755 notifications of Salvadorans reporting identity theft with their Chivo Wallets, Rina Montti, the group’s director of human rights research, told CoinDesk.  In the majority of those cases, the affected Salvadorans tried to activate their wallets after they learned of the large number of people reporting that their identities had been stolen.  The hackers had an incentive: Each wallet came loaded with $30 worth of bitcoin, provided by the administration of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to encourage citizens to use the cryptocurrency.  El Salvador’s government did not respond to a request for comment about claims of identity theft involving the wallets by press time.  With the adoption of bitcoin, Bukele positioned his Central American country at the center of a global discussion about the future of money. The process was not without its critics, such as those made against Article 7 of the law, which stipulates that all merchants must accept bitcoin as a form of payment when customers offer it.  The president later denied that bitcoin acceptance would be mandatory. Salvadorans were baffled by the discrepancy between what the president said and what the law stated.  In August, polls showed that 65% to 70% of Salvadorans opposed the adoption of bitcoin, and several protest marches took place in the streets. According to the latest official data provided by Bukele at the end of September, more than 2 million people downloaded the Chivo Wallet, as part of an aggressive agenda that also included bitcoin mining with volcanic energy.  Easy to fool  According to Chivo’s official website, opening an account requires scanning the DUI front and back, and then performing facial recognition to check the registrant’s identity. But several Salvadorans reported evidence that the system is flawed.  When Adam Flores, a Salvadoran YouTuber who runs the channel La Gatada SV, heard about the hacks, he remembered that his grandmother had not opened her Chivo Wallet and decided to use the case as a test. Even though he only had a photocopy of her DUI, he tried it anyway and, to his amazement, the application accepted the document as valid.  Flores followed through with the verification process, which then asked for real-time facial recognition. The YouTuber snapped a photo of a poster on his wall of Sarah Connor — a character from the “Terminator” movie series.  Seconds later, Chivo Wallet welcomed his grandmother and released the $30 incentive, according to a video Flores sent to CoinDesk as evidence.  Other cases uploaded to social media directly showed how just a random photo — in one case, of a coffee mug — was enough to replace the DUI and then fool the face recognition test.  Salvadorans do not always try to open their accounts themselves. According to Montti, of Cristosal, most of the 700 Salvadorans who reported identity theft asked acquaintances to try to transfer money through Chivo by putting their DUI numbers in the recipient field. They discovered the addresses were ready to receive transfers. In other words, the ID numbers were already registered, by someone other than the rightful owner.  Worried about impersonation, Ramón Esquivel asked an acquaintance to send money to a wallet with his DUI on Oct. 11. To his surprise, the transfer was successful, even though he had never activated his account.  “With anger, I realized that they had used my DUI,” Esquivel told CoinDesk, adding that after the episode he filed a complaint in the attorney general’s office. “I’m exposed to being used to commit acts of money laundering that would be registered under my identity, compromising my integrity,” he stated.  Other cases showed that the fraudsters diverted the money to accounts that were not even their own, but those of other hacked people.  Customer support  Two weeks ago, Gabriela Sosa, a Salvadoran media host, tried to activate a Chivo Wallet with her DUI, but an error message jumped up on the screen informing her it was already registered.  As soon as it happened, she called the official support number for Chivo, 192. “I kept calling for several days until they told me I had to go to a Chivo point,” Sosa told CoinDesk. Last Saturday, she went to that help center and her account was finally recovered, but the money was not.  On her Twitter account, Sosa released details of the account to which the $30 had been directed. The owner’s name was Michael Santacruz.  Days later, co-workers and university colleagues sent screenshots of that tweet to Santacruz, who had never activated his Chivo account until then, according to private chat messages he sent to Sosa that she posted.  He tried, then, to open his account but a notification said his DUI had already been registered. Like Sosa, Santacruz approached a Chivo help center, and after recovering his account, he realized that it had been used to receive money from five hacked accounts, he said. (Attempts to reach Santacruz for comment were unsuccessful.)  Cristosal was not the only nongovernmental organization (NGO) to tackle the problem. Acción Ciudadana, a non-profit specializing in social auditing, filed a notice to the Attorney General’s Office (FGR) on Oct. 12 after the group’s President Humberto Sáenz and Director Eduardo Escobar found hackers had registered their Chivo Wallets.  Acción Ciudadana told CoinDesk that up to now, two weeks after the filing, there was no response from the FGR.  Laura Nathalie Hernández, a tech lawyer at the Salvadoran firm Legal Novis, has been receiving requests for help from victims of identity theft regarding their Chivo Wallets. The first recommendation she gave to the affected people was to post the incident on social media to make it public and also file a report with the attorney general’s office.  According to Hernández, the entity that manages the application should be the first place to turn to. “But we don’t have much information about who is responsible either,” she said, adding: “We don’t know who manages it, if there is a third company. There has been no transparency.”  Unclear accountability  According to Chivo’s terms and conditions, the authorization of an account is conditioned on a know-your-customer (KYC) process carried out by CHIVO S.A. de C.V., a private company created by the government to launch the wallet. This verification process “includes the provision of the information and documents required for full compliance with the process.”  The company’s accountability is unclear. According to the terms and conditions, users agree “not to disclose or divulge to third parties any information, DUIs, passwords or any code used to access the site.” But the terms also state that it “will not be liable for any loss or damage that the user may suffer as a result of unauthorized third party access to your account as a result of hacks or lost passwords.”  Chivo’s support staff did not answer CoinDesk’s questions about who is responsible for a hack where the real account owner does not provide information.  The wallet adds that the verification services will be provided by the company directly and/or through a third party contracted by the company for such purpose. But by press time, it had not answered CoinDesk’s question about what other third party provides identification services to the platform.  Sosa, the Salvadoran media host, told CoinDesk that she eventually got her money back and emphasized that her complaint is not against the application or Bukele’s government, just that she wants to raise awareness of the problem.  Gutierrez has not yet recouped her money. “I tried to contact customer service, and they did not give me an answer, nor is there an institution that is clear about the process to follow in this case,” she said.  Esquivel said he is not interested in either the $30 incentive or the government app.  “If I use bitcoin at all, it will be with a wallet in which I have custody of my money,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/29/identity-thieves-exploit-el-salvadors-chivo-bitcoin-wallets-setup-process,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0546d679cc41f70b42d547b591e7b31249e44cf7-1440x962.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424379,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2o07h,1635793631,"BIS Report Questions Whether Stablecoins, CBDCs Can Create Risks in Developing Countries","A number of emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE) have been looking at stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to address weaknesses in their financial systems.  But according to a paper released Friday by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), these digital currencies may create daunting issues in these markets and not address problems that other fintech innovations are tackling.  “Stablecoin arrangements aspire to improve financial inclusion and cross-border remittances – but they are neither necessary nor sufficient to meet these policy goals,” the authors of the report, entitled “What Does Digital Money Mean for Emerging Market and Developing Countries,” write.  EMDEs in Latin America and other regions have turned increasingly to stablecoins as a store of value. Stablecoins have appeal in countries where the local currencies tend to be less stable and possibly subject to capital controls because of inflation.  The Basel, Switzerland-based BIS is a 91-year organization that supports central banks’ efforts to create banking and financial stability through research and by fostering cooperation among central banks on a range of issues.  The report’s authors question whether stablecoins could “offer lasting competitive advantages over rapidly developing, evolving digital payment services,” including digital ID, e-money and mobile banking. They add that stablecoins could generate new risks related to such issues as governance, efficiency in payment processes, consumer protection and data privacy.  The authors raise concerns about CBDCs, writing that “there is a risk that in periods of systematic stress, (that) households and other agents may shift from bank deposits or other instruments into the CBDC, spurring a ‘digital run’ of unprecedented speed and scale,” and questioning “whether they are necessary or desirable for all jurisdictions.”  But the authors also write that stablecoins in particular have “drawn great – and much needed – attention to the challenges of financial inclusion and cross-border payments and remittances.” This development has underscored efforts to foster a less restrictive regulatory environment, improve “monetary and financial stability frameworks and payment infrastructures, particularly across borders.”",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/30/bis-report-questions-whether-stablecoins-cbdcs-can-create-risks-in-developing-countries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bba51485f26abb692e6ef6bcc557b0fc965919a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

China’s Big Tech appears to be facing increasing pressure over the companies’ involvement with NFTs. The market hype around the unique digital assets appears to have made regulators worried that NFTs are edging too close to crypto trading, which has been practically banished from China in large part for creating too much market speculation.  The “Digital Culture and Creative Industries Self-Regulation Convention” is made up of 11 tenets that align with central government aims including “enabling the real economy; promoting national culture; supporting the development of the industry; adhering to the original letter of the law; ensuring value support; protecting consumer rights; working with controllable consortium chains; maintaining cybersecurity; ending virtual currencies; preventing speculation and financial risks; and preventing money laundering.”  The National Copyright Trading Center Alliance, the China Academy of Fine Arts, state broadcaster CCTV’s Animation Studio and Hunan Museum also signed the convention along with Tencent’s cloud division and JD.com’s technology subsidiary.  Ant Group and Tencent recently changed references on their websites and platforms from NFTs to “digital collectibles,” likely to put more distance between their products and crypto markets.  Red Date CEO Yifan He confirmed during a Friday conference the companies were trying to distance their “digital collectibles” from crypto. Red Date is building the Blockchain Services Network, a government-backed internet of blockchains. The Beijing company launched its own NFT infrastructure at the conference.  In its statement on the name change, AntChain, Ant Group’s blockchain arm, all but said that it wanted to appease regulators who think the name “NFTs” causes too much speculation. The company conducts its digital collectibles business in compliance with regulations and opposes market speculation, AntChain said.  NFTs have, up to this point, mostly been exempted from China’s crackdown on crypto.

42413897,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlsnT,1635792794,Crypto Fund Inflows Slow After Record Jolt From Bitcoin Futures ETF,"Digital asset products investments cooled last week, ebbing from a record fueled by the debut of the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund.  Digital asset investment products saw a total of $288 million in inflows during the week ended Oct. 29, a report Monday by CoinShares showed. That’s down from a record $1.47 billion during the prior week, but it helped to push inflows to $8.7 billion for the year to date.  As in the previous week, the majority of new investments went into bitcoin-related funds, at about $269 million.  The decrease in flows coincided with a market pause: Bitcoin (BTC) hit an all-time high of $66,974 on Oct. 20 but retreated last week and was changing hands at $61,359 as of press time on Monday.  Inflows into U.S.-based ETFs slowed as the initial hype that accompanied the launches faded. The new vehicles added $53 million of assets last week. The first bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 19 under the ticker BITO and quickly gathered over $1 billion in assets – the fastest-ever ETF to hit the milestone.  Altcoins flows  The Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), broke its three-week dry spell last week, with fund inflows of $16.6 million. Year to date, ether funds have brought in $1.06 billion, second only to the $6.37 billion of inflows into bitcoin funds in 2021.  Other altcoins saw inflows last week, with funds focused on Solana garnering $15 million, Cardano $5 million and Polkadot $6.2 million.

42394388,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckh9,1635792301,The Metaverse We Didn’t Ask For,"The big takeaway from Facebook’s disturbing, somnambulant keynote last week is that the company is going all-in on the “metaverse” – a persistent digital layer sitting on top of the real world, accessible via virtual and augmented reality technologies.  The concept itself isn’t new: Sci-fi authors have been prognosticating about this sort of thing for decades. Put on your headset and find yourself in an immersive digital world, a fantasy land where the coronavirus pandemic never happened, and where Facebook never admitted responsibility for facilitating ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Part of what’s so uncanny about Facebook’s take on the metaverse – and rebranding as “Meta” – is that it still feels like speculative fiction. Mark Zuckerberg envisions a world straight out of the film “Ready Player One,” where logging on is a form of escape.  Though it was meant as an opening salvo for a new era of technological achievement, Zuckerberg’s presentation was mostly just alienating. The backgrounds were fully green-screened; the speakers looked like they were being held at gunpoint; and even after 80 minutes, the applications for this tech remain unclear.  As my colleague David Morris pointed out last week, the blockchain industry has already been toying with metaverse tech. Virtual reality programs like Decentraland use non-fungible tokens (NFT) as a form of property rights – tokens are tied to 3D plots of land, which can be bought and sold on the secondary market. It’s crypto as in-game currency, a gamified spin on investing.  Even this feels a little “out there.” We spend our days online, but have yet to completely detach from the real world. Decentraland’s native token, MANA, recently shot up in value thanks to a wave of Facebook-fueled speculation, but how many people would opt for a virtual chat in Decentraland over a face-to-face Zoom call, at this point?  The reality is that some of this tech is already here, in ways that make more sense with the way we live our lives now. The metaverse as it exists today doesn’t require an Oculus headset, and our devices reflect this. Apple started building a LIDAR scanner into some of its iPhones in 2020, which allows for laser-guided measurements in physical space. Face filters on Instagram and Snapchat can provide convincing digital makeup for video calls (TikTok is still at work on its own toolset). And some fashion retailers are betting on “virtual try-on” mechanisms for clothing purchased online, with an assist from augmented reality.  The metaverse envisioned by Facebook is a kind of all-encompassing iteration on these concepts. It wants us to be more engaged, more online, while the world around us degrades. To the extent that the metaverse is already here, it’s an attempt to complement the systems we already use. It doesn’t ask us to completely reorient how we interact with each other online.  In an essay for Gawker called “The Metaverse Is for Babies,” the writer Hanson O’Haver suggested that “it’s almost unimaginable that any adult (who doesn’t run a Silicon Valley company) could be excited about [this] technology.” The Atlantic recently ran a piece with a similarly blunt title – “The Metaverse Is Bad” – which likens the tech to a “black hole of consumption” (a little like the propagandistic billboards from the movie “They Live”).  There’s a history of consumers pushing back against overly ambitious ideas in VR (see: Google Glass); Meta’s success or failure will depend on whether anyone is actually willing to make the jump.",NEGATIVE,MANA,BLOCKCHAIN | MANA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/01/the-metaverse-is-already-here,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/252f50b638a876b0f177c759c5b7d4d7da788f10-5760x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The altcoin has enjoyed glowing success as the market turns to the upside in terms of sentiment. This has helped push ETH and countless altcoins towards new highs in the market. Expectations have been on the rise following this success and Goldman Sachs market analysts believe there are merits to the expectations. Ethereum&apos;s rally towards $4,400 has set it on a path for even greater value. Faith in the asset has been on the rise in the past few months despite the slow month of September. This has caused an influx of both retail and institutional investors into the digital asset, who are investing for the long-term rather than chasing short-term gains. The push towards ETH at $10K continues and market analysts are marking a path that could lead the market there.

42394376,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcjhb,1635784440,The Tragedy of the Third Coin,"There is always the “third coin” in cryptocurrency. This is the rotating coin that occupies the third position in market capitalization behind bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). The third coin is usually characterized as a challenger to the two incumbents. It is favored by new investors and it occupies a centrist position on the cryptocurrency political spectrum.  It has been XRP, binance coin (BNB), and more recently cardano (ADA). There are fewer more dangerous positions to occupy than third in cryptocurrency. The only way is down.  Paul J. Dylan-Ennis is an assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.  Just as there’s a small majority of Americans with a favorite football team, as crypto becomes increasingly familiar to everyday people, they’ve begun to pick and choose their favorite coins.  In the imaginations of third-coin investors, often newcomers to the space, the third coin solves all the problems of the incumbents. Often these investors are not aware of the historical roots of the third coin and they imagine XRP, binance coin or cardano are novel, revolutionary products, fresh off the boat, like themselves.  Its audience are the blockchain-not-bitcoin suits, the intrigued aunt, or the average Joe tinkering with their Robinhood app. For example, the attraction of XRP (prior to the SEC lawsuit) was its association with the company Ripple and its purported use case: to eliminate costly and slow banking infrastructure by replacing it with RippleNet and XRP as the base currency.  To the new investor, Ripple was a legitimate company, with offices all across the world, and not a bunch of “shadowy super coders.” This same investor was not interested in obscure concerns such as decentralization and was quite content with XRP’s centralized, high-trust network that, after all, produced faster transaction times and lower fees, which must be a good thing. Of course, most third-coin investors have probably never seen this first hand since their XRP has only ever existed on the Binance exchange.  Speaking of, BNB follows the same logic. There is a company associated with the coin and not just any company, but one intimately familiar to the new investor, Binance. Naturally, there is also a purported use case. Users can pay fees on Binance in BNB. That this ties the fortunes of BNB long-term to a company that is, like XRP, under immense regulatory scrutiny, has been another harsh lesson for the new investors.  Third coins often benefit from company announcements, but are always at risk of announcements about companies.  Then there is Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It is difficult to capture in words the absolute chaos that is Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It is more or less a copy-and-paste of Ethereum, but as if someone created Ethereum and then stopped maintaining it the day after. It is a lawless land of unexpected bugs and YouTube influencer scams.  It seems in recent times investors have savvied up to the dangers of company coins and sought refuge in the warm comfort of ADA. While XRP and BNB are centralized and centrist, ADA is decentralized, but centrist. Cardano differentiates itself from Ethereum – and is positioned quite explicitly as an Ethereum-killer – in that the code undergoes a rigorous peer-review process, like in academia. It pursues legitimization through academic association.  The new ADA investor is able to defend the lack of core functionality – up until recently Cardano did not have smart contracts – by pointing toward this slow and steady peer-review process. Perhaps the DAO hack (2016) or the Parity bug (2017) would never have happened had Ethereum followed this procedure, assuming, that is, any contemporary ADA investor knows what either of those archaic events are.  Today, ADA, BNB and XRP sit behind tether (USDT) – a stablecoin with massive volume and not a third coin in my sense – waiting their turn for the number three spot. Behind them waits solana (SOL), a third-coin-in-waiting if ever there was one. It is an Ethereum-killer, mildly decentralized or mostly centralized depending on your view, has low fees, fast transactions and squarely targets the investor who just wants to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without paying obscene gas to do so.  Never mind if it goes offline. We’ll just reboot it. Third coin mindset!  The tragedy of the third coin is that the gap in market capitalization between them and ETH, never mind bitcoin, is so large it will likely take a seismic collapse of the incumbents for the challenges to succeed, rather than the challengers catching up due to mass adoption. ETH sits at approximately $350 billion at the time of writing. The next third coin, ADA, at approximately $66 billion.  The worrying conclusion is, and I apologize to all in advance, this seems to situate me, and others like me, as duo-maximalists: those who believe bitcoin and ether are too entrenched to be toppled.

The latest development shows just how risky it can be to invest in a new and hyped token in the crypto market.  As CoinDesk reported last week, the play-to-earn crypto project Squid Game gained instant popularity and the SQUID token rose by more than 35,000% in just three days – despite several red flags including grammatical and spelling errors in the project’s white paper and the fact that the project’s website was registered less than a month ago.  At press time, the project’s official website and its account on Medium were down and Twitter had temporarily restricted its account, saying it had detected “unusual activity” from it.  Early on Monday, Twitter user @__tricck flagged that the developers of the Squid Game project had “rug pulled” SQUID holders. A rug pull in crypto occurs when the creators of a project take off with investor’ funds.  Data from BscScan shows that an address labelled by the website as being “reported to have been involved in a rug pull” dumped SQUID tokens and cashed out millions of dollars worth of BNB tokens. BNB is the native token to Binance Smart Chain.  Data from CoinMarketCap shows that prices for SQUID, were down nearly 99.99% to $0.002541 in the past 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased more than 130% over the same time period, indicating huge selling pressure.  The token is only available for trading on decentralized exchanges PancakeSwap and DODO, both of which are based on Binance Smart Chain.  On Monday, the project claimed in its official Telegram channelthat its developers do not want to continue running the project due to the stress of dealing with scammers.  “Someone is trying to hack our project these days. Not only the twitter account @GoGoSquidGame but also our smart contract. We are trying to protect it but the price is still abnormal. Squid Game Dev does not want to continue running the project as we are depressed from the scammers and is overwhelmed with stress [sic]. We have to remove all the restrictions and the transaction rules of Squid Game. Squid Game will enter a new stage of community autonomy,” it wrote.  Squid Game is not the only crypto project “inspired” by the popular Netflix show, but none of them are officially affiliated with the South Korean survival drama. Prices of other tokens associated with the show, including squid game protocol, squidgametoken, squidanomics and international squid games, were also deep in the red over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Both SHIB and DOGE posted record highs and are now among the top 10 largest digital assets by market valuation, according to CoinMarketCap.  The dog-themed coin SHIB’s 765% gain in October made it the month’s top-performing cryptocurrency among those with a reported market capitalization of at least $10 billion.  The self-proclaimed dogecoin killer has a market cap of $26 billion and reached an all-time high on Oct. 28. At press time, the token was trading 15% below its all-time high.  Last Thursday, dogecoin reached its highest level since Aug. 20, trading near $0.30. It finished the month with a market cap of $36 billion.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.17 trillion, gained 40%, its best monthly performance since December 2020.  Within the CoinDesk 20, a group of 20 curated digital assets, the top performing coins in October were Polygyon’s MATIC, which climbed 56%; Polkadot’s DOT, up 36%; and Ethereum’s ether (ETH), which rose by 30%.  Denis Vinokourov, an independent crypto research analyst, attributes Polygon’s surge through October to its continued focus on gaming and the metaverse.

42411909,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgx6y,1635778640,Paying Off Student Loans? You Can Do It With Crypto,"The student loan debt market in the United States stands at more than $1.73 trillion, with over 42.3 million debtors required to pay an average debt of $39,351 each. For now, the government has put federal loan repayments on pause until January 2022, but that deadline is fast approaching.  For students who hold crypto assets and are interested in exploring different avenues for repaying their loans, there are a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) options worth knowing – though they should be aware of the risks. (This article is for educational purposes only and not financial advice; do your own research and consult a professional before making any kind of investment.)  What is DeFi?  DeFi expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial services. Specifically, DeFi refers to an ecosystem of decentralized applications – autonomous applications that operate using smart contracts instead of relying on an underlying company to manage them.  Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs that perform certain functions when conditions are met. These programs lie at the heart of every decentralized application.  DeFi applications offer a range of financial services similar to the loans, insurance and savings accounts offered by traditional institutions.  The main difference is DeFi applications allow anyone to access these services, regardless of a person’s documentation, credit history or geography. Through DeFi, people have the ability to access collateralized and uncollateralized loans, and earn interest by lending, borrowing and staking crypto assets.  Why is a DeFi loan a viable loan repayment option?  The first thing that makes these solutions appealing is that they offer better interest rates. In some cases, the borrowing rates are near zero.  Another factor is the possibility of accessing loans with a flexible repayment period. When taking DeFi loans, you do not need to make payments on a specific date each month. You can decide to skip a month or two without worrying about the damage it will have on your credit score.  Even more important, because these loans are issued via smart contracts and not by financial institutions you do not need to maintain a good credit score to access these loans.  DeFi loans also allow users to take loans against their crypto holdings to avoid missing out on potential bullish price movements and avoid paying capital gain taxes on sold digital assets. This removes the need to sell your crypto holdings to settle a debt or finance a project.  Another key difference about DeFi loans is that protocols often incentivize users to borrow. Think of it as being paid for taking out a loan. While this system is alien to the traditional financial system, it is a common strategy used by DeFi protocols to attract liquidity and reward users for contributing to their ecosystems. Users are usually rewarded with governance tokens, which allow participants to contribute to the day-to-day running of the protocol.  Now that you understand what makes DeFi loans tick, how can they be used to pay off student loans?  Example: Jim has to pay a $10,000 student loan debt to a private lender. Assuming that Jim’s foray into the crypto industry has yielded $20,000 worth of ether over the years, he can simply sell $10,000 worth of digital assets and, in one swoop, erase his debt. While this approach seems like the right call, it does put Jim in a bad spot. He has sold half of his holdings and, in the process, reduced his position in the crypto market. Therefore, the amount he would have made if the prices of digital assets were to maintain an upward trajectory has been halved. There is also a capital gain tax (CGT) Jim is expected to pay whenever he sells his crypto holdings. In the United States, how much CGT is owed depends on how long a person has held the asset and his or her income tax bracket.  Read more: Crypto Tax 2021: A Complete U.S Guide  A viable alternative is to deposit the $20,000 worth of ether in a DeFi loan platform as collateral and take out $10,000 worth of loan denominated in stablecoins. Then, he can exchange the stablecoins for fiat to pay the outstanding student loan. Jim has his loan denominated in stablecoin so he does not have to deal with price volatility. Because there is no fixed repayment period, Jim can take as long as he needs to repay the DeFi loan - so long his collateral remains valuable enough to prevent risk of liquidation. This approach takes away the pressure of meeting a repayment target each month.  Note: Stablecoins are digital assets backed by fiat currencies to enable stability. Typically, these assets maintain a 1:1 peg to a selected fiat currency. For example, USDT has a 1:1 relationship with the U.S. dollar, which means that if you hold 10 USDT tokens, the value of those tokens will be about $10.  Jim’s debt has not disappeared automatically. Instead, he has transferred his debt to a decentralized ecosystem where he has more freedom to dictate how he wants to make repayments. As an added advantage, the governance tokens or rewards can be sold to pay a fraction of the debt. For instance, USDT borrowers on Aave currently earn 1.66% APR – paid in staked Aave (stkAave) tokens – as rewards when they take out a USDT loan. Notably, the current interest rate of a USDT loan is 3.88%. In light of this, a borrower can use the earnings to pay part of the debt.  Likewise, the size of Jim’s DeFi loan will technically diminish as the price of the digital asset held as collateral rises. To better understand this possibility, it is necessary to discuss the loan-to-value (LTV) metric and how it could impact the activities of DeFi borrowers.  What is LTV?  LTV is a metric indicating the size of your loan relative to your collateral. In essence, LTV is the ratio of loan to collateral. From our example above, Jim has taken out a loan that is worth 50% of his collateral. In essence, his LTV is 50%. If he had taken a $5,000 worth loan, then the LTV would have been 75%. Although some protocols may allow users to borrow over 50% of their collateral, the goal is to ensure that the loans remain over-collateralized to avoid counterparty risks.  The LTV of a borrower is bound to fluctuate all through the duration of the loan, especially if the collateral is denominated in volatile cryptocurrencies. Assuming Jim deposits 5 ETH priced at $4,000 each as collateral, the LTV will automatically reduce if the price of ETH rises to $6,000 in the next two months. Let us do the math to back this up.  Initial price of ETH = $4,000  Number of ETH deposited = 5 ETH  Initial value of collateral = $20,000  Size of loan = $10,000  Original LTV = 50%  Price of ETH at the end of the year = $6,000  Value of collateral at the end of the year = $6000 * 5 = $30,000  LTV at the end of the year = $30,000 * 100% = 33.3%  In summary, Jim’s LTV has reduced from 50% to 33.3% because ETH experienced significant price gains. Note that this example is based on the assumption that Jim has not made any payment whatsoever. However, just as the volatility of cryptocurrencies could potentially reduce the value of the debt, it could also lead to liquidation risks (more on this later).  DeFi loan rates  On platforms such as Aave, Maker and Compound you can access loans with fluctuating interest rates. The rates are determined by several factors, including the demand for the digital asset in question. Depending on the protocol being used, you can also take out loans on DeFi protocols with fixed rates but those come in higher.  Average 30-day lending rates on Compound range from 0.01% to 5.12%, and 0.01% to 5.89% on Aave. Borrowing rates are between 2.79% and 28.06% on Compound and between 0.04% to 168.98% on Aave. Information on Maker was not available.  It is also worth mentioning there are options that do not implement any loan rates whatsoever. Here, the borrower gets to repay only the sum borrowed. An example of a DeFi solution that offers interest-free loans is Liquity.  Self-repaying loans  Another concept that makes DeFi loans unique is the possibility of accessing self-repaying loans. We have already established the potential of paying back a fraction of the loans with rewards earned by depositing digital assets as collateral. Some protocols take this system a little further by incorporating interest-generating opportunities for enabling a self-repayment scheme.  Here, the protocol uses the collateral as capital to fund yield farming operations on other protocols. What this means is that the protocol takes the collateral and deposits it on other DeFi platforms where it can generate interest. Subsequently, the earnings are used to repay the debt repayments over time. In other words, the loan will eventually be canceled by the potential income generated by putting your collateral to good use. Alchemix is an example of a platform that offers this type of service.  What are the risks involved with DeFi loans?  Seeing that DeFi loan is a relatively new concept, it is no surprise it comes with risks. Be sure to consider the following before opting to repay your student loan with DeFi.  Liquidation  Note that these DeFi platforms have liquidity thresholds – the LTV at which collaterals are sold off by the protocol to settle debts. From our original example where Jim borrowed $10,000 at 50% LTV, let’s assume that the liquidation threshold is set at 75% LTV. Hence, Jim must ensure that the value of his loan is kept below ¾ of the total value of his collateral, even if the price of ETH drops astronomically.  Jim could incur liquidation risk if the price of ETH drops from $4,000 to $2,800, thereby causing the value of the collateral to slump from $20,000 to $14,000. In this scenario, Jim must either deposit more collateral or pay the loan instantly. If he fails to complete any of these two actions before the price of ETH slips to $2,680, the protocol will liquidate the collateral to pay the $10,000 loan.  Variable rates  DeFi loan protocols often offer variable rates as the APR fluctuates depending on the demand and supply of digital asset loans. In such cases where the APR increases, DeFi loans become expensive. For those planning to opt for self-repaying loans or other reward-generating techniques, the lack of stable interest rates makes it difficult to accurately gauge how long it would take to repay loans.  Smart contract issues  DeFi protocols are powered by smart contracts, which automate the processes involved in borrowing loans. It is worth mentioning that the underlying codes of these smart contracts are written by humans. Hence, it is impossible to ignore the possibility of encountering errors that could jeopardize the safety of users’ digital assets. We have witnessed time and again how bugs expose smart contract-based protocols to security and systemic risks.  Like every crypto-related opportunity, it is crucial to do your own research before setting out to use DeFi strategies to pay your student loan. While DeFi loans are a great way to reduce the pressure of owing traditional lenders, this technique also exposes borrowers to risks.",NEUTRAL,ETH | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/paying-off-student-loans-you-can-do-it-with-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90ca02fcc732e0248ae38677765a6ba6f4a3e098-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blizzard is kicking off with an initial seed investment of $200 million, including participation from the Avalanche Foundation, Ava Labs, Polychain Capital, Three Arrows Capital, Dragonfly Capital and CMS Holdings, among others. AVAX is the native asset of the Avalanche blockchain.  The new fund comes on the heels of a separate pair of big-budget investment programs, including a $230 million fund primarily devoted to providing liquidity, as well as Avalanche Rush, a $180 million liquidity mining incentive fund.  Read more: Can Avalanche Keep It Up? DeFi Users Rush In as Incentives Roll Out  In an interview with CoinDesk, Ava Labs President John Wu, who will also be leading Blizzard, said the new fund will invest in early-stage projects across the Avalanche ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), social tokens and “all that stuff.”  Rival base layers to Ethereum have been exploding in popularity as of late, and venture capital firms see ample opportunity on each chain to re-create popular Ethereum-native verticals and services at much lower valuations.  A half-dozen current Ava Labs employees will migrate to Blizzard to provide business development and technical support for young teams, and the fund is being envisioned as closer to an incubator in the vein of Y Combinator rather than a pure, cash-only investment outfit. Services for selected projects will include “community building, marketing, introduction to service providers” such as security audits.  The structure of the fund does mean that the Avalanche Foundation and Ava Labs will become owners of governance tokens controlling products in the Avalanche ecosystem, but Wu said that Blizzard will be distributing portions of those tokens to the fund’s founders rather than holding them.  “We want decentralization, as all projects do. And a unique aspect of this fund is that the tokens that get distributed to Blizzard, they will be passed on to the Polychains, the Three Arrows, the Dragonflies, all these guys in the fund.”  Wu is also confident that the $200 million can be quickly deployed.  “We already have deals that we’re warehousing for the fund. The team has seen over 1,100 deals over the last ten months, and the deal flow has only accelerated.”  Wu told CoinDesk that Ava Labs has offered some form of networking, grants or marketing assistance to some 400 teams of the 1,100 that have passed through its doors, and that the team directly invested in 40 of those projects.  “Our biggest regret is not having this set for our partners earlier, because we may have invested in more,” he said.

Huobi said the launch of the Huobi NFT marketplace has been in the works for some time and is a “key milestone” in the expansion of its metaverse strategy.  The metaverse is a space generated by the convergence of virtual worlds, augmented reality and internet services.  The company has also been working on gaming and decentralized finance, or GameFi, projects. In September, Huobi Ventures, the investment arm of Huobi Group, announced it is launching a $10 million fund to invest in early stage GameFi projects.  “NFTs have opened up the public’s eyes to the wide range of blockchain applications out there. The concept of NFTs as an immutable proof of ownership is very powerful, so we’re excited to see where our NFT marketplace will take us,” said Jeff Mei, director of strategy at Huobi Group, in a statement.  An increasing number of NFT marketplaces have launched recently where users can purchase, mint, display and trade NFTs.  Most recently, Sotheby’s, the 277-year-old British auction house, announced the creation of a new platform called “Sotheby’s Metaverse” that allows visitors to view digital artworks available at auction, as well as learn about the collectors and artists behind NFTs.

42424383,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2o0Dh,1635773989,Sfermion Raises $100M NFT Fund as Facebook Stokes Metaverse Mania,"Sfermion, an investment firm led by crypto podcaster and analyst Andrew Steinwold, says it has raised $100 million for a new fund focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with contributions from Marc Andreessen, the Winklevoss twins, and Digital Currency Group (which funds an editorially independent CoinDesk).  Steinwold told CoinDesk that the fund, dubbed simply “Fund II,” will focus in on the “experiential infrastructure that involves the NFT space.”  It’s part of Sfermion’s mission to usher in the advent of the “metaverse” – a digital layer sitting on top of the real world, accessible via the internet, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This sort of thing has been around for years (remember Yelp’s Monocle?), but has yet to capture the mainstream imagination in a significant way.  And while some crypto investors have been consciously building toward this concept for years, particularly within the world of NFTs, metaverse fever is spreading far and wide.  Read more: Decentraland’s MANA Jumps 80% as Facebook Rebrand Fuels Metaverse Bets  Last week, Facebook changed its company name to Meta, signalling ambitions to dominate this new avenue of the internet; CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he hopes to see a billion people in the metaverse a decade from now.  To hear Steinwold tell it, parts of the metaverse are already here – and the rest is coming whether we like it or not.  “We don’t realize, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m spending literally all day on my computer, I’m spending all day on my phone,’” he said. “You almost don’t even notice it, it’s just natural. [The metaverse] is going to evolve in a similar way.”  Steinwold added that NFTs are key to metaverse infrastructure, since they can provide a form of digital ownership. “If you don’t have ownership, then really what you have is a communist-style dystopia,” he said.  Read more: This Casino in Decentraland Is Hiring (for Real)  Steinwold has expressed a fascination with what he sees as a “communist” internet on Twitter, too. “NFTs … give users property rights in the digital world,” he wrote in one post. “The internet just went from communism to capitalism (HUGE!)”  Steinwold, a 29-year-old Chicago native, also hosts a podcast called Zima Red; past guests have included Kayvon Tehranian, the CEO of the NFT marketplace Foundation, and Vignesh Sundaresan (a.k.a. MetaKovan), the investor who paid $69 million for an NFT at Christie’s earlier this year.  Matthew Roszak, founder of the tech company Bloq and a general partner in Sfermion’s Fund II, called Steinwold “one of the best NFT thought leaders and investors out there.”  Other metaverse believers on board with the fund include Andreessen Horowitz’s Chris Dixon, the hedge fund manager Alan Howard, Digital Currency Group (DCG), CMT Digital and Animoca Brands.

42421251,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXklSv,1635771600,November Is Crypto Literacy Month,"Crypto is on the rise. Crypto knowledge, however, is stuck on the runway: It turns out that 96% of U.S. adults can’t pass a test on crypto basics.  That’s according to the results of a survey that polled over 1,000 people in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide. Nine out of 10 people were not aware of bitcoin’s supply cap of 21 million, and less than half had an understanding of how the asset’s price is determined.  Perhaps more concerningly, the results suggest cryptocurrency isn’t doing much to break down the barriers of financial inclusion for certain groups: Crypto owners tend to steer young, educated, wealthy and male. In addition, basic crypto knowledge plummeted even further outside the U.S., with 99% of respondents in Brazil and Mexico getting a failing grade.  While overall awareness of crypto may be at an all-time high, clearly the industry has work to do to equip more investors with the knowledge and tools to take part in this new asset class. That’s the impetus behind Crypto Literacy Month, an initiative that aims to promote greater consumer education about crypto and bitcoin, the concepts behind them and the ways investors of all types can integrate digital assets into their financial planning.  CryptoLiteracy.org was created by Coinme, a cryptocurrency cash exchange that powers thousands of physical locations through partnerships with Coinstar and MoneyGram. (Disclosure: CoinDesk’s parent, Digital Currency Group, is an investor in Coinme.) Visitors to the site can take the same survey that created the initial results. CoinDesk is the official content partner of Crypto Literacy Month, and respondents will be given the opportunity to dive deeper into the basics and beyond with Crypto Explainer+, where CoinDesk breaks down the often complex world of cryptocurrency in easy-to-understand articles.  Every week in November, CryptoLiteracy.org will highlight a specific topic in crypto, starting with bitcoin. Subsequent weeks will dive into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and important security basics every crypto investor should know. Watch CoinDesk’s social channels on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and TikTok for tidbits from the theme weeks, and you can take the survey at CryptoLiteracy.org to test your own crypto knowledge.  When you’re on the outside looking in, the world of crypto often seems impenetrable. Knowledge is the key to getting in, and Crypto Literacy Month aims to spread that knowledge – one day at a time.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2021/11/01/november-is-crypto-literacy-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39dc67d63378bc670f7232049957d8f6c5edd1fe-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hacker either broke into the keyholder’s computer or might have been one of BXH’s technical staff, Wang said. The team is looking into the possibility the hacker set up a virus on BXH’s own site that the administrator clicked on, giving the attacker access to his computer and eventually the key, the CEO said.  BXH announced the hack in a tweet on Sunday. BXH user funds on Ethereum, Huobi ECO Chain and OKEx OEC are safe, the team said. BXH halted withdrawals until the issue is resolved.  The inside-job theory is supported by findings that indicate the attacker was in China, where most of BXH’s technical team is based, according to the CEO.  Wang attributed these findings to PeckShield, a blockchain security company that is working on the case with BXH. He said he is confident that with the support of PeckShield and Chinese authorities the hacker will be tracked down.  If the hacker is not found or returns the money, BXH will take full responsibility for the incident and figure out a user repayment plan, Wang said.  BXH is offering a $1 million bounty to any teams that help retrieve the funds, and will give the hacker an unspecified reward if the money is returned.  PeckShield confirmed the leaked admin key theory in a tweet early on Monday, without providing details.  BXH has also filed a case with China’s network security police, a special force that investigates digital crime, the CEO said.  The hack is one of several attacks on DeFi projects in the last couple months. Just days before the attack on BXH, Cream Finance suffered $130 million in losses. August saw the largest hack in DeFi history when cross-chain protocol Poly Network lost $600 million, which was eventually returned.

This would replace existing legislation that allowed portfolio managers to invest as much as 2.5% of funds in crypto as part of an umbrella “other assets” category.  The South African government defines a crypto asset as any digital representation of value “not issued by a central bank, but is capable of being traded, transferred or stored electronically by natural and legal persons for the purpose of payment, investment and other forms of utility; applies cryptographic techniques and uses distributed ledger technology.”  Such a broad definition points toward the ban extending to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and similar tradeable digital assets.

42424404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2o9fh,1635755746,Bitcoin Eyes Fed Meeting After Biggest Monthly Price Gain Since December 2020,"Bitcoin’s October rally appears to have put the cryptocurrency on a firm footing ahead of central bank meetings in the U.S., U.K., and Australia to assess the stickiness of inflation and determine policy response.  The top cryptocurrency rallied nearly 40% in October, hitting a fresh record high of $66,975 as investors cheered positive seasonality and the launch of futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S. That was the biggest single-month percentage rally since December 2020, according to CoinDesk data.  While key indicators favor a positive follow-through in the coming months, it may not be a smooth ride if the impending scaling back of stimulus, also known as the taper, by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks rocks equity markets.  “Bitcoin bullish sentiment remains at fever-pitch, highlighted by NFT. NYC [the annual non-fungible token event] whipping the financial capital into a frenzy,” Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. “[However], if public markets falter on the back of Fed bond purchase tapering, BTC could be dragged into a small correction after breaching all-time highs last week.”  Wednesday’s Fed meeting is widely expected to conclude with policymakers announcing plans to begin tapering the monthly $120 billion in asset purchases that have triggered unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of financial markets over the past 18 months.  Analysts told CoinDesk last month the Fed taper is priced in. So, the market reaction will depend on the Fed’s language on inflation and the timing of the first interest rate hike.  Several policymakers have recently said that inflation is proving to be more sticky than previously expected. Meanwhile, bond traders and interest rates futures have ramped up bets on early rate hikes.  On Friday, analysts at Goldman Sachs brought forward their forecast for the first rate hike to July from Q3 2023, according to Bloomberg. The investment banking giant expects the second rate hike in November 2022, followed by two hikes in 2023 and 2024.  Fed funds futures are now pricing hikes beginning early in the second half of 2022. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield, which is more sensitive to short-term interest rate/inflation expectations than the 10-year yield, nearly doubled to 50 basis points in October.  While equities and bitcoin have remained resilient, things may change if the Fed statement carries fewer references to inflation being “transitory.” That would perhaps imply policymakers’ growing discomfort with high inflation and validate fears of faster rate hikes, in turn, bringing selling pressure to equities and bitcoin.  ByteTree Asset Management’s Charlie Morris told Bloomberg that bitcoin is a “risk-on inflation hedge.” The cryptocurrency’s gold-like store of value appeal mainly attracts buyers when global financial markets see strong demand for growth-sensitive assets. However, bitcoin mostly takes a beating when global markets wilt.  Aside from the Fed meeting, investors will keep an eye on Tuesday’s Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) meeting and Thursday’s Bank of England’s rate decision and Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Money markets expect the BOE to hike interest rates this week.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/01/bitcoin-eyes-fed-meeting-after-biggest-monthly-price-gain-since-december-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/615c85bce3e7b1c2cea9710818b844a8578f50c5-2476x1250.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This isn&apos;t news to anyone, but sometimes it is nice to realize that—contrary to news headlines—not all the change is bad. In fact, the last decade has seen so much innovation and so many improvements to technology that even 2015 seems like a different world. Internet speeds, connecting with anyone globally (for free), and our ability to reach large groups of people without a middleman is nothing short of revolutionary. When it comes to technology evolution, this often happens with different iterations. Once a system is mature, there&apos;s a better idea of what we would like to change and improve. We go back to the drawing board, target our creative minds at the issues, and create a new version that has evolved to better meet our needs. The Internet has followed this model since its inception, evolving through three distinct stages. We are only at the cusp of the third stage, called Web 3.0, with technologies such as blockchain and AI only now being capable of supporting it. A key aspect of Web 3.0 is decentralization, which nearly always involves blockchain. To date, this has been the only way to scale a massive network efficiently and safely. But there aren&apos;t an abundance of social media companies who have a blockchain-based platform. While the big players like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have been experimenting with blockchain, it might be impossible to swap out the massive infrastructure running these...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/how-social-platform-chingari-is-using-web-3-0-to-transform-the-traditional-way-we-use-social-media/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
