Bitcoin futures open interest, which measures the buzz around upcoming contracts, has dropped to a 5-month low of $11.3 billion, according to data from Glassnode. This suggests traders are closing out positions and reducing exposure to volatile crypto assets. Bitcoin’s Struggles Below $26K: Is The Crypto Craze Losing Steam? The disinterest comes as bitcoin prices dropped below $26,000 for the first time since August, dampening spirits across the crypto sphere. “It seems the market is running out of steam,” said Lee Reiners, professor of cryptocurrency law at Duke University. “Investors are realizing these assets don’t just go up forever.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst’s September Warning: Bitcoin Faces A Red Month Analysts said that the drop in open interest appears related to the expiration of monthly and quarterly futures contracts, which drained trading activity and liquidity. But the decline also signals fading confidence in Bitcoin’s upside potential amid mounting regulatory scrutiny, environmental backlash, and competition from alternative cryptos like ether. “The promise of quick riches that lured many retail investors now seems a distant dream,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO at JP Morgan. “The crypto craze appears to be losing momentum fast.” Two days ago JPMorgan said: ”the bottom of this #Bitcoin crash is nearing” Honestly, this only makes me bearish… pic.twitter.com/mIAjjatrDG — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) August 27, 2023 Bitcoin has struggled to regain traction since its record high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021. Though some crypto bulls remain hopeful, continued lackluster performance could stall wider adoption. Exploring The Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Declining Fortunes One significant factor is the regulatory scrutiny that has intensified worldwide. Governments and financial authorities are increasingly concerned about the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including money laundering and tax evasion. This regulatory uncertainty has made some investors wary and hesitant to enter or remain in the market. Bitcoin has faced backlash due to its environmental impact. Critics argue that the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin is unsustainable and contributes to carbon emissions. As environmental concerns take center stage, some investors and institutions may reevaluate their support for Bitcoin in favor of more environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin pioneered, newer cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have gained traction, offering innovative features such as smart contracts and decentralized applications. These alternatives have attracted both developers and investors, diverting attention away from Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Future: Crossroads For The Original Crypto For diehard believers, bitcoin’s funk may present a buying opportunity if prices continue drifting lower. But others argue that “digital gold” has lost its luster for good.

Trackers show that the token is down 72% from 2023 peaks when it soared to $0.062 in late January 2023. From there, the token has been edging lower, sinking to $0.017 at spot rates, unwinding over 95% of gains posted in early 2023. To illustrate, GALA is cents away from retesting all-time lows registered in late 2022 at around $0.016. GALA Plunging The drawdown could be pinned to the unfavorable market-wide bear market conditions that have seen top coins, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, surge before dumping, dragging altcoins even lower. The slowdown across Bitcoin has been mirrored in GALA as the token edges lower, reversing gains posted on August 29. On this day, Bitcoin rose after a US Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Grayscale, the issuer of GBTC. Even though the court didn’t direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert GBTC trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the judge didn’t provide clear reasons why they denied Grayscale’s request. BTC prices rallied as odds of the US approving a spot Bitcoin ETF rose, lifting altcoins, including GALA. However, bears have successfully peeled back losses, as the daily chart shows. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst’s September Warning: Bitcoin Faces A Red Month CEO Versus Co-Founder Beyond market factors, GALA may plunge to all-time lows primarily because of internal wrangles that could heap more pressure on the token that’s already struggling against unrelenting bears. Court documents show that CEO Eric Schiermeyer and co-founder Wright Thurston filed lawsuits against each other. Filings show that Schiermeyer blames the co-founder for illegally obtaining and selling $130 million of GALA. The CEO also claims the co-founder stole node licenses for operating nodes within the Gala game ecosystem. He also cites Thurston’s history of founding companies that often in bankruptcy. The CEO wants the co-founder replaced as director.

They also alleged that the CEO created entities in Switzerland and Dubai that, in reality, should belong to Gala Games. The co-founder wants to kick out the CEO, who has held the office since 2021.
