21235207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564745,1702162810,Why Is XRP Price Up Today? Ripple’s Massive Buyback May Have The Answer,"XRP is one of the top gainers in the last 24 hours. As to why the crypto token is up, a popular crypto sleuth has some answers, as he recently revealed a significant move made by Ripple. This revelation also has the possibility of ending talks that XRP’s price is being manipulated by Ripple, considering that the crypto firm has so far shown that it has XRP’s best interest at heart. Ripple Allegedly Buys Back Around 700 Million XRP In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto sleuth Mr. Huber mentioned that Ripple bought back around 700 million XRP from the open market. According to him, Ripple usually does this to keep the XRP markets stable and liquid. This endeavor could explain why the token’s price has suddenly picked up. Related Reading: Dogecoin Above $0.1? Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why DOGE Price Will Continue To Rally The XRP price has underperformed in recent times, with many speculating why this could be happening. Some simply stated that the price was manipulated as there was no other logical reason to explain the underperformance, especially considering that other altcoins were enjoying significant gains. However, Mr. Huber had another plausible explanation for this decline as he stated that it could be one of Ripple’s ODL customers selling their XRP tokens on the open market. It had previously been reported that Ripple’s XRP sales to these ODL customers do not impact prices on exchanges. However, it does when these customers, in turn, start to sell these XRP tokens to retail investors. Therefore, noticing the trend of the XRP sales from ODL customers, Ripple could have bought back these XRP tokens in order to stabilize the XRP price. It is worth mentioning that Mr. Huber seems to have reached his conclusion of a massive buyback due to the decline in XRP’s circulating supply. He asserted that Ripple’s holdings are not calculated in the circulating supply. XRP recovers above $0.68 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP Price Underperformance Is Concerning Before his revelation about Ripple’s massive buyback, Mr. Huber had raised concern about XRP’s worrisome price action. He noted that the XRP price had “lost literally” all the gains it made against the broader crypto market following Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling. The Judge had ruled that the crypto token wasn’t a security in itself. Related Reading: XRP Price To Go Parabolic? Crypto Analyst Confirms 1000% Golden Cross Has Returned Many had predicted that this legal clarity was going to help boost XRP’s price, and it actually did in the weeks after the ruling. However, the XRP price has been on a notable decline since posting those gains. It has even become concerning ever since the broader crypto market picked up as many continue to wonder could be the reason for XRP’s rather relatively tepid movement. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.69, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

21231439,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561385,1702152051,What Is A DAO,"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a revolutionary concept in the blockchain and crypto world, reshaping how we think about governance and collaborative decision-making. This article dives deep into the world of DAOs, providing a comprehensive understanding of ‘What is a DAO’, their meaning, mechanics, and significance in the crypto ecosystem. You’ll also explore the intriguing history of DAOs, including insights into Nick Szabo‘s pioneering role in their invention. What Is A DAO? A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an innovative organizational structure that operates on blockchain technology, embodying principles of decentralization, autonomy, and consensus-driven governance. At its core, a DAO is an entity without central leadership, governed by a set of rules encoded in smart contracts. These contracts, running on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, automate decision-making and enforce the rules of the organization. Key to understanding ‘what is a DAO‘ is grasping its reliance on blockchain technology. DAOs utilize smart contracts to create a transparent and incorruptible framework for organizational operation. These contracts are programmed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met, ensuring that operations are not only transparent but also free from human error or manipulation. DAOs fundamentally alter traditional governance structures by enabling token holders to vote on proposals directly, thereby democratizing decision-making processes. This contrasts sharply with traditional organizations where decisions are often made by a select few at the top. Every token holder can have a say proportional to their stake, aligning the interests of the organization with those of its members. The concept of DAOs gained significant attention following the launch of projects like MakerDAO and The DAO. MakerDAO, for instance, is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies. The DAO, one of the earliest examples, was a venture capital fund without a traditional management structure, though it faced challenges that highlighted the need for rigorous security protocols in DAOs. In Short: DAO Meaning And DAO Definition DAO Meaning: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a novel form of organization governed by digital rules and operated on a blockchain. The term captures the essence of a system where organizational decisions and protocols are encoded in smart contracts, ensuring operations without centralized authority. DAOs epitomize a shift towards decentralized decision-making, leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate transparent, autonomous, and democratic governance processes. DAO Definition: DAOs are defined as entities where governance and decision-making are conducted by a collective of stakeholders rather than centralized leadership. These stakeholders typically hold tokens or digital assets that grant them voting rights within the organization. The defining characteristic of a DAO is its reliance on smart contracts to automate administrative functions and enforce the rules set forth by its members. This automation not only minimizes the need for intermediaries but also ensures that the organization’s operations are immutable, transparent, and aligned with the interests of its token holders. DAOs, therefore, redefine organizational management by embedding trust, integrity, and collective intelligence at their core. The Mechanics Of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations The mechanics of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a paradigm shift in how we conceive and execute organizational structure and governance. Rooted in blockchain technology, DAOs offer a framework for orchestrating collective action and decision-making in a decentralized, transparent, and automated manner. This approach challenges traditional hierarchical models, providing a blueprint for a more democratic and equitable form of organizational governance. How DAOs Work DAOs operate on a blend of technological innovation and organizational principles. The foundation of a DAO is its smart contract, which resides on a blockchain platform, most commonly Ethereum. These contracts are self-executing and contain the rules of the organization. Once deployed, only the consensus of the organization’s members can alter these contracts, guaranteeing immutability and transparency. The process initiates with setting up a DAO by deploying smart contracts that define the organization’s rules. This includes the decision-making process, fund management, and member participation guidelines. Typically, participation in a DAO is token-based, with members holding tokens that denote their voting rights. The more tokens a member holds, the greater their influence in decision-making processes. Voting in a DAO is a critical aspect. Members propose changes or actions, and these proposals are put to a vote. The smart contract automatically executes the decision based on the outcome of the vote, ensuring that the process is transparent and tamper-proof. This structure allows for a decentralized governance model, where no single entity has control over the organization, and decisions are made collectively by its members. The Unique Characteristics Of DAO Crypto DAO crypto refers to the use of cryptocurrency within DAOs for governance and transactional purposes. This aspect of DAOs presents several unique characteristics: Token-Based Governance: In DAOs, governance is primarily exercised through tokens. These tokens are not just a currency but a means of participating in the decision-making process. They can represent voting power, membership rights, or even a share in the DAO’s profits. Decentralization: DAOs function on a decentralized model, diverging from traditional organizations. Without CEOs or boards, the community collectively makes decisions. Blockchain technology facilitates this decentralization, preventing any single point of failure or control from compromising the organization. Transparency and Immutability: DAOs record all transactions and decisions on the blockchain, ensuring unmatched transparency. The immutable nature of these records means that once a decision is made and logged, it cannot be changed, fostering a trustless environment for member interaction. Automation And Efficiency: The use of smart contracts in DAOs automates various processes, from governance to financial transactions. This automation reduces the need for intermediaries, cuts down on bureaucratic overhead, and increases efficiency. Global Participation: DAOs operate on the internet, enabling anyone, regardless of location, to participate. This global reach expands the potential for innovation and collaboration, transcending geographical and political boundaries. The combination of these characteristics makes DAO crypto a powerful tool for creating and managing decentralized, transparent, and efficient organizations, poised to revolutionize how we think about and participate in collective decision-making and governance. The Evolution Of DAOs The concept and evolution of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) mark a significant milestone in the realm of digital governance and blockchain technology. The beginning can be traced back into the 1990s, even before Bitcoin and blockchain existed. History: Nick Szabo Invented DAOs The historical roots of DAOs can be traced back to the visionary ideas of Nick Szabo, a pioneering cryptographer and computer scientist. Szabo, who coined the term ‘smart contracts’ in the 1990s, laid the foundational concepts that would eventually lead to the creation of DAOs. Szabo is credited with pioneering smart contracts in a 1996 paper. Remarkably, his ideas also influenced Bitcoin’s development. In 1998, Szabo created BitGold, considered by some as a precursor to Bitcoin. His vision of automating contract and transaction protocols on a digital platform paved the way for the first DAOs. Although Szabo himself did not create a DAO, his work on smart contracts and digital currency greatly influenced their development. The principle of decentralized control and automation in DAOs is a direct extension of Szabo’s foresight in using blockchain technology for more than just creating digital currency. Most Famous Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Over the years, several DAOs have gained prominence, showcasing the potential and diversity of this organizational form. Some of the most notable DAOs include: The DAO The DAO, also known as Genesis DAO, stands as a landmark in the history of decentralized organizations. Launched in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain, it was envisioned as a decentralized venture capital fund, enabling investors to vote on which projects to fund. The DAO quickly garnered significant attention, raising over $150 million in Ether, making it one of the largest crowdfunding campaigns at the time. However, a vulnerability in its smart contract code led to a significant hack, resulting in the loss of a substantial portion of the funds. This event not only exposed the security risks associated with smart contracts but also influenced the subsequent hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, leading to the split between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The DAO’s story is a seminal chapter in DAO history, highlighting the importance of security and governance structures in decentralized organizations. UniswapDAO UniswapDAO governs Uniswap, one of the leading decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the crypto space. It represents the community-driven aspect of the Uniswap platform, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions and proposals concerning the platform’s development and governance. The creation marked a significant step towards decentralized governance in DeFi, empowering users to shape the platform’s future. Through a transparent and democratic process, UniswapDAO handles various aspects such as protocol upgrades, treasury management, and even community initiatives, illustrating the power of collective decision-making in decentralized finance. MakerDAO MakerDAO is a prominent DAO in the decentralized finance sector, primarily known for creating and managing DAI, one of the first decentralized stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a dual-token system consisting of DAI and MKR tokens. While DAI is used as a stable medium of exchange, MKR tokens represent governance rights within the system. Holders of MKR tokens can vote on critical decisions like risk management, collateral types, and fee adjustments, making MakerDAO a pioneer in decentralized governance and stablecoin implementation. Its innovative approach to collateral-backed stablecoin issuance and governance has set a standard in the DeFi industry. Stable DAO Stable DAO is a decentralized cross-chain reserve currency protocol, inspired by the model of OlympusDAO. It aims to provide a reliable and consistent income stream, functioning as a semi-passive source of profits without depending on active involvement. Stable DAO introduces features like a Universal Basic Income and referral rewards for early adopters. However, some experts raise concerns about its legitimacy. It’s essential to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before considering involvement with Stable DAO. DAO Governance And DAO Token The concepts of DAO governance and DAO tokens are central to the functionality and success of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. They collectively represent the democratic and decentralized ethos of DAOs, setting them apart from traditional organizational structures. DAO Governance At the heart of every DAO is a governance system that is both transparent and inclusive, ensuring that every member has a voice in the decision-making process. This system is typically enacted through a voting mechanism, where token holders submit and vote on proposals concerning the DAO’s operation, policy changes, and other crucial decisions. The voting power is generally proportional to the number of tokens a member holds, embedding a democratic structure into the DAO’s operations. This method of governance ensures that the direction of the DAO aligns with the interests of its community, as decisions are made collectively rather than by a centralized authority. The governance structure in a DAO is codified in its smart contracts, which lay out the rules for proposing and voting on decisions. These rules can vary widely among different DAOs, tailored to their specific needs and goals. Some DAOs may require a simple majority for a proposal to pass, while others might have more complex mechanisms involving various types of votes or quorums. This flexibility allows DAOs to adapt their governance models to suit their evolving requirements. DAO Token DAO tokens play a crucial role in governance. They are not just a medium of exchange but also represent voting rights and membership within the DAO. These tokens are often distributed during the DAO’s formation, either through a public sale, airdrop, or as rewards for contributions to the DAO. The distribution method impacts the decentralization of the DAO; for instance, a broad distribution of tokens can lead to a more decentralized governance structure. In addition to voting rights, DAO tokens can also have other utilities, such as profit-sharing rights, access to specific services within the DAO, or staking opportunities. The specific functions and rights associated with DAO tokens vary based on the DAO’s structure and objectives. The integration of DAO tokens into governance mechanisms is a critical innovation in the blockchain space. It provides a tangible way to align the incentives of the participants with the success of the DAO. This alignment ensures that members are motivated to act in the best interest of the DAO, fostering a collaborative and effective ecosystem. Practical Guides How To Create A DAO? Creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) involves a series of strategic, technical, and community-building steps, each crucial to the DAO’s success. Define The Purpose And Structure: Start by clearly defining the DAO’s purpose, goals, and governance structure. This includes deciding on the voting mechanisms, membership criteria, and the role of the DAO tokens. Develop The Smart Contracts: The core of a DAO is its smart contracts. These need to be meticulously coded, tested, and audited to ensure they execute as intended and are secure from vulnerabilities. These contracts should encapsulate the rules, voting mechanisms, and other operational aspects of the DAO. Deploy On A Blockchain Platform: Choose a suitable blockchain platform (Ethereum is a popular choice) and deploy the smart contracts. This step officially launches the DAO on the blockchain. Token Creation And Distribution: Create DAO tokens for governance and voting and distribute them through methods such as public sales, airdrops, or rewards for early contributors. Build A Community: A DAO is only as strong as its community. Engage with potential members, promote your DAO’s vision, and encourage participation and voting.

21229084,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564725,1702145442,Bitcoin Bull Signal Returns: Exchange Supply Hits Lowest Level Since 2017,"On-chain data has revealed an increasing sentiment of holding Bitcoin among investors. Bitcoin has been on a roll since the start of the month, pushing its price to new yearly highs. At the same time, exchange data from CryptoQuant reveals that the crypto might be gearing up for a sustained bull run. According to the on-chain analytics platform, Bitcoin’s exchange supply, the amount available for purchase on exchanges, has dropped to its lowest levels since 2017 Related Reading: The BONK Bomb: Solana Meme Coin Gets Extra 200% Boost To Its 7,000% Value Appreciation Exchange Supply Drops To Lowest Level In Six Years The Bitcoin market is flashing a bull signal that correlates with anticipation of spot Bitcoin ETF applications. CryptoQuant’s exchange reserve chart demonstrates that the supply of Bitcoin has been steadily decreasing from centralized exchanges since 2020 when it reached a high of over 3.2 million BTC. The outflow was particularly aggravated in the last quarter of 2022, when the collapse of crypto exchange FTX led to panic and investors started to opt for self-custody in cold wallets. During this period, exchange reserves dropped from 2.512 million BTC to 2.158 million BTC in a month. https://x.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1733005131216744749?s=20 Lowest Supply of #Bitcoin in Six Years “We are in the 45th month of diminishing supply. For the first time, supply returned to 2017 levels. ” by @1MrPapi Link 👇https://t.co/dY6QyFNit4 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 8, 2023 Reserve on exchanges started to increase slowly in the early months of 2023, climbing back up to 2.240 million in May. However, things started to change in June, as filings by BlackRock and other investment companies for spot Bitcoin ETF trading in the US led to the start of a bullish sentiment. Bitcoin slightly below the $44K level today. Chart: TradingView.com The reserve on centralized exchanges has been on a steady drop since then. At the time of writing, the exchange reserve has now crossed below 2 million BTC, a level it has yet to reach since December 2017. This metric’s six-year low is particularly interesting, considering Bitcoin’s total circulating supply has increased since 2017. Bitcoin’s total supply now stands at 19,564,812 BTC, a 16% increase from December 2017’s supply of 16.78 million BTC. Outlook For Bitcoin Price: Bull Signal? Although there are technically more bitcoins now available to go around, the increase in adoption is making it increasingly harder for traders to get a hold of the asset. Dropping exchange supply is a bullish signal for crypto assets and periods of low exchange supply have historically been associated with the beginning of significant Bitcoin bull runs. The last time Bitcoin had a drastic drop in exchange reserve was in 2020, and the crypto would later go on to reach its all-time high the year after.

Bitcoin is poised for extreme gains in 2024, and many analysts have predicted a price target above $100,000. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

This price increase adds to the token’s impressive form all week, culminating in an 11.85% gain in the last seven days. Interestingly, it appears there may be larger gains for XRP investors in the coming months as popular crypto analyst Ben Armstrong has placed the token as the most favorable asset for investment ahead of a potential 2024-2025 bull crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Fees Rise By Over 50%: Will BTC Conquer $69k? XRP Is The Token To Buy In 2024, Analyst Explains Why In a recent video on YouTube, Ben Armstrong has backed XRP to emerge as the leader of a potential crypto bull run over the next two years. Armstrong supports his claim with respect to many factors, including the team behind XRP, the token’s marketing, performance, utility, community, and technology, among others. When commenting on marketing, the renowned analyst explains that XRP is one of the most advertised assets to institutional investors. Furthermore, he claimed that the token’s publicity has largely increased following Ripple’s long-lasting squabble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which eventually resulted in a partial victory. On XRP’s performance, Ben Armstrong admits the altcoin left much to desire in the last bull run in 2020-2021. However, he attributes this negative performance to a suppression induced by the SEC case against Ripple. To back his XRP prediction, the crypto analyst notes that the altcoin gained by over 44,000% in the 2017 bull run and could repeat a similar feat, topping the next bull run in 2024-2025. In addition, Ben Armstrong also believes that XRP Is going to experience more adoption by traditional institutions in the world. Notably, he references the current application of the token in the creation of CBDCs by the central banks of some nations. Related Reading: SEC’s “Crypto Asset Securities” Alert Boosts Spot Bitcoin ETF Prospects – Here’s Why Armstrong Notes Worry Over XRP’s Tokenomics In his bold XRP prediction, Ben Armstrong has expressed some worry over the altcoin’s tokenomics as half of the coin’s supply is controlled by Ripple. Notably, this factor does not alter the analyst’s projection of the altcoin in 2024-2025. In fact, he believes the payment company to retain his control over XRP to be beneficial for investors. However, Armstrong predicts Ripple’s dominance in the XRP market might prove to be an unfavorable policy in the long run. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $0.687, with a 1.57% loss in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s trading volume is up by 51.78% in the last day and is currently valued at $2.4 billion.

21224853,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561798,1702134010,How To Mine Bitcoin And Crypto | Guide,"Mining Bitcoin is the cornerstone of the BTC network, providing both security and new Bitcoins into circulation. This essential process involves powerful computers solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions on the network. As a reward for this computational work, miners receive new bitcoins, making it a potentially lucrative endeavor. In this guide, we will explore the key aspects of “How to mine Bitcoin.” From understanding the basic mechanisms of how mining Bitcoin works to evaluating its economic feasibility, including the costs, potential earnings, and the time it takes to mine a single BTC. We’ll also guide you through the practical steps of setting up a mining operation, including choosing the right Bitcoin mining rig and the necessary software. Moreover, for those looking to expand their mining activities beyond Bitcoin, we’ll cover the essentials of mining cryptocurrencies. We’ll introduce various crypto mining software and tools, providing a comprehensive view of the wider crypto mining landscape. How To Mine Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin is the process through which new bitcoins are released and transactions are added to the blockchain. At its heart lies the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. Miners compete to complete these problems first, and the winner receives Bitcoin rewards. This process inherently involves the difficulty adjustment, which ensures that the rate of block creation remains constant, and the hash rate, which is a measure of the processing power of the Bitcoin network. These elements combine to form the backbone of Bitcoin mining, securing the network and enabling the decentralized control that Bitcoin is renowned for. Mining Bitcoin Explained Bitcoin mining is a complex and multifaceted process, crucial for both the creation of new Bitcoins and the maintenance of the network’s integrity and security. Here’s an in-depth look at its key aspects: Proof Of Work Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a critical blockchain consensus mechanism that dates back to 1993 when Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor first conceptualized it to deter email spam and DoS attacks. Adam Back’s Hashcash in 1997 advanced this concept by incorporating computational difficulty to combat email spam. These early forms of PoW laid the groundwork for Bitcoin’s implementation by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, which effectively solved the double-spending problem in digital currencies without the need for a centralized authority. Bitcoin’s PoW operates like a computational lottery, with miners vying to solve cryptographic puzzles using the SHA-256 hash function. The more computational power a miner contributes, the higher their chances of solving the puzzle and receiving the block reward in Bitcoin. This mining process is fundamental to Bitcoin’s decentralized security and transaction validation. The difficulty of mining adjusts approximately every two weeks or every 2,016 blocks, maintaining an average block time of around 10 minutes. This adjustment is crucial for the network’s stability, ensuring a steady rate of new block creation and coin issuance despite changes in network hash rate. The Bitcoin block reward, initially 50 BTC per block, halves every 210,000 blocks, a mechanism known as Bitcoin halving. This built-in deflationary aspect of Bitcoin is designed to gradually reduce the issuance of new coins. PoW’s significance lies in its ability to secure the Bitcoin network through decentralization. By incentivizing miners across the globe to contribute computational power, it replaces the traditional role of central authorities in validating transactions. Hash Rate The hash rate, a critical metric in mining Bitcoin, refers to the total processing power utilized by miners on the network. It indicates how many calculations per second the network can perform, where a higher hash rate reflects greater security and mining difficulty. The hash rate directly influences the competitiveness among miners and the overall efficiency of the mining process. As Bitcoin’s price increases, more miners are encouraged to join the network, pushing the hash rate higher and making the mining process more competitive and energy-intensive​​. Difficulty Adjustment Bitcoin’s protocol includes a dynamic mechanism called difficulty adjustment, ensuring that new blocks are discovered approximately every 10 minutes. This adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, based on the total hashing power of the network. If blocks are mined too quickly, the difficulty increases, making it harder to find new blocks. Conversely, if the block interval is slower than expected, the difficulty decreases. This self-regulating system maintains a stable block discovery rate, balancing the network against fluctuations in miner numbers and equipment efficiency​​. Bitcoin Mining Economics Explained Bitcoin mining economics encompass various factors such as computational power, energy costs, and market dynamics. Understanding these factors is crucial for any miner or investor who wants to know “how to mine Bitcoin.” How Do You Mine Bitcoin? Mining Bitcoin involves two major steps: building a block and proving the block. The former includes selecting and processing transactions for inclusion in the new block, while the latter involves solving a cryptographic hashing puzzle. This puzzle, part of the Proof-of-Work consensus, requires miners to generate a hash below the network’s target hash using high-powered computer hardware, typically ASIC miners. Once a miner successfully solves the puzzle, they broadcast the new block to the network, which is then verified by other miners​​. Can You Still Mine Bitcoin? Yes, individuals can still mine Bitcoin. However, it has evolved into a highly competitive and resource-intensive endeavor, with public listed companies taking the lead. Among the top mining companies are Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Canaan (CAN), Hut 8 (HUT), Cipher (CIFR), Core Scientific (CORZ), Bitfarms (BITF), Iris Energy (IREN), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Bitdeer Technologies. The block reward, which includes both the block subsidy and the transaction fees, is the core incentive for miners. Currently, the block reward is higher than the transaction fees, but this will eventually change with one of the next Bitcoin halvings, but also depends on the evolution of the Bitcoin price. How Long Does It Take To Mine A Bitcoin? The time it takes to mine a Bitcoin is not fixed and depends on several factors, including the miner’s hash rate, the total network hash rate, and the current mining difficulty. The protocol is designed to adjust the difficulty to maintain an average block time of about 10 minutes. However, for an individual miner, especially one with limited resources like one mining rig, mining a single Bitcoin can take years. This often leads solo miners to join mining pools to increase the chances of earning rewards more frequently​. Growing Trend In Mining Bitcoin: Renewables Research by environmentalist Daniel Batten suggests that mining Bitcoin can become carbon negative by utilizing waste methane as an energy source. Around 30% of the global temperature rise is attributed to methane, which has 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide. Notably, 11% of global methane emissions come from landfills. Bitcoin mining can convert this waste methane into carbon dioxide, significantly reducing its environmental impact. Batten himself aims to generate 32 megawatts of power from landfills, offsetting about 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which equates to 10% of Bitcoin’s carbon footprint. In their latest research, the Bitcoin Mining Council’s (BMC) highlighted significant strides in sustainability and efficiency within the Bitcoin mining industry. The BMC, representing 45.4% of the global Bitcoin Mining Network, reported that its members are utilizing electricity with a 67.8% sustainable power mix. This figure reflects an estimated global average of 59.4% for the industry, marking an approximately 3% year-on-year increase from 2021. This progress positions the Bitcoin mining industry as one of the most sustainable globally. How To Start Mining Bitcoins: A Step-by-Step Guide Embarking on the journey of mining Bitcoin requires a strategic approach, starting with the selection of the right equipment. Selecting the Right Bitcoin Mining Rig Choosing the appropriate Bitcoin mining rig is critical for efficiency and profitability. The ideal rig should balance power, energy consumption, and cost. ASIC miners are the standard in mining Bitcoin due to their superior hash rates and energy efficiency compared to GPUs or CPUs. When selecting an ASIC miner, consider factors like hash rate, energy consumption (measured in watts), cost, and the miner’s longevity. Higher hash rates increase the chances of successfully mining a block, but they also come with higher energy demands and costs. Balancing these factors based on your budget and the current Bitcoin mining landscape is key to a successful mining operation.

The Economics Of Mining Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies The economics of mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a critical area for anyone considering entering this field. It involves understanding the costs associated with mining and the potential returns. This section will cover the fundamentals of calculating these costs and returns, providing insights into the financial aspects of cryptocurrency mining. Calculating the Costs and Returns of Mining To understand the economics of mining, one must first be able to calculate both the costs involved and the potential returns. Here are the key factors to consider: Hardware Costs: The initial investment in mining hardware, such as ASIC miners for Bitcoin or high-end GPUs for crypto mining, is usually the most significant expense. The choice of hardware impacts both the efficiency and the potential earnings from mining. Electricity Costs: Mining consumes a substantial amount of electricity. The cost of power can vary widely depending on geographic location and can significantly impact overall profitability. Maintenance And Overhead: This includes costs related to cooling systems, internet connectivity, hardware maintenance, and any other operational expenses.

21222193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564711,1702126834,Cardano Rises $56% To Dominate Weekend’s Top 10 Roster – Details,"Altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) had a widespread increase in value, similar to the altcoin cycle observed in early November. This cycle occurred when the momentum of Bitcoin slowed down, prompting traders to secure profits and allocate their investments towards smaller cryptocurrencies. Because of the consistent price of Bitcoin (BTC), which encouraged capital rotation to alternative coins, native tokens associated with layer 1 (L1) blockchains saw the greatest gains on Saturday. Cardano (ADA) was the top performer in the weekend’s top 10 rankings. According to Coingecko data, ADA price increased by 27% to 64 cents in the last day, for a strong 56.3% growth over the previous seven days. It is the largest increase since August 2022. With the removal of the three major obstacles—the $0.40, $0.45, and $0.50—investors may begin to experience FOMO, or “fear of missing out,” as they discover ADA to be a compelling investment. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Soars To Over $2,300 – Is $3,000 Next? Cardano Bullish Momentum Sparks Optimism No doubt, Cardano has emerged as one of the most appealing assets available on the cryptocurrency scene, attracting interest as traders fervently hope that the current bullish trend holds or if they are in for a startling letdown. The money flow index’s (MFI) steady rise indicates that Cardano is firmly in the hands of bulls. For traders, there are currently several prospects for scalping, but in order to maintain investor optimism for a recovery to $1.00, ADA price needs to confirm higher support above $0.64. Cardano currently trading at $0.622836 level today. Chart: TradingView.com An indicator that keeps track of money coming into and going out of Cardano is the MFI. Prices usually increase when the inflow volume far exceeds the outflow volume. This could account for the breakout from $0.65, and ADA might try to close the difference to $1 before the end of December if the trend holds steady. The ADA price has been recognized for its gradual but consistent increase, which has kept the token from seeing a strong surge despite the favorable market sentiment. Cardano Daily Active Addresses Climb The forthcoming trade’s outline, however, seems to have altered as traders have been more engaged on the network, which might perhaps support a healthy upsurge. The on-chain statistics shows that the daily active address has increased significantly and reached quarterly highs. Source: IntoTheBlock Based on data from IntoTheBlock, around 80% of Cardano wallet addresses are sitting on unrealized profits at the current $0.56 price level. If the wallet addresses stated above realize their gains, the asset’s price could correct since more people would be inclined to sell. 📈 The notable #crypto market leaders over the past 24 hours are #Cardano (+19%), #Solana (+11%), and #Optimism (+11%). Each is seeing one of their highest social dominance days of 2023. With this implied #FOMO kicking in, proceeding with caution is wise. https://t.co/QvxDrofqJt pic.twitter.com/aUqIDoCLho — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 8, 2023 Meanwhile, ADA and a few other popular cryptocurrencies have exploded in social dominance, albeit Bitcoin’s influence is also growing. Related Reading: This BRC-20 Token Just Breached $1 Billion Market Cap With 180% Rally Today – Details According to the Santiment data above, market participants are now more positive about altcoins, particularly Cardano. In tandem with a sharp increase in their costs, social media conversations reached a two-month high, suggesting the onset of FOMO. Therefore, the next few days might be seen as extremely important, since the fear of FOMO also carries a high risk of rejection once it reaches the critical points.

The 4th Bitcoin halving in April 2024 will occur without major drama, and Bitcoin will rise above $48,000 after a brief consolidation period. Bitcoin will reach an all-time high in Q4 2024, driven by high volatility and mounting evidence of rejection of the anti-growth agenda of the Green lobby. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Step into the realm of speculation with us as we embark on a whimsical journey into the future of crypto in 2024. In the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, where imagination is not just a luxury but a necessary locomotive for investors, predicting a path feels akin to navigating through a galaxy of possibilities. We understand the skepticism that often surrounds predictions—after all, foreseeing the twists and turns of the crypto cosmos can feel as elusive as catching stardust in your hands. Yet, here we are, ready to peer into the crystal ball with a twinkle in our eyes, saluting the challenge. Because in the world of cryptocurrencies, where coins and tokens are born from the void, imagination has always been the catalyst for innovation. So, fasten your seatbelts, stow away your doubts, and join us in this speculative expedition as we attempt these first tracks in 2024's crypto terrain…with a few potential money-making ideas along the way, we ho-ho-hope! Here are our 15 crypto predictions for 2024. 1. The long-awaited U.S. recession will finally arrive, but so will the first spot Bitcoin ETFs! The U.S. economy will finally succumb to recession in the first half of the year. Economic momentum has been slowing for months, and inflation has cooled along, creating an economy more vulnerable to shocks. U.S. leading indicators are now in recessionary territory after 19 months of consecutive declines, close to a record. Shares of retailers are struggling, commodities are weak, employment is softening, corporate bankruptcy filings are back to early COVID levels, and the yield curve is inverted but steepening in recent weeks- all are very late-cycle dynamics. ""Soft landing"" mentions in the media have spiked, as they often do before an official recession is called. Bitcoin has only experienced one official US recession, from January to April 2020, during which it fell 60% peak-to-trough before rallying sharply once the Fed provided sufficient liquidity. Gold also tends to decline in the early periods of a recession - it fell 12% in two weeks in March 2020. Still, its recent breakout confirms strong demand for hard money that is not cancellable by U.S. authorities, a characteristic shared with Bitcoin. As debt levels are more concerning at the sovereign than corporate or household levels, we expect more than $2.4B will flow into newly approved US spot Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 to keep the Bitcoin price elevated. Notwithstanding the possibility of significant volatility, the Bitcoin price is unlikely to fall below $30k in Q1 2024. We approximate the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs by examining the relative ratios of the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) ETF and adjusting it to 2023 dollars. The GLD ETF launched on November 18, 2004, and it saw inflows of around $1B in the first few days of launch, and by the end of Q1 2005, around $2.26B was in GLD. At that date, the total physical gold supply stood at around 152k metric tons, with each ton worth around $15.6M, which implies a total market value of $2.36T. The initial dollar inflows into GLD in those first few days post-launch were around 0.04% of the total gold market. Around one quarter later, on March 31, 2005, GLD reached inflows of $2.26B, and after accounting for supply growth and gold price changes, GLD had become 0.1% of the global gold supply. If we apply these figures to the Bitcoin spot market, we arrive at inflows of $310M in the first few days of BTC spot ETF and ~$750M within a quarter. However, that was the era of higher interest rates and a far lower money supply. In 2023, we are no longer in the “Dead Ball” era of finance but are careening through the HGH/Steroid era. As measured by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the supply of M2 in November 2004 was 6.4T dollars compared to $20.7T in October 2023. As such, we believe it is logical to apply that ratio, 3.23x, to possible inflows, bringing us to around $1B in the first few days of a spot Bitcoin ETF and $2.4B within a quarter. Extending our logic further, a more mature state of the BTC ETF may approximate around 1.7%, the approximate amount of gold’s total supply held in gold ETFs, of the total spot market for BTC. This initial sum stands at around $12.5B. As we assume that Bitcoin is taking significant market share from Gold among the hard money crowd and expect 2024 to be a peak year of voter understanding of debt-driven money printing, we apply our 3.23x multiple based on M2 outstanding, to arrive at a medium-term estimate of $40.4B inflows over the first two years of trading. Lastly, we note that Coinbase charges retail traders all-in transaction fees of ~2.5%. We believe spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely trade at ~10bps spreads, with zero commission at many brokerages. When was the last time a 10x cost reduction didn't catalyze MUCH higher penetration for new tech? 2. The 4th Bitcoin halving will occur with minimal drama. The four-year Bitcoin halving will proceed without a major fork or missed blocks in April 2024. As the new coin issuance gets cut in half, unprofitable miners will disconnect, ceding shares to those with low-cost power. Still, the public markets will see little distress thanks to much-improved balance sheets among listed miners, who currently control a record % global hash rate (~25%). After a brief (several days to several weeks) period of consolidation post-halving, as the market digests the additional selling pressure from unprofitable miners, Bitcoin will rise above $48k, the neckline of the head-and-shoulder pattern completed in April 2022. Bitcoin miners, in aggregate, will underperform the Bitcoin price before the halving, although the low-cost miners CLSK and RIOT will outperform the field. After the halving, we expect at least one publicly traded miner to be 10x by the end of the year. Days Since Bitcoin Cycle Peak Source: Bloomberg, VanEck research as of 11/30/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. 3. Bitcoin will make an all-time high in Q4. In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin will climb a Presidential-sized wall of worry. The percentage of the global population voting in legislative and presidential elections will hit an all-time high above 45% in 2024. This high level of important elections augurs high volatility and the prospect of significant changes. More specifically, we see mounting evidence that voters and courts are rejecting the anti-growth agenda of the Green lobby. Thus, after a combative election that saw Donald Trump win 290 electoral votes and regain the Presidency, raising optimism that the SEC's hostile regulatory approach will be dismantled, we think the Bitcoin price will reach an all-time high on November 9th, exactly 3 years to the day from its last all-time high. (Recall that Bitcoin’s breakout in November 2020 also came exactly three years to the day from its November 2017 top). If Bitcoin reaches $100k by December, we make a long-shot call that Satoshi Nakamoto will be named Time Magazine's ""Man of the Year."" Source: Bloomberg, VanEck research as of 11/30/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The information, valuation scenarios and price targets presented on Bitcoin in this blog are not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell Bitcoin, or as a projection of how Bitcoin will perform in the future. Actual future performance of Bitcoin is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance of Bitcoin. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. 4. Ethereum won’t flip Bitcoin in 2024 Ethereum will fail to flip Bitcoin in 2024, but it will outperform every mega-cap tech stock. Bitcoin’s more apparent regulatory status and energy intensity will attract interest from quasi-state entities in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. Argentina will join El Salvador, the UAE, Oman, and Bhutan as the fifth country to sponsor Bitcoin mining at the state level, as Argentina’s state-owned energy giant YPF may indicate interest in mining digital assets with stranded methane and gas. Like past cycles, Bitcoin will lead the market to rally, and the value will flow into smaller tokens just after the halving. ETH won’t begin outperforming Bitcoin until post-halving and may outperform for the year, but there will be no “flippening.” Despite a strong performance in 2024, ETH will lose market share to other smart contract platforms with less uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap, such as Solana.

ETH L2s will capture the majority of EVM-compatible TVL and volume post-EIP-4844 Ethereum will implement EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will reduce transaction fees and improve scalability for layer 2 chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others. Within 1 year of the upgrade, Ethereum L2s will consolidate down to 2-3 dominant players as measured by value and usage. One will achieve higher monthly DEX volume/TVL than Ethereum for the first time. Collectively, these chains may accumulate 2x the DEX volume of Ethereum (currently 0.8x) by Q4 of 2024 and 10x the number of transactions. Ethereum will implement EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will reduce transaction fees and improve scalability for layer 2 chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others. One of them will achieve higher monthly DEX volume/TVL (total valued locked) than Ethereum for the first time. This is because cheaper transaction fees enable tighter bid/ask spreads due to the high cost of DEX transactions on Ethereum. With stricter bid/ask spreads, there exists a greater number of arbitrage opportunities, which leads to more trading. Additionally, faster block times, only 0.25 seconds on chains like Arbitrum, enable more transaction throughput and more prospects for CEX/DEX and DEX/DEX arbitrage. As a result, DEXes and L2s should attract more volume due to the trading opportunities they enable. Collectively, these chains may accumulate 2x the DEX volume of Ethereum (currently 0.8x) by Q4 of 2024 and 10x the number of transactions. Within 1 year of the upgrade, Ethereum L2s will consolidate down to 2-3 dominant players as measured by value and usage. This is due to the fact that liquidity fragmentation will accelerate the dominance of the dominant L2s. This has already occurred in DEXes, where the exchanges Uniswap, Pancake Swap, and Curve accounted for 78% of DEX volumes in 2023. The same market consolidation on will occur across L2s, with Arbitrum and Optimism looking to be the main contenders. Ethereum Share of DEX Volume Source: Artemis.xyz as of 12/3/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. 6. NFT activity will rebound to an all-time high. Monthly NFT volumes will approach a new all-time high as speculators return to crypto and gravitate toward top NFT collections on Ethereum, improved crypto games, and new Bitcoin-based offerings. Despite ETH's nearly 50-1 ratio vs. Bitcoin in primary NFT sales since inception, Bitcoin's Ordinals protocol and emerging layer 2 chains on Bitcoin will drive a continued rebirth in Bitcoin network fees. The ratio of ETH-to-BTC primary NFT issuance will end in 2024 closer to 3-1. Stacks ('STX'), a smart contract platform secured by Bitcoin, will become a top-30 coin by market cap (currently #54). Bitcoin & ETH NFT Volume Source: Cryptoslam! as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. 7. Binance will lose the #1 position for spot trading. Binance will lose its throne as the #1 centralized exchange by volumes after the company's $4B settlement with US regulators. OKX, Bybit, Coinbase, and Bitget will emerge as well-funded competitors with the potential to grab the #1 spot. Crypto exchanges' pricing inclusion in regulated indices, such as those administered by VanEck subsidiary MarketVectors, will become a critical variable in determining whether certain centralized exchanges are eligible to provide liquidity for ETF-authorized participants and sponsors. With Binance now facing a 3-year DOJ colonoscopy, Coinbase's international futures market will gain share and surpass $1B/day volume, up from ~$200M/day in November 2023. 8. Stablecoin market cap will reach a new all-time high as USDC reverses share losses. The total value of stablecoins on the chain will reach an all-time high above $200B (currently $128B) as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulated stablecoins launch in Europe, yield-bearing stablecoins proliferate, and trading volumes continue to rebound. More controversially, USDC will flip USDT, as more institutional adoption will reveal a preference for USDC already evident on newer L2 chains. Tether’s market share losses may finally materialize after the U.S. U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) takes enforcement against Justin Sun & Tron for Know Your Customer (KYC) infractions, terror financing, and/or market manipulation.

DEX: CEX Spot Trade Volume Source: The Block, The Graph, Coingecko as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) market share of spot crypto trading will rise to an all-time high as high-throughput chains like Solana improve the on-chain trading experience for users. Meanwhile, much-improved wallets - incorporating ""account abstraction,"" a critical feature in enabling automated payments -- will push more users on-chain and into self-custody solutions. As BTC and ETH dominance likely declines after the Bitcoin halving, the long tail of assets may grow faster, skewing trading activity towards decentralized exchanges that list coins earlier in their lifecycle. 10. Remittances and smart contract platforms will power a new Bitcoin yield opportunity Remittances will emerge as a killer blockchain use case as easier off-ramping and spending of stablecoins make recipient payouts cheap and useful in emerging markets. Given the use of the Bitcoin and layer 2 Lightning ('LN') network in some remittance corridors, ""Bitcoin Staking"" will become a narrative in 2024. With transaction costs rising on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC maximalists will start spreading the news that you can stake on the BTC network and earn a yield. Staking to Lightning Nodes happens today but is risky and has low return as your BTC is used for payment settlements on the Lightning network. With the proliferation protocols that abstract the technical nuances of managing a Lightning node, such as Amboss, along with federated self-custody solutions like Fedi, users will be able to participate in the remittance market from cold wallets and earn some yield. In addition, Bitcoin holders will be given a new business opportunity in 2024 as a provider of security to Proof of Stake blockchains. Utilizing projects like Cosmos-based Babylon, which will enable BTC holders to earn yield by offering non-custodial staking of PoS chains, Bitcoin holders will be able to earn yield on their Bitcoin and potentially participate in an array of other productive use cases for their BTC. 11. A breakout blockchain game will finally arrive. Web3 Gaming Investment Source: DappRadar as of 10/12/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Blockchain gaming will see at least one title surpass 1 million+ daily active users, demonstrating the long-awaited potential. Among candidates to achieve this milestone, IMX is most likely to become a top 25 coin by market cap (currently #42) with the release of Illuvium, Guild of Guardians, and other high-budget games in 2024 and a well-designed token that aligns interests better than most. According to a recent report from DappRadar, the WAX blockchain currently leads the gaming sector with 406k daily unique active wallets, of which ~100k are playing Alien Worlds, a metaverse with multiple simple games that reward players with the Trillium token. However, many of these players are likely bots farming the tokens due to the simplicity of the games. On the other hand, Immutable has multiple AAA games building on their platform that implement token models that cannot be simply farmed and are truly fun games to play. These titles, which have been building for years and received $100m+ in funding, are being released in 2024. They could attract players at the scale of traditional AAA games like Starfield, which was released earlier this year and reached 10 million players within its first two weeks. Additionally, Immutable has been working to resolve many of the technical pain points that have inhibited the success of Web3 gaming so far, such as wallet management. Immutable’s “Passport” allows users to log in to games and manage their blockchain-based game items through a familiar single sign-on process while abstracting away blockchain interaction. The increased simplicity that Immutable provides gamers combined with large distribution partners such as the Epic Games Store and GameStop could finally allow a blockchain-based game to become a mainstream hit. 12. Solana will continue to outperform ETH as DeFi TVL returns. Solana Total Value Locked Source: DefiLlama as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Solana will become a top 3 blockchain by market cap, Total Value Locked (TVL), and active users. Fueled by this rise, Solana will join the spot ETF wars thanks to a flurry of asset managers submitting filings. Related to Solana's continued market share gains, we see a legitimate possibility that Solana-based price oracle Pyth flips Chainlink in Total Value Secured (“TVS”). For reference, Chainlink today stands at ~$15bn TVS vs. Pyth’s 13. DePin networks see meaningful adoption. Hivemapper Unique Km Mapped Source: Hivemapper, as of 12/1/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Multiple decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) networks will see meaningful adoption that captures the public's attention. Hivemapper, the decentralized mapping protocol aiming to bootstrap a community-owned competitor to Google Streetview, will map its 10 millionth unique KM, surpassing 15% of global roads capacity. Hivemapper uses its native token, $HONEY, to incentivize thousands of drivers worldwide to mount dashboards to their cars and contribute to its growing database. This global network of permissionless contributors may give Hivemapper a meaningful speed and cost-of-capital advantage relative to the incumbent Google. Google Maps is projected to make more than $11bn in revenue in 2023, representing a meaningful opportunity for Hivemapper if the experiment is successful. Helium, the decentralized network of wireless hotspots, will reach 100k paying subscribers for its nationwide US 5G plan, up from 5k currently. Hotspots can be set up by anyone, and hotspot operators are paid through crypto rails in Helium’s native tokens. This powerful system of incentives gives Helium some key advantages relative to incumbent wireless infrastructure: It is capital-light (from Helium’s perspective). It turns hotspot providers into advocates & supporters (given their ongoing stake in the network). It gives Helium the ability to respond to real-time data & improve the network by adjusting its incentives (i.e., boosting rewards in areas with poor coverage). Wireless infrastructure is a $200B, relatively mature market. We see significant scope for disintermediating legacy providers (Towers) as end-users tend towards low-cost solutions with a differentiated brand (“user-owned”). Helium claims they can deliver data at less than 50% of the cost of legacy networks. As crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, and if that claim is true, they will likely join a significant share. 14. New accounting treatment will rejuvenate the case for corporate crypto holdings. Base Weekly Fees Source: DefiLlama as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Coinbase will become the first publicly traded company to break out and report Layer 2 blockchain revenues in its quarterly filings as its Base Protocol crosses $100M+ in annualized revenues and becomes a meaningful contributor to the business. The additional disclosure may be catalyzed by corporate adoption of new FASB guidelines that allow corporates to book mark-to-market gains on crypto, which will favorably impact corporate preference for holding Bitcoin and other crypto as treasury assets. Due to these accounting changes, which take effect in 2025 but can be adopted by corporates earlier, a major, non-crypto financial entity (bank, exchange) may announce the creation of a quasi-public blockchain like an L2, with the possible bridging capability to public blockchains by authorized participants. 15. DeFi Reconciles with Know Your Customer (KYC) KYC-enabled and walled garden apps like those using Ethereum Attestation Service or Uniswap Hooks will gain significant traction, approaching or even flipping non-KYC applications in user base and fees. Uniswap will lead other protocols in enabling this functionality, which will drive institutional liquidity and volume to the protocol. The additional volume from KYC-gated hooks will significantly bolster protocol fees by allowing new entrants to participate in DeFi without the fear of interacting with OFAC-sanctioned entities. The addition of hooks will help Uniswap reinforce its moat and competitiveness, which should drive token appreciation, especially once the DAO finally votes in favor of turning on the Uniswap Protocol fee switch to allow value to accrue to the token. If so, we expect such fees to be no higher than 10bps. Decentralized Exchange Market Share Source: DefiLlama as of 11/28/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

The 4th Bitcoin halving in April 2024 will occur without major drama, and Bitcoin will rise above $48,000 after a brief consolidation period. Bitcoin will reach an all-time high in Q4 2024, driven by high volatility and mounting evidence of rejection of the anti-growth agenda of the Green lobby. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Step into the realm of speculation with us as we embark on a whimsical journey into the future of crypto in 2024. In the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, where imagination is not just a luxury but a necessary locomotive for investors, predicting a path feels akin to navigating through a galaxy of possibilities. We understand the skepticism that often surrounds predictions - after all, foreseeing the twists and turns of the crypto cosmos can feel as elusive as catching stardust in your hands. Yet, here we are, ready to peer into the crystal ball with a twinkle in our eyes, saluting the challenge. Because in the world of cryptocurrencies, where coins and tokens are born from the void, imagination has always been the catalyst for innovation. So, fasten your seatbelts, stow away your doubts, and join us in this speculative expedition as we attempt these first tracks in 2024's crypto terrain…with a few potential money-making ideas along the way, we ho-ho-hope! Here are our 15 crypto predictions for 2024. 1. The long-awaited U.S. recession will finally arrive, but so will the first spot Bitcoin ETFs! The U.S. economy will finally succumb to recession in the first half of the year. Economic momentum has been slowing for months, and inflation has cooled along, creating an economy more vulnerable to shocks. U.S. leading indicators are now in recessionary territory after 19 months of consecutive declines, close to a record. Shares of retailers are struggling, commodities are weak, employment is softening, corporate bankruptcy filings are back to early COVID levels, and the yield curve is inverted but steepening in recent weeks- all are very late-cycle dynamics. ""Soft landing"" mentions in the media have spiked, as they often do before an official recession is called. Bitcoin has only experienced one official US recession, from January to April 2020, during which it fell 60% peak-to-trough before rallying sharply once the Fed provided sufficient liquidity. Gold also tends to decline in the early periods of a recession - it fell 12% in two weeks in March 2020. Still, its recent breakout confirms strong demand for hard money that is not cancellable by U.S. authorities, a characteristic shared with Bitcoin. As debt levels are more concerning at the sovereign than corporate or household levels, we expect more than $2.4B will flow into newly approved US spot Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 to keep the Bitcoin price elevated. Notwithstanding the possibility of significant volatility, the Bitcoin price is unlikely to fall below $30k in Q1 2024. We approximate the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs by examining the relative ratios of the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) ETF and adjusting it to 2023 dollars. The GLD ETF launched on November 18, 2004, and it saw inflows of around $1B in the first few days of launch, and by the end of Q1 2005, around $2.26B was in GLD. At that date, the total physical gold supply stood at around 152k metric tons, with each ton worth around $15.6M, which implies a total market value of $2.36T. The initial dollar inflows into GLD in those first few days post-launch were around 0.04% of the total gold market. Around one quarter later, on March 31, 2005, GLD reached inflows of $2.26B, and after accounting for supply growth and gold price changes, GLD had become 0.1% of the global gold supply. If we apply these figures to the Bitcoin spot market, we arrive at inflows of $310M in the first few days of BTC spot ETF and ~$750M within a quarter. However, that was the era of higher interest rates and a far lower money supply. In 2023, we are no longer in the “Dead Ball” era of finance but are careening through the HGH/Steroid era. As measured by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the supply of M2 in November 2004 was 6.4T dollars compared to $20.7T in October 2023. As such, we believe it is logical to apply that ratio, 3.23x, to possible inflows, bringing us to around $1B in the first few days of a spot Bitcoin ETF and $2.4B within a quarter. Extending our logic further, a more mature state of the BTC ETF may approximate around 1.7%, the approximate amount of gold’s total supply held in gold ETFs, of the total spot market for BTC. This initial sum stands at around $12.5B. As we assume that Bitcoin is taking significant market share from Gold among the hard money crowd and expect 2024 to be a peak year of voter understanding of debt-driven money printing, we apply our 3.23x multiple based on M2 outstanding, to arrive at a medium-term estimate of $40.4B inflows over the first two years of trading. Lastly, we note that Coinbase charges retail traders all-in transaction fees of ~2.5%. We believe spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely trade at ~10bps spreads, with zero commission at many brokerages. When was the last time a 10x cost reduction didn't catalyze MUCH higher penetration for new tech? 2. The 4th Bitcoin halving will occur with minimal drama. The four-year Bitcoin halving will proceed without a major fork or missed blocks in April 2024. As the new coin issuance gets cut in half, unprofitable miners will disconnect, ceding shares to those with low-cost power. Still, the public markets will see little distress thanks to much-improved balance sheets among listed miners, who currently control a record % global hash rate (~25%). After a brief (several days to several weeks) period of consolidation post-halving, as the market digests the additional selling pressure from unprofitable miners, Bitcoin will rise above $48k, the neckline of the head-and-shoulder pattern completed in April 2022. Bitcoin miners, in aggregate, will underperform the Bitcoin price before the halving, although the low-cost miners CLSK and RIOT will outperform the field. After the halving, we expect at least one publicly traded miner to be 10x by the end of the year. Days Since Bitcoin Cycle Peak Source: Bloomberg, VanEck research as of 11/30/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. 3. Bitcoin will make an all-time high in Q4. In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin will climb a Presidential-sized wall of worry. The percentage of the global population voting in legislative and presidential elections will hit an all-time high above 45% in 2024. This high level of important elections augurs high volatility and the prospect of significant changes. More specifically, we see mounting evidence that voters and courts are rejecting the anti-growth agenda of the Green lobby. Thus, after a combative election that saw Donald Trump win 290 electoral votes and regain the Presidency, raising optimism that the SEC's hostile regulatory approach will be dismantled, we think the Bitcoin price will reach an all-time high on November 9th, exactly 3 years to the day from its last all-time high. (Recall that Bitcoin’s breakout in November 2020 also came exactly three years to the day from its November 2017 top). If Bitcoin reaches $100k by December, we make a long-shot call that Satoshi Nakamoto will be named Time Magazine's ""Man of the Year."" Source: Bloomberg, VanEck research as of 11/30/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The information, valuation scenarios and price targets presented on Bitcoin in this blog are not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell Bitcoin, or as a projection of how Bitcoin will perform in the future. Actual future performance of Bitcoin is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance of Bitcoin. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. 4. Ethereum won’t flip Bitcoin in 2024 Ethereum will fail to flip Bitcoin in 2024, but it will outperform every mega-cap tech stock. Bitcoin’s more apparent regulatory status and energy intensity will attract interest from quasi-state entities in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. Argentina will join El Salvador, the UAE, Oman, and Bhutan as the fifth country to sponsor Bitcoin mining at the state level, as Argentina’s state-owned energy giant YPF may indicate interest in mining digital assets with stranded methane and gas. Like past cycles, Bitcoin will lead the market to rally, and the value will flow into smaller tokens just after the halving. ETH won’t begin outperforming Bitcoin until post-halving and may outperform for the year, but there will be no “flippening.” Despite a strong performance in 2024, ETH will lose market share to other smart contract platforms with less uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap, such as Solana.

ETH L2s will capture the majority of EVM-compatible TVL and volume post-EIP-4844 Ethereum will implement EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will reduce transaction fees and improve scalability for layer 2 chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others. Within 1 year of the upgrade, Ethereum L2s will consolidate down to 2-3 dominant players as measured by value and usage. One will achieve higher monthly DEX volume/TVL than Ethereum for the first time. Collectively, these chains may accumulate 2x the DEX volume of Ethereum (currently 0.8x) by Q4 of 2024 and 10x the number of transactions. Ethereum will implement EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will reduce transaction fees and improve scalability for layer 2 chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others. One of them will achieve higher monthly DEX volume/TVL (total valued locked) than Ethereum for the first time. This is because cheaper transaction fees enable tighter bid/ask spreads due to the high cost of DEX transactions on Ethereum. With stricter bid/ask spreads, there exists a greater number of arbitrage opportunities, which leads to more trading. Additionally, faster block times, only 0.25 seconds on chains like Arbitrum, enable more transaction throughput and more prospects for CEX/DEX and DEX/DEX arbitrage. As a result, DEXes and L2s should attract more volume due to the trading opportunities they enable. Collectively, these chains may accumulate 2x the DEX volume of Ethereum (currently 0.8x) by Q4 of 2024 and 10x the number of transactions. Within 1 year of the upgrade, Ethereum L2s will consolidate down to 2-3 dominant players as measured by value and usage. This is due to the fact that liquidity fragmentation will accelerate the dominance of the dominant L2s. This has already occurred in DEXes, where the exchanges Uniswap, Pancake Swap, and Curve accounted for 78% of DEX volumes in 2023. The same market consolidation on will occur across L2s, with Arbitrum and Optimism looking to be the main contenders. Ethereum Share of DEX Volume Source: Artemis.xyz as of 12/3/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. 6. NFT activity will rebound to an all-time high. Monthly NFT volumes will approach a new all-time high as speculators return to crypto and gravitate toward top NFT collections on Ethereum, improved crypto games, and new Bitcoin-based offerings. Despite ETH's nearly 50-1 ratio vs. Bitcoin in primary NFT sales since inception, Bitcoin's Ordinals protocol and emerging layer 2 chains on Bitcoin will drive a continued rebirth in Bitcoin network fees. The ratio of ETH-to-BTC primary NFT issuance will end in 2024 closer to 3-1. Stacks ('STX'), a smart contract platform secured by Bitcoin, will become a top-30 coin by market cap (currently #54). Bitcoin & ETH NFT Volume Source: Cryptoslam! as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. 7. Binance will lose the #1 position for spot trading. Binance will lose its throne as the #1 centralized exchange by volumes after the company's $4B settlement with US regulators. OKX, Bybit, Coinbase, and Bitget will emerge as well-funded competitors with the potential to grab the #1 spot. Crypto exchanges' pricing inclusion in regulated indices, such as those administered by VanEck subsidiary MarketVectors, will become a critical variable in determining whether certain centralized exchanges are eligible to provide liquidity for ETF-authorized participants and sponsors. With Binance now facing a 3-year DOJ colonoscopy, Coinbase's international futures market will gain share and surpass $1B/day volume, up from ~$200M/day in November 2023. 8. Stablecoin market cap will reach a new all-time high as USDC reverses share losses. The total value of stablecoins on the chain will reach an all-time high above $200B (currently $128B) as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulated stablecoins launch in Europe, yield-bearing stablecoins proliferate, and trading volumes continue to rebound. More controversially, USDC will flip USDT, as more institutional adoption will reveal a preference for USDC already evident on newer L2 chains. Tether’s market share losses may finally materialize after the U.S. U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) takes enforcement against Justin Sun & Tron for Know Your Customer (KYC) infractions, terror financing, and/or market manipulation.

DEX: CEX Spot Trade Volume Source: The Block, The Graph, Coingecko as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) market share of spot crypto trading will rise to an all-time high as high-throughput chains like Solana improve the on-chain trading experience for users. Meanwhile, much-improved wallets - incorporating ""account abstraction,"" a critical feature in enabling automated payments -- will push more users on-chain and into self-custody solutions. As BTC and ETH dominance likely declines after the Bitcoin halving, the long tail of assets may grow faster, skewing trading activity towards decentralized exchanges that list coins earlier in their lifecycle. 10. Remittances and smart contract platforms will power a new Bitcoin yield opportunity Remittances will emerge as a killer blockchain use case as easier off-ramping and spending of stablecoins make recipient payouts cheap and useful in emerging markets. Given the use of the Bitcoin and layer 2 Lightning ('LN') network in some remittance corridors, ""Bitcoin Staking"" will become a narrative in 2024. With transaction costs rising on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC maximalists will start spreading the news that you can stake on the BTC network and earn a yield. Staking to Lightning Nodes happens today but is risky and has low return as your BTC is used for payment settlements on the Lightning network. With the proliferation protocols that abstract the technical nuances of managing a Lightning node, such as Amboss, along with federated self-custody solutions like Fedi, users will be able to participate in the remittance market from cold wallets and earn some yield. In addition, Bitcoin holders will be given a new business opportunity in 2024 as a provider of security to Proof of Stake blockchains. Utilizing projects like Cosmos-based Babylon, which will enable BTC holders to earn yield by offering non-custodial staking of PoS chains, Bitcoin holders will be able to earn yield on their Bitcoin and potentially participate in an array of other productive use cases for their BTC. 11. A breakout blockchain game will finally arrive. Web3 Gaming Investment Source: DappRadar as of 10/12/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Blockchain gaming will see at least one title surpass 1 million+ daily active users, demonstrating the long-awaited potential. Among candidates to achieve this milestone, IMX is most likely to become a top 25 coin by market cap (currently #42) with the release of Illuvium, Guild of Guardians, and other high-budget games in 2024 and a well-designed token that aligns interests better than most. According to a recent report from DappRadar, the WAX blockchain currently leads the gaming sector with 406k daily unique active wallets, of which ~100k are playing Alien Worlds, a metaverse with multiple simple games that reward players with the Trillium token. However, many of these players are likely bots farming the tokens due to the simplicity of the games. On the other hand, Immutable has multiple AAA games building on their platform that implement token models that cannot be simply farmed and are truly fun games to play. These titles, which have been building for years and received $100m+ in funding, are being released in 2024. They could attract players at the scale of traditional AAA games like Starfield, which was released earlier this year and reached 10 million players within its first two weeks. Additionally, Immutable has been working to resolve many of the technical pain points that have inhibited the success of Web3 gaming so far, such as wallet management. Immutable’s “Passport” allows users to log in to games and manage their blockchain-based game items through a familiar single sign-on process while abstracting away blockchain interaction. The increased simplicity that Immutable provides gamers combined with large distribution partners such as the Epic Games Store and GameStop could finally allow a blockchain-based game to become a mainstream hit. 12. Solana will continue to outperform ETH as DeFi TVL returns. Solana Total Value Locked Source: DefiLlama as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Solana will become a top 3 blockchain by market cap, Total Value Locked (TVL), and active users. Fueled by this rise, Solana will join the spot ETF wars thanks to a flurry of asset managers submitting filings. Related to Solana's continued market share gains, we see a legitimate possibility that Solana-based price oracle Pyth flips Chainlink in Total Value Secured (“TVS”). For reference, Chainlink today stands at ~$15bn TVS vs. Pyth’s 13. DePin networks see meaningful adoption. Hivemapper Unique Km Mapped Source: Hivemapper, as of 12/1/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Multiple decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) networks will see meaningful adoption that captures the public's attention. Hivemapper, the decentralized mapping protocol aiming to bootstrap a community-owned competitor to Google Streetview, will map its 10 millionth unique KM, surpassing 15% of global roads capacity. Hivemapper uses its native token, $HONEY, to incentivize thousands of drivers worldwide to mount dashboards to their cars and contribute to its growing database. This global network of permissionless contributors may give Hivemapper a meaningful speed and cost-of-capital advantage relative to the incumbent Google. Google Maps is projected to make more than $11bn in revenue in 2023, representing a meaningful opportunity for Hivemapper if the experiment is successful. Helium, the decentralized network of wireless hotspots, will reach 100k paying subscribers for its nationwide US 5G plan, up from 5k currently. Hotspots can be set up by anyone, and hotspot operators are paid through crypto rails in Helium’s native tokens. This powerful system of incentives gives Helium some key advantages relative to incumbent wireless infrastructure: It is capital-light (from Helium’s perspective). It turns hotspot providers into advocates & supporters (given their ongoing stake in the network). It gives Helium the ability to respond to real-time data & improve the network by adjusting its incentives (i.e., boosting rewards in areas with poor coverage). Wireless infrastructure is a $200B, relatively mature market. We see significant scope for disintermediating legacy providers (Towers) as end-users tend towards low-cost solutions with a differentiated brand (“user-owned”). Helium claims they can deliver data at less than 50% of the cost of legacy networks. As crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, and if that claim is true, they will likely join a significant share. 14. New accounting treatment will rejuvenate the case for corporate crypto holdings. Base Weekly Fees Source: DefiLlama as of 11/28/2023. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Coinbase will become the first publicly traded company to break out and report Layer 2 blockchain revenues in its quarterly filings as its Base Protocol crosses $100M+ in annualized revenues and becomes a meaningful contributor to the business. The additional disclosure may be catalyzed by corporate adoption of new FASB guidelines that allow corporates to book mark-to-market gains on crypto, which will favorably impact corporate preference for holding Bitcoin and other crypto as treasury assets. Due to these accounting changes, which take effect in 2025 but can be adopted by corporates earlier, a major, non-crypto financial entity (bank, exchange) may announce the creation of a quasi-public blockchain like an L2, with the possible bridging capability to public blockchains by authorized participants. 15. DeFi Reconciles with Know Your Customer (KYC) KYC-enabled and walled garden apps like those using Ethereum Attestation Service or Uniswap Hooks will gain significant traction, approaching or even flipping non-KYC applications in user base and fees. Uniswap will lead other protocols in enabling this functionality, which will drive institutional liquidity and volume to the protocol. The additional volume from KYC-gated hooks will significantly bolster protocol fees by allowing new entrants to participate in DeFi without the fear of interacting with OFAC-sanctioned entities. The addition of hooks will help Uniswap reinforce its moat and competitiveness, which should drive token appreciation, especially once the DAO finally votes in favor of turning on the Uniswap Protocol fee switch to allow value to accrue to the token. If so, we expect such fees to be no higher than 10bps. Decentralized Exchange Market Share Source: DefiLlama as of 11/28/23. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656999-vaneck-15-crypto-predictions-2024?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21279524.jpeg

The unprecedented upswing in the cryptocurrency market has not only been good to tokens of decentralized protocols, but also meme coins like Bonk Inu (BONK). Today marked a new high for the token as its price increased by more than 200% in the weekly timeframe. Solana’s meme coin Bonk has been on a tremendous bull run for quite some time, with a price increase of over 7,000%, indicating the strengthening of the Solana ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Soars To Over $2,300 – Is $3,000 Next? BONK Surges: A Crypto Standout November saw a sharp 1,000 surge in BONK’s value, making it one of the most profitable assets in the cryptocurrency market to date. The general upward trend in the cryptocurrency market in the first part of the month is partially the reason for this growth. Source: TradingView / BONKUSDT The BONK price has consistently produced large bullish candles since breaking out of the bearish trend it had been in since the start of the year. The majority of meme currencies are not moving very much, but BONK is experiencing high trade frequencies that are causing many bull runs. Even though there was a slight decline in price, the bulls’ overwhelming domination kept the price above the gains. Considering that the volume has now turned to its advantage, the uptrend should last until the end of the month. Based on the technical indications, there is no sign that the bullish momentum will abate anytime soon. At the moment, BONK is experiencing a strong positive trend, with its price hitting an exponential high of $0.0000152. Interestingly, the prior high at $0.0000100 has become a level of support. BONKUSD currently trading at $0.00001360 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com The 89th position on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates an overbought zone. Extended green histograms on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate a strong bullish trend. BONK’s Ascent Faces Resistance Challenges BONK will encounter early resistance near its new all-time high of $0.0000133299 if it continues to rise. Above that, the extended Fib -0.236 level at $0.0000156963 and Fib -0.382 at $0.0000171293 are targets for higher moves. Volume is still high, indicating that people are still interested in BONK as it rises. BONK seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Meanwhile, some fortunate Solana ecosystem participants stand to gain greatly from the skyrocketing price of the meme coin. Solana gave away $10 worth of BONK tokens when it released its Saga smartphone back in April. Those tokens are now worth over $11,500 because BONK is now over 1,000 times the price since then. Related Reading: This BRC-20 Token Just Breached $1 Billion Market Cap With 180% Rally Today – Details For those who are still holding onto their BONK airdrops, this has already been a transformative experience. Even in the wildest meme coin theories, gains of over a thousand percent are practically unheard of. Furthermore, given the continued growth of the cryptocurrency industry overall, it is possible that Solana and the meme coin community will continue to surprise us in the future given the persistent enthusiasm and risk-taking behavior.

In a recent post on X, prominent analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the Dogecoin price has successfully cleared all major resistance levels. This latest on-chain revelation is based on IntoTheBlock’s price data, which revolves around the density of investors who bought the DOGE token at certain ranges. #Dogecoin has successfully cleared all major resistance levels!

I expect the next generation to be consumers of decentralized apps built on blockchains like Ethereum. The cost of using the platform is measured in Ether, and end users will compete and pay cash for this scarce resource. I like Ether because the Ethereum blockchain is diverse and has the ability to track and regulate the movement of tokens. ETHE is undervalued when considering the spot price of its assets. Introduction Ethereum Grayscale Trust ( ETHE ) is an ETF that invests in and stores Ether. I write this article to reiterate to investors that Ethereum should be thought of as more than a currency; it bears similarities to the equity and commodity asset classes and stands to revolutionize the way we live. Much like AI, the full spectrum of use cases for such technology is vast and likely seeps into all industries in some manner. Ethereum's potential and ETHE trading currently at a discount to net asset value make this instrument very attractive. On the basis of operational value, solid macros, and technical momentum, I rate ETHE a Strong Buy. The Value of Ether and Ethereum Ether is to Ethereum as stock is to a company. The profitability of one drives the value of the other. Of course, miners make the profits on the Ethereum platform, but the economics are the same as with companies. There are many nuances, like staking which now yields investors interest on their Ether. Proof of stake consensus governance means that the control over Ethereum operations, akin to voting rights, lie in Ether. Ether is also a commodity, representing the ability to do business through the Ethereum ecosystem. Ether earned by miners is sometimes called gas. As petroleum powers global commerce, so too will Ether become a commodity that powers a virtual economy on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is like a solid company because its product is valuable to humans. Trustless transactions with no middleman stand to solve many inefficiencies. Data mobility, privacy, and opportunity are key components of the value of Ethereum to users, as is authenticity and legitimacy of digital objects. It therefore paradoxically can make us more secure, honest, and fair in our use of the Internet. Web 3.0 encapsulates this idea. All the available Ether is now worth around $276 billion. If cryptocurrencies were valued as companies are, the market capitalization numbers would put Ethereum in the mega-cap range. Although I tend to write about small- and micro-cap stocks with large upside potential, I believe Ether has as much value as any equity or commodity exposed in my portfolio. The Macro Picture While the Federal Reserve's Summary of Economic Projections is to release the week after I write this article, things are looking pretty good except for inflation above target levels. Employment increased more than forecasted and unemployment rates fell in November. The data suggest that Federal Reserve may come off a bit hawkish and send ETHE prices lower. Despite monetary headwinds, there are other macroeconomic factors that are favorable to Ethereum in the long run. As the jobs numbers show, real economic growth is robust and opportunity exists. Long term trends toward digital consumer products and content over physical alternatives bode well for blockchain generally. Challenges of implementing a government may be mitigated by the adoption of blockchain in government institutions, facilitating lower tax rates and improved resource allocation. Technical Momentum In the context of the bear market and all time highs, now is a great time to buy ETHE for the longer term. From late 2021 to the beginning of 2023, tracking the Ether bear market, ETHE prices were in a sustained downturn. The current price trend suggests that we are in a bull market, although recent price increases appear slightly parabolic, piercing up into the trend line in the chart below. I therefore believe we are overbought in the short term yet in the medium to longer term the trend suggests that this ETF will increase in price. I especially like that the bottom has been clearly validated by daily, weekly, and monthly gains, although it is not yet as pronounced as reduced volume would indicate. I am looking for volume to increase to historical levels and a long run trend to persist no sharper than the trend line below indicates. On a technical basis, I am targeting $30 per share in the next year. Trading View Risks Ethereum is a highly volatile asset; prices move on all sorts of news. You are gambling on the political sausage making process in owning crypto assets. Government officials have expressed concern and anger towards the emergence of the technology, with many early adopters being criminals. While I believe that technology can and will be harnessed for the advancement of society, the perception and primary bias against crypto for these reasons may dampen its adoption. There is also competitive risk from other blockchains that provide the same service as Ethereum. Mitigating this risk is the legacy that Ethereum enjoys, as a lot of end users find legitimate purpose on the platform. While I believe that some cryptocurrencies should not be thought of as just a currency, many investors and users envision Ether replacing the dollar, and with those people I disagree. Priced into Ether may be these expectations, in which case correction may occur. Finally, there is risk related to news surrounding the SEC's decision to give this OTC ETF its stamp of approval. Conclusion I recommend ETHE as an ETF that invests in Ether for several reasons. While it comes with a 2.5% management fee, it takes the work out of buying and safely storing Ether. Given the NAV discount, it is even better to buy this ETF than to buy the cryptocurrency itself. I am targeting 20% portfolio exposure in the near term and would not recommend going any higher. I am also not buying any other asset with meaningful cryptocurrency exposure. The broader case for Ethereum remains strong and characterized by potential to revolutionize the global economy. Miners may replace bankers and others. Decentralized applications will consume gas to provide the next generation of goods and services in a digital economy. As an investor in ETHE, you are owning this commodity and speculating on an increase in its value for a discount.

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Republic of Korea National Security Advisor Cho Tae-Yong and Japan National Security Advisor Takeo Akiba met in Seoul, South Korea to discuss various issues, including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, the official name for North Korea) and its ongoing weapons of mass destruction program, a White House readout said.  ""The National Security Advisors reviewed progress on a wide range of trilateral initiatives, including the Commitment to Consult on regional crises, the sharing of ballistic missile defense data, and our collective efforts to respond to the DPRK’s use of cryptocurrency to generate revenue for its illicit WMD programs,"" the readout said.  The three officials also discussed North Korea's relationship with Russia, the readout said.  North Korea's theft of billions of dollars' worth of crypto from various projects in the industry have drawn attention from various government entities. The U.S. government alleged that Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking entity tied to the DPRK, stole over $600 million from Axie Infinity's Ronin Bridge last year.  The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) has sanctioned multiple mixers it alleged North Korean hackers used to move stolen funds. Just last week, OFAC added two crypto addresses tied to the Sinbad mixer. Police officials from multiple nations jointly seized Sinbad's website as well.  OFAC has also banned various wallet addresses and individuals from the dollar-based global financial system, alleging similarly supported North Korea's efforts to launder stolen funds in support of its weapons program.  Most famously, OFAC listed privacy tool Tornado Cash as a sanctioned entity, alleging more than $100 million in stolen crypto has flown through the mixing service.  Two of the project's developers, Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, are currently facing charges in the U.S. and the Netherlands respectively tied to their work on Tornado Cash. A third developer, Roman Semenov, was charged with money laundering and sanctions violations, but has not yet been arrested.

The company announced a recent press release highlighting the “overwhelming demand” during the early-access period, which filled the staking limit in just six hours. Chainlink Unveils Staking v0.2 Chainlink, recognized as the industry-standard decentralized computing platform, unveiled Chainlink Staking v0.2, the latest upgrade to the protocol’s native staking mechanism. The Early Access phase has commenced, inviting eligible participants to stake up to 15,000 LINK tokens. This phase will last four days before transitioning into the General Access phase, enabling investors to stake up to 15,000 LINK tokens as long as the staking pool remains unfilled. Per the announcement, the upgrade introduces an expanded pool size of 45,000,000 LINK tokens, equivalent to 8% of the current circulating supply. This enlargement aims to enhance the accessibility of Chainlink Staking, enabling a more diverse audience of LINK token holders to participate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Been In A Class Of Its Own For The Last 10 Years, Top Expert Says Staking forms an integral part of Chainlink Economics 2.0, which brings an additional layer of cryptoeconomic security to the Chainlink Network. Specifically, Chainlink Staking empowers ecosystem participants, including node operators and community members, to support the performance of Oracle services by staking LINK tokens and earning rewards for contributing to network security. While v0.1 served as the initial phase of the Staking program, v0.2 has been restructured into a fully modular, extensible, and upgradable Staking platform. Building upon the lessons learned from the previous release, the v0.2 beta version focuses on several key objectives. Chainlink is introducing several new features to enhance its staking program. These include a new unbinding mechanism that provides more flexibility for Community and Node Operator Stakers. Additionally, security guarantees for Oracle services are being reinforced by slashing node operator stakes. A modular architecture is being adopted to support future improvements and additions, and a dynamic rewards mechanism is being introduced to seamlessly accommodate new external sources of rewards in the future, such as user fees. Following the conclusion of the Early Access phase on December 11, 2023, the v0.2 staking pool will transition to General Access. At this stage, anyone will have the opportunity to stake up to 15,000 LINK tokens. LINK Surges To New Yearly High Given Chainlink’s successful upgrade, LINK, the native token of the decentralized computing platform, experienced a significant surge of 12%, reaching a price as high as $17.305. This price level has not been seen since April 2022, signifying a new yearly high for the cryptocurrency. However, LINK has retraced slightly and is currently trading at $16.774. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical support zone for Chainlink. Martinez noted that over 17,000 addresses purchased 47 million LINK tokens from $14.4 to $14.8. This accumulation by many addresses suggests strong buying interest in this price range, potentially acting as a support level for the token. Related Reading: Dogecoin Above $0.1? Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why DOGE Price Will Continue To Rally While the support zone may hold and trigger a rebound in the price of LINK, Martinez cautions that investors should remain vigilant. Any signs of weakness, such as a breach of the support zone or negative market sentiment, could prompt investors to sell their LINK holdings to avoid losses. It remains to be seen whether LINK can maintain its position above these critical levels and whether the broader cryptocurrency market will enter an accumulation phase or experience a retracement after the significant upward movement witnessed in recent weeks. Such a retracement could potentially impact LINK’s price and lead to a test of the support above levels. On the other hand, the token faces immediate resistance at $17.483, $18.069, and $18.910. These represent the final hurdles to overcome before LINK reaches the $20 milestone.

According to IntoTheBlock data on December 8, Bitcoin transaction fees are up by over 60%, while “gas” in Ethereum has climbed by nearly 50% in the past week. Bitcoin And Ethereum Transaction Fees Rise By Double-Digits This surge in activity can be pinned to multiple factors, mainly growing user interest and the ongoing crypto bull market. To illustrate, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are trending at 2023 highs above $43,500 and $2,300 when writing. Even so, the crypto community expects these coins to extend gains in the coming weeks and months, partly because of expected institutional capital, projected to be in their billions, flowing to the sphere. Related Reading: XRP Price To Go Parabolic? Crypto Analyst Confirms 1000% Golden Cross Has Returned According to IntoTheBlock data, cumulative fees collected in Bitcoin this week stand at $43.8 million, up 61%. On the other hand, $83.3 million in fees has been accrued from Ethereum. Looking at the historical transaction fees trend, transacting on Ethereum, despite its relatively high transaction processing speeds (TPS), is more expensive than Bitcoin. This can be due to Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) minting, and more. Bitcoin is a transactional layer and doesn’t inherently support smart contracts. Usually, rising on-chain transaction fees are bullish for price and indicate that their respective ecosystem is thriving from increasing adoption. With transaction fees rising in the two leading blockchain ecosystems, more people want to interact with the project. Subsequently, this could support prices since BTC or ETH is used for paying transaction fees. Will BTC Ease Past 2021 Highs Of $70,000? As BTC is currently trading above $43,500 and ETH recently broke above $2,300, the possibility of these coins retesting and easing past their all-time highs of $70,000 and $4,800, respectively, cannot be discounted. One of the key drivers of the surge in on-chain activity is the ongoing bull market. With crypto rising, more people are looking to position themselves, hoping to profit from further price appreciation. This wave of fear of missing out (FOMO) has pushed higher fees and prices. The demand for liquid and SEC-recognized digital assets will likely increase once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes ahead and authorizes the first Bitcoin ETF. This derivative product will allow institutions to invest in Bitcoin confidently through a regulated solution. Related Reading: Binance Founder Ordered To Stay Put In The US In Ongoing Probe As the odds of the SEC approving this product rose from early Q4 2023, BTC and ETH prices started rising in sync.

The SEC issued an investor alert regarding “crypto asset securities,” prompting speculation that the spot Bitcoin ETF may be closer than ever. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval On The Horizon? The recent investor alert issued by the SEC has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. While the alert does not explicitly mention the spot Bitcoin ETF, many market participants believe it is a positive indicator for its potential approval. The parallel between the investor alert and the approval of Bitcoin Futures adds to the growing optimism surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF. Before approving Bitcoin Futures, the SEC issued similar alerts and warnings, indicating their concern and engagement with the underlying asset class. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Been In A Class Of Its Own For The Last 10 Years, Top Expert Says Consequently, market observers, including Bloomberg’s ETF expert Erich Balchunas, are interpreting the investor alert on “crypto asset securities” as a potential precursor to the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Balchunas stated: Oh snap, SEC tweeting out educational materials, warnings on crypto investing, which is something they also did ahead of $BITO It is important to note that the SEC will evaluate various factors, including investor protection, market integrity, and compliance with existing regulations, before making a final determination on the spot Bitcoin ETF. However, given the increased attention and progress in cryptocurrency, the issuance of the investor alert signifies a step in the right direction. Potential BTC Surge To $48,000 Renowned crypto analyst, Crypto Con, has made interesting observations regarding BTC’s current market dynamics that shed light on the potential next steps for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. According to Crypto Con, money has been pouring into BTC at a rate not witnessed since the last cycle’s peak, with historical data indicating similar patterns on only five prior occasions. This influx of funds has heightened the market’s sentiment and created anticipation for potential further price gains. Crypto Con highlights the significance of Bitcoin’s Money Flow Index (MFI), a technical indicator used to measure the strength and volume of funds flowing into or out of an asset, which reached a value of 91.57, historically indicating the presence of additional bullish momentum. Furthermore, the analyst identifies the .618 cycle retrace of weekly candle bodies as a point of interest for potential target ranges. This level aligns with other significant price regions, further bolstering its importance. Crypto Con suggests that Bitcoin’s price could likely reach the range of $47,000-$48,000 based on these target ranges. However, the analyst also notes that significant price increases are often followed by retracements at this stage in the market cycle. Related Reading: Binance Founder Ordered To Stay Put In The US In Ongoing Probe Crypto Con highlights the potential for a retracement after the completion of the current price rise. The analyst identifies the $31,000-$32,000 range as an area of interest for a potential retracement based on long-term data. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is being traded at $43,800, showcasing a noteworthy recovery within the past 24 hours following a retracement below $42,900 on Thursday. While this price rebound is encouraging, it remains uncertain whether the prevailing market dynamics possess sufficient strength to propel Bitcoin beyond its current yearly high of $44,500. There is a possibility that Bitcoin may experience another failed attempt to surpass this level, which could subsequently result in a deeper retracement before witnessing another upward movement.

21203251,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656800-why-grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust-trading-at-massive-premium?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1702080000,Why The Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust Is Trading At A Massive Premium And How To Exploit It,"Summary Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust is the only way to get Bitcoin Cash exposure through traditional finance infrastructure in the U.S. FRMO Corp, a holding company, believes that Bitcoin Cash has more potential appreciation than Bitcoin due to its larger block size. The Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust is currently trading at a large premium to the price of Bitcoin Cash, presenting trading opportunities for investors. Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) is the only way to get Bitcoin Cash exposure through Tradfi infrastructure in the U.S. markets. It is a closed-end fund with around $75 million in assets under management and a 2.5% management fee. The fund is passively invested in Bitcoin Cash. It is of course possible to buy Bitcoin Cash through a trusted crypto company. The problem is not all investors are sure which of the crypto companies can be trusted or can't go outside of the Tradfi system due to mandate limitations or simply they don't want the additional headache of ensuring security etc. Bitcoin Cash, the underlying here, is a cryptocurrency that came into existence due to a hard fork from Bitcoin (BTC-USD) back in 2017. The primary reason for this split was a disagreement within the Bitcoin community about how to scale the network. When Bitcoin went mainstream, it started facing scalability issues with slower transaction times and higher fees. Bitcoin cash has a larger block size, which increases the speed of transactions and lowers fees. Its community continues to be more transaction-oriented vs store of value-oriented. A holding company called FRMO Corp ( FRMO ) that owns a stake and a royalty on the asset manager Horizon Kinetics, led by Murray Stahl and Steven Bregman, is an interesting company with a big stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Stahl regularly talks about FRMO's and Horizon Kinetics Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ventures. They hold several cryptocurrencies passively but are also engaged in mining and hold the fruits of those endeavors. On the most recent FRMO conference call Stahl said some interesting things about Bitcoin cash in reply to a question about the most undervalued asset on the balance sheet(emphasis mine): ...I’m going to take the liberty of ever so slightly rephrasing the question, for reasons you’ll understand from the answer. I’m going to interpret it as: What investment has the most upside, the greatest potential? And I think it’s Bitcoin Cash. By the way, I think Bitcoin, has enormous potential. I think Bitcoin Cash has more potential appreciation. Basically, Bitcoin Cash has the same monetary protocol as Bitcoin. Yet, one Bitcoin Cash, trades at 0.7%, less than 1%, of a Bitcoin. The reason it trades at that level is that its mining network is less than 1% of the Bitcoin’s. But, there’s no reason why that mining network won’t grow, even in relation to Bitcoin. The reason is, there are so many potential use cases of the blockchain, just in transacting securities, though there is a lot more than that. In the securities world, trading will eventually shift to same-day settlement, probably in a couple of years. The current systems are just not adequate for that. Blockchain technology, though, can do it... ...Bitcoin should, in theory, be worth the value of all nominally denominated currencies. In other words, for anything that has a face value, like a government bond or cash, Bitcoin could be used as a substitute for that sort of value—and if it can, it should be worth at least the nominal value of all those assets, and arguably more. If Bitcoin Cash were to rise from its current 0.7% of the value of Bitcoin to merely 2.8% of Bitcoin—which is still just a tiny fraction—you basically have all the appreciation potential of Bitcoin, which is enormous, but times four. So, to me, that’s the most attractive investment in terms of its potential upside. But as I said, the cryptocurrency project can still fail, so we have to be mindful of that, although I don’t think it’s going to... Personally, I don't know whether Bitcoin cash is very attractive, but there is little doubt that it is recently in favor and up around 149% for the year. Data by YCharts So much so that this Bitcoin cash trust now trades at a large premium to the price of the Bitcoin cash it contains. It contains $2.12 in Bitcoin cash per unit but trades at $3.51. If you buy the closed-end fund, you are essentially paying 60.39% more than if you would buy it on a trusted exchange and hold it in self-custody or in a trusted exchange wallet. Bitcoin Cash Trust discount to NAV (Author) This is not a unique event because the fund has traded at an even larger premium to NAV in the past. Discount Bitcoin Cash Trust to NAV (Author) I think this happens because it is hard to get exposure to Bitcoin cash in regulated or Tradfi-compatible environments. This opens up a few attractive trading opportunities for entrepreneurial investors. I've written up several similar but even more attractive opportunities here . Long Bitcoin Cash Self-custody / Short Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust For some investors, it is possible to go long Bitcoin cash through an exchange and hold it in self-custody or on a trusted wallet/exchange. Meanwhile, it is possible to short BCHG against that position. This position can be set up to be neutral to the movement of Bitcoin cash or to get what is essentially free Bitcoin cash exposure. Long ABCH / Short Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust If you have access to European markets, it is possible to buy a 21Shares ETP that offers Bitcoin Cash exposure to gain long exposure. An Exchange-Traded Note or ETN is an unsecured debt security that tracks an underlying index of securities and trades on an exchange. Unlike Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), ETNs don't have to hold the things the note promises to track. This can introduce counterparty risks. However, ABCH is 100% physically backed by the underlying BCH. The BCH is kept in cold storage. The custodian is Coinbase ( COIN ) which is also used by Grayscale to do their cold storage. Offset the long exposure through the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash fund, and you have created an attractive arbitrage position within the Tradfi system. Long Bitcoin Cash Trust / Short Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (Accredited Investors Only) Accredited Investors can do something exciting, which is buying into the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash fund close to the net asset value. They don't have to pay the premium. However, this requires a bit of paperwork, and you get restricted shares. On one hand, it appears very risky to get stuck in Bitcoin cash for a 1-year period, but nothing barring investors from short-selling the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash fund in the open market. If you do this in the proper ratio, there is effectively no Bitcoin Cash exposure, but after a year, as the private investments become freely tradeable, you capture the difference between the prices you've paid per unit. This sounds great. So, why aren't a lot of people doing this? Well, it is only a $75 million fund. Bitcoin cash isn't that large of an asset. And people have historically done precisely this. In 2020 and 2021, when the fund traded at a large premium, the share count exploded: Bitcoin Cash Trust shares outstanding (Author) I think the same thing will happen now, and over time, this will erode the premium to net-asset value. As the premium erodes, the value between the long and short leg of the proposed trades converges, and the difference is captured, leading to a return of between 40%-60%. I expect this will happen in a timeframe of 1-1.5 years. A critical risk is that the premium can increase in the short term. The trade idea is straightforward, but it is essential to size positions modestly and manage them well.
