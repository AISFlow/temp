Some 50 Google Cloud Platforms, or GCP, customer instances were compromised, according to the report from Google. Crypto mining typically consumes large amounts of computing resources and storage space, Google’s cybersecurity action team wrote in the report. The remainder of the hacking activities included phishing scams and ransomware.  Exploits remain common in the digital assets sector, especially with large amounts of capital flowing into the industry. In May a hacking group installed crypto mining malware into a company server through a weakness in Salt, a popular infrastructure tool used by the likes of International Business Machines, LinkedIn and eBay.  Moreover, in August, more than $600 million was stolen in one of the biggest crypto heists to date, exploiting a vulnerability in the Poly Network, although some of the amount stolen was returned. In 2014, Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange at the time, filed for bankruptcy after hackers stole $460 million worth of crypto.  Poor security practices  Most of the attacks on the GCPs are primarily due to poor security practices by the customers, including the use of weak or no passwords. “Malicious actors gained access to the Google Cloud instances by taking advantage of poor customer security practices or vulnerable third-party software in nearly 75% of all cases,” the report said.  In the cases of hackers using accounts to mine cryptocurrencies, mining software was installed within 22 seconds of the attack, making manual interventions ineffective in preventing such attacks. “The best defense would be to not deploy a vulnerable system or have automated response mechanisms,” the report recommended.  To prevent such attacks, the team recommended several different security approaches, including scanning for vulnerabilities, using two-factor authentication and implementing Google’s Work Safer product for security.  “Given these specific observations and general threats, organizations that put emphasis on secure implementation, monitoring and ongoing assurance will be more successful in mitigating these threats or at the very least reduce their overall impact,” the authors concluded.

42396445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3U1R,1637951238,Celsius CFO Arrested on Charges Tied to Former Job at Moshe Hogeg’s Firm,"Yaron Shalem, the chief financial officer of cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius, was one of the seven people arrested in Tel Aviv this month in connection with Israeli crypto mogul Moshe Hogeg, CoinDesk has confirmed.  Three sources in Israel confirmed Shalem’s arrest. In a tweet Friday, Celsius said it was “recently made aware of a police investigation in Israel involving an employee,” without naming the person.  “While this is in no way related to the employee’s time or work at @CelsiusNetwork, the employee was immediately suspended. We have also verified that no assets were misplaced or mishandled,” the tweet said.  Court proceedings in Israel generally take place in public, except under certain extenuating circumstances when a gag order can be placed on an investigation to protect the identity of individuals involved, as is the case with the people that are part of the Hogeg investigation.  Shalem’s name was included – along with 17 others, including Hogeg’s – in an appendix to a document bearing the letterhead of the Israel police’s national fraud investigation unit. The page, reviewed by CoinDesk, was stamped Nov. 15 by Judge Erez Melamed of the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court. It is not clear from the appendix what kind of document it was attached to. However, the date on the stamp is three days before Israeli police said they had arrested eight individuals, including Hogeg, on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and sexual assault.  Celsius did not respond to requests for comment. Calls to Israeli police were answered with a prerecorded message, or not at all. When CoinDesk called the number listed for a Yaron Shalem in Tel Aviv and asked for him, the person who answered hung up.  In an “ask-me-anything” on Twitter late Tuesday, a Celsius staffer said he could not confirm or deny whether Shalem was one of the former Hogeg associates to have been arrested.  Shalem joined Celsius earlier this year. From January 2014 to March 2018 he worked as CFO for Singulariteam, a venture capital firm launched by Hogeg.  It is not clear what charge(s) Shalem was arrested on. Also unclear is who were the other six individuals who were reportedly arrested along with Hogeg.  Hogeg has been involved in controversy in the past, much of it dating back to the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017. Shalem was named in a lawsuit against Hogeg back in January 2019, brought by Chinese investor Zhewen Hu, the Times of Israel reported.  Alex Mashinsky, Celsius’ founder and CEO, was an adviser to Hogeh’s Sirin Labs as recently as 2019, according to an archived version of the latter startup’s website.  Celsius has had its own share of troubles in recent months. In September, securities regulators in the U.S. states of Texas and New Jersey put Celsius under the microscope, alleging the company’s lending product qualified as an unregistered security.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/26/celsius-cfo-arrested-on-charges-tied-to-former-job-at-moshe-hogegs-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bd10b66c9376de11b0042e0fee124bf001c7934-1440x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Through an agreement with CONMEBOL, the governing body for soccer in South America, Crypto.com will serve as an official partner of CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores from 2023 to 2026 and as a licensee of the competition’s official non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as of 2022, the company said in a statement Thursday, without disclosing further terms.  The deal will make Crypto.com the latest participant in Latin American soccer’s NFT trend, which includes stars such as Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Brazil’s Pelé. In July, CONMEBOL teamed up with Ethernity Chain to mine the 47th Copa America trophy – a continental soccer tournament – as an NFT.  As part of the agreement with CONMEBOL, Crypto.com will be the first brand to be integrated into the Virtual Assistant Referee (VAR) system through which referees review plays, the company added.  “Additionally, Crypto.com will benefit from brand exposure in stadiums, activations and broadcasts of the Conmebol Libertadores, as well as digital assets”, the crypto exchange said, adding that both parties will create NFTs associated with the CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores competition on the NFT platform of Crypto.com.  “Our research shows Latin America is leading the way in embracing cryptocurrency, with 40% of Latin Americans saying they are interested in buying crypto in the near future. Naturally we were eager to support the continent’s most important football competition,” Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, said in a statement.

But do you ever wonder if there is anything that blockchain can never do? Create liquid assets. The very process of selling a token implies an existence of a counter-party who is willing to buy. Compared to selling stocks or bonds, trading a crypto asset is a lot like selling a house, where it is harder to find a buyer (depending on the coin, of course). More precisely, the illiquidity of crypto assets affects how fast they can be bought or sold at a stable price. To create a liquid asset, you&apos;ll need a promising Dapp, a reputable chain, and a cult-like following. In other words, it is a time-consuming, difficult balancing act. Enter, yield farming. Yield Farming is, quite simply, letting your hard-earned money work for you. It&apos;s no different than owning a savings account. The DeFi puts your money in a money pool, and earns profits by charging interest from these loans. The loans are used for market speculation, which in turn promotes liquidity. A smart contract exists to ensure everything remains in check and no value is lost. After all, you are not providing liquidity out of the goodness of your heart, but for stable returns.

The good news is there are lots of developments in the crypto sector that capture its transformative economic and social potential and don’t require embracing the rather distasteful “have fun staying poor” mindset of a few speculators. After looking through CoinDesk’s coverage the past 12 months, here are five things I think the crypto community can be thankful for.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  1) The advance of “Layer 2″ scaling  I chose this nerdy topic first because, ultimately, the question of whether crypto can one day be a viable alternative for the wider global economy depends largely on its ability to scale. It needs the capacity to rapidly settle a massive number of transactions without imposing burdensome costs on users.  Some folks, such those at Bitcoin Cash who led a largely failed move to increase Bitcoin blocks’ data storage capacity, believe scaling requires changes to the base layer blockchain protocol. But that can undermine network security and lead to more centralization. The real promise lies in “layer 2″ middleware that pushes processing capacity “up the stack.” With this, transactions and software commands are executed “off-chain” while the base blockchain still acts as a validation anchor to prevent double-spending.  The best known layer 2 product is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which was first fleshed out by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in a January 2016 white paper. Only now, in 2021, has Lightning come into its own, however, as the basis for El Salvador’s embrace of bitcoin as legal tender. The country’s Chivo wallet remains beset by bugs and President Nayib Bukele isn’t exactly the international community’s darling. Still, the fact that Lightning is allowing many poor Salvadorans to make small payments without incurring heaving processing fees is a positive sign for the advance of this technology.  Other layer 2 advances this past year lie in decentralized finance, or DeFi. Protocols like Polygon and Arbitrum are using tools such as zero-knowledge rollups and Plasma to increase throughput of transactions on Ethereum and other smart contract layer 1 chains, while also creating more opportunities for cross-chain interoperability. These advances are vital if DeFi is to truly challenge the traditional finance model for the global economy.  2) Developing world crypto innovation  While there has been a great deal of attention in the U.S. and other developed countries on the flood of institutional investors into crypto assets (see point 3), there’s an equally important trend of adoption in the developing world. Bitcoin- and stablecoin-based cross-border remittances are increasing in many developing countries, crypto payments have rapidly expanded inside troubled economies such as Turkey and Argentina, and, most interestingly, new hubs of unique innovation have popped up in the developing world.  We covered three examples in separate episodes of the “Money Reimagined” podcast: the expansion of DeFi projects in Nigeria; the outsized role played by the Philippines in the global advance of “play to earn” crypto gaming models; and the lead that Cambodia has taken in using a blockchain system for internal payments that improve financial inclusion without requiring a formal central bank digital currency.  3) The institutions have arrived  The past year has seen investments in bitcoin and crypto from a who’s who of hedge funds, big-name investors like Ray Dalio and George Soros, and even pension funds. A few more adventurous crypto-ready hedge funds are now finding their way into DeFi.  A more cynical eye might view the arrival of these institutional investors, which has pushed up the price of tokens, as crowding out smaller players and therefore undermining the dream of an open, accessible and inclusive decentralized financial system. But if we believe layer 2 projects like those described in point 1 will make transactions cheap and efficient, then there’s a more positive way to view this trend: that it makes the crypto ecosystem more secure, for two reasons.  First, the more money locked in these systems, the more difficult they are to compromise, because it makes it much more expensive for an attacker to take over the network. Second, the more that Wall Street and its wealthy investors are exposed to crypto, the harder it is for regulators in Washington to shut it down.  4) An NFT creativity burst  Suddenly, non-fungible tokens are everywhere. Collins dictionary has even declared “NFT” the word of the year. Cynics (and snobs) worry that profit-making obsessions for collectible avatars such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club series are giving art a bad name. But the myriad commercial and non-commercial NFT art and entertainment projects represent an explosion of creativity, one that merges money, technology, community and art into a confusing but fascinating mix of forces.  It’s indisputable that the biggest financial winners in this boom are confined to a narrow set of early-adopting collectors and big splash-making artists such as Beeple, with his record-breaking $69.3 million Christie’s sale in March. But there are also signs that previously marginalized digital artists are finding new avenues for both creativity and for directly selling their work to collectors. We highlighted South African artist Lethabo Huma in a “Money Reimagined” podcast in February that doubled up as a special Clubhouse edition and attracted innovative NFT artists such as Micah Johnson.  5) Protocol upgrades: Bitcoin’s Taproot and Ethereum’s London hard fork  Having started out with a nerdy topic, I’ll close with another. This one might seem to contradict the idea that it’s better to develop layer 2 products that sit on top of the base protocol, rather than try to insert new bells and whistles into the base layer. But the truth is that some problems can be dealt with only at the protocol layer. It’s really hard to make those changes in a decentralized system, because you need to find community consensus around them or risk a split in the chain.  So, it was encouraging to see two rather significant upgrades get through for the two biggest blockchains in 2021. One was Bitcoin’s long-awaited Taproot upgrade, which improves privacy, efficiency, programmability and security. And the other was Ethereum’s London hard fork, which (among other things) helps reduce volatility in that blockchain’s “gas price” transaction fees and created the potential to reduce long-term ETH supply in a manner that boosted its value in the market. Both upgrades represent important, material changes that will advance the broader crypto ecosystem.",POSITIVE,ETH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FORKS,Michael J.

Not much is clear about the variant&apos;s properties yet, but what looks to be most worrying so far is that this version of COVID may be vaccine resistant due to the large number of mutations. The Director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, Prof. Tulio de Oliveira, said &apos;This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump on evolution [and] many more mutations that we expected.&apos; If it indeed turns out to have strong immunity to the vaccine, then vaccination efforts so far may become ineffective, and nations around the world may look at enforcing new lockdowns.

42394373,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcE1B,1637933400,"America, Let’s Try Optimism This Thanksgiving","You’re reading this on Friday, but I’m writing it on Wednesday because of the Thanksgiving holiday. So I suppose it makes sense to think about the future, and about America. Many Americans seem to have lost that urge, despite economic signs showing things are turning a major corner. One of the reasons crypto is winning so big right now is that it offers an escape from a society that in many ways can seem like it’s traveling a long, dark tunnel to nowhere.  Whether crypto represents a real alternative or not, of course, remains to be seen. But with political tensions, COVID-19, looming climate catastrophe and apparently contagious social-media brainworms, America is in the midst of a period of extreme cultural pessimism, alongside what many are describing as a mental health crisis. Tragically, this has been particularly concentrated among children, but it’s also obviously hitting adults. I’m personally fixated on the rise of violent incidents on airplanes, among the most clearly terrifying places to lose your mind.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  More specifically, survey data shows surges in anxiety and depression (unfortunately, better medical data seems hard to come by). Individual anxiety and depression are such pernicious little bastards because they trap you in a loop of cursing yourself for inaction while also being terrified of taking the wrong action. That’s a fairly decent analog for the broader paralysis, malaise and fear that have taken over our cultural discourse as a whole.  Unlike a lot of individual cases, America’s collective mental health crisis has some serious real-world justifications. But on at least one front there’s a strange disconnect: The U.S. economy is absolutely burning up the charts. I saw this first hand recently when I trekked out to Jamaica, Queens, to renew my driver’s license at the excellent Motor Vehicles department there. It’s a working-class neighborhood on the far eastern outskirts of New York City, and I was amazed by the crowds, the number of people in the streets and the boxes of new goods piled on the sidewalks. People were just out there shopping their tails off.  The numbers back up the anecdote. JPMorgan this week revised its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to 7%, per CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla, which is so good you’re tempted to use bad words. Goldman Sachs’ estimate is 6%. Meanwhile, wages are rising, unemployment is at 4%. It’s all looking really good.  And these growth numbers, by the way, are adjusted for inflation (credit to Fabian Stolzenburg on Twitter for this point). U.S. nominal (non-inflation adjusted) growth for 2021 could wind up at over 10%, which is the kind of growth you’d expect from a country that just got its first power plant – scratch that, its first light bulb – and not the world’s biggest and most advanced economy.  Yet, you’re much more likely to hear people doomsaying about inflation. That’s a reasonable anxiety! But it seems, perhaps thanks to fearmongering by some politically motivated pundits, many Americans are totally unaware of the connection between this increasingly face-ripping economy and recent inflation increases. The two are almost always entwined: Inflation is a product of too many dollars chasing too few goods. So it’s what happens when people are spending a lot of money instead of, say, saving it.  Of course, that doesn’t apply if you’re Argentina or Venezuela or Turkey and you have some actual kook just spinning up the money printer. There is absolutely such a thing as bad inflation. But mixing up what’s happening in Turkey with what’s happening in the U.S. is a drastic category error.  See also: Turkey Makes the Case for Bitcoin as Erdogan Runs the Autocrat’s Inflation Playbook  At its best, inflation is a measure of optimism. You know when else it was high? In 1942, U.S. annual inflation was 10.2%. In 1946, it was 8.5%. In 1947, it was 14.4%. You know what those spikes represented? Sending our soldiers across the pond to save millions of people from a delusional little cokehead named Hitler, then buying the boys steaks and Chevrolets to celebrate (and also sending the white ones to college. Irony!). We spent the money, did the thing, then basked in the fruit of our labors. And it all seems to have pretty much worked out.  We haven’t quite kicked COVID’s ass as thoroughly as we kicked Hitler’s. We’ve fallen short on unity and self-sacrifice this time around – though looking around the world, it’s not clear at this point there was any real way to stop the spread of COVID-19. What we could do, and did with admirable foresight and determination, was keep the economy’s pipes from freezing while it was on lockdown. We prevented massive amounts of misery and kept things ready to roar when the time was right.  And boy, we’re roaring now. So do yourself a favor and indulge in some optimism, Americans, on the economy if nothing else. Happy holidays. You deserve it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,David Z.

The issue is caused by domain name system (DNS) “pollution,” Binance Pool and Poolin said on their Chinese Telegram channels. F2pool also said the pool’s domain name is not being properly resolved.  The DNS is the internet service that converts domain names like coindesk.com into internet protocol (IP) addresses, which are strings of numbers. DNS poisoning can occur when a hacker redirects traffic from the domain name to an imposter website.  ViaBTC users are also reporting on Telegram that they are having difficulty accessing the pool. On its English Telegram channel, the pool acknowledged the issue but did not specifically mention DNS connectivity problems.  “The connectivity issues appear to be primarily affecting Chinese miners,” said Alejandro De La Torre, founder of ProofofWork.Energy consulting firm and former Poolin vice president. De La Torre thinks the Chinese government is likely interfering with the mining pools.  Binance Pool’s bitcoin hashrate is down 14% in the last 24 hours. F2pool has dropped almost 8% and ViaBTC has fallen by 7%, according to BIT Mining’s information platform.  A large part of the pools’ operations are located in China, which has vowed to eliminate crypto mining. While their hashrate does not come only from China, and they have said they plan to exit the country by year-end, the publication of material in Mandarin could be interpreted as courting its population.

42396441,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3TyU,1637924771,Goldman Says Fed May Accelerate Tapering in January: Report,"Having kicked off the unwinding of the crisis-era stimulus this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve may accelerate the pace of the tapering next year, according to a Bloomberg report, citing a client note from Goldman Sachs.  The central bank will double the pace of scaling back its liquidity-boosting asset purchases to $30 billion per month from the current $15 billion, Goldman economists said, predicting three rate hikes in 2022 and two in 2023.  The new projections mean the asset purchase program would end in March.  The investment banking giant expects the first rate hike from near zero will come in June.  “The increased openness to accelerating the taper pace likely reflects both somewhat higher-than-expected inflation over the last two months and greater comfort among Fed officials that a faster pace would not shock financial markets,” economists led by Jan Hatzius noted.  The Fed cut rates to nearly zero and began purchasing assets worth $120 billion per month following the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.  The massive liquidity injections led to unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of the financial market, including bitcoin.  Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting released Wednesday showed a growing number of policymakers were ready to speed up pace of the taper and raise interest rates if inflation continues to run high.

42396446,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3U3P,1637918183,Bitcoin Slips to $55K as Renewed COVID Concerns Jolt Traditional Markets,"The financial markets are a sea of red on Friday as worries over a new coronavirus variant appear to have zapped risk appetite.  While bitcoin is trading 6.7% lower on the day at about $55,000, the S&P 500 futures are nursing a 2.3% loss. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index has slipped 1.8%, and the commodities complex is bleeding, with oil down over 2% on both sides of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, anti-risk assets like the Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries are gaining ground.  The classic risk-off action comes in the wake of reports of a new coronavirus variant detected in Botswana, South Africa, and Hong Kong, which may be vaccine-resistant. If these fears come true, many nations may have to reintroduce economically painful lockdown restrictions.  “There’s a lot we don’t understand about this variant,” Richard Lessells, an infectious disease physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, told the science journal Nature. “The mutation profile gives us concern, but now we need to do the work to understand the significance of this variant and what it means for the response to the pandemic.”  Bitcoin’s decline amid risk aversion in traditional markets suggests the cryptocurrency is not viewed as a safe haven.  More Inflation?  Lockdowns, if any, would perhaps worsen supply chain disruptions, pushing inflation higher – a positive for bitcoin, given it is widely perceived as a store-of-value asset. According to JPMorgan, bitcoin’s October rally mainly resulted from the spike in inflation expectations and the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a hedge against inflation.  That said, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) is already at a three-decade high. A further rise in CPI may see the U.S. Federal Reserve prioritize inflation control over growth by unwinding stimulus faster. That could lead to asset price deflation.  Bitcoin, which remains vulnerable to Fed tightening, fell sharply on Nov. 10 after the higher-than-expected U.S. CPI bolstered fears of an early interest rate hike by the Fed.  Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting released on Wednesday shows that officials would be willing to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
