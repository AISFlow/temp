Meanwhile, Stellar’s technical analysis shows a 29% decline this month, suggesting a continuing downward trend. In the midst of these developments, anticipation around BlockDAG (BDAG) grows following an AMA announcing its 2025 plans to launch on premier exchanges. This news has spiked BDAG demand, with its presale now exceeding $173 million. The journey toward a $600 million presale target appears more feasible, with analysts predicting a BDAG price of $1 by 2025. Let’s delve into how these digital currencies are positioning themselves as the best cryptos to buy now. Stellar’s Outlook: Prolonged Bearish Trends Ahead Stellar’s recent technical analysis indicates a significant 29% fall over the last month. The appearance of a ‘death cross’ could mean the bearish phase isn’t over yet, although a surge in buying might suggest an upcoming reversal. Currently, Stellar finds support at $0.31 and faces resistance at $0.40. The technical charts, including the Directional Movement Index (DMI), point to a strengthening bearish force with an ADX over 25, signaling a strong trend. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index has risen to 0.19, reflecting notable purchasing activity. Should this buying momentum continue, Stellar could potentially breach its current constraints and ascend further. Chainlink’s Pricing Path: Poised for a $32 Breakthrough Despite recent hurdles, Chainlink holds firm support at $21, potentially setting the stage for a push toward the $32 resistance level. A significant amount of LINK has transitioned from exchanges to private storage, hinting at a decrease in sell-off pressure. If Chainlink maintains this foundational support, it may witness an upward trajectory. Growing optimism for Chainlink’s price is evident, with commentary from analyst @Bitcoin_Buddah on X suggesting, “Trump’s World Liberty is actively acquiring LINK, and IMO, Chainlink will spearhead the Altcoin movement in 2025.” Stability is crucial for Chainlink; a fall below support might lower its price further. BlockDAG’s 2025 Exchange Debut Unveiled in the Latest AMA BlockDAG recently stole the spotlight in its December 2024 AMA by announcing substantial development goals. The headline news is BlockDAG’s preparations for major listings in 2025. This AMA shared insights into ongoing discussions with several prominent exchanges, noting a more organized approach to onboarding than before. Aiming to launch on approximately 10 exchanges, this plan positions BlockDAG for swift international growth, boosting its global visibility and making it a top contender as the best crypto to buy now . The buzz from this news has significantly boosted demand for BDAG, prompting a rush for early participation. As the crypto presale surpasses $173 million with prices climbing, daily contributions of over $5 million from major participants indicate a $600 million presale target could soon be a reality. For those eyeing substantial gains, time is of the essence. BDAG’s price is presently $0.0234 in the quickly depleting presale batch 26, with a significant price increase anticipated for the upcoming batch. Adding to the excitement, analysts project that BDAG might reach $1 by the end of 2025. Early participants in BDAG have seen a 2240% ROI, and the projected $1 price points to a possible 4200% ROI for those in batch 26. In brief, entering now might lead to greater gains than delaying and facing higher costs later. The Bottom Line With the Chainlink price steady at $21 and the potential to rise to $32, it presents itself as a robust choice. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) technical analysis after a recent decline suggests a potential upturn if buying intensifies, offering a cautious yet hopeful outlook for market watchers. BlockDAG sets itself apart with its bold plans for 2025 exchange listings. These planned listings are expected to increase global accessibility to BDAG, thereby ramping up demand. With the presale already beyond $173 million and a projected price of $1 by 2025, BlockDAG ranks as one of the best cryptos to buy now.

38244299,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/altura-alu-price-prediction-for-2025,1735428930,Altura ($ALU) Price Prediction for 2025,"Experts have shown interest in Altura, providing realistic price predictions for 2025 that highlight its bullish potential in the cryptocurrency and gaming industries. With both short-term and long-term projections for 2025, Altura is positioned as a standout project in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and gaming industries. What is Altura? Altura is a blockchain-based platform that empowers game developers to create and manage in-game items as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Unlike traditional gaming assets that are locked within specific games, Altura enables true ownership, allowing players to trade, sell, and use their items across multiple games. This innovation creates a seamless and engaging gaming experience. What makes Altura stand out is its ease of use and efficiency. The platform is designed for developers and gamers alike, making it a preferred choice for integrating blockchain technology into gaming ecosystems. Why Altura is Bullish • Integrating AI: Altura uses artificial intelligence to predict gaming trends, enhance user interactions, and streamline the development process. This integration makes Altura’s platform smarter and more adaptable to the fast-paced gaming industry.• A Hundred-Billion-Dollar Industry: The global gaming market, along with AI, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and is expected to grow into trillions. By targeting this industry with cutting-edge technology, Altura has positioned itself in one of the most lucrative markets.• NFT Adoption in Gaming: NFTs are becoming increasingly popular in gaming, offering players real ownership of their digital assets. Altura’s focus on gaming NFTs aligns perfectly with this trend, making it a preferred platform for developers and gamers.• Strategic Partnerships: Altura recently partnered with Immutable, integrating advanced tools like Immutable Passport and Checkout to enhance game development and player experiences. This collaboration highlights Altura’s commitment to innovation and growth in the Web3 gaming space.• Supporting Developers: Altura launched a $1 million Web3 Gaming Grant Fund to support game studios and developers. This fund allocates $50,000 each month, fostering creativity and innovation in blockchain gaming.• Potential Exchange Listings: Altura has significant potential to be listed on top-tier exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. With Binance’s 220+ million users and Coinbase’s 100+ million users, such listings could provide immense exposure and liquidity, further boosting Altura’s value. Short-Term Price Prediction for Altura ($ALU) Altura’s price chart shows a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish signal. The immediate target is $0.20, but with the growing bullish sentiment around its technology and market positioning, the price could exceed $0.50 by Q1 2025. If the altcoin season kicks off in January 2025, Altura’s momentum could gain even more traction. This period often sees rapid market-wide growth, and Altura is well-positioned to capitalize on it. Market Cap and Long-Term Targets for 2025 Altura’s long-term potential is reflected in three clear projections: • Base Target: Altura’s price reaching a $1.5 billion market cap, approximately $1.52 per ALU, is the lowest expected target. This could happen even in a slow or unfavorable market. The project’s solid foundation and consistent innovation mean that Altura can grow despite challenging conditions.• Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap, translating to about $3.03 per ALU, is highly realistic. This outcome is supported by the growing excitement around AI and gaming and favorable market trends. Altura’s focus on blockchain gaming and NFT adoption positions it perfectly to achieve this target, especially with a potential altcoin season driving momentum.• Ultimate Ambition Target: Altura could achieve a market cap between $5 billion and $10 billion, equating to $5.05 to $10.10 per ALU. This would likely occur during a cryptocurrency super cycle, where Ethereum surpasses $15,000 and Bitcoin trades above $240,000. Such market dynamics, combined with Altura’s positioning in the thriving AI and gaming sectors, could drive unprecedented growth for the project. Conclusion The Bullish Target of $3 billion market cap is very achievable due to the fact that we are still early in the cryptocurrency market. Many leading altcoins, such as Ethereum, are still trading below their previous all-time highs. This suggests that the altcoin season hasn’t even started yet. As a result, reaching a $3 billion market cap for Altura would be a realistic milestone, representing an impressive 3000% increase in value. Why Altura’s Future is Bright Altura stands at the intersection of three powerful trends: gaming, blockchain, and AI. The gaming industry’s rapid expansion, combined with Altura’s innovative use of NFTs and AI, positions it as a key player in this space. With increasing interest from developers, gamers, and investors, Altura is set to achieve remarkable milestones in the coming years. Final Thoughts Altura ($ALU) is a project with immense potential and real-world applications. Whether it’s through short-term growth driven by market patterns or long-term success fueled by its strategic focus, Altura is a cryptocurrency worth watching. With partnerships like Immutable and initiatives like the Web3 Gaming Grant Fund, Altura is setting itself up for success. As we approach 2025, keep an eye on this innovative project—it could be a game-changer in your portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38243649,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-groups-sue-irs-over-new-defi-broker-rules,1735427582,Crypto Groups Sue IRS Over New DeFi Broker Rules,"Three major crypto advocacy groups—the Blockchain Association , DeFi Education Fund , and Texas Blockchain Council —have filed a lawsuit against the IRS over its new regulations targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. These groups argue that the IRS has exceeded its legal authority by categorizing DeFi platforms as brokers, sparking backlash across the crypto sector. The IRS recently expanded the definition of ""broker"" to include decentralized exchanges and front-end platforms, requiring them to report all crypto transactions and user details. These rules, set to take effect in 2027, aim to improve transparency in digital asset trading. However, critics argue that the agency’s interpretation goes beyond the scope of its statutory powers and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) . The advocacy groups claim these regulations create excessive compliance burdens, particularly for software developers building DeFi trading interfaces. They warn this could stifle innovation and push emerging technologies offshore. Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal at the Blockchain Association, stated that the IRS’s move infringes on privacy rights and unfairly targets decentralized technologies. The broader crypto community has also voiced strong opposition. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys , criticized the timing of the rule's release during the holiday season, suggesting it was a tactic to minimize public resistance. Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, called the regulation a heavy-handed approach designed to restrict DeFi growth. Additionally, Alexander Grieve, Vice President of Government Affairs at Paradigm, urged Congress to reconsider and potentially block the regulation. Lawmakers, including French Hill and Patrick McHenry, have expressed their disapproval, calling the rule an overstep by the Treasury. Hill described it as a poorly crafted policy finalized in the closing days of the current administration. The lawsuit underscores growing tension between regulators and the crypto industry, highlighting concerns about innovation, privacy, and the future of decentralized finance in the United States .",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-groups-sue-irs-over-new-defi-broker-rules,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38243649.jpeg

The latest move makes El Salvador the sixth country to hold over 6,000 BTC. The country in Central America bought one Bitcoin on December 29, bringing the country’s total to 6000.77 Bitcoin, which translates to $569.3 million, as shown by the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador’s portfolio tracker . After the purchase, the country’s Bitcoin investment rose to 108.02%. The Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker further indicates that El Salvador acquired the digital assets at an average purchase price of $45,450 per Bitcoin. The country made its first Bitcoin purchase on September 6, 2021, when it bought 200 Bitcoins. It officially became the first country to declare Bitcoin a legal tender by then. The latest purchase solidifies crypto’s status as a treasury asset for President Nayib Bukele’s country. El Salvador accelerates Bitcoin purchases despite IMF warnings El Salvador ranks sixth among the countries that hold Bitcoin. According to BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data, it falls behind the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan. Although the country always buys a Bitcoin per day, it bought $1 million worth one day after striking a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and again on December 22, despite the IMF requesting it row back some of its Bitcoin activity. The purchases are in line with El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert’s statement on X on December 19, in which he indicated that the country would continue to buy Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. Bitcoin has led to financial freedom in the Central America’s country El Salvador is proud of the achievements associated with Bitcoin since it undertook the mission of stacking digital assets. It recently showcased those achievements in a meeting between Vice President Félix Ulloa Jr. and Zhang Yanhui, the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China. During the meeting, the Vice President stated that Bitcoin made their country a symbol of financial freedom. He further clarified that the country’s Bitcoin reserve currently exceeds 6,217 BTC, valued at over $500 million.

But what if there’s a superior option to enhance your shopping rewards? Enter the world of Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens, a groundbreaking reward system poised to revolutionize e-commerce. These tokens surpass traditional gift cards by offering enhanced value, greater flexibility, and more growth opportunities, positioning them as the smarter choice for discerning shoppers today. The live Web3Bay presale presents an early opportunity for participants to secure tokens that provide much more than simple discounts. These tokens allow entry into a decentralized marketplace, offer exclusive advantages, and even grant a stake in the platform’s future, marking the dawn of a new e-commerce era. The Superior Benefits of 3BAY Tokens Enhanced Financial Value Unlike Amazon gift cards that restrict spending to one platform, 3BAY tokens bring unmatched flexibility. These blockchain-enabled tokens can be utilized across Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace or exchanged on various trading platforms, opening up substantial financial prospects for holders. While gift cards become useless post-use, 3BAY tokens maintain and can even increase in value over time, transforming them from mere rewards into significant assets. Furthermore, Web3Bay’s decentralized structure allows 3BAY tokens to adapt with ongoing innovations in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), providing opportunities that go far beyond what traditional gift cards can offer. Unrivaled Discounts and Rewards Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens are crafted to elevate the shopping experience. Token holders enjoy a 5% discount on every purchase and gain rewards for their participation and engagement with the platform. These benefits accumulate, creating a continual value cycle that Amazon gift cards cannot match. For example, those who take part early in the Web3Bay presale have a unique chance to acquire tokens at a significantly lower price than their eventual final value. As the token price increases by 15% at each presale stage, early buyers experience substantial growth potential. Ownership and Influence in the Platform Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens extend beyond mere transactional advantages. Token holders play a crucial role in governing the platform, as they can vote on key decisions and shape the direction of the marketplace. This participation ensures that Web3Bay evolves in ways that benefit its community, a stark contrast to Amazon gift cards, which provide no influence over the retailer’s strategies or offerings. Additionally, as Web3Bay transitions into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), token holders will gain even greater control over the platform’s trajectory, solidifying their position as pivotal stakeholders in the Web3 revolution. Seize the Moment: Join the Web3Bay Presale Now Web3Bay’s presale is a prime opportunity to get 3BAY tokens at a ground-floor price. Launched on December 10, 2024, the presale is laid out over 28 stages, with initial token prices at only $0.003, climbing to $0.1959 in the final stage. With a vast total of 5 billion tokens, 40% of which are designated for the presale, early buyers can capture unmatched value. Unlike Amazon gift cards, which lose their practical value once used, 3BAY tokens represent a growing investment in the evolving e-commerce landscape. As Web3Bay expands, the value of these tokens is anticipated to rise, providing both immediate benefits and long-term growth potential. Web3Bay’s development plan includes exciting features like cross-chain compatibility, NFT-based loyalty schemes, and staking options, positioning 3BAY tokens as a visionary pick for those who want more from their online shopping ventures. The platform is also compatible with established payment methods like PayPal, ensuring it is accessible to everyone. Final Thoughts Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens do more than just substitute Amazon gift cards; they completely transform the rewards system in e-commerce. These tokens offer genuine value, continuous rewards, and an active role in the platform’s governance, providing advantages that traditional gift cards cannot. The presale is active, with early participants already securing their place in this game-changing marketplace.

38243302,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667847,1735426840,"Bitcoin Next Move Hinges On Critical $96,600 Region – Here’s Why","The price of Bitcoin saw no overall gain over the past week as the premier cryptocurrency continued to undergo a market correction. Despite multiple upward movements, Bitcoin struggled to break past the $100,000 resistance with its price performance in December continuing to deviate from earlier bullish predictions. Amidst this development, market analysts continue to roll out projections on Bitcoin’s potential price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Surge: Are Traders Preparing For A Major Market Shift? Is Bitcoin Price Top In? In an X post on December 27, crypto technical analysis handle More Crypto Online shared an interesting prediction on Bitcoin in its current corrective state. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, these market analysts have drafted two opposing forecasts on the BTC market named the yellow and white scenarios. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory is a form of technical analysis that hinges on the belief that the financial market moves in repetitive fractal patterns called waves that can be used to predict future price movements. With Bitcoin presently in a corrective structure i.e. moving against the bullish market trend, the white scenario states Bitcoin has completed a B-wave in which it recorded a local price top on December 26th. Currently, the premier cryptocurrency is moving in a C-wave headed to a potential price target in the mid to low $80,000 price zone. The original support zone to counter this bearish movement is around $95,068 – $96,670. However, as Bitcoin establishes new lows, these resistance regions will be recalibrated. On the other hand, the yellow scenario shows that the B-wave, which is concluded in the white scenario, is still developing as part of a larger corrective structure with no price top yet recorded. However, for this yellow scenario to become valid, BTC needs to break above $96,673 signaling that an upward movement is still ongoing. Therefore, as long as this price zone remains unbroken, the white scenario remains the dominant outlook for the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over? What This Legendary Metric Says BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,790, marking a 1.04% decline over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has risen by 10.35%, reaching $52.24 billion. After a week of near-balanced gains and losses, the leading cryptocurrency has dropped 2.00%, with its monthly performance also slipping into negative territory. For market bulls, moving above $96,600 remains the immediate task based on the Elliott Wave theory, however, a major opposition awaits at $100,000 which has proved an effective resistance in recent times. Generally, optimism continues to remain high in the Bitcoin market, especially with the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump fast approaching which is expected to herald in a new era of pro-crypto policies.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto investors seek high returns, with WallitIQ poised to outshine Dogecoin and Cardano, aiming for $10 in 2025. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s recent price swings leave investors unsure about its performance in 2025 Cardano mimics 2020 trend that suggests it might surge to $6 Conclusion Irrespective of the industry, the goal of any investment is to make a profit. This is why crypto investors are constantly looking out for the next big altcoin that will yield massive profits. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are household names, a new contender, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is dominating the market because it promises greater returns. Moreover, HSBC analysts believe it will stand out at the start of 2025 by hitting an impressive $10. You might also like: Bank of America manager says ADA not done, WallitIQ set for 77,000% breakout Here Is Why HSBC Analysts Are Confident WallitIQ Will Outpace Other Altcoins and Reach $10 in January 2025 WallitIQ is the undisputed king of this bull run, as HSBC analysts say it is poised to rise from $0.0243 to $10 by January 1st, 2025. This token is rewriting the rules of crypto investing because it uses artificial intelligence to help traders maximize their profit. So, those who are still on the sidelines risk missing the biggest crypto opportunity of the decade. One of the features driving WallitIQ’ s upcoming rise is how it helps people manage their digital assets. This token allows traders to trade over 1,000 cryptocurrencies from the comfort of their wallets. Also, it offers unmatched staking rewards. Users can earn a whopping 180% APY by simply staking their token. HSBC analysts laud WallitIQ as an effortless opportunity to make a juicy passive income. Token holders have governance rights to make their contribution or suggestions towards the platform’s future. The crypto market is already buzzing about WallitIQ’s potential. So, it is no surprise that its presale crossed the million-dollar milestone within days. With other perks like unlimited referral bonuses, community rewards, and ultra-low swap rates, crypto whales are pouring millions into the presale. WallitIQ is selling at $0.0243, and HSBC analysts have predicted it will skyrocket to $10 come January. A major contribution to these projections is that WallitIQ has proven to be a safe and trustworthy platform by completing its smart contracts audit with SolidProof. In other words, WallitIQ helps investors make huge profits and protects their interests while at it. WallitIQ’s presale is currently selling out at lightning speed, and today could be the last chance to grab the token at the low price of $0.0243. Do not let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity pass by. With WallitIQ, the future of crypto is indeed here, but the big question is — how many will be a part of it? Dogecoin’s recent price swings leave investors unsure about its performance in 2025 Dogecoin has kept many investors on their toes because of its wild price swings. Currently, experts, including HSBC analysts, are uncertain about Dogecoin’s future in 2025. Even Dogecoin’s creator, Billy Markus, was asked about Dogecoin’s potential of an end-of-the-year peak, and his playful response was a “no idea” GIF. This perfectly captures the state of the Dogecoin’s market. Cardano mimics 2020 trend that suggests it might surge to $6 Cardano has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts as its current price movements seem to mirror its 2020 bull rally pattern. Cardano is currently trading at $0.88 and battling to hold above a key support level of $0.76, a make-or-break point for a Cardano bullish momentum. Additionally, there are comments that Cardano has the potential to surge to $6. Cardano’s 38% increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) and upcoming upgrades like the Plomin hard fork, set to happen in January, are the basis for this sentiment. Conclusion Sometimes, declaring a crypto winner may prove difficult; however, that is not the case with WallitIQ . Although Dogecoin and Cardano have a level of optimism surrounding them, WallitIQ is in a league of its own. HSBC analysts’ prediction of an astronomical rise from $0.0243 to $10 by January 1 is proof of this token’s worth. With WallitIQ’s presale closing soon, this could be the last chance to act fast. Do not hesitate on the biggest crypto opportunity ever. Interested investors should act fast to buy the token now so they can count their fortune in the new year.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/prince-elon-elonprin-solana-memecoin-to-explode-13000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38244227,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53352,1735425479,Expert Opinion On XRP Current Price Trend: “The Longer the Consolidation…”,"CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020), a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently highlighted the potential for a significant upward move in XRP’s price. A chart shared by the analyst on X illustrates XRP’s current consolidation phase. It shows a bullish pattern that often precedes a breakout. The chart captures XRP trading in a descending triangle pattern following its substantial rally in November that sent it to its highest level since 2018. CryptoBull suggests that “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the move up,” implying that the asset’s price could surge soon. This aligns with the historical behavior of cryptocurrencies, where extended consolidation phases often result in explosive moves. The chart also showed how two brief consolidation periods helped XRP reach this peak of $2.86, and the extended consolidation following that could lead to a much larger price increase. #XRP will go up soon. The longer the consolidation, the stronger the move up pic.twitter.com/OcClBNdqrL — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 26, 2024 Potential Targets for XRP CryptoBull has been optimistic about XRP’s trajectory in the past. In a recent analysis, he projected that XRP could reach a new all-time high within two weeks . That analysis also emphasized that the ongoing consolidation phase is critical, serving as a foundation for the asset’s next upward move. CryptoBull noted that the digital asset has reached its bottom for the current run, and showed a similar consolidation triangle that would cause the surge in under two weeks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further, CryptoBull has outlined a potential path for XRP to hit $6 . He argues that XRP is completing a correctional pattern, which could set the stage for a sharp price increase. The analyst has previously pointed to XRP’s ability to sustain support levels during market volatility as evidence of its long-term bullish potential. Key Technical Levels and XRP’s Future Based on the shared chart, XRP’s immediate resistance lies near the $2.9 mark, with significant support at the $2 level. A breakout above the triangle’s resistance line could validate CryptoBull’s predictions, potentially driving the price to new heights. CryptoBull’s analysis has sparked interest among XRP investors and traders. His confidence in XRP’s performance is rooted in technical analysis and historical market trends, and many other analysts support the bullish outlook for the digital asset’s immediate future. The digital asset is trading at $2.17, after a minor increase of under 1% in the past 24 hours. However, it might not be here for long, as one analyst recently reiterated a target of $27 with a detailed path to this lofty target.

38242667,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634386,1735425056,Crypto projects to receive the most venture capital funding in 2025,"Crypto venture capital funding is projected to reach $18 billion in 2025 , due to strong market fundamentals and favorable regulations . Investments will focus on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, blockchain infrastructure, AI blockchain, DeFi, Web3, privacy, and tokenization. Robert Lay, the head of PitchBook, shared his expectations for crypto projects venture capital funding in 2025 in a recent interview with CNBC’s Crypto World . Although the year 2024 has been challenging, with a decrease in funding due to various reasons, such as the collapse of major players and higher interest rates, Lay remains optimistic about the industry’s future. Reflecting on 2024, Lay said the year started strong with good funding, especially after approving a Bitcoin ETF. That renewed positive sentiment brought venture capital back into the space. However, crypto investment momentum slowed as the year progressed. “Bitcoin kind of staggered a little bit, and there wasn’t a lot of activity, especially through the summer,” Lay said, adding that the 2024 venture capital amount will come in between $11 billion and $12 billion as projected, a 10 to 20 percent surge above the 2023 mark but still far less than what the world had hoped for going forward. Crypto VC funding expected to grow in 2025 Lay turns his focus to 2025 and is optimistic because the fundamentals are strong for this crypto market. Bitcoin had already touched all-time high numbers, and a more liberalizing regulatory environment was popping out of the woodwork. He also indicated that interest rates, although high , are likely to fall and thus further improve the investors’ outlook. “We’re expecting next year to be much stronger,” he stated, p redicting that VC funding for crypto could rise to $18 billion or more in 2025, representing an increase compared to 2024. Although this figure would still fall short of the nearly $30 billion invested in 2021 and 2022, it signals a clear rebound in interest and investment. The generalist investors have been relatively absent in recent years. Lay mentions that this group is back, and large financial institutions have a major role to play in this shift, along with close coordination with regulators to establish a more stable and credible environment for crypto. As the involvement from these institutions builds , the levels of trust within crypto should increase, resulting in additional dollars transferred into the ecosystem. When questioned on which areas crypto VC funding might focus on during 2025, Lay mentioned that, unlike during the last cycle, much attention was paid toward infrastructure and speculative sectors, including NFTs and Web3. Focus on r eal-world apps predicted to rise In contrast, during the following cycle, things may tilt toward applications. Lay noted that we expect to see more investments at the application layer. This means the focus will shift from infrastructure to real-world, user-friendly applications. S uch applications could be in industries where crypto infrastructure decentralizes traditional systems, such as mobility or energy data. Lay stressed that what’s lacking is more user-friendly platforms that allow people to get into crypto without having a deep understanding of the underlying technology. He compares it to the early internet days when infrastructure like AWS was set up, but the real value came when companies like Uber and Airbnb built on it. “In crypto, the real value will come from the applications, not just the infrastructure,” he said, pointing out the potential for real-world use and growth. A project that received major attention in 2024 is the development of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, which may help scale Bitcoin and make it more useful for everyday applications. Although there was much excitement early in the year, that progress has slowed, and technical challenges have hindered the development of scalable solutions. The development has been slower than anticipated, and whether Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions will come up to the mark is yet to be seen. Better regulations expected in 2025 When asked about the role of regulation in shaping the future of crypto, Lay acknowledged that though the regulatory environment remains a major concern, the situation has improved from previous years. He believed that if no new legislation is approved in the United States for 2025, that is enough , just having less restrictive rules from the legislator side . If more detailed legislation, such as a bill on stablecoin, enters into force, that will be a tremendous lift to the industry. “If Congress does nothing, I think that’s already a benefit compared to the last two years,” Lay concluded.

In its Anti-Scam Refund Initiative end-of-year report, the company outlined how it deployed cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to transform digital asset security from reactive measures to proactive defense strategies. Anti-Scam Initiative According to the report , on average, the company processed about 80 successful fund recoveries monthly, totaling to about $9 million of stolen funds returned to victims in 2024. Additionally, it revealed that it made over 30,000 phone calls to warn potential targets of likely scams, with at least 15,000 alerts issued daily to platform users. The initiative’s efforts resulted in no less than 47,000 malicious addresses being blacklisted and, as of November, more than $129 million in annual funds prevented from being swindled. The key to Binance’s approach to stopping bad actors from stealing from its user base is a system that combines technological surveillance and human-centered support. In it, machine learning algorithms analyze complex transaction patterns in real-time, identifying potential criminal activities at super-fast speeds. It also employs AI-powered behavioral profiling to distinguish between legitimate user activity and potential illegal undertakings. The firm reported that it developed more than 50 specialized models and implemented 14 major upgrades to outmaneuver the fraudsters’ increasingly sophisticated tactics. Its Anti-Scam Refund Initiative operates through four pillars: proactive protection, 24-hour safety mechanisms, rapid response recovery, and support for silent victims. The one-day safety net allows users a cooling period for suspicious transactions, with funds moved to flagged accounts frozen to provide an opportunity for investigations and potential intervention. Binance’s Wins Over Crypto Thieves Since the beginning of the year, CryptoPotato has reported several incidents in which Binance’s intervention helped cryptocurrency users recover stolen funds. For instance, in October, the company aided Delhi police in taking down a digital asset scam ring in the city and recovering up to 100,000 USDT. Earlier in September, the exchange’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) helped authorities in the same country crack a scheme in which user funds amounting to $47.6 million were stolen from an online gaming platform and siphoned into several digital wallets. In August, the company announced that its risk management system had prevented more than $2.4 billion in losses from potential swindlers in the first half of 2024. About $1.1 billion of this was attributed to suspected criminal withdrawals, with another $73 million previously frozen due to external hacks.

Recent Tron (TRX) news underscores breakthroughs in AI technology, while Sui market analysis indicates a promising future for sustained growth. Moreover, the partnership between BlockDAG Network and Inter Milan aims to broaden its already extensive community of over 170,000 holders by integrating blockchain with global sports platforms. These developments highlight varied strategies and underline the significant impact of visibility and adoption in propelling the crypto sector forward. From Tron’s initiatives in streamlining process creation to the broadening applications of Sui and the notable milestones achieved by BlockDAG’s presale, each project sheds light on critical aspects of the blockchain environment. For those keen on the market dynamics, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a primary crypto coin to monitor closely into 2025. Tron News: Launch of AI-Driven Features The latest Tron news reveals the introduction of its inaugural AI agent on the Sun Pump platform, a pivotal development that allows for the automated generation and real-time modification of process parameters.

This integration with AI technology is designed to simplify process creation and elevate user experiences, enhancing both usability and reliability through unique identifiers for each process. Following these updates, TRX has seen a significant uptick in its market value, reaffirming its current relevance and potential growth. Sui Market Analysis: Poised to Challenge Top Contenders Recent Sui market analysis points to the potential of this blockchain to soon contend with major cryptocurrency players. Despite fluctuations in price, Sui has shown considerable growth this past year, with its total value locked significantly increasing since September. The use of the Move programming language is a key factor simplifying development on the Sui platform. The analysis of Sui’s market also highlights robust fundamentals, including escalating adoption rates and strategic partnerships, such as those with USDC and Revolut. Despite the volatile price trends, many in the trading community view Sui as possibly undervalued. Given its strong developer support and expanding practical applications, forecasts suggest Sui is on track for considerable expansion in the upcoming year. BlockDAG’s Alliance with Inter Milan Elevates Global Crypto Visibility The collaboration between BlockDAG and the iconic Italian soccer team Inter Milan has made BlockDAG a highly anticipated crypto coin to watch . This partnership has greatly increased visibility, introducing BlockDAG’s advanced blockchain technology and its potential for substantial growth to millions of soccer enthusiasts globally.

The network’s versatility extends across DeFi, gaming, and NFT sectors, providing a broad platform for developers and traders. This multimillion-dollar agreement with Inter Milan provides unique, blockchain-enhanced engagement opportunities for fans and additional benefits for BDAG holders, enhancing the appeal and success of the presale. This partnership merges cutting-edge blockchain technology with a globally renowned sports brand, enhancing overall adoption and interest among traders. In the upcoming weeks, it is anticipated to increase BlockDAG’s community of 170,000 holders, further cementing its position in the crypto presale market.

38241539,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634381,1735422636,US Treasury to hit new debt ceiling before Trump’s inauguration as the crisis worsens,"The United States is staring down the barrel of another financial crisis, with the Treasury Department confirming it will hit a new debt ceiling just days before Donald Trump returns to the White House. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sent a warning to Congress, saying the debt limit will reset to match the current $36 trillion in national debt on January 2, 2025. A small $54 billion reduction in federal trust fund securities will provide a sliver of breathing room, but that will disappear fast. By mid-January, the Treasury will be forced to use “extraordinary measures” to keep the government’s lights on. Yellen’s message was that lawmakers must act to raise or eliminate the debt ceiling, or the U.S. will face financial disaster. “I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” she wrote. But with a politically divided Capitol and tensions rising, the solution is far from clear. Interest payments are swallowing the budget If the growing national debt was a fire, interest payments would be the gasoline. In the past year alone, the U.S. spent $1.15 trillion on interest payments alone. To put it plainly, that’s more than the country spent on defense and healthcare combined—by $300 billion. Interest costs have doubled in just three years, and they’re climbing fast. At this rate, interest payments will overtake Social Security as the government’s biggest expense in the next three years. The Treasury is now America’s biggest borrower, but even it can’t keep up with the Federal Reserve’s relentless high rates. Without congressional action, the U.S. will hit its borrowing cap by January 14 to 23. After that, the government won’t be able to issue new debt, leaving it incapable of paying its bills. Federal programs like Social Security, Medicare, and even military operations could face massive funding cuts. Trump calls for a radical fix Trump broke with Republican tradition by backing the idea of eliminating the debt ceiling altogether. In his words: “The Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge.” Trump pushed for Congress to include a debt ceiling provision in its end-of-year funding bill, threatening primary challenges against Republicans who opposed him. But despite his influence, 170 Republicans defied him, leaving the debt ceiling fight for his incoming administration. The divide in Washington is as sharp as ever. Democrats argue that the debt ceiling is an outdated tool that only creates unnecessary crises. Republicans, on the other hand, see it as a bargaining chip to rein in government spending. Trump has blurred the lines, creating new tensions within his own party. The economic fallout The timing couldn’t be worse. The U.S. economy is already grappling with rising inflation, high interest rates, and slowing growth. GDP is projected to grow by 2.7% this year, but that’s expected to drop to 1.7% by 2026. Consumer spending, the backbone of the economy, has slowed to a crawl. In October, spending rose by just 0.1% month-over-month, a drop from the stronger gains earlier this year. Unemployment is creeping up too, now sitting at 4.25%. Companies are cutting back on hiring, and wage growth is slowing. The labor force participation rate is declining, leaving more Americans out of work or underemployed. Even consumer confidence is tanking. The Consumer Confidence Index fell by 8.1 points in December, signaling that Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy. Inflation, while stabilizing at around 2.3%, is still eating into household savings. Personal income rose by just 0.3% in November, and the savings rate is now at a meager 4.4%.

38240725,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667904,1735421437,"Crypto Market Remains Greedy Despite Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000, Is A Recovery Coming?","You could argue that the cryptocurrency market maintains its confidence despite the Bitcoin price experiencing a significant drop to $94,000. Although price action says otherwise, this confidence is highlighted through various predictions from crypto analysts on social media and on TradingView, which cuts across various cryptocurrencies. Amidst the price decline and market optimism, the Crypto Market Fear and Greed Index continues to point to greed, which leans toward the idea of a momentary dip before a broader recovery. Bitcoin Price Crash Stalls Bullish Momentum The crypto industry has largely exhibited bullish momentum throughout 2024, with many cryptocurrencies reaching new multi-year highs. This momentum was led by Bitcoin, which broke through its 2021 all-time high of $69,000 in the middle of 2024 to eventually break above the $100,000 psychological level for the first time on December 5. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish However, Bitcoin’s price action since crossing over the six-digit price threshold has been mostly full of corrections. Although it peaked at $108,135 on December 17, the past 12 days or so have been highlighted by price declines. Notably, Bitcoin has corrected as low as $92,600 in the past seven days, essentially leading to a cascade of declines among other cryptocurrencies and stalling the bullish momentum. Bitcoin’s descent has surprised many crypto traders, considering its strong rally in recent months. Analysts attribute this correction to profit-taking by a few long-term holders and a temporary slowdown in market activity. Crypto Market Sentiment Stays In Greed Despite recent price declines, HODLing trends suggest that the cryptocurrency market remains on track to sustain its rally into 2025. This sentiment is reflected in the Fear and Greed Index, which continues to hover in the greed zone, signaling confidence among investors. The index is derived from a combination of key metrics, including market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, Google search trends, and surveys. Each component is carefully weighted to gauge the market’s psychological state. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target At the time of writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, according to alternative.me, is at a reading of 72, which is in the Greed threshold. This relays investor confidence across the various market indicators and suggests that traders perceive the dip as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for panic. This greed sentiment is relayed through a few buying trends across notable cryptocurrencies. For example, on-chain data from crypto analytics company Santiment shows that Dogecoin whales have bought over 90 million DOGE tokens in the past 48 hours. With this in mind, analysts are optimistic about a broader market recovery in the coming weeks. Technical indicators point to a rebound led by Bitcoin if it can continue to hold above support levels around $92,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 and is down by 12.8% since it reached $108,135 on December 17. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, such corrections (between 20% and 30%) are the best thing to always happen to Bitcoin in every bull cycle.

With Hyperliquid, Solana, and Rollblock as some of the top options, those early retirement plans could turn into reality. HYPE showcases potential in decentralized finance, SOL continues to lead with its high-speed blockchain, and the new crypto RBLK is maxing out on a niche in web3 applications. This article explores why these projects could be pivotal for achieving life-changing returns in 2025. Rollblock Offers More Than 150 Profit Opportunities Rollblock merges blockchain technology with online gaming, creating a decentralized ecosystem powered by the RBLK token. The platform offers users access to games and a transparent rewards system. By leveraging blockchain’s speed and security, Rollblockensures seamless transactions and eliminates traditional barriers in online gambling. A weekly revenue-sharing model also sets Rollblock further apart. Users who stake RBLK earn a share of the platform’s weekly earnings, directly linking participation to financial returns. This model encourages user involvement and provides a consistent stream of rewards. Notably, Rollblock enhances its utility through staking bonuses of up to 30% APY and cashback rewards. To maintain token value, Rollblock integrates deflationary mechanisms such as buybacks and burns, reducing the circulating supply of RBLK over time. This approach balances demand and supply, driving long-term value appreciation. With over 150 games in its arsenal, Rollblock can easily capitalize on the hype of the iGaming industry. HYPE Hits 1,050% Price Increase in Just 25 Days Hyperliquid (HYPE) broke records in 2024 with a 1,050% price increase just 25 days after its listing on CoinMarketCap. Just like its price, HYPE’s trading volume and user adoption keep hitting new highs. Analysts are yet to figure out its price ceiling as HYPE’s price is forecasted to rise by 240% by January 25, 2025. HYPE’s unique mechanism for pooling liquidity across decentralized exchanges gives it a significant edge in the DeFi market. Its integration of AI-driven market-making and automated yield strategies enhances efficiency for traders and liquidity providers. With over $8.2 billion in market cap, HYPE could enter the top 20 cryptocurrencies in early 2025. Analysts Predict SOL Breakout Above $221 Solana (SOL) is not left out of the record-breaking. This year, SOL outperformed its biggest competitor, ETH, in on-chain activities and percentage increase in capital. With Solana’s layer-2 blockchain Sonic airdropping to select users, SOL is forecasted to retest the resistance at $198 and even cross $221 by January end. Moreover, SOL’s staking rewards and developer-friendly infrastructure continue to attract institutional and retail interest alike. With speculations of a Solana ETF approval in 2025, analysts see the potential for SOL to break its previous all-time high, making it a key asset to watch. Conclusion While SOL and HYPE have the potential to skyrocket in 2025, Rollblock provides better returns on investment as a new crypto. Through its ongoing presale, RBLK is valued at a generous rate of $0.044 each.

As 2025 approaches, these cryptos are at the forefront, transforming decentralized finance, smart contracts, and cross-border payments. But choosing from thousands of options can be daunting. It requires a smart approach to decide which cryptos to add to one's portfolio, regardless of one's familiarity with the cryptocurrency sphere. This guide highlights the top altcoins to consider by 2025, including Stellar (XLM), BlockDAG (BDAG), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Ripple (XRP). So, let’s explore the key reasons these cryptos are the best choices. BlockDAG: World’s Most Advanced Blockchain Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) leads the list as a pioneering layer-1 blockchain project, with its successful presale, which has already amassed over $173 million, making it one of the most-discussed new crypto projects.

Stellar (XLM): Streamlining Global Payments Stellar (XLM) continues to expand its blockchain ecosystem through partnerships with Paxos and Etherfuse. Known for quick transactions, low fees, multi-currency support, and a decentralized exchange, Stellar is set to improve cross-border payments. Currently priced around $0.3881, XLM is gaining traction among the top altcoins to buy now. Experts foresee a potential price rise in 2025 as Stellar’s network becomes known for efficient and accessible financial solutions, confirming its place among the top altcoins to consider for 2025. Chainlink (LINK): Secure Oracle Integration Chainlink is advancing by teaming up with entities such as Banco Inter and Microsoft to boost trade finance. Its latest venture into the zkSync ecosystem with a cross-chain interoperability protocol underscores its dedication to advancing technology, even during slow market periods. Key features of Chainlink include decentralized oracles, secure data feeds, and hybrid smart contracts that connect blockchain technology with practical, real-world data applications. These innovations position LINK as among the top altcoins crypto for 2025. Currently, LINK is priced at about $24.82, and it is anticipated to experience further growth in 2025 due to its increasing usage. Avalanche (AVAX): Rapid & Low-Cost Transactions Avalanche has seen significant developments with its latest updates, like the Avalanche9000 mainnet upgrade that cut fees by more than 90% and secured $250 million for its Layer-1 improvement. Its main attributes are high throughput, low latency, customizable subnets, and compatibility with Ethereum.

38240455,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634362,1735420504,Will the U.S. adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset for real?,"As the debate over Bitcoin’s role in global finance intensifies, questions emerge on whether the United States would adopt it as a strategic asset. Others believe that Bitcoin will eventually replace traditional reserve systems, but according to Ki Young Ju, the U.S. is far from embracing such a shift given its economic dominance and reliance on the dollar. Recently, the idea of the United States adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset has come forward, but not everybody agrees that it will happen soon. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju joined the discussion on the U.S. introducing Bitcoin into its financial plan. Ju said gold has often been presented as a solution whenever the United States felt threatened by a loss of global economic dominance. The gold price has risen as uncertainty has surrounded the U.S. economy, and the debate about going back to the gold standard never really subsided. In the 1990s, Peter Schiff argued that gold is the “true form of money,” and today, Bitcoin advocates claim that Bitcoin can replace all other forms of money. These advocates see Bitcoin as a way to achieve financial freedom and global economic stability. Despite some calls to bring back the gold standard, no effort has succeeded in doing so in the United States. Instead, the U.S. has always found other ways to handle crises and keep growing. Bitcoin is taking the place gold once held in people’s minds. According to Ki Young Ju, the future of finance is unlikely to see Bitcoin as an important player in the immediate future, though it may one day become a strategic asset for the U.S. In other words, serious consideration by the U.S. as a reserve asset will depend on a real threat to its global economic supremacy. U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade Despite the changing global economy, the U.S. stands strong, and the dollar remains the first choice of international trade. Though, at the same time, it is possible that the U.S. may be using Bitcoin as a sort of backup for the dollar or to gain economic benefit, Ju points out that the reasons behind such a step would likely be very far from what Bitcoin supporters could imagine. Ju’s skepticism towards the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset is mainly because the country still relies on the dollar. With capital flowing to the U.S. from anywhere worldwide, money is still pouring into dollar accounts. This is even as Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies rise to unparalleled heights, and many folks see the dollar as at least a better store of value than all of that stuff. Examples are countries such as South Korea, which for years have been opting to store U.S. dollars instead of Bitcoin or gold as their currencies, the Korean won, continue to decline. This proves that at least the U.S. dollar will remain a reserve currency for the future. However, there are emerging voices across the U.S. calling for a course change in its monetary policy, and even President-elect Donald Trump has been quoted as supporting Bitcoin, with public statements made valuing the virtual currency during his presidential run. As Ju points out, things could change, especially with bigger policy issues ahead. The U.S. might still buy Bitcoin to strengthen its economy or manage risks. However, Ju believes it’s unlikely that the U.S. will treat Bitcoin as a core reserve asset, as some Bitcoin supporters hope. Instead, he would be far more concerned with the diversification of schemes rather than considering Bitcoin a core base of the financial systems of the government. Ju’s analysis holds true for the fact that most governments have yet to adopt Bitcoin. While nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted Bitcoin within their respective economies, nations like Japan could not consider Bitcoin to be added as a national reserve. Instead, Japan has strengthened its economy by using more traditional approaches than risking its exploration with Bitcoin. This is because it cannot take a risk with the volatility of Bitcoin and the uncertainty it carries as to its long-term value as a stable asset. Companies lead Bitcoin adoption On the other hand, private companies have been much faster in adapting to the idea of Bitcoin in their financial strategy. Big firms such as MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and RIOT Platforms continue to buy Bitcoin steadily. These companies buy Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and to diversify their investments. These firms have steadily accumulated substantial Bitcoin holdings, reflecting a growing shift in how institutional investors perceive and value cryptocurrency as a key asset. Companies such as Metaplanet, for instance, recently bought more than 600 Bitcoin, adding to their reserves, now at almost 1,800 BTC. This is why more people in private firms may embrace it, but the U.S. government is more hesitant. The U.S. may look into a reserve of Bitcoin in the long run. Still, it will remain one of the assets that the individual investors and companies would hold onto rather than a vital component of the U.S. government’s financial plan. Though the surge in popularity and adoption of Bitcoin is undeniable, it appears that the U.S. will not immediately make Bitcoin a strategic asset. The dollar remains dominant and the U.S. holds a strong position in the global economy, making it hard to argue for an immediate shift towards Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, as the maturing of the cryptocurrency market and more institutions and private firms invest in Bitcoin, the U.S. government might reassess its position. For now, Bitcoin is a niche asset and not a mainstream reserve currency for the U.S. Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-u-s-adopt-bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38240455.jpeg

The leading crypto asset price has been unstable for the past two weeks, trading sideways. Currently, it is trading at around $95,114, showing a 1.16% drop in just 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. Analytics firms are taking notice, with some even predicting a crash might be on the horizon. Bitcoin’s Path Stirs Market Worries Analysts like IT Tech from Cryptoquant have recently pointed out that certain market indicators suggest a shift might be coming soon. One key indicator is Bitcoin’s spot exchange reserves, which had declined for a while but recently increased. In a short time, 20,000 BTC were moved onto exchanges, meaning investors may be getting ready to trade or sell their Bitcoin. This movement can create selling pressure, which could lead to a drop in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin’s reserves on exchanges are not just rising; the overall flow of Bitcoin into exchanges has also increased. Recently, 15,800 BTC entered exchanges, reversing the trend of more Bitcoin being withdrawn than deposited. This shift is called a positive netflow, often showing investors preparing to trade or sell their Bitcoin. When reserves go up, and netflows turn positive, investors might plan to take profits or expect Bitcoin’s price to drop soon. These combined signals hint at a possible change in the market. Bitcoin Whales and Retail Traders Shows Caution Alike Bitcoin’s recent market trends do not just reflect the actions of retail traders. Bitcoin whale holders are also making moves . Over the past week, the amount of Bitcoin these whales sent to exchanges increased significantly, with the exchange netflow rising from -0.04% to 0.27%. This means more of their Bitcoin is being moved onto exchanges. This trend often signals upcoming selling and a shift toward bearish sentiment. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s NVT (Network Value to Transaction) ratio is a key indicator to track the asset’s price trajectory. This has recently jumped to a noticeable 1010.02. The NVT ratio measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s market cap and its daily transaction volume. A spike in the NVT ratio means Bitcoin’s price is rising faster than network usage. This often signals a price correction ahead as the market realigns. With these signs of caution, Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is uncertain. If reserves keep rising and netflows remain positive, the market could see more volatility and selling pressure, possibly lowering Bitcoin’s price. Support levels are crucial. If Bitcoin drops below $92,700, it could fall to $86,000. Market sentiment is changing, and a correction may be near. Investors are advised to watch closely for potential volatility ahead.

While BTC and the altcoin market continue to struggle, Solana memecoin Husky Inu (HINU) generated over $680,000 in its presale. Bitcoin Loses Steam Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) recently reached a high of 60.1% but has declined to around 50%. While a decline in BTC’s dominance was expected, a surge in altcoins was also expected. The past time has, however, revealed that the crypto market at large is losing steam, but top altcoins are stepping up to claim their share of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Dominance measures BTC's relative share or dominance in the overall crypto sector. This measure represents the percentage of Bitcoin’s total market cap compared to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. Bitcoin currently trades for $94,916 – representing a weekly loss of over 2.6%. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE), the top memecoin by market cap, exploded after Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. DOGE ranks as the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $47.4 billion, and further gains are expected in the coming months. DOGE quickly rose through the ranks to become a household name in the crypto industry, owing its success to a strong community spurred by the involvement and endorsement of Elon Musk. The tech mogul is the world’s richest man, CEO of Tesla, and owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk joined the Trump campaign, playing an integral role in the president-elect’s victory, and his involvement with the party could see DOGE run to new heights as the Trump administration comes into power. DOGE’s value stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement naming Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as the leads of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $13 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 108%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Likely to Benefit on Timing Market onlookers and crypto enthusiasts reacted positively to the end of Gary Gensler’s brutal and belligerent regime. Under Gensler, several large crypto firms and prominent industry figures faced regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action, which drove many to seek refuge off US shores. Donald Trump won the hearts of a large part of the industry with a promise to make the US the world’s crypto capital, and the relief brought by this promise is reflected in current market behaviour. The renewed optimism toward digital assets will likely benefit new projects as investors regain trust and confidence in the industry. Husky Inu (HINU), the latest memecoin sensation from the Solana network, will surely reap the rewards of industry news. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $686,000, with numbers expected to rise rapidly as the crypto market explodes. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

As the XRP price starts on this trajectory, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival’s staggering leap from $0.0243 to $100 further fuels the race for dominance. With its groundwork laid, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale presents the next wave of opportunities for proactive investors. The XRP Price Eyes $1,000, But WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) $100 Target Attracts Investors The XRP price is making headlines in an impending revolution in the crypto landscape. According to an insider with strong connections to the XRP price, this altcoin is on an extraordinary path toward a $1,000 valuation in this market cycle. The insider pointed out that the landmark court victory against the SEC earlier this year has set a remarkable pace for the XRP price, establishing momentum like never before. With regulatory clarity affirming its status, the XRP price emerged as a beacon of legitimacy in a market that craves trust. Moreover, the insider’s roadmap reveals that expanding partnerships with major financial institutions is the cornerstone of this ambitious trajectory of the XRP price. According to the insider, the XRP price’s recent integration with the European Central Bank’s digital euro project signals the XRP price rising role as the backbone of global payment infrastructure. However, the fame of the Ripple rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has risen over this insider’s lofty projection. For a token valued at $0.0243, a rally to $100 will deliver over a 400,000% rally — a move that will make thousands of investors crypto millionaires. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, many investors believe WallitIQ (WLTQ) can realistically reach $100, leading to a total market capitalization of $100 billion. In contrast, the insider’s roadmap indicates that the XRP price could attain a staggering $57 trillion market cap upon hitting $1,000. This assumption would be faulty, as a valuation that size is larger than the entire cryptocurrency market. Moreover, investors are keen on the Ripple rival WallitIQ (WLTQ) because 20% of its tokenomics is allocated to rewarding early adopters and active investors. The previous presale stage sold out quickly, and the current stage is now over 90% sold out within just a few days, raising more than $3 million. Investors who have eyes on this Ripple rival have set their sights on a fortune that only decisive action will deliver. As such, they are investing in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival now as the surefire path to financial freedom. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Innovative Edge In The Crypto Market Any token targeting a 400,000% increase must have expansive innovation to back its ascent. One of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) extraordinary features is its AI smart suggestions. This tool empowers investors to maximize profitability through strategic portfolio rebalancing and insights into optimal trading times. Similarly, the provision of learning materials helps investors find the documentation needed to learn the intricacies of DeFi. With this knowledge, investors continue to refine their strategies to stay relevant in the market. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has bolstered investor confidence by completing a smart contract audit with SolidProof , a leading auditing firm, confirming that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is free from vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. Conclusion The insider’s roadmap paints a promising picture for the XRP price, positioning it to reach $1,000 in this market cycle. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is investors’ preferred investment path. As a Ripple rival, this AI coin is poised to thrive amid growing interest in the AI sector. To be part of this wealth creation, investors must realize that they must beat time and thousands of other investors looking to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival token. In the race, fortune favors only the swift and decisive who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) now at $0.0243 .

On the social media platform X, Glassnode examines the Realized Cap metric, which records the price at which each coin was last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss. The firm points out the monthly percent change in realized cap for each of the three assets. “This metric acts as an indicator of the rate and direction of capital inflows or outflows for these assets. During the recent market downtrend, the monthly rate of change in Realized Cap for SOL has plunged below both BTC and ETH. This indicates a faster decline in momentum for Solana compared to the other two assets. Current monthly Realized Cap Change (%/30D): • BTC: +10.87% • ETH: +5.43% • SOL: +2.19%.” Source: Glassnode/X But Glassnode noted earlier this week that Solana has maintained a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023, with only minor periods of outflow. “This sustained influx of liquidity has assisted in stimulating growth and price appreciation, achieving a remarkable peak inflow of $776 million of new capital per day.” SOL is trading at $186.12 at time of writing.

Leakd also says that the party responsible may have launched a deliberate data-harvesting campaign after discovering many instances involving “too-good-to-be-true” promotional offers. “The leaked screenshots often featured instances of users entering personal and financial details into seemingly innocent promotional forms. These offers, promising rewards like a free iPhone 14 or heavily discounted items, were just traps.

Over the past few days, DOGE has experienced a significant drop, but recent consolidation, continuous accumulation by whales, and a shift in market sentiment might be driving potential upside momentum. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Break $0.36? Key Levels to Watch Amid market uncertainty and ongoing consolidation, DOGE has formed a descending triangle pattern on the four-hour timeframe and is poised for a breakout. DOGE Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, if the meme coin breaches this pattern and closes a candle above the $0.327 mark on the same timeframe, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 11% to reach $0.36 in the near future. Source: Trading View However, this speculation is based on a short timeframe and could appear in the coming days. On the daily timeframe, DOGE appears to be consolidating within a tight range below the crucial support level of $0.36. Based on recent price action, if DOGE breaks out of this narrow zone and closes a daily candle above the $0.36 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach $0.465 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Whales Accumulate 90 Million DOGE Amid this ongoing consolidation, whales have demonstrated strong interest and confidence in the meme coin. According to a prominent crypto expert’s post on X (formerly Twitter), whales have purchased a significant 90 million DOGE tokens.

38239919,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634366,1735419318,AI’s energy demand leaves millions of US homes power-starved,"America’s love affair with artificial intelligence comes with a bill far bigger than anyone expected. Reportedly, AI is draining the country’s electricity like a high-tech vampire. As data centers multiply, guzzling more power than entire cities, millions of homes are getting hit with distorted power flows that wreak havoc on their appliances and jack up fire risks. “Bad harmonics” is the name of this nightmare. Normally, electricity flows smoothly, like ocean waves. But when AI-fueled data centers crank up their demands, those waves turn chaotic, destabilizing everything downstream. Think of it as a speaker blaring music so loudly it fries itself. That’s what’s happening to America’s power grid. Refrigerators start rattling, air conditioners overheat, and sparks can fly—literally. Whisker Labs, a company tracking power quality with one million sensors across U.S. homes, has reportedly uncovered a grim reality. The closer a home is to a data center, the worse the distortions. More than half of the homes with the worst power quality issues sit within 20 miles of a data center. That’s 3.7 million Americans caught in the crossfire of the AI boom. Data centers are turning the grid into a ticking time bomb Experts have been sounding the alarm about the impact of data centers for years, but AI has put this problem on steroids. These facilities are popping up like mushrooms, each demanding as much electricity as 10,000 homes. But the grid wasn’t built for this kind of pressure. The AI frenzy has turned Northern Virginia into ground zero. Dubbed “data center alley,” the region now holds 3,000 megawatts of data center capacity—double that of Beijing, its closest competitor. The power demands are so massive that Dominion Energy, the utility serving much of the area, is scrambling to build a new transmission line just to keep the lights on. In Prince William County, sensors installed in homes within seven miles of data centers showed alarming distortion levels. The report says nearly 6% of these homes reported power quality so bad it risks frying appliances. Some readings spiked as high as 12.9%, way beyond the 8% threshold where equipment starts failing. Meanwhile, York County, 80 miles from the nearest major data center, reported steady, low distortion levels. The connection is undeniable. AI is pushing America to the brink America’s grid was already hanging by a thread before AI came into the picture. Decades of underinvestment in infrastructure mean the system is aging and fragile. Now, electricity demand is set to spike by 16% over the next five years, with AI-driven data centers driving most of the growth. This isn’t just a city problem either. Even rural areas near data centers are seeing distorted power flows. A Bloomberg analysis showed that homes close to data centers had way worse power quality, even if they were in low-density areas. Bad harmonics also lead to billions of dollars in equipment failures, repairs, and lost productivity. It’s a slow bleed that’s adding up fast. Utilities like Dominion Energy and Exelon’s Commonwealth Edison are trying to downplay the issue. Dominion claims its systems are within industry standards, while ComEd outright disputes Whisker Labs’ findings. But here’s the problem, utilities often rely on outdated measurement tools that miss the granular, home-level data captured by Whisker Labs. So while utilities say everything is fine, residents are dealing with flickering lights, blown-out appliances, and rising repair bills.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

With major CEX and DEX listings on the horizon, audited smart contracts ensuring security, and a fully vetted team leading the charge, XYZVerse is setting itself apart as a first-mover in this space. The presale could be the chance to join before the market shifts — and the crowd storms in. This winter, XYZVerse is more than just another altcoin; it’s the top contender for investors seeking promising returns. Don’t miss the chance to secure a spot in what’s shaping up to be one of the hottest crypto opportunities of the season. Ethereum Ethereum has been a game-changer in the world of blockchain since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. Known for enabling smart contracts and hosting a wide array of decentralized apps (dApps), it has paved the way for innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used for various purposes, including governance and value storage. Even with these tokens, ETH is still needed for transaction fees. The shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 made the network more efficient. Upcoming features like sharding are set to improve speed and reduce costs, showing Ethereum’s dedication to growth and decentralization. Ether (ETH) remains at the core of this ecosystem, powering transactions and rewarding those who help maintain the network. Looking at past price trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles, predictions suggest that ETH could hit a low of $2,700.31 in 2025 and might reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. In today’s market, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades and its key role in DeFi and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. Its continuous innovation and strong community support position it well for the future, making it an intriguing option in the current market cycle. Solana Solana is making waves in the blockchain world. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana focuses on speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Developers appreciate its flexibility, as it supports multiple programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just another coin; it’s the fuel that powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is significant. Since it underpins the entire Solana ecosystem, its value is tied to the network’s success. Solana avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it has built a high-capacity network capable of handling lots of activity. This approach makes it attractive to developers and investors looking for speed and efficiency. In the current market cycle, SOL stands out due to its technology and growth potential. As more projects choose Solana for its performance advantages, SOL could see increased demand compared to other coins. Ethena In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Ethena introduces ENA – a synthetic dollar built on Ethereum. Unlike traditional stablecoins tied to bank reserves, ENA offers a crypto-native solution that doesn’t rely on banks. This innovation ensures greater decentralization and brings to life the ‘Internet Bond’, a global dollar savings tool. By using Ethereum’s blockchain, ENA aims to provide stability and easy access, making digital transactions smoother and more reliable. Right now, ENA looks like an attractive option for those seeking stability in the volatile crypto market. With worries about fiat-backed stablecoins and regulatory hurdles facing other cryptocurrencies, ENA’s approach stands out. It offers a decentralized alternative that’s independent of traditional finance, which could be appealing in uncertain times. Compared to coins like Tether or USDC, which depend on reserves held by banks, ENA’s synthetic method may offer more transparency and strength. As the crypto market grows up, innovations like ENA could lead the way to a more stable and accessible digital economy. Ondo Ondo Finance is reshaping the way we think about investing. It combines the stability of traditional finance with the speed and transparency of blockchain technology. By turning stable, income-generating real-world assets into tokens, Ondo opens the door for more people to access high-quality financial products. Its unique approach uses blockchain to make financial systems more efficient and accessible. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products, and a technology arm that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Together, they enhance the functionality and scalability of Ondo’s offerings. In a market often plagued by volatility and mistrust, Ondo stands out by prioritizing security and transparency. It partners with well-known firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for safe crypto asset custody. Products like USDY showcase Ondo’s commitment to quality. USDY offers the ease of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits. For non-U.S. investors seeking regulated and transparent financial products, Ondo presents an attractive option. While the crypto market cycles through ups and downs, Ondo’s focus on real-world assets and compliance could give it an edge over other coins. Its blend of traditional finance with blockchain might make it a strong contender in the current market landscape. Conclusion ETH, SOL, ENA, and ONDO are promising, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport meme coin, offers a unique opportunity for early adopters in the 2024 bull run.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As SOL slows down, analysts recommend Remittix and Hedera for major gains, with RTX predicted to surge 25x in Q1 2025. Table of Contents Solana forms bullish pattern to extend rally Remittix ICO tracked by investors for 25x return in q1 2025 Hedera set for massive increase Which is the best crypto to buy for q1 gains: HBAR or RTX? In the 2024 bull run, SOL has been one of the top altcoins, with its rally of more than 160% to an ATH of $264. In recent weeks, the price of Solana has slowed down, which is why top analysts have identified Remittix (RTX) and Hedera (HBAR) as two of the best altcoins to invest in for huge gains in Q1 2025. WorldOfCharts has predicted that HBAR could increase by 40-50% while RTX could lead the way with a 25x price pump. Before looking at how much gains you could make from RTX and HBAR in Q1 2025, how high do experts think SOL can go? You might also like: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Solana forms bullish pattern to extend rally Since the Solana coin set an all-time high of $264, the altcoin has been on a decline, dropping as low as $180. However, SOL has bounced back to the $200 level, CoinMarketCap’s info shows. The bounce comes amidst a new ATH in daily transactions, per Artemis . The surge in activity was fueled by an increase in memecoin on the Solana network. Captain Faibik said , “The rebound has also confirmed a breakout and retest of the bullish pennant on the weekly Solana price chart.” Due to this strong rebound, Faibik suggests that the Solana price could head firmly towards $400 before th8e end of Q1 2025. However, the Solana altcoin price would need to defend the $200 support level for this bullish prediction. Remittix ICO tracked by investors for 25x return in q1 2025 Highlighted by top financial experts as one of the best cryptos to buy heading into 2025, Remittix has been on the radar of investors. In the last week, the presale has raised over $500,000 from investors as they believe the RTX coin could skyrocket by 25x in Q1 2025. Remittix has gained much traction because of its unique solution to the problem of the $190 trillion global cross-border payment market. Remittix is addressing issues concerning speed to documentation, high fees, and many more. On Remittix, users can accept 50+ crypto pairs, which they can convert to 30+ fiat currencies. Local payment networks have also been incorporated into Remittix which means that users can send the fiat to bank accounts and receive them on the same day. The use of Remittix in providing a real-life solution to crypto to fiat payments will enhance a massive adoption of the DeFi coin, RTX. This could create a massive surge of funds into the DeFi project. As a result, the DeFi coin has even greater prospects than SOL in Q1. While it is priced at $0.0163 in presale, analysts believe it will not have any difficulty outshining even the top 10 altcoins in gains over the coming months especially under a pro-crypto administration once Trump’s team takes The White House. Hedera set for massive increase Between November and the first week of December, Hedera was one of the best-performing altcoins in the market. According to CoinMarketCap , the price of the Hedera coin increased from $0.040 to peak trade above $0.360. However, the hot rally has cooled off, with Hedera dropping back to the $0.3100 support. Despite the decline, Jesus Martinez has reported that the Hedera crypto is the number one trending crypto globally. There are also rumors that Apple could join Hedera’s governing council in Q1 2025. Top crypto analyst, WorldOfCharts1 has said that Hedera has broken another bullish flag consolidation. Based on his analysis, the Hedera price could rally by 40-50% in the coming days. However, it could gain even more if the Apple partnership is confirmed. Which is the best crypto to buy for q1 gains: HBAR or RTX? As we head into Q1 2025, the spotlight is shifting from Solana to the likes of Hedera and Remittix . While HBAR could see an increase of 50% or more in the case of Apple joining its team, analysts believe RTX could skyrocket by up to 25x because of its utility in a multi-trillion-dollar market.

Pompliano argued that Bitcoin's rarity and positioning as “digital real estate” make it a vital asset for nations and institutions alike. Pompliano noted the limited supply of 21 million coins, saying: “Owning Bitcoin is like owning a strategic physical asset, but in the digital world. This is digital gold, and the US must decide whether it wants to lead or lag behind other nations that are already accumulating Bitcoin.” The discussion also touched on the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the U.S. government. Pompliano noted that many members of the current administration, including President Trump and Senator J.D. Vance, own Bitcoin or other crypto assets, indicating a potential policy shift toward greater adoption. “We are seeing crypto mature and integrate into the traditional financial system. Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset; it is becoming a fundamental part of the conversation about free markets and capitalism,” he said. Related News: Veteran Analyst il Capo Reveals He's Buying More of This Altcoin After Today's Rally When asked about Bitcoin’s volatility and whether it’s a solid investment at current levels, Pompliano drew parallels to historical market trends, such as the early days of investing in the S&P 500. “The best time to buy Bitcoin was yesterday. The second best time is today. Waiting will make it even harder as the dollar continues to depreciate,” he said. Pompliano also touched on Bitcoin’s positioning compared to other cryptocurrencies, especially with the approval of Ethereum ETFs and the increasing diversity in the crypto market. Despite these developments, he said, “Bitcoin is king and will remain king. Most of the capital flows from traditional finance are directed to Bitcoin because it represents stability and purchasing power preservation.” On the geopolitical front, Pompliano said the U.S. risks falling behind if it does not consider creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Noting that many countries are already mining and purchasing Bitcoin, Pompliano suggested that America’s position as a global leader could be in jeopardy if proactive measures are not taken. As for his price predictions, Pompliano refrained from specifying specific targets but expressed unwavering optimism: “With or without Bitcoin reserves, the price will go higher. The real story of 2025 will be how BTC and crypto mature and become an integral part of the global financial system.” *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, Bitget Token’s market cap is nearing $8 billion, boosted by Gen Z investors and political endorsements, highlighting its growing appeal. Turning to BlockDAG (BDAG) , this coin has quickly become the centre of attention with its innovative technology. As the mainnet audit progresses, excitement builds around its 2025 launch, drawing big daily contributions from whales, who are pushing its presale past $173 million and closer to the $600 million target. BlockDAG’s advanced technology and innovative capabilities set new standards, promising potentially massive returns and making it an enticing option for those looking for the best crypto to buy today. VeChain’s Price Prediction: Market Outlook The latest VeChain price prediction suggests a 30% rise to $0.086 by the first quarter of 2025, as noted by CoinCodex. This marks a steady growth from its current $0.066, showing potential for modest gains. VeChain has recently seen a 250% increase, drawing attention with significant trading volume and highlighting strong buyer interest. Although VeChain’s price prediction remains optimistic for short-term growth, achieving the $1 mark would require a substantial surge of 1,450%. Current market conditions seem unsupportive of such a dramatic increase. Despite this, the ongoing positive sentiment and active trading enhance the VeChain price prediction prospects in the crypto market. Gen Z Boosts Bitget Token (BGB) Market Cap As political promises energize the cryptocurrency market, the Bitget token (BGB) market cap has soared, nearing the $8 billion mark. This growth is notably driven by an influx of Gen Z users, whose participation spiked significantly in November. Their surge in numbers reflects a broader trend as more young investors are drawn to platforms like Bitget after recent political endorsements of crypto. The Bitget token now stands at $5.64, marking a 15% increase in just 24 hours. This uptick has contributed to the growing Bitget token (BGB) market cap, underlining the platform’s rising popularity among younger demographics eager for financial autonomy through digital assets. Whales Driving BlockDAG Towards Its $600M Presale Target BlockDAG is making waves in the crypto market, as it gears up for its big mainnet launch set for 2025. Right now, it’s in the audit phase and analysts say it is the best crypto to buy right now as it’s showing great promise to soar in the blockchain world. Known as a hub for meme coins, BlockDAG also shines with its low-code and no-code platform. This feature makes it super easy for anyone to develop tokens and decentralized apps, even if they don’t have much coding experience. Plus, BlockDAG works well with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), giving developers the freedom to use different programming languages. This flexibility is a big win for creating and deploying meme coins, attracting a wide range of developers. Thanks to these top-notch capabilities, BlockDAG is raising the bar, making it easier for folks from all walks of life to dive into the blockchain world, which boosts demand. With its growing popularity, BlockDAG’s presale numbers are shooting up, reaching $173 million so far. Whales are dropping up to $5 million in a single day, which shows that BDAG is on track to hit its $600 million target for the presale. Those who got in early are now enjoying returns of up to 2240%, and analysts predict a staggering 20,000X ROI in the not-too-distant future. With BDAG’s price at just $0.0234 and climbing, now is the perfect time to get in. As the price increases with each batch, the window to cash in on that 20,000x ROI is narrowing, positioning BDAG as the best crypto to buy today . Final Verdict VeChain’s price prediction points towards a 30% increase, setting the stage for a promising uptick to $0.086 by early 2025. This reflects a vibrant and growing interest from traders. Meanwhile, the Bitget token market cap is approaching a notable $8 billion, demonstrating its increasing allure among investors. But crypto enthusiasts and whales are increasingly turning towards BlockDAG — the new emerging star in the crypto space. With its advanced technology and increasing demand, BlockDAG’s presale has gone beyond $173 million in its presale.

One of the best things about Bitcoin is its decentralized nature. As Wall Street behemoths such as BlackRock begin to dip their toes in, fears of centralization start to fill the air. Kiyosaki does not trust these institutions. He believes they may end up gaining too much influence over the crypto market. This would shift Bitcoin from its original appeal as “people’s money.” With such concerns, institutional interest still may drive up demand. If the market perceives Bitcoin as a “safe bet” due to BlackRock and others, its price may skyrocket. However, the potential downside—the loss of the power of decentralization—cannot be disregarded. The Road To 2025 Will Bitcoin hit $350,000 by 2025? Opinions remain divided. The crypto market is famously unpredictable, driven by factors like investor sentiment, regulation, and global economic conditions. Kiyosaki’s bullish stance appeals to those who see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. But others argue that market manipulation and regulatory scrutiny could keep prices in check.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As staking grows in crypto, Lightchain AI’s unique model offers better returns than XRP, with its presale now live for early adopters. Table of Contents Case for XRP transactional giant with price potential Staking Lightchain AI passive income meets innovation Comparing the strategies: XRP vs. Lightchain AI staking Long-term wealth potential Smarter wealth strategy As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, staking has become a go-to strategy for investors looking to grow their wealth while supporting network security. While XRP , widely known for facilitating cross-border payments, offers potential for price appreciation, Lightchain AI (LCAI) provides an even more compelling opportunity for wealth generation. With its unique staking model and advanced blockchain infrastructure, Lightchain AI stands out as a smarter choice for long-term investment. Plus, the Lightchain AI presale is now live, offering early adopters an exclusive chance to get involved.. Here’s why staking Lightchain AI could deliver greater returns compared to just holding XRP. You might also like: Paradigm shift: XRP holders eye Lightchain AI for future investment Case for XRP transactional giant with price potential XRP is a known coin that helps Ripple’s pay͏ system, letting quick and cheap swaps between countries. Over the years, it has got broad use among money firms, placing itself as a leader in the world cash sector. Many buyers keep XRP for many reasons. Its use in money markets is a main mover as Ripple’s ties with banks and payment givers boost XRP’s real-world help. Also, as a big altcoin, XRP is known for its price ups and downs which can give chances for quick profits. Its large market value and trading amount also make XRP a very liquid asset, attractive to buyers. But, while XRP’s good points are in its use and cash flow; having it is mostly linked to price rise, giving few choices for making easy money. Staking Lightchain AI passive income meets innovation Lightchain AI introduces a unique ecosystem that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence. By staking LCAI tokens, investors not only earn rewards but also contribute to the advancement of AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). This dual benefit — passive income and active participation in an innovative ecosystem—sets Lightchain AI apart. Why staking Lightchain AI is a smarter wealth strategy Proof of Intelligence (PoI) : Lightchain AI’s unique consensus mechanism rewards network participants for performing AI computations, creating an eco-friendly and productive staking model. Deflationary Tokenomics: A portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing the total supply over time and increasing the value of staked tokens. Passive Income Opportunities: Stakers earn consistent rewards, growing their holdings without relying solely on market speculation. Utility-Driven Growth: By supporting real-world applications in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance, Lightchain AI ensures sustainable demand for LCAI tokens. Staking provides a more dynamic approach to wealth generation compared to holding XRP, which depends on market performance and adoption in the payments sector. Comparing the strategies: XRP vs. Lightchain AI staking Feature Holding XRP Staking Lightchain AI (LCAI) Primary Benefit Potential price appreciation Passive income + network contributions Utility Cross-border payments AI-powered dApps across industries Token Supply Fixed supply Deflationary through token burning Passive Income None Regular staking rewards Market Dependence High Moderate While XRP offers exposure to Ripple’s payment network, staking Lightchain AI provides a steady income stream alongside the potential for token value appreciation driven by its innovative ecosystem. Long-term wealth potential Staking Lightchain AI combines the benefits of passive income, deflationary economics, and participation in a unique project. As the demand for AI-driven blockchain applications grows, the utility of LCAI tokens will likely increase, driving both staking rewards and price appreciation. In contrast, XRP’s growth is tied to its adoption in the financial sector, making it more susceptible to external factors like regulatory scrutiny and competition. While XRP offers liquidity and short-term trading opportunities, it lacks the wealth-building capabilities of a staking model. Also, Lightchain AI is still in its early stages, giving stakers an opportunity to get in at a lower price and potentially earn higher rewards as the project gains momentum. Smarter wealth strategy For investors seeking to maximize their returns, staking Lightchain AI offers a more comprehensive wealth strategy compared to holding XRP. By providing passive income, deflationary tokenomics, and exposure to AI-powered innovation, Lightchain AI positions itself as a forward-looking choice for long-term financial growth. So, it is clear that staking Lightchain AI provides a smarter wealth strategy compared to just holding XRP. It offers investors the potential for steady passive income, deflationary tokenomics, and exposure to a creativeecosystem with real-world applications. With its presale currently live, investors have the opportunity to get involved early and potentially earn higher rewards as the project grows.

38237832,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314415,1735415147,Crypto Stakeholders Protest As U.S. Treasury Department and IRS Finalize New DeFi Broker Reporting Rule,"Crypto stakeholders are protesting as the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) finalize new reporting rules for decentralized finance (DeFi) brokers. According to a new press release by the Treasury Department, while the new rules don’t add any taxes on crypto assets, they require DeFi brokers to report on the gross proceeds of sales of their digital assets, making them follow the same rule as traditional securities brokers. The rule also means that owners of digital assets who engage in DeFi transactions will receive the same form as well from their broker. Aviva Aron-Dine, the Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, says in the press release that the new rule will help taxpayers be compliant. “These regulations will help ensure that all taxpayers play by the same set of rules and have access to the information they need to file their taxes accurately. Aligning tax reporting requirements for digital assets with reporting for other assets will make filing easier and cheaper for compliant taxpayers while also helping close the tax gap.” In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Kirstin Smith, the chief executive of the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association, says that the move is the Biden Administration’s last-ditch effort to hurt the industry before pro-crypto politicians take power. “Today’s broker rulemaking by the IRS and Treasury – days before the end of the year – is a disappointing, but expected, final attempt to send the American crypto industry offshore. On behalf of the industry, we’re prepared to take aggressive action to fight back. We also look forward to working with the new pro-crypto Congress and Administration to roll back this and other anti-innovation rules.” Prominent crypto lawyer Jake Chervinksy also took to X, saying that the decision is “unlawful” and should be reversed. “IRS has finalized the second half of its broker rule, requiring most DeFi front-ends to KYC (know your customer) users starting in 2027. This unlawful rule is the dying gasp of the anti-crypto army on its way out of power. It must be struck down, either by the courts or the incoming administration.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

38237783,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376330,1735415086,"Meme Coin Trends Surge in 2024, Capturing 30% of Investor Attention Across Crypto","2024 saw massive gains for the crypto market, but meme coins dominated the narrative. Owing to its notable resurgence, several meme coins even emerged as some of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the year, contributing to the rise of new crypto millionaires along the way. Speculative Meme Coins Take Over Crypto According to CoinGecko’s report , meme coins captured more than 30% of the global investor interest, which was distributed across the central niche narrative and 25 different trends related to them. This suggests that nearly one-third of the focus in crypto was on speculative investments, where fundamentals took a back seat, with the market rapidly diversifying from dog-themed coins to other meme tokens inspired by animals and public figures. The primary meme coin narrative itself emerged as the most popular, accounting for 14.36% of total crypto narrative interest, reflecting a considerable 6.04 percentage point rise from last year’s 8.32%. Aside from the overarching meme coin category, other specific trends also gained attention. Solana-based meme tokens secured 4th place with 7.65% of the narrative interest, while Coinbase-incubated Ethereum Layer 2 Base assets ranked 11th at 2.13%. Meanwhile, AI-themed and cat-centric meme coins rounded out the top 20, with 1.49% and 1.19% of interest, respectively. AI, RWA, DePIN Trails Behind The artificial intelligence (AI) narrative was another prominent topic in the crypto market in 2024, attracting a total of 15.67% of investor interest across the general AI narrative and five other AI-related sub-trends. The main AI narrative ranked second overall, holding 12.58% of investor attention. While this represented a 1.26 percentage point increase from last year’s 11.32%, it was still overshadowed by the meme coin narrative in terms of popularity. The real-world assets (RWA) and DePIN narratives were among the most notable trends to experience a surge in interest in 2024 compared to the previous year. The RWA narrative saw its share of investor focus rise by 2.16 percentage points, from 6.48% in 2023 to 8.64% in 2024, which also boosted its ranking from 6th to 3rd. Similarly, the DePIN narrative saw a positive shift, with its share of interest growing by 1.56 percentage points, allowing it to climb from 13th to 8th place. On the other hand, the GameFi narrative faced a decline in popularity, as its share dropped by 6.77 percentage points, from 10.49% in 2023 to 3.72% in 2024.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/prince-elon-elonprin-solana-memecoin-to-explode-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

As the crypto market evolves toward 2025, this altcoin is set to capitalize on its first-mover advantage and deliver significant returns for its investors. Solana Solana is making waves in the blockchain world. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana focuses on speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Developers appreciate its flexibility, as it supports multiple programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just another coin; it’s the fuel that powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is significant. Since it underpins the entire Solana ecosystem, its value is tied to the network’s success. Solana avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it has built a high-capacity network capable of handling lots of activity. This approach makes it attractive to developers and investors looking for speed and efficiency. In the current market cycle, SOL stands out due to its technology and growth potential. As more projects choose Solana for its performance advantages, SOL could see increased demand compared to other coins. Dogwifhat Dogwifhat (WIF) is capturing attention as the newest dog-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this coin brings a playful spirit to the crypto community. Meme coins like WIF thrive on community engagement and the fun they bring to the market. Being on Solana means WIF benefits from fast transaction speeds and lower fees, making it accessible to a wider audience. In today’s market, meme coins are gaining traction, and WIF stands out with its unique origin and technology. While coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, WIF offers something fresh on a modern blockchain platform. The current trend shows a growing interest in community-driven projects, and WIF fits right in. Its potential lies in its vibrant community and the efficiency of Solana’s network. As the crypto landscape evolves, WIF could be an exciting coin to watch alongside other emerging tokens. Avalanche Avalanche is a blockchain that stands out for being fast, eco-friendly, and affordable. It can handle up to 4,500 transactions per second with low fees. Using a special way of agreeing on transactions, it finalizes them in under two seconds. This makes it one of the quickest blockchains around. Avalanche also lets users create custom blockchains, called Subnets, which can be tailored to specific needs. Its three chains — X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain — work together to handle everything from simple transactions to smart contracts. In today’s crypto market, AVAX, the token of Avalanche, looks promising. It’s useful for payments, securing the network through staking, and running Subnets. While some other coins struggle with high fees and slow speeds, Avalanche offers a better alternative. Its focus on being environmentally friendly fits with the global move towards sustainability. As more people look for fast and scalable blockchain solutions, Avalanche could stand out. Compared to older blockchains that can’t easily scale, Avalanche’s technology might make it an attractive option for investors and users alike.

Its potential lies in its widespread appeal and the Prophecy that unites its fans. As crypto continues to grow into mainstream culture, coins like PENGU are making their mark.

38237660,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634330,1735414222,Galaxy Research predicts Bitcoin at $185K and Ethereum at $5.5K by 2025,"Galaxy Research sees significant growth for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025, where Bitcoin may reach $185,000, and that for Ethereum will rise above $5,500. This growth is expected to come from more institutions using these cryptocurrencies, along with improvements in Ethereum’s technology and the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). Galaxy Research issued positive forecast on the cryptocurrency market, which stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) would more than triple by 2025. According to the firm, BTC will hit $185,000, and ETH will go up to $5,500 by 2025 as more institutional, corporate, and sovereign entities come on board. Bitcoin’s rise driven by Institutional adoption and ETP demand Galaxy precisely noted that Bitcoin will pass the $150,000 mark during the first half of 2025, and increase further up to $185,000 at the end of the year. One major reason behind this growth is the increasing demand for Bitcoin ETPs in the U.S. – especially spot ones. 01 – Bitcoin will cross $150k in H1 and test or best $185k in Q4 2025. A combination of institutional, corporate, and nation state adoption will propel Bitcoin to new heights in 2025. Throughout its existence, Bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes,… pic.twitter.com/KJKE1hcrSw — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 With big hedge funds and institutional investors getting involved, Bitcoin ETPs could reach $250 billion in assets by 2025, per the report. This means Bitcoin could become more popular than physical gold ETPs, helping Bitcoin become even more mainstream. Galaxy also predicts that Bitcoin will become a significant investment for both companies and government-backed wealth funds. The firm believes that by 2025, as many as five Nasdaq 100 companies and five sovereign nations could add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. In addition to institutional adoption, Galaxy points out Bitcoin’s role in wealth management. Significant wealth management platforms will recommend allocating a piece of portfolios to Bitcoin, a recommended 2% allocation. This would further increase the demand for the cryptocurrency, further pushing prices higher as more high-net-worth individuals and firms get exposure to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s rise powered by staking and DeFi development On the other hand, Ethereum should trade above $5,500 by 2025 because of the continued steady development in its staking ecosystem and the resurgence of DeFi, per the report. Other reasons Ethereum will do well include switching to a proof-of-stake system, which makes transactions faster and safer. Galaxy also predicts that by 2025, half of Ethereum’s total supply will be staked. As more people join in, Ethereum’s security and ability to handle more transactions will improve, making it more attractive to both small users and big companies. It further added that L2s, like Optimism and Arbitrum, will help Ethereum in terms of scalability and transaction fees. This Layer 2 solution is expected to provide great corporate experimentation. Since the solutions will enable greater, smoother scaling for Ethereum users and businesses, Galaxy looks forward to large-scale adoption. Another factor that would send the Ethereum price up is if there would be a new and vibrant resurgence in the NFT market. The fact that the NFT market slowed down a bit doesn’t diminish its potential for a strong rebirth, according to Galaxy, especially in 2025. With the NFT market’s resurgence in relevance, so is its demand for Ethereum as the prime blockchain for NFTs. Ethereum’s price is increasing toward reaching an even more substantial one this year. The DeFi sector which enters into a “Dividend Era” a major growth area for Ethereum, is also expected to continue expanding. Galaxy believes the Bitcoin DeFi market might double by 2025 as Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions are implemented, and the total value locked in existing and emerging DeFi protocols grows. This will spur the overall DeFi application market and increase demand for Ethereum, which underlies most of the projects. Regarding mining, Galaxy Research also sees drastic shifts in the mining landscape: More than half of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin miners are expected to diversify by teaming up with hyperscale data centers and AI companies. This way, they will benefit from new cash flows as the industry stabilizes at all costs for the sake of the Bitcoin network. It is observed that bitcoin hash rate increases are anticipated to stabilize further at 1.1 by the end of 2025. Overall, it means the strategic shifting will have security and efficiency regarding the process of Bitcoin mining.

Earlier today, the company proposed launching futures-based Solana (SOL) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The proposal document was submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This bold attempt is poised to provide traders with an innovative way to bet on Solana’s (SOL) price movements, allowing for both upside and downside exposure. A New Era for Solana in the Futures Market Volatility Shares is gearing up to launch a new set of futures-based ETFs centered around Solana (SOL). The proposed ETFs will feature leveraged options, including 1x, 2x, and -1x inverse exposure to Solana futures. This could allow investors to capitalize on price fluctuations in both directions. This is a bold move, as it opens up more ways to trade SOL. Allowing investors to interact with futures contracts provides an alternative to directly owning the digital asset. These ETFs will primarily focus on near-term and next-term Solana futures. It will offer 100% exposure to Solana’s performance through regulated futures contracts. The collateral is reportedly in cash, cash equivalents, and top-tier securities. This ensures the ETFs offer a secure and structured approach to tapping into Solana’s price swings. Volatility Shares’ Push for Crypto ETFs This is not Volatility Shares’ first venture into the crypto futures ETF space. The firm previously contributed to the launch of Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs. This showcases its experience and commitment to bringing more crypto-based investment products to market. This Solana proposal is essential to a broader acceptance of crypto futures in traditional financial markets. Market analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the importance of this move. He suggested it could set the stage for a spot for Solana ETF approval . However, he noted Litecoin and HBAR ETFs might see approval before Solana does, signaling a shifting momentum within the SEC’s stance on crypto. Is Solana Ready to Shine Again? This proposal is not just another ETF for the crypto space; it could pave the way for broader adoption of Solana. Solana’s price has been in a phase of stagnation, trading sideways since mid-November. Meanwhile, digital tokens such as Binance’s BNB and Ripple’s XRP have overtaken it in market rankings. Many speculate that approving a Solana spot ETF could trigger a major surge for SOL. Some analysts are predicting the asset’s price to hit $1,000. Solana’s price is currently down 2.13% in a single day, trading by $186.43 as per CoinMarketCap data. However, the future could be brighter, especially with Solana’s track record of rebounding after rough patches.

Solana: A scalable blockchain for decentralized applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with Ethereum and Cardano, it focuses on faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network. The SOL coin holds value as it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem and allows users access to a suite of projects. In the current market cycle, Solana’s technology positions it as a significant player in the blockchain space. Uniswap’s UNI Token: Governance and innovation in decentralized finance Uniswap’s UNI token, launched in September 2020, serves as a governance token for the Uniswap platform. It allows holders to vote on key developments such as fee structures and token distributions. Uniswap, established in 2018, is a leading decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book. This design gives users full control of their funds and promotes accessibility and security. With over $3 billion in assets, Uniswap stands as a major player in DeFi. The UNI token’s role in governance and the platform’s innovative technology suggest potential value, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Worldcoin: Changing digital identity with iris biometrics Worldcoin (WLD) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2023 that aims to create a global digital identity system using iris scans. Co-founded by Sam Altman, it uses an Orb device to scan eyes and generate unique digital IDs, promoting fair wealth distribution and universal access to the digital economy. The project has attracted over 2 million users and plans a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens valued at $3 billion. While it has seen a surge in token value, it faces privacy concerns due to biometric data collection and is under investigation in several countries. Its potential lies in combining AI and biometrics for financial inclusion, but it must navigate regulatory hurdles to achieve mass adoption. ONDO: Integrating traditional finance with blockchain efficiency ONDO Finance bridges traditional finance and blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This approach makes high-grade financial products more accessible. ONDO has an asset management arm creating tokenized products and a technology arm developing DeFi protocols to enhance functionality and scalability. Collaborations with reputable partners like BlackRock and the use of Coinbase for asset custody emphasize trust and security. Their product USDY offers a stablecoin backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, providing non-US investors with regulated and transparent options. In the current market cycle, ONDO’s focus on transparency and regulatory compliance may appeal to those interested in blockchain-based financial products. Conclusion Though SOL, UNI, WLD, and ONDO show less short-term potential, Catzilla shines as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom. With a 700% ROI in its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it offers governance rights, loyalty rewards, and passive staking. Catzilla unites enthusiasts to combine fun with profit and fight crypto villains. To learn more about Catzilla, visit the website , X , Telegram chat , and Telegram news .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As 2025 nears, Rollblock’s GambleFi platform positions it to outpace Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the anticipated crypto bull run. Table of Contents Why Rollblock could be THE Gamechanger Dogecoin continues to range as whales step in Shiba Inu sees modest rebounds, but it still has a long way to go Discover the Rollblock presale With 2025 right around the corner the crypto market is entering peak euphoria. Picking the next big winner can be a daunting task, especially in the current state of information overload. According to ChatGPT, Rollblock (RBLK) stands out among newcomers in the crypto landscape. AI suggests that by leveraging its novel GambleFi platform, Rollblock could outpace majors like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in terms of gains when the bull run is in full swing. Let’s dive deeper and discover what makes this new gem so special. You might also like: Rollblock vs Dogecoin vs Cardano: A quest for crypto with higher growth potential in 2025 Why Rollblock could be THE Gamechanger As the $450 billion-a-year global gambling industry migrates online, Rollblock is poised to claim a significant share of this revenue through its blockchain-driven framework. Rollblock is a web3 casino that has already captured the interest of players and investors alike, with its wide array of gaming options and a revolutionary revenue-sharing mechanism. While the reputation of many old-guard online casinos has been tainted by issues of transparency and security, Rollblock goes against the grain. Its platform is built on the tried and tested Ethereum blockchain to ensure that all transactions are easily traceable and tamper-proof. Moreover, its smart contract has been thoroughly audited by SolidProof, and just recently the project secured a license from Gaming Anjouan, further cementing its credibility. With over 35,000 early investors, Rollblock has already raised over $7.7 million in the ongoing presale. More than 7,000 games await newcomers, ranging from casino classics such as blackjack, to brand-new AI-enhanced games. Moreover, Rollblock’s sports betting platform is now live, providing a 360-degree gambling experience and allowing users to bet on their favorite sports with ease and provably fair odds. In addition to all this, Rollblock offers one of the most intriguing revenue-sharing models on the market, powered by the RBLK token. Every week, the platform will perform open market buybacks of RBLK. Of these tokens, 40% will be distributed to holders as staking rewards, while the rest will be removed from circulation through an automated burn mechanism. This model not only encourages and rewards long-term engagement but also ensures superior price stability and growth. Dogecoin continues to range as whales step in Despite playing a protagonist role in November and shocking the crypto space with a memorable triple-digit surge, Dogecoin has entered a cool-off phase. Dogecoin shed roughly 35% of its value after topping out at $0.47 and is now consolidating around the $0.32 mark. Whales are wasting no time, as over the last wallets, large wallets scooped up over 270 million Dogecoin, worth approximately $86 million. This signals growing confidence among big-time investors and technical indicators seem to agree that a massive Dogecoin breakout could be on the horizon. Analyst Trader Tardigrade has drawn attention to a spinning top candle formation on the Dogecoin chart, with the RSI indicator rebounding from the ascending trendline acting as a dynamic support. Shiba Inu sees modest rebounds, but it still has a long way to go Shiba Inu has been struggling over the past few weeks as market-wide turbulence intensified. After several failed reclaims of the crucial $0.000033 level, the Shiba Inu price spiraled downward, bottoming out around the $0.000020 mark. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu trades at $0.000022 following a 2% intraday increase. However, the 24-hour volume has recorded a 5% decline, which indicates diminishing market participation. While Dogecoin has enjoyed revamped interest, large investors have steered away from Shiba Inu, as on-chain analysis shows a staggering 99% decrease in whale activity. According to IntoTheBlock data, over the last day, net inflows to major wallets plummeted from 2.97 trillion tokens to 14.8 billion within a day. Discover the Rollblock presale While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu will likely see new heights in 2025, Rollblock has one major advantage: a significantly lower market cap. This, in turn, gives it much greater room for growth in the upcoming months. Currently, Stage 9 of the RBLK presale is underway, and tokens sell for just $0.044, with a projected 800% increase by the end of the final round. Once RBLK hits the markets and listings on major exchanges are finalized, early adopters could have a potential 100x play at hand.

Ethereum and Solana have laid robust foundations in this arena, facilitating decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts across various sectors. Ethereum is renowned for its extensive support of dApps, while Solana excels in managing high-traffic applications at low cost and high speed. Yet, Web3Bay emerges as a standout, pioneering a dedicated, decentralized e-commerce platform. Specifically crafted for online marketplaces, Web3Bay delivers a user-centric, community-led experience that emphasizes true ownership, setting a new standard in the Web3 landscape. Ethereum: The Pillar of Web3 Ethereum remains a bedrock for the Web3 ecosystem, underpinning dApps, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Its blockchain is highly adaptable, allowing developers to forge decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and myriad other applications without middlemen. With its shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, Ethereum has not only reduced its energy footprint but also sped up transactions, enhancing its attractiveness to both developers and investors. In the market, Ethereum’s prices typically oscillate between $3,800 and $4,100, affected by network demand and transaction fees. Its ongoing enhancements and pivotal role ensure its indispensability in powering innovative Web3 projects across numerous sectors. Solana: Accelerating Web3 Transactions Solana is renowned for its blistering transaction speeds, enabled by its unique proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism that processes thousands of transactions per second. This capability is perfect for applications demanding rapid transaction throughput, like gaming and social media, offering lower costs and faster performance than many competing blockchains. Solana also supports DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs, drawing developers focused on high performance and scalability. The price of Solana, which fluctuates around $200–$300, reflects its growth potential and market volatility. Continuous improvements and a focus on scalability help maintain its strong developer community and position it as a formidable platform for Web3 projects requiring extensive transaction capacity. Web3Bay: Pioneering Decentralized E-commerce Web3Bay carves its niche within the Web3 world as a specialized e-commerce platform free from intermediaries. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which cater to various dApps, Web3Bay is devoted to forging a decentralized marketplace where users have complete control over their data. Built on a decentralized blockchain, Web3Bay offers an open, user-driven experience and adopts a community-guided governance model through its 3BAY token. A key innovation in Web3Bay is its Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, where 3BAY token holders have the power to shape platform policies, embodying true community governance. Currently in its first presale stage, 3BAY tokens are exceptionally priced at $0.005, with a presale designed to escalate the token value by 15% across 28 stages, rewarding early adopters. Web3Bay supports both digital currencies and traditional payment methods like PayPal, broadening its reach. Its Layer-1 blockchain enhanced by Layer-2 rollups guarantees swift, cost-effective transactions. Moreover, Web3Bay utilizes the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for secure data storage. Upcoming integrations with NFTs and DeFi are set to expand its ecosystem further, introducing opportunities for staking, lending, and trading digital assets. This forward-thinking approach positions Web3Bay not just as an e-commerce platform but as a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem. Key Insights Ethereum, Solana, and Web3Bay each bring distinct advantages to the Web3 domain. Ethereum’s versatility and robust dApp support make it a top choice for developers, while Solana’s unmatched transaction speeds cater to those needing efficient, scalable solutions. However, Web3Bay’s targeted approach to e-commerce, combined with its community-led governance, versatile payment options, and upcoming NFT and DeFi features, mark it as a cutting-edge, user-centric marketplace in the evolving Web3 landscape.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. December’s crypto correction clears weak hands as XRP, Cardano, and Rollblock show signs of potential reversal and long-term gains. Table of Contents Rollblock goes red-hot Is it time to buy Cardano? XRP remains strong despite market downturn Conclusion With the way crypto prices were accelerating in the aftermath of the US elections, a price correction was all but inevitable. When the crypto market took a nosedive in early December, some quarters of the industry were not surprised. In fact, some industry watchers were pleased. A price correction is necessary to weed out weak hands and get rid of those who are not in it for the long term. For the crypto market to advance and hit the next level, it must go through several price corrections. The bad news is no one knows when the market will bounce back, but there’s been a few encouraging signs of a reversal. Is it time to buy XRP , Cardano , Rollblock , and other highly rewarding coins? Read on to find out. You might also like: Rollblock vs Dogecoin vs Cardano: A quest for crypto with higher growth potential in 2025 Rollblock goes red-hot Whilst XRP, Cardano, and other top tokens were falling hard during the last correction, Rollblock was soaring high. This trailblazing crypto presale has captured the attention of crypto investors both small and great, and the promise of stupendous gains has got everyone rushing in on it. So, what’s the magic behind the success of Rollblock’s presale ? In case someone doesn’t know it, Rollblock is a game-changing online crypto casino that is set to take over the $500 billion GambleFi market. By offering an exquisite variety of games and prioritizing fair gaming via its blockchain integration, it creates the best environments possible for gamers and gamblers. Already, Rollblock is home to thousands of active users, and the figure is only going to grow with time. Should Rollblock capture just 1% of the GambleFi market share, there’s no telling how high the price will soar. This is the reason it is on the list of many crypto investors today. Is it time to buy Cardano? Cardano is currently in the top 10 coins by market cap, having soared spectacularly towards the end of November. It was affected by the marketwide drop, and troubles amongst its leaders also caused ADA to drop in the last couple of weeks. At the moment, ADA is trading just below $1, which is still above its average price for the year. A Cardano resurgence could be on the cards since the market is expected to bounce back anytime soon. XRP remains strong despite market downturn Surprisingly, the last crypto market liquidations didn’t affect Ripple that much. XRP dipped to $2 but still looks solid on larger time frames. With a market cap of $133 billion, XRP seems to be doing just alright. Perhaps, expectations of a favorable crypto climate played a role in Ripple’s resilience. Nevertheless, XRP is still on course to eclipse its past ATH. The token is just about a dollar away from hitting this level, and there are expectations XRP may do this in the new year. Conclusion XRP and Cardano would fetch investors decent gains in this trying period for cryptocurrencies. But for maximum profits, the go-to coin is Rollblock. Even though it is still in presale, Rollblock has risen by over 340%. It has raised an impressive $7.7 million from thousands of investors, with 20 million tokens sold. Currently priced at $0.044, experts predict that the token would appreciate by 800% during the presale stages alone, and that is why no investor should miss out on it.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

38235801,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667845,1735410646,Chainlink Price Could Crash 30% To $15 — Here’s How,"The Chainlink price has been under intense bearish pressure over the past week, mirroring the current state of the general market. The altcoin’s value continues to slide deeper after briefly touching the $30 mark in mid-December. A prominent analyst on the social media platform X has come forward with an even more bearish forecast for the future of Chainlink. Below is how the cryptocurrency could slump as low as $15 in the near future. This Chart Pattern Suggests Chainlink Price Could Drop 30% In a new video on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an interesting bearish prediction for the price of Chainlink. According to the crypto pundit, the LINK price appears to be set up for at least a 30% correction. Related Reading: Ethereum On The Cusp Of Major Breakout In Q1 2025, Altcoins Expected To Follow Suit The rationale behind this prediction is the formation of a head and shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart of the Chainlink price. A head and shoulders pattern is a chart formation used in technical analysis characterized by three price peaks, where the outside two (shoulders) are similar in height, and the middle (head) is highest. The head and shoulders pattern is considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns, which predicts the shift from a bullish trend to a bearish situation. However, a price close beneath the support line (neckline) connecting the two swing lows is needed to confirm the trend reversal. According to Martinez, this support line lies around $21.30, and a 4-hour candlestick needs to close beneath this level in order to confirm the bearish theory. Also, the Chainlink price might also need to close beneath the $20 support level in order to fall all the way to $15. As of this writing, the price of Chainlink stands at around $21.30, reflecting an over 7% decline in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the altcoin’s value is down by nearly 10% over the last seven days.

This has brought the total supply of the Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin down from 100 trillion to 91 trillion tokens. This reduction in supply has sparked new buyer interest in the market.

38235619,https://thecoinrise.com/kyrgyzstans-bitcoin-mining-revenue-takes-a-hit-in-2024/,1735409267,Kyrgyzstan’s Bitcoin Mining Revenue Takes a Hit in 2024,"In 2024, Kyrgyzstan, a country whose lawmakers are pushing for Bitcoin legalization , faces a surprising setback in its crypto-mining sector. A recent report revealed that the country’s tax revenue from mining operations dropped by 50% compared to the previous year. As the crypto market boomed worldwide, Kyrgyzstan’s mining tax receipts fell sharply, signaling deeper issues within the industry. Kyrgyzstan’s Sudden Decline in Bitcoin Mining Tax Revenue Kyrgyzstan’s mining tax revenue in 2024 amounted to 46.6 million Kyrgyzstan soms, equivalent to $535,000. This represents a significant decline from the previous year’s total of 93.7 million soms, about $1.08 million. This dramatic decline came despite the rise in global cryptocurrency valuations. The decline was evident early in the year, with tax revenues dropping 29.7% during the first seven months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The country’s tax system on crypto mining includes a 10% tax on electricity usage and value-added and sales taxes. This model initially boosted revenue, especially in 2023. Early in the year, Kyrgyzstan reported an impressive increase in mining taxes, bringing in 78.6 million soms ($883,000) in the first few months. This is a sharp rise from the 11.1 million soms ($133,200) collected during the same period in 2022. What Caused the Drop? The reasons behind the sharp drop in tax revenue remain unclear, but several potential explanations exist. Regulatory uncertainty, possibly stemming from unclear or changing policies on crypto mining, may have caused a reduction in mining activity. Additionally, the mining industry could face operational challenges, such as rising costs or changes in energy policies . Kyrgyzstan’s inexpensive hydroelectric power has long been a key factor driving crypto miners to the country. However, recent changes in energy policies or shifts in electricity costs may have impacted mining operations. This could lead to decreased activity and, consequently, lower tax receipts. Kyrgyzstan to Explore Sustainable Solutions for Crypto Mining The drop in mining tax revenue may be a setback. However, it presents Kyrgyzstan with an opportunity to rethink how to support the industry sustainably. Germany’s success with using excess renewable energy for Bitcoin mining offers a potential model for Kyrgyzstan, where hydroelectric power could be better utilized. Countries like Canada and the United States are also exploring ways to integrate crypto mining with the energy grid, reducing carbon footprints. This approach aims to make the sector more sustainable and viable in the long run. Kyrgyzstan could boost revenue by attracting sustainable crypto miners while promoting clean energy. Embracing innovative solutions and new regulatory frameworks could help the country grow its mining sector and sustain its economy in the long term. These global shifts provide valuable insights for Kyrgyzstan as it navigates the complexities of crypto taxation and sustainable growth.

With the potential to redefine how businesses and consumers interact online, Web3Bay has quickly become a top contender among the best crypto presales to invest in for 2025. The global e-commerce market is projected to hit $8.1 trillion by 2026, with blockchain integration expected to play a crucial role in enabling borderless transactions, reducing costs, and enhancing transparency.

The PNDN token powers the ecosystem, providing governance rights and multi-layered rewards. Its streamlined approach makes it an appealing option for both new and experienced DeFi users.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Designed for seamless, borderless exchanges, XRP eliminates the need for central authorities, ensuring secure and irreversible transactions resistant to censorship and fraud. Created by visionaries Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP debuted with a finite supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the key driver of its ecosystem, holds 80 billion XRP to fuel liquidity and foster growth. By integrating XRP into its network, Ripple delivers swift currency conversions and cross-border transfers, cementing its role as a cornerstone of global financial systems. As the world leans further into digital finance, XRP’s unparalleled efficiency positions it as a transformative force in the payments industry. Kaspa: Redefining blockchain performance with GHOSTDAG technology Kaspa is breaking the mold of traditional blockchain design through its pioneering use of the GHOSTDAG protocol. This revolutionary approach enables blocks created simultaneously to coexist and establishes their sequence via consensus, forming a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). This structure pushes the boundaries of Nakamoto consensus, delivering unmatched scalability and lightning-fast block rates — currently at one per second, with ambitious goals of 10 and even 100 blocks per second. Kaspa’s unique features extend to features like DAG topology querying, data pruning, SPV proofs, and the development of subnetworks for streamlined layer 2 implementations. By prioritizing speed, scalability, and security, Kaspa positions itself as a trailblazer in next-generation cryptocurrency networks, making it a compelling choice for high-throughput financial applications. Conclusion With coins like XRP and KAS offering less short-term potential, DOGEN shines for those seeking luxury and success. Following the path of tokens like BONK and Popcat, it’s expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season.

38235076,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634350,1735408820,Bitcoin passes Elon Musk’s clean energy usage condition of 50% at 54% – What now?,"Bitcoin mining has since ticked the box Elon Musk set three years ago. He said at least 50% of its energy must come from renewable sources. Well, miners just hit 54%. This should, in theory, be enough for Tesla to dust off its Bitcoin payment system, as we kindly suggested in the past. Elon’s ultimatum and Bitcoin’s big energy problem Back in May 2021, Elon pulled the plug on Bitcoin payments for Tesla, citing environmental concerns. His issue? Mining Bitcoin was guzzling electricity, much of it coming from coal and other dirty sources. “We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining,” Elon said at the time. But the 54% progress didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of miners packing up and moving to regions with cleaner, cheaper power. Think Quebec with its hydro plants, Iceland with its geothermal hotspots, and even sunny Texas, where wind and solar farms are booming. But let’s not pretend Bitcoin’s energy makeover is complete. Mining still devours about 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year—more electricity than countries like Argentina. Carbon emissions remain a problem, too, with Bitcoin responsible for around 69 million metric tons of CO₂ annually. That’s roughly the same as Greece’s annual emissions. Clean energy or not, Bitcoin’s power consumption is still a headline magnet for critics. The new energy mix: Less coal, more wind and water Meanwhile, hydropower is leading the renewable pack, making up 23% of the total energy used. Iceland and Quebec are the poster children here, thanks to their abundance of water resources and dirt-cheap electricity. Wind energy is another big player, especially in Texas. Bitcoin miners have swooped in to take advantage of sprawling wind farms and the Lone Star State’s pro-business attitude. Wind now accounts for about 5% of Bitcoin’s energy mix. Solar energy is making moves too, although it’s still a small fry at just 2%. For miners in sunny places, pairing solar panels with battery systems is becoming a trendy way to cut costs and boost energy independence. Then there’s nuclear power, which provides 9% of Bitcoin’s energy. While not technically renewable, nuclear is low on emissions and reliable. It’s especially popular in places where other clean energy options aren’t available. Finally, geothermal energy is quietly being used in places like El Salvador, where volcanic activity powers mining rigs. And coal is still hanging around like an uninvited guest, making up 22% of the energy mix. But that’s a slight improvement from earlier years when coal accounted for 40% of Bitcoin’s power supply. Natural gas is also in the mix at 21%, and while it’s cleaner than coal, it’s not winning any green awards. Bottom line? Renewables are gaining ground, but Bitcoin mining is still far from being liked by environmentalists. Will Tesla bring Bitcoin payments back? The big question now is whether Tesla will reinstate Bitcoin payments. Technically, Elon’s condition has been met. The Bitcoin network has hit 54% renewables, so what’s stopping Tesla from flipping the switch? Part of the hesitation could be tied to politics. Elon is now rubbing elbows with Donald Trump, who’s back in the White House. Elon reportedly donated $277 million to Trump’s presidential campaign and is set to head the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). This new role gives him unlimited access to the Oval, which could mean smoother sailing for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Trump, for his part, has promised not to introduce any policies that could crash Bitcoin. That’s music to the ears of Bitcoin fans—and probably Elon, too.

Santiment notes on the social media platform X that Decentraland registered 116.27 notable GitHub events in the past 30 days. Decentraland also led the rankings in November , October , and September .

A poll with over $1.5 million in funds puts these odds at just 27%, down from 60% after Trump’s election. This is a notable prediction since Polymarket has been highly accurate in the past, including its estimate on the last presidential election. Odds of strategic Bitcoin reserves are falling | Source: Polymarket You might also like: US will not approve strategic Bitcoin reserve: CryptoQuant CEO Kalshi users disagree Other participants in the prediction market expect Trump to ultimately accept Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a strategic reserve, joining crude oil and gold. Kalshi, for example, has placed the odds of a BTC reserve happening by January 2026 at 61%, the highest point since Dec. 21. Some conservative-leaning states like Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have also started working on their strategic Bitcoin reserves. A bill in Pennsylvania states that the government may invest at least 10% of the State General Fund in Bitcoin to fight inflation. Still, Polymarket and Kalshi users expect the Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve bill to take time. A Polymarket poll places the odds of Texas passing the bill by March next year at 10%, while Kalshi has the odds at 24%. Proponents of the U.S. embracing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, including Senator Cynthia Lummis , argue that it makes financial sense because of the demand and supply dynamics. Data shows that Bitcoin demand is rising, with spot ETFs having over $128 billion in assets. Supply is falling, with the mining difficulty rising to a record high after the last Bitcoin halving event in April this year. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin balances in exchanges have continued falling this year. Proponents also point to MicroStrategy’s success, which has helped it become an $80 billion company by becoming the biggest Bitcoin holder. As such, some analysts predict that the U.S. could ultimately use its Bitcoin holdings to pay some of its debt, which currently stands at over $36 trillion. Opponents argue that Bitcoin’s volatility, limited acceptance, market scale, regulatory constraints, and its implications for sovereignty and trust make it an impractical solution for paying off the U.S. national debt. Also, the Federal Reserve has already said that it is not allowed to hold Bitcoin , meaning that it would need a congressional law to do that. Trump has supported Bitcoin and suggested that the government should convert its Bitcoin holdings into strategic reserves. Data by BitcoinTreasuries show that the government holds 198,000 coins valued at $18 billion.

The Virginia resident, who is 80-years-old and identified as Kay, says she received a message from someone impersonating Wells Fargo warning her account had been frozen, reports the NBC-affiliated news station WWBT. Kay says the message included a number that she was directed to call to unlock her account. She called the number and spoke to someone who claimed to be a Wells Fargo security expert. “I thought, ‘Dear god, what is going on?’ So I called this number, and I did what they told me to do because they told me they were top security at Wells Fargo… I didn’t know it at the time I was talking to scammers.” Soon after the call, Kay realized her life savings had disappeared. “My heart just dropped to my feet. My money was gone.” To recover her funds, Kay says she promptly called and visited Wells Fargo and was told her account would be reimbursed. But after a few days, Kay learned that the lender’s fraud division closed the case, blaming her for giving the scammers access to her account. “This is my life savings; it’s all I have in the world, and again, at my age, I can’t jump out and say, ‘Oh well, I’ll get a job and just reimburse myself.’ I’m not able to do that. I have a lot of health issues.” WWBT touched base with Wells Fargo to inquire about Kay’s case. The bank says it is still investigating the matter.

Remittix, a low-cap PayFi token, emerges as XRP’s rival, with experts predicting a 40,000% surge by 2025 amid rising demand. Table of Contents Crypto EA remains optimistic for Ripple as price goes in the red Remittix seen as a presale sensation with high upside potential Will Remittix evolve into the next Ripple? The crypto market offers limitless opportunities, and often, a new project appears that could change an entire industry. One such project is Remittix (RTX) , a new low-cap PayFi token that could change the cross-border payments space. Some analysts are even saying this rookie could be Ripple (XRP) 2.0, which has dominated this sector since its launch. Although experts like Crypto EA have made bullish predictions for this altcoin, XRP has been experiencing a downtrend on the price charts. Therefore, investors are now sidestepping one of the top crypto coins for RTX – a presale star. Demand is so high that analysts predict a potential 40,000% surge in 2025. You might also like: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Crypto EA remains optimistic for Ripple as price goes in the red Ripple has been regarded as one of the top 10 altcoins, but its price has experienced quite a few swings in the past. The one-week trend as shown by CoinMarketCap indicates that the price of Ripple depreciated by around 10%. The value has plummeted greatly from approximately $2.60 to almost $2.30 in only a couple of days. However, market expert Crypto EA remains optimistic about Ripple. According to his recent X post , this crypto coin could experience a massive price explosion. As a long-term Ripple price prediction, he set a $31 price target by 2026. The technical analysis for the Ripple coin is also bullish. TradingView data points to this altcoin being valued above its 30-day EMA ($2.11) and its 50-day EMA ($1.82). Additionally, its bull-bear power sits at -0.05, which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls are in control. Remittix seen as a presale sensation with high upside potential While Ripple paved the way for fast cross-border payments, Remittix is working on improving this space. It will launch a crypto-to-fiat network that lets traders convert over 40 crypto coins to Fiat currencies. These currencies will then be sent to bank accounts all over the world. With this aspect, Remittix will stand out from the likes of Stripe or Wise, which do not let users send funds via crypto, which is then converted. Not only that, but the Remittix Pay API will also allow businesses to accept these crypto payments. Therefore, Remittix will benefit both businesses and users. Since there will be no extra charges for FX, wires, or hidden costs, Remittix could become a fan-favorite for millions. The RTX native token will be at the center of its ecosystem. Those who hold this crypto coin will get staking rewards, governance voting rights, and more. Currently, one RTX token costs only $0.0156. However, this price will rise to $0.0163 once the next stage of the presale starts. Furthermore, traders are waiting for a Tier-1 CEX like Uniswap to list RTX, which could trigger a jump to $0.09. This could make RTX one of the top crypto coins for fast returns. Will Remittix evolve into the next Ripple? Remittix might just stand to give Ripple a run for its money regarding cross-border payments. The invention it brings, its strong foundation, and its upside potential could make RTX a powerful force in this area. Some experts suggest that the price of this altcoin may even soar as high as 40,000% in 2025. To learn more about Remittix, visit the Remittix presale and join the Remittix community.

Lunex holders also generate passive income without tying up assets in liquidity pools through the profit-sharing system, distributing a share of the platform’s weekly revenues.

38233630,https://finbold.com/?p=223770,1735406154,Why Bitcoin correcting by 30% ‘is the most bullish thing’ for BTC price,"Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price remains highly volatile, with an analyst suggesting that a well-defined further drop could eventually be bullish for the digital currency. Notably, in recent trading sessions, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the critical $100,000 resistance level, which remains a pivotal threshold for reaching new highs. Now, prominent cryptocurrency trading analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted that, based on historical trends, a Bitcoin correction of 20% to 30% could be “the most bullish thing” for the asset, as shared in an X post on December 27. Bitcoin historical price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts As per the analysis, it can summed up that regular price corrections are a hallmark of a healthy market. “A 20% to 30% correction is the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin,” he said. In this line, Bitcoin has historically shown a recurring pattern of strong rallies followed by notable retracements, typically in the 20% to 30% range. Following such trends, Bitcoin has often surged to new highs. This pattern, observed multiple times since 2016, suggests that Bitcoin’s current price movement could follow a similar trajectory. What next for Bitcoin? At the same time, Martinez identified key levels that investors should watch closely. His December 27 post warned of “free-fall territory” if Bitcoin falls below $92,730. “You don’t want Bitcoin to dip below $92,730—it’s essentially free-fall territory if that level breaks,” he cautioned. Using data from the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, he pointed to a gap in realized price activity between $92,730 and around the $105,000 mark. This void indicates a dip below $92,730 could lead to a sharp decline, potentially dropping Bitcoin to the $60,000 zone . Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution. Source: Glassnode/Ali_charts Despite the short-term bearish outlook, Bitcoin has had an impressive run in 2024, adding over $1 trillion in market capitalization . The rally has been fueled by the latest halving cycle and optimism stemming from Donald Trump’s election victory , with his administration pledging to implement pro-crypto policies. Looking ahead, analysts maintain a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly with expectations of increased institutional adoption under a pro-cryptocurrency government. To this end, as reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $94,249, down 0.15% in the past 24 hours but up 1.75% on the weekly timeframe. However, the short-term technical setup shows that Bitcoin is still in trouble. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index at 72 (Greed) reflects optimistic sentiment, while the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) of 44.41 indicates neutral to slightly bearish momentum. Despite this, Bitcoin remains well above its 200-day SMA of $70,978, maintaining a bullish long-term trend. In the short term, caution is advised as Bitcoin approaches critical support levels at $92,000 and $90,000.

38235392,https://invezz.com/?p=2409076,1735406024,IDEGEN goes viral as Bonk and Dogecoin prices remain on edge,"The cryptocurrency market continues to experience heightened investor interest and activity as more of these digital assets get integrated into the global financial and technology sectors. From being seen as the future, cryptos are now a reality and more savvy investors want a piece of the over $3 trillion pie. Among the altcoins that have captured investors’ attention is iDEGEN . It is a social experiment that has craftily and successfully amalgamated the principles of AI), social media, and the craze on meme coins. It has raised over $9.6 million a week ahead of its exchange debut. BONK forms bearish death cross despite the BURNmas BURNmas, BONK’s burning event held on 26th December, saw 1.69 trillion tokens of the dog-themed meme coin destroyed. The amount represents 1.85 of BONK’s total supply and has now dropped the available tokens from the initial 100 trillion to 91 trillion. The event was the culmination of heightened community engagement under #LetsBONK. Token burns tend to push prices higher due to reduced supply. However, BONK’s event has not yielded the expected outcome. According to CoinMarketCap, the meme coin, which is ranked 52 on the list of top cryptocurrencies, has had its market cap drop by 7.13% to $2.39 billion. Similarly, its price and trading volume have dropped by 7.15% and 22.08% respectively. Low trading activity during the current festive season has contributed to the price decline. Besides, the broader crypto market is experienced eased bullish sentiment as Bitcoin lacks enough momentum to retest $100,000. A look at BONK’s daily chart shows the formation of the bearish death cross with the short-term 20-day EMA having crossed the medium-term 50-day EMA to the downside. However, within a relative strength index (RSI) of 42, the crypto may continue finding support at the crucial zone of $0.00003000. More specifically, the range between this 7-week steady support level and the resistance zone of $0.00003435 will be worth watching. iDEGEN: The social experiment adding fuel to the AI meme coin market On 26th November 2024, creators of iDEGEN launched a unique auction that has since blown out beyond their expectations. About a month into the presale, the project has raised close to $10 million with over a billion $IDGN tokens sold to more than 12,000 holders. The success and virality of this project is largely founded on the principle of AI being the present and the future. Indeed, AI meme coins are taking over the market, with their total market cap being close to $7 billion. The likes of ai16z, Ava AI, and VaderAI by Virtuals have had their prices surge by 78%, 134%, and 151% over the past 7 days respectively. At a market cap of over $1.3 billion, ai16z is ranked 94 on the list of top cryptocurrencies. iDEGEN, the new entrant in the AI meme coin scene has the potential to top these figures. In slightly over a month, it has recorded gains of over 92,000%. As such,an overwhelming number of savvy investors are rushing to own some $IDGN tokens ahead of its listing in less than a week from now on 1st January 2025. Beyond the concept of AI, what’s more enticing about iDEGEN is that it has been built “by the people, for the people”. As its slogan reads, the project is “AI Born. Degen Raised”. In the absence of any guard rails, Crypto Twitter can shape the project’s path as it chooses. With all the chaos thrown its way in the form of tweets, comments, and tags, iDEGEN learns, adopts, and tweets after every 60 minutes. Savvy investors understand that this level of wildness and virality is the foundation of a successful meme coin.In fact, it is this intense community engagement that saw the likes of Dogecoin transform from a mere joke to a top crypto with a valuation of over $46 billion. Besides, $IDGN is not just a token that investors are interested in; they can actually afford it. Its price varies every 5 minutes depending on its demand. Under this dynamic pricing model, purchases in two consecutive 5-minute intervals yields a price increase of 5% in the next interval. On the flipside, absence of a purchase in a span of 5 minutes causes the price to drop by 5%. At the time of its listing, the price will be 10% higher than at the time of the auction closing. In addition to ensuring that the holders get the value that they actually asked for, this model is effective at deterring abrupt dumps upon listing. Learn more about IDEGEN here . Dogecoin on a winding road to $1 Dogecoin, a meme coin that started out as a joke, has grown to be the 7th leading cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $47 billion. Among the aspects that have contributed to this immense growth is its aggressive community engagement. For instance, tweets from Elon Musk have bolstered its price on several occasions. With Musk now being part of the US government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), some analysts forecast that the dog-themed coin will hit $1 in 2025. However, in the short term, it will likely remain range-bound as the Bitcoin-led rallying eases. A look at its daily chart shows a probable death cross as the 2 and 50-day EMAs near convergence at around $0.3451. In the near term, the range between $0.30000 and $0.3415 will be worth watching. Further rebounding may have the bulls finding resistance at $0.3505.

Real alphas make their moves early Here’s why DOGEN stands out: it’s not just another meme token. It’s a symbol of dominance and potential, the alpha dog leading this altcoin season.

Big money means big moves — don’t get left behind The presence of whales is a clear signal: DOGEN is heating up, and the price is set to skyrocket. This isn’t just speculation — it’s happening now. Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin’s abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply increased SHIB’s visibility. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the crypto space, making SHIB appear attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion With DOGE and SHIB showing less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Following in the footsteps of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims to build a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

38233343,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376141,1735405547,2024 NFT Revenue Tops Last Year’s $8B Mark,"The broader non-fungible token (NFT) market has defied expectations after it surpassed last year’s revenue milestone. Data collected by CryptoSlam shows that with less than a week left before 2024 ends, NFT sales for the year have amounted to $8,717,920,832, edging out 2023’s tally by about $230,000. The Numbers Last year, the sector recorded more than 91.55 million transactions, bringing in $8.71 billion per CryptoSlam. However, in 2024, the total transactions dropped significantly, only reaching 70.89 million. Nonetheless, an increase in unique buyers and sellers helped balance the scales, with the former totaling 7.5 million and the latter reaching 4 million. These were the highest recorded figures since 2017, the closest being the 3.8 million sellers captured last year and the 5.4 million buyers from 2022. There have long been discussions about the prospects of the NFT space, with the hype that once engulfed them dying down considerably. But analysts have urged against writing off the industry altogether, a sentiment justified by the year’s performance, which, while some ways below 2022’s record-setting sales of $23.7 billion from 56 million transactions, has been markedly better than expected. The next best period was 2021, when the sector raked in $15.7 billion from 34 million transactions involving 3.6 million unique sellers and over 5 million buyers. 2024’s numbers are on course to be the third-highest returns on record, marginally beating last year’s figures. The space also recently suffered casualties when the Nike-owned RTFKT project announced it would close shop in 2025 after earning almost $50 million since its launch. Monthly Insights Looking more short-term, the last month presented a mixed outlook for NFTs. While global sales volumes went up 19.43% to $912 million, unique buyer and seller numbers fell by nearly 28%, reflecting a more selective market approach. Additionally, transactions saw a 59.25% drop from the previous month, suggesting that fewer but more valuable exchanges may have driven the sector’s growth. Overall, Ethereum remains the top blockchain for NFT sales, contributing $495.7 million in the last 30 days alone. In second and third place were Bitcoin and Solana, which respectively generated $191.4 million and $107 million in that period. Interestingly, the two blockchains went in completely opposite directions with regard to attracting buyers. CryptoSlam data shows that NFT purchasers on the Bitcoin network skyrocketed by more than 80% in the last month, while those on Solana dropped by at least 37%. Immutable and Mythos rounded up the top five blockchains by monthly NFT sales volume. The former registered $35 million worth of sales, a 66.51% jump from the previous month, while the latter shed 36.72% from its tally in the same period, only reaching $25.4 million.

38233334,https://crypto.news/?p=14322868,1735405470,"Shiba Inu coin price at risk as burn rate, Shibarium fees fall","Shiba Inu is highly volatile as its burn rate and Shibarium transaction fees continue to fall. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) retreated to $0.000022, down by 33% from its highest level this month. At last check Saturday, the Ethereum meme coin was up at least 3.5%. See below. Source: CoinGecko Why did Shiba Inu retreat? This retreat is mainly because of the ongoing softness and falling volumes in the cryptocurrency industry. Shiba Inu’s fundamentals have also deteriorated in the past few days. First, Shibarium’s network is not growing as it did months ago. According to Shibarium Scan, the number of new accounts on Friday was just 44 — much lower than 3,400 on Dec. 4. The cumulative number of accounts has grown to 222,000, while the active ones have fallen to less than 3,000. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1872777533554401359 You might also like: IRS targets DeFi: Blockchain groups challenge new broker reporting rule Shibarium’s average transaction fees have continued falling after peaking at 0.0004 earlier this month. Its total value locked has also dropped to $3.55 million from over $6 million on Dec. 7. These numbers are important for Shiba Inu because Shibarium is its layer-2 network, and its success matters. Also, Shibarium’s fees , which are in form of BONE, are usually converted into SHIB and then burned. Burning is a process where cryptocurrencies are moved into an inaccessible wallet. These numbers likely explain why Shiba Inu’s burn rate crashed by over 98% in the last 24 hours to 507,123 SHIB. That burn has brought Shiba Inu’s circulating supply to 584 trillion tokens, much lower than its total supply of over 999 trillion. Shiba Inu could lose key support SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price has dropped sharply after peaking at $0.000033 in December. It has fallen and moved slightly below the 50-day moving average. There are signs that the coin is forming a bearish pennant chart pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a triangle. This pattern often leads to more downside. On the positive side, Shiba Inu remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since August. It has failed to move below that level at least six times since then, offering hopes of a rebound. A drop below that support will be a sign that bears have prevailed, which will lead to more downside, potentially to $0.00001590, its lowest level on Oct. 25.

The Ethereum Classic price is anticipated to see a 20% increase. Similarly, the Bittensor price prediction indicates a potential rise to an all-time high of $1,098. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has distinguished itself as the best crypto to buy today, thanks to its unprecedented presale achievements and the attractive BDAG400 bonus offer. With over $173 million collected and more than 17.5 billion coins distributed, BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a focal point of discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The BDAG400 promotion from BlockDAG, concluding soon, provides increasing rewards for each purchase, capturing the interest of holders keen to enhance their returns. Whether drawn by the upward movement of ETC and TAO or the dynamic potential of BlockDAG, the cryptocurrency market is ripe with possibilities. Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Climbs as Market Rebounds The Ethereum Classic (ETC) price is exhibiting signs of a robust recovery. After a marked decline, ETC has advanced by over 22%, attracting both longstanding holders and active traders. On-chain data points to a significant $22.85 million withdrawal of ETC from exchanges, suggesting active accumulation by holders. Analysts suggest that if the Ethereum Classic price remains above $28.50, it could surge by 20%, targeting $34.25 in the near term. With the ETC price drawing increasing scrutiny from traders and large-scale buyers, it is emerging as a notable asset in the current market resurgence. Anticipating a Bittensor Price Surge: What’s Next? Bittensor is capturing attention in the crypto sector with its notable growth and commitment to developing a decentralized, transparent AI ecosystem. The latest Bittensor price prediction posits that TAO could hit up to $845 by the end of 2024, assuming positive market conditions. Even under pessimistic scenarios, the forecast suggests a resilient price floor around $454. TAO’s unique strategy and expanding base position it as an appealing prospect for those interested in the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. BlockDAG’s BDAG400 Bonus Creates a Stir: A Look at the Returns BlockDAG is rapidly making headway in the cryptocurrency arena with its unique attributes and remarkable success in presales. The network’s presale efforts have amassed over $173 million and facilitated the distribution of more than 17.5 billion coins. Moreover, early holders of the coin have seen a staggering 2240% ROI as the price of BDAG escalated from $0.001 in the initial presale to $0.0234 in the latest, batch 26. This batch is nearing sell-out as interest from both the existing community and new traders continues to swell. With an impending significant price increase in the next batch, acting now could be advisable. Overall, BlockDAG’s notable metrics underscore its status as one of the best cryptos to buy today. A primary factor in BlockDAG’s growing appeal is its BDAG400 bonus program, which introduces increasing rewards with each subsequent purchase. The initial bonus offers a substantial 250% reward, escalating to 270% with the second bonus. Further purchases enable participants to access even greater bonuses through engaging mystery boxes. This progressive reward system has sparked considerable interest among traders, prompting them to act quickly to maximize their returns before the promotion concludes. BlockDAG’s sustained achievements serve as proof of its strategic foresight and execution capabilities. By presenting significant rewards and cultivating a strong community bond, BlockDAG is recognized as the best crypto to buy now for those aiming for both growth and substantial returns. The Bottom Line The Ethereum Classic (ETC) price is experiencing upward momentum, with projections suggesting a potential 20% increase, while the Bittensor price prediction indicates it might achieve a new all-time high soon. Yet, it is BlockDAG that has cemented its place as one of the best cryptos to buy today. Its unparalleled presale success, having raised over $173 million and issued more than 17.5 billion coins, highlights its expansive influence. The BDAG400 bonus scheme enhances its allure, offering layered rewards that increase with each purchase. As potential buyers weigh their options, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a venture that not only promises profitability and growth potential but also ensures a rewarding experience for all involved.

38233201,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667840,1735405234,Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details,"Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.31, a level that has left investors in a state of uncertainty. The price has been stagnant, neither breaking down nor rallying, as it consolidates and prepares for what could be a significant move. This period of indecision has fueled speculation among DOGE enthusiasts, with many wondering if the popular meme coin is poised for a breakout or further decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin $90K Level Is Crucial For Bulls – Price Could Tag $79K If BTC Loses It Adding to the intrigue, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key data suggesting a potential bullish outlook for Dogecoin. According to Martinez, whales have accumulated over 90 million DOGE in the past 48 hours, a significant indicator of long-term optimism. Historically, whale activity has often preceded notable price movements, hinting at the possibility of renewed momentum. While the short-term outlook remains unclear, this whale accumulation could act as a strong foundation for Dogecoin’s next move. However, the meme coin must overcome its current indecision before any substantial trend emerges. Can Dogecoin rally and reignite its meme-driven hype, or will it succumb to further consolidation? Only time will tell as DOGE approaches a critical juncture. Dogecoin Whales Prepare For A Move Dogecoin has been navigating through a challenging phase, with its price experiencing significant drops in recent weeks. Despite the bearish sentiment dominating the broader market, whales have consistently taken advantage of the dip, signaling long-term confidence in the meme coin. This accumulation trend underscores the potential for a bullish reversal in the near future. Martinez recently highlighted compelling on-chain data, revealing that whales purchased over 90 million DOGE in the past 48 hours alone. This buying spree adds to a growing trend of whale accumulation during the current market pullback. Martinez’s analysis suggests that large-scale investors are positioning themselves for a long-term rally, viewing the current price levels as an opportunity rather than a risk. Historically, whale activity has often foreshadowed significant price movements and Dogecoin’s current scenario appears no different. If DOGE can maintain its position above the crucial $0.31 level, the foundation for a massive rally will solidify. However, breaching this support could open the door to further downside, adding urgency to the current consolidation phase. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 As accumulation continues and key support levels hold, Dogecoin’s bullish outlook remains intact. Investors are now watching closely to see if this meme coin can capitalize on whale confidence and spark its next upward surge. Key Levels To Hold Dogecoin is trading at $0.31, reflecting a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Recent price action saw DOGE fail to reclaim the $0.35 mark, a key resistance level that needs to be broken for bulls to regain control. On the downside, attempts to break below $0.30 have also been unsuccessful, signaling strong demand at this level. However, the indecision leaves DOGE at a critical juncture, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still in play. For bulls to reclaim momentum, Dogecoin must push above $0.37 and hold it as support. Breaking and sustaining this level would signal renewed strength, potentially setting the stage for a rally. Without this breakthrough, however, DOGE risks losing its current foothold.

38233239,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634319,1735404868,Volatility shares files for Solana futures ETF,"Volatility Shares LLC has proposed a futures-based Solana ETF to the SEC, offering 1x, 2x, and -1x leverage options. The ETF will trade on CFTC-registered exchanges, providing regulated exposure to Solana’s price movements. This move could pave the way for spot Solana ETFs in the future. Volatility shares propose Solana Futures ETF with leverage options Volatility Shares recently submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create an ETF based on Solana futures. This filing presents new ways for traders to take advantage of Solana (SOL) price changes in both directions. The proposed ETF will be offered in levels of leverage, including 1x, 2x, and -1x, according to risk preference. Solana ETF Registration Statement | Source: Volatility Shares The filing is important because investors who want to bet on Solana’s future have more options. Solana is known for its blockchains, which allow for speedy transactions and low fees. Adding the -1x inverse product also allows investors to make money if Solana’s price drops. Volatility Shares has played a leading role in achieving the approval and launch of Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs and is dedicated to continuing to pursue new concepts within this space. The company has also led in the creation of asset-class blended ETFs, such as BTC+ETH and S&P+VIX, that can ease the process of diversification for the modern investor. Impact on Solana and the Crypto ETF Market The price of Solana has just dropped by 2.87%. Other cryptocurrencies like BNB and XRP have already surpassed Solana in the rankings. Analysts predicted that the price of Solana would surge in the future, particularly if the SEC approves a spot Solana ETF. Market experts believe this approval could take the price of SOL up to $1,000. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, commented on the filing, saying it was a brave decision. Balchunas said the timing was odd since Solana futures are not yet available. He also mentioned the risk of having a 2x leveraged product that could cause big changes in value. However, this filing might help approve spot Solana ETFs, which would let people invest directly in the cryptocurrency instead of depending on future contracts. Balchunas said Litecoin and HBAR ETFs might get approved before Solana, making this filing important in the industry. This proposal is not the first time Volatility Shares LLC has tried to enter the crypto ETF market. Before this, several companies, like VanEck and 21Shares, applied for spot Solana ETFs, but the SEC has not approved any of these products during its current rules. Considering these challenges, even applying for a Solana futures ETF may be the best decision for Volatility Shares, especially given that regulation changes will likely arrive soon since new leadership at the SEC should be on their way within days. The Solana futures ETF application was made just days after Christmas, when market activity is often quiet. The filing from Volatility Shares hints at the rising demand for regulated Solana ETFs. Such products could standardize access to digital assets for diverse investors. The SEC’s decision will determine the course of crypto ETF innovation.

The LCAI token serves multiple functions, from facilitating transactions and incentivizing developers to enabling community governance. By ensuring equitable distribution, the platform avoids centralization risks and encourages widespread participation. A deflationary model adds another layer of value, with a portion of transaction fees burned to reduce the token supply over time, creating scarcity and supporting price stability.

Subsequent phases focus on ecosystem expansion, cross-chain integrations, and partnerships with industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. With a clear plan for global adoption, Lightchain AI leverages grants and outreach programs to attract developers and enterprises. This methodical approach, coupled with community-driven initiatives and unique inventions, positions Lightchain AI to rival Solana’s trajectory, becoming a dominant player in the blockchain industry. Could LCAI outperform Solana by 2025? Lightchain AI is emerging as a serious contender in the blockchain space, thanks to its unique integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology.

Every four years, a ""halving"" reduces miners' rewards by half, affecting mining profitability. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply contribute to its potential.

Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin's abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Kaspa: A High-Throughput Cryptocurrency Utilizing the GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means the Kaspa blockchain is a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). This approach extends Nakamoto consensus, enabling secure operation with very high block rates—currently one block per second, with goals of 10 per second and aspirations for 100 per second. Confirmation times are minimal, mainly limited by internet latency. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG's topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and planned subnetwork support to simplify future layer 2 solutions. These innovations aim to improve scalability and transaction speeds in cryptocurrency networks. Conclusion While DOGE, XRP, and KAS may show limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout option. Designed for those pursuing excellence, it embodies luxury and success. With high growth potential, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

38232994,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-scandal-lands-former-bithumb-ceo-behind-bars/,1735403883,Crypto Scandal Lands Former Bithumb CEO Behind Bars,"In a shocking turn of events, a court in South Korea has recently sentenced celebrity golfer Ahn Sung-hyun and Lee Sang-jun, former CEO of Bithumb, to prison. Their convictions revealed a high-stakes scheme of bribery and market manipulation designed to rig the crypto exchange for profit. Prosecutors Unveiled the Bithumb Bribery Plot The scandal revolved around a plot to inflate the value of a low-profile digital asset. Businessman Kang Jong-hyun, seeking quick profits, devised a plan to list the coin on Bithumb . To make this happen, Kang offered lavish bribes to Lee Sang-jun, Bithumb’s former CEO. The bribes included cash totaling 3 billion Korean won, equivalent to $2 million, luxury watches, designer bags, and exclusive restaurant memberships. Lee accepted these gifts and facilitated the altcoin listing, setting the stage for Kang’s desired price surge. Lee was sentenced to two years in prison for his role. Despite his conviction, questions remain about his possible secret ownership of Bithumb and the extent of his influence within the crypto exchange. Investigators are uncovering more about Kang’s activities, but his involvement in rigging altcoin prices is clear. Ahn Sung-hyun’s Double Dealing in the Scheme Ahn Sung-hyun, a professional golfer married to actress Song Yu-ri, was a key player in delivering the bribes. Kang entrusted Ahn with funds to secure Lee’s cooperation. However, instead of handing over all the money, Ahn siphoned off 2 billion Korean won, about $1.5 million for his stock investments. This act of self-interest drew harsh criticism from the court. Judges described Ahn’s actions as “heinous,” emphasizing that he exploited stolen funds for personal gain. As a result, Ahn received a four-and-a-half-year sentence, marking a dramatic fall from grace for the once-celebrated athlete. This scandal highlights the vulnerabilities in the crypto market, where lack of regulation allows bad actors to manipulate prices for personal gain. The trust in the crypto industry has been eroded as critics point out the ease with which individuals can exploit systems without facing serious consequences. In November, Jimmy Donaldson, popularly known as MrBeast, found himself at the heart of a crypto controversy . Blockchain analysts suggested that MrBeast used his immense online influence to orchestrate multiple pump-and-dump schemes. According to analysts, MrBeast may have earned over $23 million from these practices, further fueling concerns about the ethics and regulation of the crypto space. Additionally, Bithumb’s deep involvement in this latest bribery and market manipulation case might lead to stricter regulations across the industry.

38232588,https://crypto.news/?p=14322836,1735403854,US will not approve strategic Bitcoin reserve: CryptoQuant CEO,"In a lengthy post on X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju questioned whether the U.S. would embrace a Bitcoin reserve under the incoming Donald Trump administration. “I personally support the idea of Bitcoin Standard,” Young Ju said. “However, I question whether the U.S., while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. For the debate to gain serious momentum, the U.S. would need to see its global economic dominance genuinely threatened. At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the U.S.’s continued supremacy.” Trump, on the 2024 campaign trail, promised to establish a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve to drum up support among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This initiative has garnered attention, with some analysts suggesting it could lead to significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value. Indeed, in the weeks following Election Day, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $108,300. But even before Trump changed his stance on Bitcoin, the U.S. already stood at the top of the global Bitcoin mining chart, producing approximately 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin hash rate as of 2022, according to the government Energy Information Administration. Also, the U.S. dollar also maintains its dominance globally, handling about 58% of all trade and 59% of all currency reserves. As such, Young Ju expects the U.S. only to accept a strategic Bitcoin reserve if it sees its global dominance threatened. See his full comment below. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction.

It is a top rival to companies like Glassnode and Nansen. Read more: Powell says Bitcoin is a competitor for gold, not a dollar Was Trump’s Bitcoin reserve promise just campaign rhetoric? As geopolitical shifts and economic uncertainties continue to influence global markets, a notable trend is emerging among Koreans, Young Ju says: They’re increasingly turning to U.S. dollars as a safe haven, eclipsing both gold and Bitcoin. This reflects a broader global sentiment that favors the dollar’s relative stability and raises questions about how U.S. economic policies will evolve under Trump’s leadership. Trump has only been an outspoken advocate for cryptocurrency for less than a year, explicitly doubting its potential as a cornerstone of future financial systems when he was in office the last time. I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019 Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may shift yet again depending on the broader political landscape, Young Ju observes. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing U.S. economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he adds. “He could easily step back from his Bitcoin advocacy, citing changing priorities, without alienating his voter base.” For Young Ju and other crypto professionals, the question remains: Was Trump’s mention of Bitcoin at the BTC Conference a serious step toward a “Bitcoin Standard,” or was it “a calculated move to secure votes?” “It remains uncertain how much of his campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin he intends to fulfill,” Young Ju says.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin's abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply increased SHIB's visibility. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the crypto space, making SHIB appear attractive in the current market cycle. Floki: From Meme Coin to Multifaceted Cryptocurrency with Real-World Utility Floki, inspired by Elon Musk's Shiba Inu named Floki, started as a meme coin in June 2021. It has evolved to provide utility and charitable initiatives, such as building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Floki offers projects including the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and the DeFi service FlokiFi. These enhance its utility within and beyond its ecosystem. Floki's partnership with NOWPayments and its prepaid Floki Card enable real-world transactions with FLOKI tokens. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world utility sets it apart from other meme coins. In the current market cycle, Floki's expanding ecosystem and practical applications may make it an attractive option. Turbo Token: The First AI-Created Memecoin in Cryptocurrency Turbo Token is a cryptocurrency that marks a new chapter in digital assets as the first memecoin created by artificial intelligence. Originating from a simple challenge posed to GPT-4, the project's founder sought to develop the next notable meme coin.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 345,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is likely to stay below the record high of around $108,200 for more than one week but not for more than half a year. According to Pizzino, the longer Bitcoin consolidates below the all-time high, the stronger the upward move that could follow will be. “I don’t think we’re in the midst of something like six months underneath that top [of around $108,200]. What we do expect is a longer period of time under the top, not more than six months, but longer than what we have currently seen. And what we have currently seen is 13 days underneath that top.” The widely followed analyst says Bitcoin could start breaking out from under the current all-time high beginning in the early weeks of the first quarter of 2025. “ So somewhere around that inauguration [of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20th, 2025]. So that might be some of those reasons that people get really excited as to why this thing should go up from that point. You know Trump’s in and then they start to get a little bit excited and the cycle sort of rinses and repeats and we get a nice upside. If that is the case, that’s going to be a good move or at least a good amount of time underneath this top [of $108,200] especially as we have broken out into a new fresh all-time high… Basically call it January for some sort of low and then potential breakout to a new fresh high which might come in late January or into February. So that’s the big thing that I’m looking out for quarter one [of 2025].” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $94,528, about 13% below the all-time high, at time of writing. ?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s price struggles spark liquidations, while PropiChain gains traction, changing real estate with AI innovation. Table of Contents XRP price battles market turmoil: Will the $2.20 support hold amid fed-induced sell-off? PropiChain’s ascendancy in the real estate sector Why PropiChain is the perfect investment The recent decline in XRP price has caused significant liquidations as there were bullish sentiments surrounding the asset since November. As the XRP price struggles to maintain its foothold, PropiChain (PCHAIN) emerges as a beacon of invention, using AI to transform the real estate sector. While the XRP price faces bearish sentiment and market fluctuations, PropiChain gradually gains momentum with its unique offerings that promise to redefine property investment. XRP price battles market turmoil: Will the $2.20 support hold amid fed-induced sell-off? The XRP price has sharply declined amid a broader cryptocurrency market sell-off. The asset is around the $2.20 support level, reflecting an 8% drop over the past week. This price drop is part of a larger market downturn, which saw the total market capitalization fall to $3.3 trillion, its lowest in a month. Bitcoin ‘s slide below $94,000 and Ethereum’s retreat to $3,300 have intensified bearish sentiment across all major altcoins, including XRP. The Federal Reserve’s recent hawkish policy stance, emphasizing fewer interest rate cuts in 2025, triggered this significant market reaction. Tightening global liquidity and rising bond market volatility have further compounded the sell-off. Despite these challenges, the psychological support of $2.00 for the XRP price remains a key level to watch. Investors continue to weigh macroeconomic pressures against potential long-term gains, reflecting the delicate balance in the current crypto landscape. PropiChain’s ascendancy in the real estate sector While the XRP price faces these challenges, PropiChain is making significant strides in the real estate industry by using blockchain and AI technologies. PropiChain aims to democratize access to the global real estate market, valued at over $300 trillion, by enabling fractional ownership through asset tokenization. PropiChain is a unique project, blending blockchain technology, AI, and NFTs to redefine property ownership and real estate management. Designed to address traditional real estate market inefficiencies, the platform eliminates barriers such as high entry costs, lengthy processes, and fraud risks. At the core of PropiChain’s value proposition lies its use of NFTs for fractional property ownership. By converting physical real estate into digital assets, PropiChain democratizes access to property investments. Investors can own fractions of high-value properties, trade their shares with ease, and diversify portfolios. This NFT-based system also guarantees transparency and security through blockchain technology, removing the need for cumbersome paperwork and intermediaries. PropiChain’s integration of AI improves the platform’s efficiency. Advanced predictive analytics give users actionable insights into market trends, property valuations, and optimal investment strategies. For instance, investors can automate transactions based on specific conditions, such as purchasing property when its value reaches a target price. This level of automation minimizes human error, reduces transaction costs, and accelerates deal execution. Beyond its core offerings, PropiChain integrates with the Metaverse to introduce a virtual property exploration experience. The Propiverse feature allows users to take immersive 3D property tours, eliminating geographical barriers and providing a comprehensive understanding of property attributes. PropiChain further simplifies property management with smart contracts. Lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals can all be automated, reducing administrative burdens and ensuring transparency. Tenants can automate rent payments while landlords receive funds instantly, eliminating delays from traditional banking systems. Security is another key pillar of PropiChain’s ecosystem. Every transaction is recorded on a decentralized ledger known as a Title Contract, ensuring tamper-proof and verifiable records. This transparency mitigates fraud risks and provides a level of trust unparalleled in the legacy real estate industry. PropiChain’s native token, PCHAIN, plays a central role in its ecosystem. It grants access to the platform’s features, including property NFTs, AI-driven insights, and DeFi applications. Early investors are well-positioned to gain significant returns, with projections indicating over 800% ROI for initial buyers. Additionally, PCHAIN tokens can be used as collateral for liquidity through decentralized finance, allowing investors to unlock the value of their assets without selling them. Why PropiChain is the perfect investment PropiChain’s native token, PCHAIN, is currently in its presale phase and has garnered significant interest from the investment community. Since listing on CoinMarketCap, the presale has surpassed the $2 million milestone, showcasing growing confidence in the platform’s potential​. Investors participating in the presale can acquire PCHAIN tokens at a discounted rate of $0.011 per token. This early participation provides a chance for substantial financial returns as the token listing is anticipated to be at $0.32, translating to over 800%​. Analysts have projected remarkable growth for PCHAIN, with some estimates suggesting that an initial $1,000 investment could grow to $80,000 by mid-2025. This represents a potential 8,000% return on investment, further underlining the token’s appeal to retail and institutional investors​. While the XRP price movement to resurgence may take some time, savvy investors have started hedging their bets in PropiChain for unmatched ROI.

In a public statement, Hoskinson shared his thoughts on Ripple’s approach and the potential for future integration with other blockchain networks. “Working with Ripple has been easy,” Hoskinson said, adding that the Cardano team has also been working with the Ripple USD team. Ripple’s stablecoin initiative, RLUSD, recently completed its launch phase, which Hoskinson described as “an incredibly time-consuming effort.” Hoskinson explained that RLUSD is looking to integrate with other blockchain networks next year, suggesting a self-service model for these integrations similar to Coinbase’s Rosetta framework, which makes it easier to onboard for serious projects. Related News: Veteran Analyst il Capo Reveals He's Buying More of This Altcoin After Today's Rally “They’ll start adding other chains next year,” he said. “My suggestion to them was a self-service model… It makes it much easier to see who’s serious and who’s not.” “There is no reason why we shouldn’t work together,” Hoskinson said, noting the mutual benefits of the collaboration.

The cumulative trading volume of AI tokens also slumped to $4.73 billion, dropping by almost 11%. However, some of these tokens are doing much better than others, including the AI16Z token, which bypasses the need for traditional exchange listings. The token is currently going for $1.26, and its market cap surpasses the billion mark. The PHA token is also trading at $0.4432, up by over 13.57% in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour trading volume has also escalated by over 168% to $878.76 million. However, tokens like TURBO and RENDER trading prices have slumped, dropping by 1.31% and 0.61% , respectively, in the last 24 hours. TURBO’s 24-hour trading volume has also dwindled by over 25%, while RENDER’s is down by 14%. Analysts expect altcoins to pick up in 2025 Crypto analysts are projecting 2025 to be a huge season for altcoins. In the past, altcoin seasons have followed periods of Bitcoin price rallies, with smaller assets like AI tokens profiting massively. Analysts expect that Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins might revisit their previous peaks following the Bitcoin price surges and the growing hype for AI-powered innovations and blockchain advancements. Despite the declines in AI tokens, regulatory changes and institutional interest expected in 2025 are also projected to allow for market recovery.

38231989,https://nulltx.com/?p=137070,1735402557,Top Coins to Invest in This Week: Your Guide to December 2024’s 4 Most Promising Cryptos,"Cryptocurrencies are all the rage, but with so many options, where do you start? As December comes to a close, savvy investors are hunting for the best coins to invest in this week, looking for projects with strong fundamentals, promising ROI, and innovative features. From long-standing giants like Solana ($SOL) to game-changing presale stars like Qubetics ($TICS), the market is brimming with opportunities. Qubetics ($TICS) is a standout this month, tackling real-world problems that many crypto pioneers failed to address. Paired with cutting-edge features like decentralised VPN (dVPN) and real-world asset tokenisation, $TICS offers a fresh take on crypto utility. Let’s dive into why Qubetics ($TICS), Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot made this exclusive list. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Presale Powerhouse Qubetics ($TICS) is leading the charge in December’s crypto scene. With its 14th presale stage underway, $TICS has already raised over $7.9 million, welcomed more than 12,100 holders, and sold an impressive 379 million tokens at just $0.0377 each. But numbers aside, what really makes Qubetics ($TICS) shine is its innovative applications that go beyond the basics. One standout feature is its decentralised VPN (dVPN), designed to ensure private, secure internet browsing. Imagine a journalist covering sensitive stories in restrictive regions. With Qubetics ($TICS)’ dVPN, they can operate safely, knowing their data isn’t being tracked or intercepted. Businesses too can benefit—think of companies handling sensitive client information. The dVPN bridges a crucial gap between convenience and security. The cherry on top? Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a 630.20% ROI. At $15 post-mainnet launch, that same investment could skyrocket to 43,711.73% ROI. For an $8,500 stake today, you’d potentially rake in over $3.7 million. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics ($TICS) offers a presale price that’s hard to ignore, a user-centric vision, and real-world applications designed to bridge gaps in both personal and professional domains. 2.

As of December 27, 2024, Solana remains a favourite among developers and investors alike, standing tall as one of the best coins to invest in this week. Take gaming platforms, for instance. Solana’s high throughput allows developers to build seamless, real-time experiences for players worldwide. Imagine a global tournament where players can mint in-game assets without delays or outrageous fees. That’s Solana’s magic in action. Beyond gaming, its integration into DeFi protocols is another major draw. Solana supports decentralised exchanges and lending platforms, making it a cornerstone for financial innovation. With its active developer community and consistent upgrades, $SOL continues to show strong long-term potential. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched scalability, developer-friendly ecosystem, and strong adoption make it a must-watch for December’s investors. 3. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Multi-Chain Maestro Avalanche ($AVAX) has earned its spot as one of the most scalable and interoperable blockchains in the market. Its unique consensus mechanism allows developers to create subnets tailored to their specific needs, making Avalanche a darling among enterprises and institutions. Picture a multinational company wanting its own blockchain network to manage supply chains. Avalanche’s architecture makes this not just possible, but practical. Additionally, $AVAX supports decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFT projects with efficiency that rivals giants like Ethereum. As of December 27, 2024, Avalanche is showing consistent growth, with increasing integrations and adoption across multiple sectors. Its ability to support complex use cases while maintaining low fees has made it a top performer this month. Why did this coin make it to this list? Avalanche’s versatility, strong partnerships, and consistent performance cement its position as a top crypto to watch this week. 4. Polkadot ($DOT): The Interoperability King Polkadot ($DOT) is all about breaking down barriers in the blockchain world. Known for its parachain model, Polkadot allows different blockchains to communicate seamlessly, creating an interconnected network of specialised chains. Consider a decentralised finance app that wants to interact with a supply chain management system. Polkadot makes this possible without the usual headaches of building from scratch. Its focus on interoperability has made it a favourite for both developers and enterprises seeking cross-chain solutions. As of December 27, 2024, $DOT continues to roll out new parachains and expand its ecosystem, proving its resilience in a competitive market. Its commitment to solving interoperability challenges ensures its relevance for years to come. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s mission to create a seamless blockchain network and its steady progress in achieving this vision make it an essential addition to any savvy investor’s portfolio. Conclusion: Seize the Moment Qubetics ($TICS), Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot each bring unique strengths to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics ($TICS)’ presale buzz and innovative features, Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, Avalanche’s multi-chain flexibility, or Polkadot’s seamless interoperability, these coins represent some of the best coins to invest in this week.

Early identification of promising altcoins can lead to significant rewards when the market heats up. This article explores little-known cryptocurrencies that could see substantial gains ahead of the anticipated 2025 altcoin explosion. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum’s legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 — a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 — an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren’t cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What’s Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the “old guard” is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite’s reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that’s designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits — Don’t miss out! Is Arbitrum (ARB) Set for a Bounce? Oversold Indicators Suggest Potential Rise Arbitrum (ARB) has seen a recent price decline, with a one-week drop of 12.76% and a one-month decrease of 17.06%. The current price ranges between $0.59 and $0.98, sitting below both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.76 and $0.78. However, technical indicators like the RSI at 25.88 and Stochastic at 9.34 suggest oversold conditions, indicating a potential price rebound. If buying pressure increases, ARB could test the nearest resistance level at $1.21, representing a possible gain of over 20%. Nevertheless, if bearish momentum continues, it may fall to the nearest support at $0.44. Hashflow (HFT) Oversold: Is a Price Rebound Imminent? Hashflow (HFT) has fallen 12.48% in the past week, trading between $0.15 and $0.27. Indicators suggest the coin is oversold, which could signal a rebound. The nearest support is at $0.10, with resistance at $0.35. If HFT climbs to $0.35, it could gain over 30%. Both the 10-day and 100-day average prices are $0.21, indicating a possible stabilization. The 6-month price change is nearly flat at 0.05%, showing long-term steadiness. Jito (JTO) Eyes Resistance After Recent Gains: Is a Breakout Looming? Jito (JTO) has seen a 6.72% price increase over the past week, trading between $2.41 and $3.61. The 10-day Simple Moving Average of $3.18 is slightly above the 100-day average of $3.12, indicating steady momentum. The Relative Strength Index stands at 50.10, suggesting a neutral market. With the Stochastic at 25.95, Jito is approaching oversold territory, which might signal an upcoming rise. If the price breaks the nearest resistance at $4.33, it could climb toward the second resistance at $5.53, offering potential gains. However, the MACD level of -0.012 hints at caution. Traders are watching to see if Jito will continue its upward trend or retest support levels. Conclusion While ARB, HFT, and JTO show limited short-term potential, Graphite Token (@G) stands out as a promising project. It powers the Graphite L1 blockchain, which aims to make crypto simpler and faster. Graphite addresses issues like high fees on Ethereum and outages on Solana by offering fair transaction costs and a reliable network. Its unique Trust Score system enhances user confidence, and its reward model allows entry-point nodes to earn 50% of transaction fees. With strong security through Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite sets new standards for reliability. For early investors, it offers a chance to engage with a project designed for lasting utility and growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is changing the way we think about digital exchanges. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, it employs a unique structure called the Tangle—a multi-dimensional network that securely records direct transfers of data and value. This open-source platform invites individuals, businesses, and institutions to engage in Web3 with tools for creating smart contracts, minting tokens, and more. With the upcoming IOTA 2.0 upgrade in 2024, the network aims to achieve full decentralization, enhancing its usability and security. In today's market, IOTA stands out with its innovative approach. While many cryptocurrencies rely on older blockchain methods, IOTA's Tangle offers scalability and efficiency. Its focus on enabling decentralized applications and digital identities positions it well in a space that's increasingly valuing real-world use cases. Compared to other coins, IOTA's commitment to building a secure and open infrastructure could make it an attractive option for those interested in the future of the digital economy. Starknet (STRK) Starknet is changing how we think about transactions on the Ethereum network. By using a technology called zero-knowledge rollups, specifically ""STARK"", it handles transactions off the main chain. This approach makes transactions faster and cheaper. Developers can use Cairo, a special coding language, to build on Starknet easily. In November 2021, Starknet launched its first block, and its native token, STRK, is set to launch in February 2024. STRK will be used for fees, staking, and helping the community make decisions about the network. As the demand for quicker and more affordable blockchain solutions grows, Starknet stands out. Its use of sequencers and provers means it can process many transactions efficiently before adding them to Ethereum's mainnet. Compared to other coins, STRK's focus on scalability and low costs is timely in today's market. With strong backing and a team experienced in privacy-focused technology, Starknet's approach offers something fresh. For those watching market trends, STRK might be an attractive option due to its innovative technology and the growing need for scalable solutions in the crypto space. Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter is making waves in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), especially on the Solana blockchain. It's the most popular platform for swapping tokens, bringing together different exchanges to make trades smooth and efficient. Starting with helping people swap tokens easily, Jupiter has grown to offer more. Now, it includes futures trading, similar to what GMX offers, and is getting ready to launch its own stablecoin. This stablecoin aims to avoid the risks that come with holding funds with other parties or dealing with strict regulations. On January 31, 2024, Jupiter plans to reward its early users with a big airdrop of one billion JUP tokens. Nearly 955,000 wallets will receive these tokens, showing appreciation for the community's support. This move, along with its new features and the introduction of the JUP token for governance, positions Jupiter for significant growth in Solana's network. As it continues to innovate, Jupiter looks attractive in the current market. Its focus on efficiency and safety could set it apart from other coins and platforms, making it a project to watch in the evolving DeFi space. Quant (QNT) Quant (QNT) is making waves by aiming to connect different blockchains around the world. Launched in June 2018, it seeks to bridge the gap between various networks without losing speed or compatibility. At its core is the Overledger Network, an operating system built for blockchains. This system lets developers create decentralized applications that work across multiple chains, called MApps. To build these MApps, developers need to hold Quant tokens. Quant's potential lies in solving the problem of interoperability. While many cryptocurrencies operate on separate chains, Quant focuses on linking them together. This approach could pave the way for a more connected digital economy. In the current market, as interest grows in decentralized apps and cross-chain solutions, Quant stands out. Compared to other coins that stay within their own networks, Quant's goal of unifying blockchains makes it a project to watch. Market trends show a shift toward greater connectivity, and Quant is positioned to play a key role in that future. Conclusion While IOTA, STRK, JUP, and QNT offer potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin targeting 20,000% growth with its unique community-driven ecosystem.

38231855,https://nulltx.com/?p=137035,1735402203,Ethereum Price Forecast: Could ETH Smash $4000 as Jetbolt Gains Strength?,"Amid the recent crypto market shifts, all eyes are on Ethereum’s (ETH) price movement. Ethereum takes center stage as investors speculate about a potential break out for ETH, with the goal to smash $4000. Behind this optimism is the speculation that Ethereum’s resurgence could trigger the long-awaited altseason, potentially leading to widespread gains for the entire altcoin market. Meanwhile, a young altcoin shares the crypto spotlight as it presents its groundbreaking zero-gas technology and innovative Web3 utilities: JetBolt (JBOLT). Beyond expectations, its presale has soared over 200 million tokens sold since launch. As JetBolt gains strength amidst market uncertainties, can Ethereum rise to the challenge to hit $4000? Let’s dive into the dynamics and thrilling developments surrounding Ethereum alongside JetBolt’s growing popularity and adoption. Ethereum: Could ETH smash $4000? Ethereum (ETH) is trading as of press time at $3,367.95. With a market cap of over $400 billion, ETH continues to hold the second spot in the list of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and is still the world’s second-most famous blockchain network, next to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s Price chart courtesy of Trading View Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum suffered major declines when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates and as the market slumped post-Christmas. ETH’s price is down by 4.48% over the past two days, and still more than 30% away from its all-time high of $4,800 achieved in November 2021. On the flipside, Ethereum has posted a year-to-date growth of over 50%, sparking analysts to remain optimistic about the future of the asset. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently discussed ETH’s formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern in the four-hour timeframe, a classic indication of a breakout. He said that Ethereum must break upward from the triangle formation to breach the $3,980 bullish target. But Ethereum faces resistance at the $3,550 level, a critical price point analysts and investors are eager for ETH to surpass, reflecting renewed bullish momentum. Ethereum’s derivatives maintained levels the same as last week, with monthly contracts trading with an 11% premium over the spot market, slightly above the 5%-10% neutral range. Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) has held steady at around 20 million ETH over the past two weeks, highlighting its resilience. While ETH maxis remain optimistic about its breakout, with positive derivatives and on-chain metrics, hitting $4000 will also depend on the macro economic performance, and how Ethereum could defend or break the $3,550 critical level. JetBolt: Gaining ground with zero-gas innovation and Web3 utilities Navigating through the crypto labyrinth of waves and tides, the young altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) continues to gain traction, with a growing popularity and market appeal fueled by its cutting-edge technologies and utility-driven solutions. Leveraging the Skale Network, JetBolt offers zero-gas technology, a defining feature that eliminates the barrier of gas fees. Everyday users and developers no longer need to worry about hefty gas costs, enhancing blockchain’s appeal to a wider range of audience. JetBolt offers an AI-driven aggregation tool that delivers crypto news and market development updates. In addition, JetBolt’s user-friendly Web3 wallet makes entry simple and smooth, using advanced features like WebAuthN and facial recognition. There are also enticing incentives that await early buyers, including daily price increases and special offers that grant up to 25% more tokens, when they avail of the Alpha Boxes or JBOLT token bundle deals. Despite being a new player, JetBolt is rapidly making its mark in the crypto space, offering its unique blend of technology-powered features and real-world usability. With such appealing advantages, JetBolt is gaining ground as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Final Thoughts: Could ETH Smash $4000 as Jetbolt Gains Strength? Supported by positive derivative markets and strong on-chain metrics, Ethereum reaching the $4000 mark may be possible in the long term. Key factors such as the broader global economy and Ethereum ecosystem’s ability to defend or break key resistance levels, will play significant roles. Meanwhile, JetBolt’s technology-powered features and utility-driven innovations continue to showcase its strength, driving its rapid ascent. With focus on enhancing blockchain users’ experience, JetBolt is solidifying its position as one of the stand out altcoins for 2025, alongside established players like Ethereum.

The potential of SOL is significant. Since it underpins the entire Solana ecosystem, its value is tied to the network's success. Solana avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it has built a high-capacity network capable of handling lots of activity.

As more projects choose Solana for its performance advantages, SOL could see increased demand compared to other coins.

Using a special way of agreeing on transactions, it finalizes them in under two seconds. This makes it one of the quickest blockchains around. Avalanche also lets users create custom blockchains, called Subnets, which can be tailored to specific needs. Its three chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—work together to handle everything from simple transactions to smart contracts. In today's crypto market, AVAX, the token of Avalanche, looks promising. It's useful for payments, securing the network through staking, and running Subnets. While some other coins struggle with high fees and slow speeds, Avalanche offers a better alternative. Its focus on being environmentally friendly fits with the global move towards sustainability. As more people look for fast and scalable blockchain solutions, Avalanche could stand out. Compared to older blockchains that can't easily scale, Avalanche's technology might make it an attractive option for investors and users alike. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) PENGU is the official coin of Pudgy Penguins, a vibrant community that has become the face of crypto.

Make All Your Wishes Come True with the XYZ winning team! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has been a game-changer in the world of blockchain since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. Known for enabling smart contracts and hosting a wide array of decentralized apps (dApps), it has paved the way for innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used for various purposes including governance and value storage. Even with these tokens, ETH is still needed for transaction fees. The shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 made the network more efficient. Upcoming features like sharding are set to improve speed and reduce costs, showing Ethereum's dedication to growth and decentralization. Ether (ETH) remains at the core of this ecosystem, powering transactions and rewarding those who help maintain the network. Looking at past price trends and Bitcoin's halving cycles, predictions suggest that ETH could hit a low of $2,700.31 in 2025 and might reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. In today's market, Ethereum's ongoing upgrades and its key role in DeFi and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. Its continuous innovation and strong community support position it well for the future, making it an intriguing option in the current market cycle. Solana (SOL) Solana is making waves in the blockchain world. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana focuses on speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Developers appreciate its flexibility, as it supports multiple programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL isn't just another coin; it's the fuel that powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is significant. Since it underpins the entire Solana ecosystem, its value is tied to the network's success. Solana avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it has built a high-capacity network capable of handling lots of activity. This approach makes it attractive to developers and investors looking for speed and efficiency. In the current market cycle, SOL stands out due to its technology and growth potential. As more projects choose Solana for its performance advantages, SOL could see increased demand compared to other coins. Ethena (ENA) In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Ethena introduces ENA – a synthetic dollar built on Ethereum. Unlike traditional stablecoins tied to bank reserves, ENA offers a crypto-native solution that doesn't rely on banks. This innovation ensures greater decentralization and brings to life the 'Internet Bond', a global dollar savings tool. By using Ethereum's blockchain, ENA aims to provide stability and easy access, making digital transactions smoother and more reliable. Right now, ENA looks like an attractive option for those seeking stability in the volatile crypto market. With worries about fiat-backed stablecoins and regulatory hurdles facing other cryptocurrencies, ENA's approach stands out. It offers a decentralized alternative that's independent of traditional finance, which could be appealing in uncertain times. Compared to coins like Tether or USDC, which depend on reserves held by banks, ENA's synthetic method may offer more transparency and strength. As the crypto market grows up, innovations like ENA could lead the way to a more stable and accessible digital economy. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance is reshaping the way we think about investing. It combines the stability of traditional finance with the speed and transparency of blockchain technology. By turning stable, income-generating real-world assets into tokens, Ondo opens the door for more people to access high-quality financial products. Its unique approach uses blockchain to make financial systems more efficient and accessible. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products, and a technology arm that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Together, they enhance the functionality and scalability of Ondo's offerings. In a market often plagued by volatility and mistrust, Ondo stands out by prioritizing security and transparency. It partners with well-known firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for safe crypto asset custody. Products like USDY showcase Ondo's commitment to quality. USDY offers the ease of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits. For non-U.S. investors seeking regulated and transparent financial products, Ondo presents an attractive option. While the crypto market cycles through ups and downs, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance could give it an edge over other coins. Its blend of traditional finance with blockchain might make it a strong contender in the current market landscape. Conclusion ETH, SOL, ENA, and ONDO are promising, but XYZVerse's sports-meme blend and live presale offer early adopters a chance at 20,000% growth in a community-driven movement.

Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 42.03 and a stochastic value of 22.76 indicate that Toncoin is nearing oversold territory, which often precedes price increases.

The agency says it will be sending the funds by the end of the month to eligible individuals who did not claim the Recovery Rebate Credit, a refundable credit for taxpayers who did not get coronavirus-related stimulus payments on their 2021 tax returns. According to the IRS, some of the eligible Americans will receive up to $1,400. “No action is needed for eligible taxpayers to receive these payments, which will go out automatically in December and should arrive in most cases by late January 2025. The payments will be automatically direct-deposited or sent by paper check; eligible taxpayers will also receive a separate letter notifying them of the payment.” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel says the federal agency’s internal data shows that one million taxpayers “overlooked claiming” the Recovery Rebate Credit even though they were eligible. “To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we’re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it.” Americans who haven’t filed their 2021 tax returns will also be eligible for a share of the $2.4 billion if they file the same by April 15th of 2025. “Qualified taxpayers are those who filed a 2021 tax return, but where the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit was left blank or was filled out as $0 when the taxpayer was actually eligible for the credit.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Predictions for 2025 Exponential Growth Ahead Analysts predict that Lightchain AI will experience significant growth in 2025 as it achieves key milestones. The upcoming launch of its testnet in January 2025 is expected to validate the platform’s scalability and performance, boosting investor confidence. Additionally, the platform’s ecosystem is anticipated to grow through developer incentives and strategic partnerships with enterprises, further driving adoption and expanding its reach. With its low presale price and innovative features, Lightchain AI is positioned to attract strong investor interest, which could result in a dramatic price surge. Some forecasts even suggest the token could see a 50x to 100x increase, making it one of the most promising projects for the coming year. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Both have earned their place in the memecoin hall of fame, with DOGE gaining early fame as the “people’s cryptocurrency” and SHIB proving the power of community-driven projects. But as we look toward 2025, the question remains: Which of these tokens has the potential to break the $0.01 barrier and emerge as the dominant memecoin? While SHIB and DOGE may dominate headlines, a new wave of meme tokens like BEERBEAR is challenging these established players with a mix of innovation, gamification, and rewarding ecosystems.

Meanwhile, SHIB has leveraged its robust ecosystem, including its ShibaSwap platform and planned metaverse expansions. However, as the memecoin space becomes more competitive, their path to $0.01 is far from guaranteed. Newer tokens like BEERBEAR are capitalizing on the gaps left by legacy memecoins, offering tangible utilities, gamification, and community-driven innovation. BEERBEAR, with its emphasis on fighting scammers and rewarding holders, demonstrates how modern memecoins can evolve beyond hype to build sustainable ecosystems. This blend of fun, functionality, and financial opportunity could position it as a strong contender to dominate the market in the coming years.

For investors looking to ride the next wave of innovation, BEERBEAR offers a refreshing alternative with its unique gamified ecosystem and commitment to transparency. As 2025 approaches, the memecoin battle is set to intensify, and BEERBEAR might just be the underdog that surprises everyone.

After six years of holding, Dogecoin investors saw explosive growth that catapulted the meme coin into mainstream fame. However, the market is shifting, and new players like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are offering opportunities for similar returns in a fraction of the time. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , LCAI combines artificial intelligence and blockchain innovation to redefine decentralized applications. The question now is whether Lightchain AI can deliver six years of DOGE-like gains in just six months. From Meme Coin to Intelligent Innovation While Dogecoin rose to prominence as the people’s cryptocurrency with community-driven hype, Lightchain AI enters the market with a vastly different approach. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism transforms blockchain operations by rewarding nodes for performing AI tasks, such as model training and inference. This innovative system combines security, utility, and eco-friendliness in one solution. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) tailored to industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. With 40% of its total token supply allocated to the presale, LCAI offers a low entry price and a future built on cutting-edge technology, making it a standout option for those seeking rapid growth. The Patience of DOGE vs. The Speed of LCAI Dogecoin’s meteoric rise took years, fueled by viral marketing and celebrity endorsements, but it lacks the technological depth of modern blockchains. It relies on Proof of Work, which limits scalability and energy efficiency. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s deflationary tokenomics and innovative infrastructure position it as a faster-growing alternative. A portion of LCAI transaction fees is burned, creating long-term scarcity and value appreciation. By focusing on scalability, decentralized governance, and real-world utility, Lightchain AI bypasses the speculative nature of Dogecoin to offer sustainable growth potential. Investors looking for faster returns with a solid technological foundation may find Lightchain AI a compelling choice. Could Lightchain AI Match DOGE’s Gains in Six Months? Lightchain AI’s potential lies in its ability to merge AI and blockchain technologies to create a platform with broad market appeal. While Dogecoin capitalized on humor and hype, LCAI is addressing real-world challenges with its AIVM and PoI consensus mechanism. Industries requiring advanced computational tools are likely to adopt Lightchain AI, driving its value upward. With its presale generating significant attention and a token price poised for rapid appreciation, Lightchain AI is on track to achieve returns that could rival Dogecoin’s, but in a fraction of the time. For investors seeking high growth within a short timeframe, Lightchain AI presents a revolutionary opportunity. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, the spotlight is shifting toward Lightchain AI (LCAI), whose presale is attracting the attention of DOT whales. Priced at just $0.0041, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining traction with its innovative AI-integrated blockchain technology and unique ecosystem features. This surge of interest indicates that even DOT’s most loyal supporters are diversifying into LCAI , a project poised for exponential growth. With projections of an $80x surge for Polkadot and the explosive potential of Lightchain AI, both tokens are drawing considerable attention from investors. Lightchain AI’s Appeal Beyond Interoperability to Industry Disruption While Polkadot focuses on cross-chain communication and interoperability, Lightchain AI takes blockchain technology further by integrating artificial intelligence. One standout feature is adaptive task allocation, which ensures that computational resources are utilized optimally across the network. This approach not only boosts efficiency but also expands the platform’s potential for enterprise applications. In industries like predictive analytics and logistics, Lightchain AI uses decentralized AI models to improve decision-making processes. For example, its platform can process complex datasets in real-time, providing insights that traditional blockchain systems like Polkadot cannot offer. This ability to tackle real-world challenges gives Lightchain AI a broader scope and a competitive edge in emerging markets. Polkadot’s Strength in Interoperability and Its Limitations Polkadot’s special design lets many blockchains run in a single network, making it popular for projects that need easy sharing of data between chains. Its parachain setup helps separate blockchains link up while keeping their own control, which makes a very ͏large system. This has made Polkadot a top choice in helping blockchains work together But, Polkadot's goal stays mostly techy, looking to boost blockchain setup without going into special uses. While this skill attracts makers, it misses out on chances in fields needing smart solutions, where Lightchain AI shines. The change in focus from DOT big holders to LCAI shows the rising need for places that deal with certain, strong use cases. Why DOT Whales Are Moving to Lightchain AI The influx of DOT whales into the Lightchain AI presale underscores the platform’s potential for higher returns and industry disruption. Lightchain AI’s dynamic pricing model, which adjusts fees based on task complexity, creates an economically sustainable environment, attracting enterprise clients and developers alike. This feature sets it apart from platforms like Polkadot, which prioritize network performance but lack similar economic adaptability. Lightchain AI’s projected growth is bolstered by its open governance model, empowering token holders to participate in key decisions. This inclusive approach fosters long-term engagement and positions the platform as a community-driven powerhouse. Combined with its $0.0041 presale price and innovations in decentralized intelligence, Lightchain AI offers a compelling investment case for DOT whales seeking diversification and rapid growth. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While Bitcoin’s steady rise signifies confidence in the market, the spotlight is shifting toward innovative projects capable of delivering exponential growth. Among them, Lightchain AI (LCAI) , Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) stand out as top contenders for a 70x surge, driven by unique technologies, robust ecosystems, and increasing adoption. These tokens combine cutting-edge utility and market traction, setting the stage for unprecedented returns before Bitcoin reaches its next milestone. Lightchain AI Fusion of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI introduces the innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, which rewards nodes for completing AI computations such as model training and optimization. This groundbreaking approach not only enhances network security but also improves efficiency, distinguishing it from traditional mechanisms. The project's comprehensive roadmap demonstrates a clear path to growth, with significant milestones including a testnet launch scheduled for January 2025 and mainnet activation by March 2025, showcasing its dedication to innovation and scalability. With robust tokenomics, the LCAI token's 10 billion supply is strategically allocated, ensuring sustainability and participation within the ecosystem. Additionally, Lightchain AI's strategic vision of integrating AI with blockchain technology addresses key challenges in scalability, governance, and privacy while emphasizing real-world applications. These elements, coupled with a strong development team, position it as a revolutionary force in decentralized intelligence. Cardano Slow and Steady Wins the Race Car͏dano (ADA) has got its place as the ""top student"" of the crypto world, due to its checked growth and focus on growth. With its green Proof of Stake (PoS) way and the Hydra more transactions fix in plan, its getting ready to deal with more deals than a Black Friday sale. Cardano is not just a one-hit wonder. Its expanding network and smart links are catching eyes in the DeFi and NFT spaces. Also, its green approach and ability to work with others gives it a great lead over rivals. As Bitcoin dances around $130K, don’t be shocked if Cardano grabs the center stage with some big business use charm. Who doesn’t like a dark horse that has both smarts and strength? Solana The Flash of the Crypto World If Cardano is the honors student, Solana (SOL) is the high-speed daredevil. Known for its jaw-dropping transaction speeds and bargain-bin fees, Solana is the go-to platform for DeFi pros and NFT enthusiasts who don’t have time—or money—to waste. Its Proof of History (PoH) tech, paired with PoS, keeps it cruising at warp speed, even under pressure. Sure, it’s had the occasional ""oops"" moment with network outages, but who hasn’t? Despite the hiccups, its developer-friendly vibes and rapidly expanding ecosystem keep it in the crypto A-list. As Bitcoin eyes $130K, Solana could be the one making waves, powering high-demand applications like a pro.

Leading the charge is BTFD Coin, whose presale performance has been nothing short of legendary, raising over $4.6 million and selling more than 60 billion coins across 6,900 holders. Meanwhile, Mog Coin (MOG) is luring in new investors with its viral appeal, and Baby Dogecoin (BABYDOGE) is levelling up with gaming features that have everyone talking. The cryptocurrency space hasn’t been this electric since Shiba Inu and SPX6900 redefined the culture. Over the years, meme coins have skyrocketed from being mere jokes to becoming a financial powerhouse. Think about Dogecoin’s massive surge or Shiba Inu’s entry into the top cryptos by market cap. These projects thrive on community power, viral campaigns, and real utility. Enter BTFD Coin — a project ready to revolutionise the meme coin space with its play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and referral programme. Analysts say BTFD is primed to redefine the genre, giving investors another reason to buy the dips. With every market dip, savvy investors sniff out opportunities. History proves this, especially during events like the 1973 global economic crash. As chaos gripped the markets, those who bought the dips often emerged wealthier. BTFD Coin embraces this spirit, blending meme culture with economic smarts, ensuring it’s not just a coin but a movement. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Movement Redefining Value If you’ve been watching the crypto presale scene, you’ve probably already heard of BTFD Coin. It’s not just riding the meme wave; it’s making waves of its own. With a name that cheekily nods to the famous trading mantra “buy the f****** dip,” BTFD isn’t just about humour; it’s about strategy. The presale has been flying off the shelves, crossing $4.6 million and selling over 60 billion coins to 6,900 eager investors. Currently, in Stage 13, the price per coin is $0.000142, with analysts predicting a post-presale listing price of $0.0006. Here’s why BTFD is the talk of the town. It’s not just another meme coin. It comes with real utility, including a highly anticipated P2E game, where players can earn rewards in BTFD tokens. Add to that the staking programme, where holders can grow their portfolios passively, and a referral system that rewards users for bringing in their mates. The buzz is justified. Think about this: if you invested $35,000 at the current presale price of $0.000142, you’d snag around 246,478,873 BTFD coins. Once the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would balloon to $147,887. Talk about a cheeky return on investment! With 16 stages in the presale, each stage sees a price hike. Early birds are clearly the winners here. And don’t forget the bonus code BIG50, which gifts you 50% extra coins when used. To join the BTFD revolution, head to the presale page , connect your wallet, apply the code, and lock in your purchase before prices climb higher. Mog Coin (MOG): A Viral Sensation with Real Staying Power Next up is Mog Coin (MOG), a project that’s capitalising on the meme coin formula with a fresh twist. Born out of internet culture, MOG leans heavily into its community’s strength, driving its value with viral campaigns and grassroots support. It’s the kind of coin that thrives on memes, tweets, and TikTok videos—a perfect recipe for the Gen Z and Millennial crowd. Mog Coin’s primary appeal is its relatability. With its cat-themed branding and no-nonsense vibe, it’s both accessible and endearing. It’s a reminder that crypto doesn’t always have to be overly technical or serious. However, what’s serious is MOG’s potential. With increasing listings on centralised exchanges and growing social media hype, analysts believe MOG is poised for a significant breakout. What sets Mog Coin apart is its unwavering commitment to community-driven growth. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely on large institutions or foundations, MOG thrives on its fans’ collective power. It’s proof that a shared vision and some cheeky memes can go a long way in the crypto world. Investors who got in early are already seeing substantial returns, but the project’s roadmap suggests there’s plenty of room to grow. From partnerships with influencers to charity initiatives supporting animal welfare, MOG is more than just a flash in the pan. It’s building a brand that could stand the test of time. Baby Dogecoin (BABYDOGE): Where Memes Meet Gaming Baby Dogecoin (BABYDOGE) has been a fan favourite since its launch, but it’s the recent pivot to gaming that’s got everyone’s attention. BABYDOGE is already well-known for its charitable efforts and strong community backing, but its entry into the gaming space marks a new chapter. The BABYDOGE gaming ecosystem aims to attract players and investors alike. By integrating play-to-earn mechanics, Baby Dogecoin has created a platform where users can have fun while earning rewards. This shift not only broadens its appeal but also adds real-world utility to a coin initially known for its meme value. Another standout feature is BABYDOGE’s deflationary model. With every transaction, a percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value over time. It’s a smart strategy that rewards long-term holders and creates a sense of exclusivity. But it’s not all about tech and utility. Baby Dogecoin remains true to its meme roots, with campaigns that tug at heartstrings and tickle funny bones. The gaming move is just another way the coin is staying ahead in a highly competitive market. Whether you’re in it for the laughs or the gains, BABYDOGE offers something for everyone.

Over the years, DOGE has gone from tipping currency to a major player in the market, even earning endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. DOGE’s strength lies in its simplicity. It’s not trying to be the next Ethereum or Bitcoin. Instead, it’s carved out its own lane as a fun, lighthearted coin with massive community backing. That community power has proven to be a driving force behind its price surges, making it a reliable contender during bull runs. But Dogecoin isn’t just about memes anymore. It’s making strides in real-world adoption, with merchants worldwide accepting it for everything from coffee to Tesla accessories. Developers are also working on scaling improvements, ensuring DOGE remains relevant as blockchain technology evolves.

38230524,https://thecoinrise.com/solana-co-founder-hit-with-lawsuit-amid-fraud-charges/,1735398934,Solana Co-Founder Hit With Lawsuit Amid Fraud Charges,"Stephen Akridge, co-founder of Solana , has been slammed with a lawsuit by his ex-wife, Elisa Rossi. The couple were married for 10 years before filing for divorce in 2023. However, Rossi has now filed legal claims that Akridge misappropriated “millions of dollars” in cryptocurrency. Allegations of Stolen Crypto Rewards According to the report , Rossi claims that the Solana co-founder stole “millions of dollars” from the gains from her digital wallet holdings of Solana (SOL). Notably, Akridge’s ex-wife accuses him of redirecting staking commissions from her holdings for his benefit. This is according to a complaint she filed at California Superior Court, San Francisco County. She alleged this happened between March and May 2023 after the couple filed for divorce in February. Rossi is now seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud, including undue enrichment. Akridge has been involved in other projects before co-founding Solana. He worked with Qualcomm Inc. as a principal engineer for the blockchain. Solana’s Historical Market Resurgence Solana has recorded interesting price development as it crashed from about $134 in 2022 to a low of $10 in the same year. The challenges resulted from the asset’s close association with now-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried and his trading firm, Alameda Research. However, SOL has moved past that ugly incident and sits among the top 10 crypto assets by market capitalization. Solana’s market capitalization stands at over $89.73 billion as the asset continues to make waves in the crypto sector. As of this writing, SOL is trading at $186.43, a 2.12% decline in the last 24 hours. The asset has witnessed increased price fluctuation that saw it plunge to a low of $177 and a high of $201. As the coin battles this market volatility, its trading volume has declined significantly by 21.98% to $2.15 billion. Solana’s Growing DeFi Appeal The Solana network has recently become a major attraction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Many developers are shifting from Ethereum to Solana , and the network has over 7,600 new developers. This figure flips those on Ethereum, a development analyst expects to reflect in the price outlook soon.

38230326,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27878,1735398840,National Bank of Cambodia Allows Banks to Process Cryptocurrencies for the First Time,"Regulating Crypto: What’s Allowed? On Dec. 27, the National Bank of Cambodia issued a groundbreaking announcement that – for the first time – would permit commercial banks and payment firms to process Category 1 crypto assets. Examples of such assets include, but are not limited to, stablecoins like USDC and USDT, and CBDCs. Unbacked cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other decentralized tokens, remain strictly prohibited under the new regulations. This move marks an important, yet judicious step in how Cambodia is handling the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies in zeroing in on digital assets backed by fiat currency. Conditions for Service Providers Banks and payment firms must first get formal permission from the NBC before engaging in any crypto-related service offerings. The approved entities can cash or sell digital currencies in traditional ones, transfer cryptos between accounts, and offer custody services related to such assets. However, the NBC has set strict rules to protect the clients. For example, financial institutions are not allowed to use their clients’ crypto assets for their own financial gain. This is a protective measure against the misappropriation of assets and in conformity with international standards on crypto regulations. A Cautious Shift Toward Digital Assets Cambodia earlier had a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency-related transactions due to perceived extreme volatility and tendencies for unlawful use, including money laundering and fraud. The latest move softens that stance, but the country is treading carefully by focusing on regulated, fiat-backed digital currencies instead of speculative assets. Wider Implications Cambodia’s move to regulated crypto services is part of a global trend. The territories at the forefront of the effort to incorporate digital currencies into their financial systems include Hong Kong, the U.S., and the UAE. Still, Cambodia has only recently started down the path of adoption and regulation. Challenges to Adoption Despite this development, the regulatory framework of Cambodia has remained restrictive. The country was blocking 16 major crypto exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, earlier this month after those failed to secure licenses from its Securities and Exchange Regulator. Yet, Cambodian officials believe that digital currencies have a potential to contribute to strengthening the local currency-the Cambodian riel-and decreasing dependence on the U.S. dollar. This strategic approach has marked Cambodia’s intention to balance financial innovation with risk management and paved the way for further developments in its crypto ecosystem.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/national-bank-cambodia-allows-banks-cryptocurrencies/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

One standout opportunity is the Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to a promising project at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Alongside Lightchain AI, the following five cryptocurrencies are worth considering for those aiming to build a millionaire portfolio in the upcoming market surge. Lightchain AI Perfect Blend of Blockchain and AI Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly gaining recognition as a blockchain project that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology. With its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), the platform allows developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) that cater to real-world needs like predictive modeling, automation, and decision-making. Currently priced at just $0.0041 in its presale , Lightchain AI offers an attractive entry point for early investors. Its roadmap includes major milestones such as the testnet launch in January 2025, which will validate its scalability, and the mainnet rollout in March 2025, expected to drive significant adoption. With innovative features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and deflationary tokenomics, Lightchain AI is a promising candidate for exponential growth in the next bull run. Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin Major Players for Investment Ether (ETH), XRP and Lite coin (LTC) are well-known digital coins, each one give special worth for buyers. Ether, the second-biggest digital coin, supports open apps and smart deals. Its move to a staking method has made it work better and use less power͏ grabbing major money support. Ether-based investment things have also caught good cash, showing more trust. XRP made by Ripple Labs helps quick, cheap transactions between countries. Even with rules being tough, XRP has stayed strong, with it price reaching $1 in November 2024 showing new interest from buyers. Litecoin, which is known as the ""silver for Bitcoin's gold,"" gives quicker trades and has a limited amount of coins, which makes it great for daily use. Experts think Litecoin-centered ETFs will get green light in 2025, making it more attractive as an investment. These cryptocurrencies offer diverse opportunities for investors in the evolving digital asset market. Cardano's Push for Scalability and Interoperability Cardano is improving scalability and interoperability to support its growing user base and enable seamless blockchain interactions. Key solutions include Hydra, a Layer 2 scaling solution that creates multiple sidechains to boost transaction throughput and reduce latency. In June 2024, Cardano integrated the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol, connecting it to over 115 blockchains for enhanced cross-chain transactions and data exchanges. Powered by the Ouroboros Consensus Algorithm, a proof-of-stake protocol, Cardano ensures efficient transaction processing and encourages network participation. These advancements position Cardano as a scalable and adaptable platform for the evolving blockchain ecosystem. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This Low-Cap Crypto Could Turn $1,000 Into $50k","The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to incredible gains, but finding the next big opportunity early is often the key to maximizing returns. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) —a low-cap crypto gem that has caught the attention of analysts and investors alike. With its innovative approach to blockchain technology and a presale price of just $0.0041, Lightchain AI offers a rare chance for exponential growth. Experts are predicting that an investment of $1,000 today could transform into a potential $50,000 as this project gains momentum and adoption. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised for Exponential Growth Lightchain AI (LCAI) isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a next-gen platform combining AI and blockchain technology. By powering AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps), it stands out with a focus on scalability, efficiency, and real-world utility. With a starting presale price of $0.0041, Lightchain AI offers an accessible entry point for early investors, with significant growth expected as the project progresses. At its core is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), enabling developers to build AI-driven dApps for automation, predictive modeling, and optimization. Its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus rewards meaningful computational contributions, creating a secure and productive network. Lightchain AI presents a promising opportunity for those seeking both short-term gains and long-term innovation. Roadmap to Success For Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is advancing through a structured roadmap to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology effectively. The trip started in November 2024 with a Prototype Growth phase, which aimed at making and trying out key parts like a Proof of Smartness (PoS) agreement tool and the Artificial Smart Machine (ASM). This stage also brought a developer portal to involve early use͏rs. By January 2025, a project began the Testnet Rollout stage, letting community to use its main systems. Developers and node operators took part by running the testnet, checking token staking methods and doing AI tasks using a AIVM. The Mainnet start is set for March 2025, marking the opening of PoI and AIVM and growing partnerships. Next steps will look at ecosystem growth, and global use in all of 2025. Turning $1,000 Into $50,000 Investing in Lightchain AI at its current presale price offers a unique opportunity for significant returns. As the platform gains traction and adoption grows, analysts predict the token’s value could increase 50x or more, presenting a highly attractive prospect for early investors. At the current presale price of $0.0041, a $1,000 investment would secure over 243,000 tokens. If Lightchain AI reaches a value of just $0.20 per token, that initial investment could turn into over $48,600—a potential increase of 4860%. Analysts also predict that as the platform gains more partnerships and real-world use cases , it could potentially reach even higher values. And with the growth of AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to become a major player in both industries. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While XRP thrives on its role in the financial sector, BeerBear taps into the growing appeal of gamified ecosystems and community-driven platforms. The $BEAR token offers users an engaging way to earn, play, and invest, bridging the gap between fun and financial growth. This innovative approach makes BeerBear a strong contender for massive adoption, even as XRP remains a trusted stalwart. Both projects highlight a crucial trend in 2025: diversification.

With its presale price at just $0.0041, Lightchain AI is positioned as a next-generation blockchain platform poised to lead in scalability, utility, and real-world applications. Polkadot’s 300% Surge: What’s Driving It? Polkadot (DOT) is a main part in the crypto world, giving a very usabl͏e network with its parachain system. This lets easy links between other blockchains. Many reasons are pushing the positive view for DOT. The ongoing growth of parachains boosts Polkadot’s use by luring in more builders and plans to its system. Its skill to help cross-chain talks puts Polkadot as a chief in solving the piecemeal problem in the crypto field. Plus, as de-centralized finance (DeFi) keeps getting bigger, Polkadot’s flexible setup is pulling in rules wanting strong networks.

Experts are predicting the Bitcoin price to rise to a $260,000 all-time high in 2025. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) is predicted to reach $7, and the new presale token WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to rise to $15 from its $0.0243 price.

The new wallet solution aims to make institutional wallet technology accessible to everyone at the retail level. This implies that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will aid crypto adoption in the next bull market and could also drive huge demand for the native WLTQ token.

Cardano (ADA) Is Ready To Rise Alongside Bitcoin Price In This Bull Run The Bitcoin price prediction of $260,000 sets the stage for a Cardano (ADA) surge to $7. The current market cycle promises new all-time highs on popular altcoins and the Bitcoin price despite the recent bearish wave. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price is at $93,565, showing a 12% price decrease in the past week. The Bitcoin price correction trend is coming right after a rally to the new $108,173 all-time high, so investors are hopeful for a bullish rebound on the coin. On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is a much smaller cryptocurrency poised to see higher returns in this bull run. As of this writing, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.8923 with a $31 billion market cap. While Cardano (ADA) had not been impressive all year long, the cryptocurrency only picked up following the US elections in November. Cardano (ADA) rose from $0.3 to a $1.2 two-year high following Trump’s victory in the election, especially after news of a possible partnership between the new administration and Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson. In light of the development, experts are predicting a possible Cardano (ADA) surge to $7, and investors are looking to capitalize on that opportunity. Conclusion Investors are watching Cardano (ADA) and the Bitcoin price for promising market trends but are even more impressed by WallitIQ (WLTQ) amid the $7 predictions. The new project is set to deliver impressive market gains this year with a growing demand for AI assets.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Poised For 35% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News price decline it has experienced over the last few weeks. As of today, December 28, 2024, WIF has begun experiencing upward momentum, with the price surge standing out notably compared to other assets. The significant price surge in WIF can be explained by the recent breakout of the descending price action pattern, interest from long-term holders, and the shift in market sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. Dogwifhat (WIF) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, WIF has not only broken out of a descending price action pattern but has also successfully retested its crucial support level of $1.80. This recent support for WIF is the third occurrence since November 2024. Source: Trading View WIF Price Prediction Based on historical price momentum, whenever the meme coin reaches this level, it experiences buying pressure and notable upside momentum. This time, experts and analysts anticipate a similar kind of upside momentum in the future. Based on the recent price action, if WIF successfully breaches the descending triangle price action pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $1.945 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach the $2.65 mark in the future. WIF’s bullish thesis will only hold if it successfully breaches and closes a candle above the inclined trendline, otherwise, it may fail. $16 Million Worth of WIF Outflow Besides this bullish price action, investors and long-term holders have continuously been accumulating the tokens despite the price struggling to gain momentum, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data from WIF spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges across the cryptocurrency landscape have witnessed an outflow of a significant $16 million in WIF meme coins. The term “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses, which potentially indicates upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. Current Price Momentum At press time, WIF is trading near $1.92 and has experienced upward momentum of over 4% in the past 24 hours.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Here’s What to Know,"The European cryptocurrency market is set for a seismic change as the Crypto Asset Markets Regulation (MICAr) comes into full force on December 30, 2024. The delisting of Tether’s USDT from most centralized European exchanges is among the most significant changes that have stirred fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Here’s what it means for crypto users, businesses, and the future of digital assets. MICAr stands for Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation. This comprehensive regulatory framework sets licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses in the European Union (EU), including “transitional rules” that facilitate compliance across EU member states. MICAr essentially creates a transparent environment for crypto activities by requiring Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for crypto transactions and wallets. While advocates see this as a step towards legitimacy of the market, critics argue that it could stifle innovation and invade privacy. MICAr is also expected to impact global crypto regulation, with the US and other countries likely to adopt similar rules in the near future. What Will Change Within the Scope of MICAr? Travel Rule Travel Rule, bir AB lisansı altında faaliyet gösteren kripto para işletmelerinin, boyutlarına bakılmaksızın tüm işlemler için hem gönderenlerin hem de alıcıların kimliklerini toplamasını ve paylaşmasını zorunlu kılacak. Bu kural aşağıdakiler için geçerlidir: Exchange transactions: Exchanges will share users' personal data during transfers. Hot and cold wallets: Even personal wallets should be tied to verified identities, giving authorities and exchanges full visibility of transactions. Critics argue that such extensive data collection increases the risk of privacy violations and data leaks. Related News: Veteran Analyst il Capo Reveals He's Buying More of This Altcoin After Today's Rally Tether (USDT) Delisting One of the most immediate impacts of MICAr is the delisting of Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap. USDT will no longer be available on most centralized exchanges in Europe from December 30. While USDC (USD Coin) has been deemed compliant and will remain in use, the loss of USDT could disrupt trading pairs and liquidity. More stablecoins could follow, potentially reducing options for users in the EU. What Does This Mean for Users? Exchange-to-Exchange Transfers: Personal data will now accompany every transaction. This lack of anonymity raises concerns about where private information might go and how securely it will be handled. Hot and Cold Wallets: Tying wallets to identities undermines the privacy that crypto wallets have traditionally offered. Even offline wallets that do not provide direct on-ramps for fiat currency will face KYC requirements. MICAr advocates argue that tighter regulations will combat criminal activity like money laundering and tax evasion. But research shows that personal wallets do not significantly contribute to these risks because they do not involve fiat currency coming in and out. Critics argue that the measures disproportionately affect privacy-conscious users and set a worrying precedent for global crypto governance. *This is not investment advice.

This time, a phishing campaign centered around fake Zoom meeting links has left victims counting massive losses in cryptocurrency. Fake Zoom Invites Mask Malware A recent report by blockchain security firm SlowMist detailed a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting cryptocurrency users through fake Zoom meeting links. The attack has reportedly resulted in the theft of millions of digital assets. It involved the use of a fraudulent domain resembling the authentic one. This site mimicked the genuine Zoom interface to trick unassuming victims into downloading a malicious installation package. Once executed, the malware prompted users to enter their system passwords which enabled the collection of sensitive information such as KeyChain data, browser credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet details. Upon analysis, SlowMist said that it identified the malware’s code as a modified osascript script. The script extracted and encrypted user data before transmitting it to a hacker-controlled server flagged as malicious by threat intelligence platforms. The server’s IP address was traced to the Netherlands, and the attackers’ monitoring tools, including logs showing Russian script usage, suggest a connection to Russian-speaking operatives. On-chain tracking through SlowMist’s MistTrack tool revealed that the hackers’ primary wallet amassed over $1 million, converting stolen assets into 296 ETH. Further transfers led to a secondary address which is now linked to transactions across popular crypto exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io, and MEXC. A complex network of smaller wallets and flagged addresses, including those tagged “Angel Drainer” and “Pink Drainer,” facilitated fund dispersal. “These types of attacks often combine social engineering and Trojan techniques, making users vulnerable to exploitation. The SlowMist Security Team advises users to carefully verify meeting links before clicking, avoid executing unknown software and commands, install antivirus software, and update it regularly.” Phishing Scams Hit Alarming Highs There has been a surge in crypto phishing scams lately. Earlier this month, a fraudulent work meeting link sent via KakaoTalk caused a person to lose $300,000 in cryptocurrency. The malware-compromised funds were transferred to a BingX-associated wallet. The link installed malware and compromised Ethereum and Solana wallets. Another blockchain security expert, Scam Sniffer reported over $9.4 million was lost in phishing attacks in November alone. Malicious blockchain signatures remain a top threat, as scammers exploit fraudulent transaction permissions to drain wallets, including high-profile thefts exceeding $36 million.

38228287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667835,1735394436,A 20%-30% Correction Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ That Could Happen To Bitcoin – Analyst,"Bitcoin is navigating turbulent waters as its price continues to slide, searching for a stable support level amid growing uncertainty. The current downward momentum has sparked concerns among investors and analysts, with many questioning whether Bitcoin has reached its cycle top. Sentiment in the market has shifted dramatically, with fear replacing the once euphoric optimism that drove the cryptocurrency to recent highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 Despite the unease, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offers a more optimistic perspective on the situation. In a recent analysis shared on X, Martinez suggested that a 20% to 30% correction could actually be the most bullish outcome for Bitcoin at this stage. He highlights how such pullbacks have historically set the stage for stronger rallies by shaking out weaker hands and allowing the market to reset before resuming its upward trajectory. As Bitcoin’s price action teeters on the edge of a potential breakdown, all eyes are on the key support levels that could determine the next move. Will Bitcoin confirm the fears of a cycle top, or will a healthy correction provide the foundation for the next leg of its rally? The coming weeks will be crucial in shaping the narrative for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Correction Looms Bitcoin appears on the verge of entering a critical correction phase, with the $92K level emerging as the line in the sand. Analysts and investors are increasingly concerned that a drop below this threshold—and potentially the $90K mark—could trigger a wave of selling pressure, driving the price into sub-$80K territory. The growing fear has cast a shadow over Bitcoin’s bullish narrative as many brace for potential downside risks. Related Reading: ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst However, not everyone sees this potential correction as bearish. Martinez offers a contrarian viewpoint, suggesting that a 20% to 30% correction could be the most bullish outcome for Bitcoin within the context of a bull trend. Martinez presented a compelling chart showcasing every Bitcoin correction exceeding 20% during past bull markets. His findings reveal that each of these corrections acted as a reset for the market, shaking out weaker hands and paving the way for stronger rallies. Martinez emphasizes that corrections are a natural and healthy component of Bitcoin’s price cycles, especially during bull runs. By allowing the market to recalibrate, they set the stage for sustained upward momentum. If Bitcoin does experience a significant pullback, it could be the precursor to a more robust and prolonged rally in the coming months. BTC Testing ‘The Last Line Of Defense’ Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,500, grappling with sustained selling pressure and bearish price action. The market sentiment has shifted significantly in recent days, with fears of a deeper retracement gaining traction among analysts and investors. Many believe that if Bitcoin loses the $92,000 mark, it could open the door for an accelerated decline. The $90,000 level is emerging as the critical support zone that Bitcoin must hold to maintain its bullish outlook. This level represents a psychological and technical barrier that could determine the cryptocurrency’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. If BTC manages to stay above $90K, analysts anticipate a strong recovery that could reignite bullish momentum and lead to a push toward previous highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Setting For a Big Move – Breakout Or Downturn? However, the stakes are high. A decisive break below the $90,000 level would likely exacerbate selling pressure, driving Bitcoin into deeper correction territory.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field.

In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Eight exciting altcoins—Rexas Finance (RXS), Hedera (HBAR), Tron (TRX), Mantle (MNT), VeChain (VET), Kaspa (KAS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Etherna ( ETHN)—are positioned to explode for 2025. Here is a detailed analysis of why these initiatives will take the front stage. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star in DeFi Rexas Finance (RXS) is a fresh blockchain-based platform that changes decentralized finance (DeFi) and real estate tokenizing. Rexas Finance uses modern technologies to tokenize real-world assets such as property so clients may access speedy, safe, open financial services. This approach gives incomparable value and enables RXS to lead in mixing blockchain innovation with traditional industries. Rexas Finance (RXS) has firmly established itself among the most likely altcoins in 2025. With coins at $0.15, the presale has reached stage 10. Sales of over 367.8 million tokens and more than $31.2 million raised indicate investors' great interest. This success shows the market's increasing faith in Rexas Finance and its capacity to rule the DeFi scene. The project's ecosystem is based on creative real estate tokenization and cutting-edge DeFi technologies, offering unparalleled utility by many rivals. The cryptocurrency market now views it with more respect after its placement on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and its certification by CertiK. Moreover, Rexas Finance is hosting an interesting $1 million giveaway in which twenty lucky winners will get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens apiece, increasing investor enthusiasm. Rexas Finance is a unique altcoin that stresses security, openness, and utility. Early investments are profitable, as the coin's price will skyrocket as its presale approaches. With its strong foundations and deliberate marketing, RXS is positioned to lead the cryptocurrency surge in 2025. Hedera (HBAR): Revolutionizing Blockchain with Hashgraph Through its distinctive architecture, Hedera Hashgraph has elevated blockchain technology. Unlike conventional blockchain, Sure is built from scratch, providing unmatched security scalability. It is the top pick for companies Because the proof-of-stake (PoS) methodology speeds transaction processing and reduces hacker attack risk. The Hashgraph consensus algorithm, a groundbreaking method for rapid and safe data processing, is the foundation of Hedera's ecosystem. Hedera has gained credibility among institutional users since its governing council consists of multinational companies. As businesses use its advantages, the current price of $0.26, as of writing, shows its consistent acceptance and possibility for long-term expansion. Hedera leads sectors, including supply chain and finance, and is dedicated to enterprise-grade solutions. As blockchain acceptance rises, Hedera's strong infrastructure and original design will help increase its pricing and usage in 2025. Tron (TRX): Redefining the Decentralized Internet Tron has become a top venue for distributed and created dispersed, decentralized content. It gives developers tools to build decentralized apps (dApps) and provides content creators with direct monetizing capability. Tron guarantees faster and less expensive transactions by cutting intermediaries and drawing a rising user base. The network's fit with Ethereum-based dApps improves its accessibility and value to developers. At $0.25 as of writing, Tron is still a fierce competitor in the blockchain field. Its scalable infrastructure makes it a preferable substitute for Ethereum for many initiatives. For many initiatives Tron'poisedm is positioned to gain as the need for decentration becomes increasingly critical. Its emphasis on user empowerment and flawless content sharing fits the rising need for decentration, confirming its supremacy in the altcoin scene. Mantle (MNT): Modular Ethereum Scaling With modular design, Mantle Network is transforming Ethereum scaling. Mantle guarantees constant improvements and easy integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by isolating transaction execution, data availability, and transaction finality into separate modules. For developers, its clever design offers unrivaled scalability and efficiency. At $1.18 as of writing, Mantle Network is becoming important in the Layer-2 ecosystem. Its capacity to scale Ethereum while keeping interoperability with its infrastructure equally appeals to companies and developers. Mantle's modular approach ensures it remains innovative by embracing the latest advancements. Given Ethereum's fast-growing ecosystem, Mantle Network's infrastructure is poised to gain even more traction. It is a must-watch asset for 2025 since its sophisticated technologies define Ethereum's future. VeChain (VET): Bridging Blockchain and Real-World Applications Leader in corporate blockchain solutions, VeChain Thor (VET) has established a niche. VeChain tackles data-related problems across sectors, including supply chain management and sustainability, by combining NFC technology with the Internet of Things (IoT). Its two-token approach guarantees the stability and economy of the company. Given its practical uses, VeChain is an undervalued asset at a live price of $0.04 as of writing. By letting smart contracts pay gas bills on customers' behalf, the platform helps to lower obstacles to blockchain acceptance. Its sophisticated transaction approach guarantees adequate data packing and finality, enhancing its business value. VeChain leads in blockchain adoption because it emphasizes sensible uses and affordability. As more companies use its solutions, VeChain's worth and market importance will rise significantly in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Redefining Proof-of-Work Using its GHOSTDAG system, Kaspa (KAS) presents a novel proof-of-work (PoW) perspective. Kaspa's blockDAG technology lets parallel blocks coexist, lowering confirmation times and increasing scalability. This invention guarantees safe operations and high throughput while preserving the advantages of PoW decentralization. At $0.12 as of writing, Kaspa is a pleasing choice for those looking for a scalable block proven by block data reduction, SPV proofs, and Layer-2 to improve its usability and scalability, making developments that make it a unique proposition in the blockchain field. A growing desire for scalable PoW solutions means Kaspa's innovative approach will likely be widely adopted. The top contender for the altcoin season 2025 is its capacity to mix strong security with fast transactions. Arbitrum (ARB): Elevating Ethereum with Advanced Layer-2 Scaling Arbitrum reduces transaction costs, increases scalability, and employs optimistic rollovers. Arbitrum moves processing and storage off-chain to maximize throughput and save costs, thus providing Ethereum's security and compatibility. Arbitrum has attracted attention among developers looking for reasonably priced alternatives to Ethereum. As of this writing, its live price is $0.79. Under its distributed autonomous organization (DAO) structure, ARB holders can help shape the protocol's evolution, guaranteeing ongoing improvements and creativity. Arbitrum's role in network scalability becomes increasingly critical as Ethereum acceptance rises. Thanks to its clever design and user-centric governance, Arbitrum is leading in the Layer-2 market and will be a massive factor in 2025. Etherna (ETHN): A Decentralized Financial Backbone Using its synthetic dollar system, Etherna (ETHN) is rethinking decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on Ethereum, Etherna offers consumers internationally available savings tools like the ""Internet Bond,"" a crypto-native substitute for traditional banking. As of writing, Etherna's creative solution, priced at $0.97, meets the demand for consistent, dependable digital currency. Its system guarantees that users may save and transact without depending on conventional financial infrastructure, improving accessibility and acceptance. Etherna's function as a decentralized financial backbone should become more critical as DeFi develops. Because of its original ideas, Etherna is a leader in the altcoin market and a fierce competitor for the altcoin season 2025. Conclusion As Bitcoin supremacy declines, the next altcoin season offers significant gains. Rexas Finance presents unmatched chances for development with its unique DeFi solutions and other creative projects, including Hedera, Tron, Mantle, VeChain, Kaspa, Arbitrum, and Etherna. These tokens, each ready to redefine blockchain uses and provide outstanding profits, should be closely watched by investors.

38228023,https://nulltx.com/?p=137095,1735393896,Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) Investors Shift Focus: Rollblock Emerges As The Money Pick For 2025,"Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) holders are tracking a new crypto star, Rollblock (RBLK). Rollblock’s tamper-proof smart contracts, AI-driven games, and community-backed rewards are transforming online gaming with its revolutionary GambleFi platform powered by Ethereum. With over $7.7 million raised and RBLK tokens gaining in value, Rollblock is rapidly becoming the top crypto investment of 2025. This game-changing platform is turning heads with its potential for massive growth. Rollblock Positioning Itself to Be a Leader in the Gambling Market Rollblock (RBLK) is an online gambling platform that aims to disrupt the GameFi sector. It’s commitment to offering fair odds and providing robust security measures has been attracting a growing number of daily active users. The worldwide gambling industry is projected to grow from $540.3 billion in 2023 to $744.8 billion by 2028, with Rollblock positioning itself as a leader in the space. The platform combines gaming with earning via its community-backed casino and Play-to-Earn token. With an Ethereum-based ecosystem, 7,000 AI-powered games, token burns, staking rewards, and weekly dividends, Rollblock is reinventing online gambling. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its innovative buyback model. This system involves repurchasing RBLK tokens to support their value growth, which bolsters investor confidence and contributes to long-term stability. Investors have already shown significant interest, with Rollblock raising over $7.7 million and selling over 21 million RBLK tokens during its presale. At just $0.044 per token, early participants can take advantage of the opportunity before prices soar. Market enthusiasts think Rollblock might reach an all-time high on its current trajectory. Analysts Believe Tron (TRX) Can Hit $1 in 2025 Tron (TRX) is among the best altcoins operating. CoinMarketCap noted that the token was down 16.3% last week but gained roughly 25% over the previous thirty days. This remarkable month-long gain demonstrates Tron’s resilience and growth potential. The latest price surge has analysts paying rapt attention. BullishBanter, a well-known market expert, predicts TRX could rebound to $0.32 shortly. He believes surpassing this level might unlock significant upward momentum, pushing the token to even higher price points. Another analyst, EWT, shared an even more optimistic outlook. He forecasts that Tron could rally to $1 before the current market cycle ends. Tron’s technical indicators remain bullish. The relative strength index is above average and heading towards the overbought area, suggesting more upward pressure on the price. Binance Coin Faces Short-term Bearish Challenges Binance Coin (BNB) continues to showcase its market dominance. Recent technical analysis reveals that the price is steady at nearly $720, with strong support at $700. However, there are signs of bearish sentiment as whale activity declines, and futures open interest has dropped by nearly 50%, reaching $433 million. This lack of momentum could create short-term challenges for BNB. Regardless of these hurdles, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about BNB’s potential. They point to a symmetrical triangle breakout, which might drive the price to $850 (+ nearly 20%). However, BNB is under continuous regulatory scrutiny and competition from various other platforms, posing concerns regarding its long-term success. Though doubts regarding Binance’s future may harm BNB’s performance, the short-term outlook is encouraging. Rollblock’s Innovative Feature Attracts Tron and BNB Holders Rollblock’s ability to integrate advanced technology and provide tangible rewards sets it apart from competitors like Tron and Binance Coin, positioning it as a game-changer. The platform’s success, raising over $7.7 million, reflects its disruptive potential and growing appeal among investors. Rollblock is not just a gambling platform; it’s a transformative opportunity for those seeking innovation and long-term growth in the crypto market.

Join the Lightchain AI Presale now and explore how this revolutionary platform is focused on real-world applications, cutting-edge technology, and a solid development roadmap. Unlike the speculative spikes often seen with memecoins, Lightchain AI delivers real utility by addressing real-world challenges, making it an ideal choice for investors seeking long-term value and meaningful innovation. Don’t miss your chance to get involved early! Memecoins Like DOGE and SHIB Limited Utility Hampers Growth Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have turned into the face pups of joke-fueled money fuss, getting news and bag͏s during good times. But when the cheers fade away their shout is often louder then their sting. Dogecoin could be good for giving tips to your best Reddit user but after that, it’s just riding on good feelings, not new ideas. At the same time, Shiba Inu is trying to get trust with Shibarium; however, it mostly wags its tail at buzz from the group instead of offering real tech. Smart buyers are now leaving the meme dog and looking for plans like Lightchain AI—a crypto that has real use, growth, and, should we say, true value. Because let’s face it we’ve all had enough of running in circles. Lightchain AI Unique Features That Drive Real-World Utility Lightchain AI has gained significant attention for its ability to seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Unlike DOGE and SHIB, Lightchain AI’s innovations extend beyond speculation to tackle challenges in modern industries. The platform’s standout features include its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which allows developers to deploy AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) for solving complex tasks like data optimization, predictive analytics, and decision automation. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s decentralized governance system empowers its community to influence key decisions, ensuring that the project evolves in alignment with user needs. This participatory approach not only strengthens community trust but also ensures that the platform remains adaptable and innovative over time. Roadmap That Shines Bright Lightchain AI’s Journey Lightchain AI isn’t just blending AI and blockchain—it’s serving up a masterclass in how to do it right. Kicking off in November 2024, the Prototype Development phase was all about building tech with brains, featuring the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Oh, and they threw in a developer portal to get the early adopters buzzing. By January 2025, things got real with the Testnet Rollout. The community dove in, running the testnet, staking tokens, and putting the AIVM through its paces—all while developers and node operators kept the wheels turning. Next up? The Mainnet Launch in March 2025, promising decentralization with a diverse squad of validators and contributors. But wait, there’s more! May will bring Ecosystem Growth, and by June, Lightchain AI is looking to conquer the world with Global Adoption. Innovation? Accessibility? They’re not just buzzwords here—they’re the endgame. Keep an eye on this one; it’s lighting the way forward. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, its slow pace has caused investors to embrace cryptocurrencies with more promise. Rexas Finance (RXS), a ground-breaking blockchain-based platform meant to transform decentralized finance (DeFi) and real estate tokenization, is one exciting choice. Combining modern technologies with practical applications, Rexas Finance offers an unmatched chance to earn excellent returns. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Cardano Alternative to Transform $350 into $70,000 Although Cardano has been a consistent pick for many investors, its broader blockchain uses have slowed its development compared to niche-oriented initiatives like Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a high-growth alternative by focusing on addressing particular practical issues, such as real estate tokenization. Rexas Finance is a better option for investors looking for significant returns because of creative technology, outstanding presale performance, and a committed community. Rexas Finance presents a convincing chance for people trying to optimize their short-term gains that Cardano cannot equal. Leading DeFi innovation, Rexas Finance provides a platform combining blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization. It helps investors get honest, open, and quick financial services. By tokenizing physical assets like real estate, Rexas Finance creates new opportunities for investors to profit from usually exclusive markets. Rexas Finance is a disruptive factor in the real estate and cryptocurrency markets since asset ownership is becoming more democratic. The platform's goal is simple yet powerful: to use blockchain technology to offer flawless financial solutions. This forward-looking strategy has positioned Rexas Finance to rule the DeFi market and draw significant interest from institutional and retail investors. Reaching stage 11 of its presale, Rexas Finance prices its tokens at $0.175. The presale has been explosive, raising over $33.1 million and selling over 380 million tokens. This result shows investors' confidence and emphasizes Rexas Finance as a project with great expansion possibilities. Outstanding fundraising on the platform is merely one measure of its possibilities. Already on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has increased its profile in the crypto industry. An audit by Certik confirms that the platform satisfies the highest security and openness criteria, verifying its legitimacy. In addition to its real estate focus, Rexas Finance offers advanced DeFi functionalities, including staking, lending, and borrowing. These characteristics allow users to earn and interact with the platform’s ecosystem in different ways. This combination of DeFi and tangible asset tokens distinguishes Rexas Finance from many cryptocurrencies as it lays the groundwork for the next stage of advancement on the blockchain. Rexas Finance has started a $1 million giveaway to involve its expanding community further. This project will reward twenty participants with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, generating buzz about it and drawing fresh capital. Such initiatives create a devoted user base and improve the project's visibility, guaranteeing its ongoing development and success. Investing in the RXS presale offers a chance to get tokens before the price increases. To guarantee a safe transaction and avoid fraud, visit the official Rexas Finance page. Link your wallet—such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet—to the platform and buy RXS with defined tokens, such as Ethereum or USDT. Once you have purchased the tokens, save them in your wallet and monitor the presale stages to stay current on price adjustments and developments. With the present presale price of $0.175, a $350 investment will get around 2,000 RXS tokens. Within 12 weeks of its initial release, analysts estimate RXS might hit $35. This estimate shows a possible 200x return, transforming a small $350 into $70,000. Such fast expansion is rare in the crypto market, so Rexas Finance is a unique and interesting chance. Rexas Finance's creative platform, excellent presale performance, and mounting community support drive the expected price explosion. Demand for RXS tokens is projected to explode as more investors see the initiative's promise, raising its value. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) offers a one-of-a-kind prospect for those looking for phenomenal expansion. Its emphasis on tokenizing actual assets and transforming DeFi sets it ahead in the cryptocurrency scene. Already raising over $33.1 million, the stage 11 presale emphasizes the great potential of the enterprise. Rexas Finance presents the ideal mix of creativity, openness, and community support for people wishing to turn a $350 investment into $70,000 in just 12 weeks. While the presale is still open, don't miss the opportunity to participate in this innovative initiative.

Analyst Darren has claimed that Cardano has not yet shown its full potential in the crypto market. Darren noted that ADA is on the brink of a major breakout.

The ADA price jumped 154.5% from $0.33 on November 1, 2024, to $0.84 on November 20. By November 30, Cardano’s ADA extended further by 35.71% to $1.14. However, ADA lost momentum, dropping 7.89% to $1.05 just 16 days into December. Darren highlighted that the adoption of Cardano’s ADA will grow, suggesting a strong upward trajectory. The analyst noted that ADA’s price could propel toward $3 in the near term and that’s only the beginning.

One standout is Lightchain AI (LCAI) , which combines the power of AI and blockchain technology for groundbreaking innovation. With a projected 300% growth potential, Lightchain AI is drawing attention, especially with its ongoing Lightchain AI Presale that offers investors an early opportunity to capitalize on its momentum. In addition to Lightchain AI, other promising altcoins like Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also showing strong potential for price surges, making them excellent picks for investors aiming to close the year on a high note. Lightchain AI Revolutionizing Blockchain with AI Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quickly becoming a focal point in the crypto world due to its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. These features enable the creation of AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) that offer real-world solutions far beyond the capabilities of most blockchain platforms. With a presale price of $0.0041, analysts are predicting exponential growth for LCAI as it approaches key milestones, including its testnet launch in early 2025. Its unique integration of AI capabilities into blockchain technology makes Lightchain AI a game-changer, with a 300% price potential before the year-end as more developers and enterprises adopt its platform. Polkadot Expanding Its Parachain Ecosystem Polkadot's parachain set up keeps showing big growth, helping the network's ability to grow and work with others. New parachain bids have brought in big projects like peaq, Bit.Country, InvArch, Energy Web and Nodle ͏each adding their own features to the wider system. On the tech side, new things like a special system link for buying and trading future block space have been given the go-ahead. This gives people more easy access to Polkadot's computer tools. Also, the planned Plaza setup hopes to bring together parachain features, making it even better for scale and boosting how folks use it overall. These changes show Polkadot's true promise to make a strong, linked, and wide-ranging blockchain system. Avalanche Scaling to New Heights Avalanche, a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain launched in 2020, has achieved notable advancements in scalability and performance. Its distinctive multi-chain architecture consists of the Exchange Chain (X-Chain), Platform Chain (P-Chain), and Contract Chain (C-Chain), collectively enabling the network to process approximately 4,500 transactions per second (TPS). One of Avalanche's key innovations is the introduction of subnets—customizable blockchains within its ecosystem—that empower developers to create application-specific chains tailored to their unique requirements. This approach supports horizontal scaling by integrating new blockchains into the network, thereby increasing capacity while maintaining high performance. The recent Avalanche9000 upgrade marks a significant step forward for the platform by drastically reducing deployment costs and enhancing accessibility for developers. This upgrade is projected to lower deployment expenses by 99.9%, replacing substantial upfront payments with a more cost-effective monthly subscription model for validators. Shiba Inu Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu (SHIB), initially launched in August 2020 as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has significantly evolved beyond its origins. The development of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, enhances scalability and reduces transaction fees, facilitating efficient Ethereum-based applications. Additionally, the introduction of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, enables users to stake, earn, and swap tokens seamlessly, reflecting the project's commitment to user empowerment and decentralization. The Shiba Inu ecosystem also includes tokens like BONE and LEASH, each serving specific roles within its decentralized framework. This progression from a meme coin to a multifaceted ecosystem underscores Shiba Inu's dedication to innovation and sustainability in the cryptocurrency space. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

An example of such a rival is Rexas Finance (RXS), which increased its value from $0.03 during the presale to $0.175 after raising more than 33 million dollars. Its new business model of integrating blockchain technology with real-world assets has made it a company being compared to Solana (SOL), a giant in the sector. But can RXS truly succeed Solana, and how high can it rise? Solana’s Legacy Based on the accepted understanding of global cryptocurrency networks, the Solana network’s competitive advantage lies in its market scalability and transaction speed, which are estimated to reach thousands of transactions per second. Its strong ecosystem, consisting of DeFi and NFTS, has allowed the creation of numerous decentralized applications. Rexas Finance (RXS) is carving a niche for itself rather quickly. Starting at just $0.03 and climbing to $0.175 during its presale, RXS raised more than $31 million. It brings innovations such as tokenizing real-world assets and creating NFTs via artificial intelligence, making the race for the best blockchain-friendly. Rexas Finance (RXS): Bridging Blockchain and Real-World Assets Rexas Finance differs from others by emphasizing the tokenization of real-world assets that integrate with conventional finance. RXS facilitates the digitization of real estate, among other types of assets, creating a new market for asset liquidity and fractional ownership. This strategy eliminates such restrictions and widens the target market to include those unaccustomed to the crypto space. Rexas Token Builder is one of the applications offered to users that do not require any technical know-how to create and manage their tokenized assets, which is an essential part of Rexas Finance’s ecosystem. It also supports budding companies via its Rexas Launchpad, advancing its ecosystem. In contrast to Solana, which is more exclusively for developers, Rexas Finance aims to include everyone and enable its blockchain technology to be used in various scenarios. Community Engagement and Security: Could Rexas Finance Outshine Solana? Solana’s (SOL) swift and inexpensive transactions have enabled it to foster a robust and devoted community of developers, creators, and investors. The community builds and interacts within its decentralized ecosystem. The Solana Foundation has also promoted community initiatives such as grants and partnerships to strengthen the ecosystem. However, this large community has experienced network outages, which raised questions about its security and reliability. On the other hand, Rexas Finance (RXS) completely emphasized community and security issues at the very onset of its downfall. After undergoing a stringent CertiK audit, the platform’s smart contracts have been fully sanctioned with no vulnerabilities. RXS also has a $1 million giveaway for the community to drive interaction through social networks. Twenty lucky winners can win 50,000 RXS tokens each by participating in referrals and completing activities. The giveaway results from these concentrated initiatives on security and community, and RXS will likely surpass Solana's legacy. The Case for Rexas Finance as Solana’s Successor Rexas Finance has penetrated the blockchain ecosystem and is showing itself as worthy of competition to Solana, which is known to be the prime factor in the industry. Solana’s history has provided it with some serious challenges regarding network reliability. Still, Rexas has promised stability thanks to its strong technology wrap-around and its target to solve real-world use cases, which are pretty appealing. Rexas Finance fuels its promises of being cost-efficient and stable, allowing it to stand out. With Rexas Finance looking to be revolutionary in the trillion-dollar real estate sector, Rexas’s growth looks exponential compared to Solana, which has a smaller market capitalization. Conclusion Rexas Finance shows that cryptocurrencies are just the tip of the iceberg regarding blockchain applications. In terms of market potential, this journey from $0.03 to $0.175 is massive and inspires confidence in investors. If the pace remains the same, along with strong fundamentals, it can grow to be one of the major players in the crypto space with the potential to compete with Solana. For Investors looking for newer, exciting opportunities in the scalable blockchain aspects, Rexas Finance is a chance to be involved in the more expected revolutionary shift.

The IRS’s “broker” definition conflicts with SEC and CFTC regulations in crypto. Ripple CTO warns that users may turn to unsafe, anonymous DeFi platforms. The IRS’s finalization of the second half of its controversial broker rule marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for decentralized finance (DeFi). Jake Chervinsky, the CLO of Variant Fund, stated that by the start of 2027, the rule would require a lot of DeFi front-ends to enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for their users. This decision has sparked outrage in the crypto community, with critics arguing that the rule is an overreach of governmental power. Further, they stated that it violates constitutional rights, posing a threat to innovation in the DeFi space. IRS has finalized the second half of its broker rule, requiring most DeFi front-ends to KYC users starting in 2027. This unlawful rule is the dying gasp of the anti-crypto army on its way out of power. It must be struck down, either by the courts or the incoming administration. — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) December 27, 2024 The Rule’s… The post IRS’s DeFi Broker Rule Faces Backlash, Ripple CTO Highlights Risks appeared first on Coin Edition .",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coin Edition,https://coinedition.com/irss-defi-broker-rule-faces-backlash-ripple-cto-highlights-risks/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png

TAO, FET, RENDER Plunge, But Lightchain AI Shows Promise","The ongoing market correction has taken a toll on many AI-focused cryptocurrencies, with tokens like TAO, Fetch.ai (FET), and Render (RNDR) seeing significant price drops. However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is breaking the mold with its innovative technology, clear roadmap, and a strong presale opportunity that’s catching the eye of investors. Join the Lightchain AI Presale today and secure your place in this promising project. Positioned as a disruptor in the blockchain and AI space, Lightchain AI is emerging as a sustainable alternative for those navigating the challenges of the crypto winter. TAO, FET, and RENDER Why Are They Struggling? The drop in TAO, Fetch.ai, and Render can be linked to some reasons. Worries about being too high in price have made a big impact, as lots of AI tokens went up a lot before this year, pushed more by excitement than by real use, which caused prices to go way up. Also, the market fill up has turned into a problem. Many AI-centered projects are getting in the area and making it harder to compete, which causes a drop of investor interest. Plus, even if these tokens offer hopeful ideas, their missing real-world uses have made it tough to explain their high market values͏. Even with their fresh traits, these plans are now having a hard time showing they can last. This has made room for newer and more sharp plans, like Lightchain AI, to pull in money backers. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out in the AI Crypto Space As the broader crypto market faces turbulence, Lightchain AI’s clear roadmap and early adoption opportunities position it as a strong contender for long-term success. With its presale price of just $0.0041, the token offers investors a low-risk entry point with the potential for exponential returns as the project progresses. Upcoming milestones, such as the January 2025 testnet launch and the March 2025 mainnet rollout, will further validate the platform’s capabilities and drive adoption. By focusing on practical utility and scalability, Lightchain AI is setting itself apart from competitors that rely solely on hype. So join presale today and secure your spot in Lightchain AI, the project that’s defying the AI crypto winter with its innovative approach and strong fundamentals. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to be part of a game-changing platform that is shaping the future of blockchain and artificial intelligence. How To buy Lightchain AI Tokens? To buy Lightchain AI (LCAI) tokens during the presale, set up a compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network. Fund your wallet with Ethereum (ETH), which you can purchase on exchanges like Coinbase or Binance and transfer to your wallet. ETH is needed for buying LCAI and covering transaction fees. Visit the official Lightchain AI presale website, connect your wallet, and use the dashboard to select your payment method (ETH or USDT) and enter the amount. Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the LCAI tokens will be sent to you once processed. New users can also buy ETH with credit or debit cards via Ramp Network or MoonPay, then follow the same steps to complete their purchase. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38227289,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399383,1735392325,Ethereum’s Top Meme Coin PEPE vs Solana’s Top Meme Coin BONK – Which Will Outperform The Other This Cycle?,"The post Ethereum’s Top Meme Coin PEPE vs Solana’s Top Meme Coin BONK – Which Will Outperform The Other This Cycle? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s safe to say that the memecoin market rebound in 2024 was phenomenal, leading traders and investors jumped into memecoins for huge returns following Donald Trump’s victory. Two of the top memecoins during this wave of investment were Ethereum’s PEPE and Solana’s BONK, rallying by 150% and 200% , respectively. As we approach 2025 and a new big bull cycle, insiders question which of these meme coins will see the biggest gains over the coming weeks. While many have set their price targets for $PEPE and $BONK, Remittix (RTX) h5x as been identified as the next altcoin as it taps a much bigger market. Pepe (PEPE) Rebounds, Prepares for Massive Rally The frog-themed crypto, Pepe, felt the heat in the recent crypto market correction. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Pepe coin price dropped to $0.00001400 for the first time since November 5. However, the meme coin has rebounded, reclaiming the critical support level at $0.00001800. The futures open interest of $PEPE has also been growing steadily over the last few days, reaching a high of $151 million. The MVRV-Z score shows that the Pepe crypto is oversold and due for a massive price pump. Chandler Bing has reported that Pepe (PEPE) has formed a bullish megaphone pattern. If this pattern holds, the memecoin will clear its current ATH of $0.00002803. According to Chandler’s forecast, the Pepe price may cross $0.00006500 in 2025. If the rally extends it may peak at $0.0001, equaling the 2021 market cap of $SHIB. Analysts Share Optimistic Outlook for Bonk (BONK) The biggest Solana memecoin, Bonk (BONK) also took a huge hit during the recent market dip. From its ATH of $0.00005825, the Bonk coin has plunged by more than 40%, CoinMarketCap’s data shows. Though the outlook for $BONK is quite grim, analysts are still positive about the memecoin. According to a Bonk price chart shared by Frumza, the price of $BONK could increase by 135% over the next few weeks. The Bonk crypto price prediction showed that the price will hit $0.00007500 with a new all-time high. The prediction from Bluntz_Capital is similar but with a potential target of $0.0000700 in early 2025. By the end of this bull cycle, $BONK could delete another zero, meaning a rise of 210% from the current price. Why Analysts Believe Remittix (RTX) is the Next 100X Coin While the memecoins have led the market in 2024, analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could be the next big player in the DeFi space. Remittix has been getting a lot of interest because industry experts believe that its platform could be the major payment bridge foundation between crypto and fiat. Remittix is designed to reinvent the $190 trillion global cross-border payment market, promising users cheap, instant transfers, and transparency from anywhere in the world. The platform supports over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ fiat currencies, more than what the likes of Wise and Stripe offer. Remittix also integrated local payment networks into its platform, which allows users to instantly send fiat to any supported bank account. Remittix’s innovative platform could make it quickly become the standard for cross-border payments. With the $190 trillion market set to be reinvented by Remittix, the RTX coin is destined to be one of the biggest gainers of this bull cycle. With a current RTX coin price of $0.0156, analysts say that the altcoin price could shoot up by more than 100x before mid-2025. The Best Memecoin To Buy Now: BONK or Pepe? While Solana’s BONK outperformed $PEPE in 2024, this bull cycle will see Pepe record more gains. However, since the memecoin is past its era of explosive growth, the best crypto to buy in this bull cycle is RTX. The platform not only offers utility, but massive growth potential as it looks to reinvent a $190 trillion market.

According to the SEC filing, these Bitcoin-hedged ETFs will strategically pair long positions in stocks or gold with short positions on the US dollar, complemented by long positions in Bitcoin through futures contracts. The ETF will allow ProShares to harness Bitcoin’s potential as an alternative asset while maintaining exposure to traditional financial markets. Importantly, the fund does not involve direct investments in Bitcoin itself. Observers see the filings as an indication of the growing market confidence in flagship crypto projects. REX had also proposed a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at investing in convertible bonds issued by companies that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries How will the ProShare Bitcoin-hedged ETFs function? The filing outlines more details on how the ProShare Bitcoin hedged ETFs will look. Bitcoin futures contracts will execute the short US dollar/long Bitcoin component. The setup establishes a currency hedge against the US dollar exposure associated with S&P 500 stock positions. The hedge will shield against the fluctuation in dollar value relative to Bitcoin. Current events show Bitcoin’s increasing dominance within traditional finance spheres. Several traditional operators, mainly financial institutions , have devised ways of blending Bitcoin and other digital assets into mainstream investment strategies. Vocal financial advisory personalities, including Robert Kiyosaki, have also stressed that Bitcoin is yet to reach its peak, claiming that it will hit $350,000 by the end of 2025. Bitcoin ETF markets soared past $36 billion in investor capital The Bitcoin market has enjoyed a stable and comfortable environment, triggering its growth. Political developments, especially digital asset stakeholders who overtly supported the US president-elect, Donald Trump, have boosted crypto prospects. Trump has promised a favorable crypto environment during his administration, including establishing the National Bitcoin Reserve . The sentiments have raised optimism, driving the Bitcoin price to over $100,000. One of the most notable developments this year was the launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States on January 11. The ETFs allowed investors indirect ownership of Bitcoins without physical custody. The Bitcoin ETF market share has grown past $36 billion on the back of investors seeking crypto exposure.

Although Bitcoin frequently takes center stage, professional investors are aware that altcoins also have enormous potential for enormous profits. But how can you choose the finest cryptocurrencies when there are millions to choose from? Let us share the list of some of the best altcoins with you. LuckHunter (LHUNT) Ripple (XRP) Polkadot (DOT) Chainlink (LINK) Dogecoin (DOGE) Let’s dig into these projects further to know what makes them the best altcoins to buy now for ultimate ROI in 2025. 1. LuckHunter (LHUNT) The gaming industry is undergoing a change because of the cutting-edge blockchain-powered online casino platform LuckHunter (LHUNT) . Through the smooth integration of state-of-the-art blockchain technology, LuckHunter (LHUNT) provides players with a safe, open, and decentralized environment where they can play a variety of casino games, including unique titles developed in-house. Visit the LuckHunter presale page >> The LHUNT token, the native cryptocurrency at the center of the LuckHunter ecosystem, allows users to access the platform’s Metaverse Casino , engage in games, and receive staking incentives. By enabling users to rent, lease, or even own virtual casino tables , the Metaverse Casino is a ground-breaking innovation that contributes to the platform’s overall success and passive revenue streams from table activity. LuckHunter (LHUNT) is well-positioned to take a sizable chunk of the quickly expanding online gaming industry, which is predicted to reach $227 billion by 2028, with 20.7% of that market being blockchain-based. The platform is an attractive investment option for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and online gaming fans because of its dedication to user protection, regulatory compliance, and transparent operations. 2. Ripple (XRP) One of the most creative cryptocurrency initiatives, Ripple aims to transform international financial transactions. XRP, in contrast to conventional cryptocurrencies. Ripple is focused on resolving practical issues, especially those pertaining to international payments. It is a great candidate for widespread adoption because its main goal is to enable quick, affordable, and secure money transfers between banks and financial organisations. Ripple is unique because of its cutting-edge blockchain technology, which gets rid of the inefficiencies in conventional financial systems. With minimal costs, XRP transactions settle in three to five seconds, outperforming even the majority of cryptocurrencies and conventional wire transfers. As a result, Ripple is now the preferred partner of more than 300 financial institutions, such as American Express and Santander. Ripple’s decentralized blockchain, the XRP Ledger, can process 1,500 transactions per second and offers strong security without sacrificing scalability. Additionally, Ripple is actively pursuing regulatory certainty, which will result in important alliances and widespread usage. Ripple is regaining the trust of institutions and investors alike following its recent partial success in its continuing legal struggle with the SEC. XRP’s promise for 2025 rests in its capacity to take a bigger chunk of the $156 trillion cross-border payment market. Ripple’s cutting-edge infrastructure and practical applications make it a long-term winner as blockchain use increases. Retail and institutional investors have the chance to participate in a cryptocurrency that is not only speculative but also has the potential to revolutionize global banking through XRP. 3. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a groundbreaking blockchain technology that tackles interoperability, one of the most important problems in the cryptocurrency industry. Polkadot, created by Dr. Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, allows many blockchains, or parachains, to function in unison. This opens up previously unheard-of possibilities for decentralized apps by establishing a single ecosystem in which value and data may move freely. The distinctive feature of Polkadot is its shared security paradigm, which allows all parachains to profit from the strong security of the main relay chain. This guarantees that Polkadot-based projects continue to be safe and scalable. Furthermore, the Substrate architecture allows developers to design unique blockchains for certain use cases without sacrificing compatibility. In Polkadot’s ecosystem, the native coin, DOT, is essential. In order to keep the network decentralized and community-driven, it is utilized for bonding, staking, and governance. In addition to helping to secure the network, investors may stake their DOT tokens to get alluring returns. Polkadot has a competitive edge thanks to its emphasis on scalability and interoperability as blockchain technology approaches widespread usage. Polkadot is anticipated to develop into a center for decentralized ecosystems by 2025, which would make DOT a valuable asset with substantial room for expansion. Polkadot offers a distinctive value offering that blends creativity, utility, and sustainability, regardless of your level of experience as an investor. 4. Chainlink (LINK) As the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink is essential to integrating blockchain-based smart contracts with actual facts. Simply said, Chainlink makes it possible for smart contracts to access external data feeds, APIs, and other off-chain resources. As a result, it is essential for supply chain management, insurance, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Chainlink’s strong infrastructure guarantees the security and dependability of data. Because it is decentralized, there is no chance of manipulation, guaranteeing that smart contracts operate precisely in accordance with actual circumstances. With connectors spanning Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and more, this special capability has made Chainlink the preferred choice for important blockchain projects. A key component of Chainlink’s ecosystem, the LINK token serves as both a staking tool to guarantee data integrity and a payment method for node operators. The need for LINK is increasing along with the use of smart contracts, which makes it a desirable investment choice. In order to improve its usefulness and security, Chainlink is extending its products with cutting-edge features like staking and the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Chainlink is positioned to be a key player in integrating blockchain technology with conventional industries by 2025. LINK is among the top cryptocurrencies for long-term returns because it provides investors with a unique blend of solid fundamentals and market demand. 5. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, which was first developed as a joke, has grown to become one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the world. What began as a humorous meme currency has gained widespread notice, a devoted following, and practical applications. Dogecoin has proven its resilience in the erratic cryptocurrency market with support from well-known individuals like Elon Musk. Dogecoin has an infinite supply, which makes it an inflationary currency in contrast to Bitcoin, which has a 21 million coin restriction. Even though this may appear to be a disadvantage, it guarantees that DOGE will continue to be a useful medium for regular transactions. It is the best option for tipping, charity gifts, and microtransactions because of its quick processing times and minimal transaction costs. Dogecoin’s potential for development in 2025 rests on its capacity to take advantage of widespread use. Its increasing usefulness is demonstrated by recent advancements, including partnerships with retail platforms and integration with Tesla’s payment system. Additionally, the Dogecoin Foundation has created technological advancements to improve the security and scalability of the network. DOGE is a special opportunity for investors. Although there are dangers associated with its speculative character, its enormous community support and growing number of real-world applications make it a coin worth keeping an eye on. Dogecoin’s potential to evolve from a joke to a useful digital asset might result in substantial profits as the cryptocurrency industry develops. How Altcoins Work? Like Bitcoin, altcoins use blockchain technology to enable and secure transactions over decentralized, trustless peer-to-peer networks. The Ethereum blockchain serves as a distributed ledger, transparently and irrevocably documenting all contracts and transactions. One of the main advantages of blockchain technology is its transparency, which guarantees that everyone involved has access to the same data. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two examples of consensus procedures used in cryptocurrency networks to validate transactions. PoS uses less energy since it depends on users holding and staking their coins to validate transactions, whereas PoW needs a lot of processing power to solve complicated issues. This staking procedure is a desirable choice for many as it not only promotes network security but also enables participants to get incentives. Altcoins’ decentralized structure and creative consensus techniques guarantee their continued security, openness, and censorship resistance. These characteristics make altcoins an attractive substitute for established financial systems, offering a more inclusive and intermediary-free future for financial transactions. Why Choose Altcoins? First, let’s ask the obvious: why not just use Bitcoin? Although Bitcoin is the forerunner of all cryptocurrencies, altcoins frequently have distinctive characteristics and cutting-edge technologies. Many address practical issues or enhance Bitcoin’s drawbacks, such as its scalability or energy usage. Additionally, altcoins often have lower entry costs, allowing you to purchase more units for less money. Additionally, during bull markets, they frequently enjoy larger percentage returns. Consider them the crypto equivalent of small-cap stocks: more risky but perhaps more lucrative. Factors to Consider Before Choosing the Best Altcoin To Buy Now It is crucial to carry out due diligence and comprehensive study before entering the altcoin investing industry. Investors may make wise choices and steer clear of potential traps by having a thorough understanding of the underlying technology, the project team, and the market potential. When in doubt, seeking advice from a financial adviser with expertise in cryptocurrency might yield insightful information. Although there are many potential benefits to investing in lesser-known cryptocurrencies, there are also many risks, including the potential for total loss. These risks can be mitigated by diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio by holding a combination of well-known and prospective altcoins. Investors searching for expansion prospects may find altcoins appealing because to their distinctive features and cutting-edge technologies. The secret to investing in altcoins successfully is to be knowledgeable and flexible. Because the cryptocurrency market is so dynamic, investors may make more informed and timely decisions by staying up to date on the most recent news, trends, and regulatory developments. A well-rounded approach to altcoin investing enables investors to take advantage of the possibilities and negotiate the intricacies of the crypto markets. Pros and Cons of Altcoins Because of the cryptocurrency market’s potential for explosive development and innovation, investing in altcoins can yield substantial financial gains. By weighing the benefits and hazards of various digital assets, altcoins offer a means of diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio. Some investors believe that altcoins provide a safer option when the economy is unstable, such during times of severe inflation. However, there are hazards associated with the altcoin market. In contrast to Bitcoin, which is widely accepted and has a strong market presence, many altcoins are more vulnerable to hazards, including market instability and fraud. The process of purchasing cryptocurrencies and verifying their legality can be made more difficult by issues with availability and governmental control. Setting specific investing objectives and using risk management strategies, such stop-loss orders, and altcoin diversification, are necessary to navigate these dangers. It might also be advantageous to have a long-term investment stance, concentrating on initiatives with sound foundations and practical uses. An investor might increase their chances of success in the altcoin markets by carefully preparing and researching prospective benefits. Conclusion: Best Altcoins To Buy Now It’s critical to consider each project’s long-term utility, scalability, and growth potential while looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. Cryptocurrencies with distinctive value propositions that make them exceptional investments for 2025 and beyond include Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ripple, Polkadot, and LHUNT. From cutting-edge VR-blockchain integration to cross-border payments and decentralized oracles, each of these initiatives fills a unique niche and presents several chances for significant profits. LHUNT stands out as the best option among these. It is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity due to its revolutionary methodology. LHUNT may pave the way for revolutionary returns in the upcoming years with a verified listing and the possibility of large staking payouts.

38226699,https://crypto.news/?p=14322806,1735390980,High-growth economies lead the way in crypto regulations | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. While the United States is often seen as a leader in both financial and technological advancement, it has clearly struggled in recent years to establish clear (and consistent) crypto regulation frameworks. You might also like: Can global regulation keep up with the tokenization boom? | Opinion This lack of clarity has allowed other countries, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, to take the lead. High-growth economies in these regions are creating frameworks tailored to digital assets, which are often more effective than those in the West. These regulations offer a model for the rest of the world to follow. If the West doesn’t catch up, it risks being left behind as the crypto industry shifts its center of gravity. The US should not be the blueprint for regulations In the past years, the US has struggled in its attempt to regulate the crypto industry, with regulatory entities, such as the SEC, often taking hostile and inconsistent measures. High-profile lawsuits against Ripple and Coinbase made headlines globally, which have cast a shadow over innovation and pushed some crypto firms to move to friendlier countries. The absence of clear guidelines from the SEC has left founders and investors walking on eggshells, uncertain if their next move could get them into legal trouble. One of the main issues is that the US has been trying to fit digital assets into existing laws (e.g., securities and commodities regulations), which were never designed for crypto in the first place. While the US’s newly elected crypto-friendly Congress indicates hope for progress, the country has a lot of catching up to do. Waiting for the United States to set the standard is no longer viable when others are already leading. Emerging markets are the hidden gem of regulations In the meantime, high-growth markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia have introduced a new way to approach crypto regulations, with an understanding that digital assets are not enemies but should be regulated like any other assets. While the US SEC spent years trying to classify cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum ( ETH ), as securities, Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (known as BAPPEBTI) officially classified all digital assets as commodities as early as 2019. In Malaysia, the Securities Commission created a comprehensive framework for crypto exchanges with high standards for licensing, investor protection, and anti-money laundering. This has also been implemented in Indonesia, which rolled out clearer rules for exchanges, such as mandatory client fund segregation, strong security demands, and token listing requirements. In both countries, these measures have reduced fraud and improved trust in the overall system, making using crypto safer for everyone (and more enticing!). This is the level of clarity and engagement we need as we move into broader web3 adoption globally. As a result, the Asian crypto market is thriving. The Indonesian crypto market surpassed $30 billion in transactions from January to October 2024, a 350% increase compared to the previous year. It is now the third-largest country globally for cryptocurrency adoption, just ahead of the U.S. In fact, in this index, seven of the top 20 countries are in Central and Southern Asia and Oceania, which signals that the crypto world is a multipolar industry. Emerging markets lead in crypto utility But why are high-growth markets seemingly more advanced in crypto regulations? It’s because in these markets, crypto utility shines brighter than anywhere else. Crypto addresses several pitfalls, such as high remittance costs and limited access to owning assets and investing. On average, remittance fees are around 6.65% of the amount sent, which can take a big portion out of what workers send back to their families. In the Philippines, remittances make up nearly 10% of the country’s GDP, showing just how important they are. Digital assets also serve as a hedge against inflation. In Asia and the Middle East, gold has traditionally been a safe and reliable asset that has been able to retain value over the years. However, access to owning physical gold is complicated, with high entry fees, storage issues, and a lack of accessibility for everyday people. Crypto allows the creation of tokenized gold, enabling consumers to own a tokenized, digital fraction of gold at a much lower price, thereby lowering barriers to entry. Crypto regulations in high-growth markets aren’t perfect, and it will take a few more years for them to become even more comprehensive. But these markets understand that effective regulation can’t be one-size-fits-all, and they are tailoring rules for real digital asset use cases. The future of crypto won’t be defined by Wall Street or Silicon Valley. It will be defined by the people who can use crypto daily to solve real-world problems and address the pitfalls of traditional finance. Which is exactly what crypto was made for.

Currently ranked #2 in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum has a market capitalization of $403.88 billion and a circulating supply of 120.47 million ETH. The price action has narrowed into a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic technical setup that often precedes a significant price movement. The immediate resistance at $3,350, which coincides with the triangle’s upper boundary, is critical for bullish momentum. On the downside, support levels at $3,221 and $3,097 are key to preventing further declines. Traders are closely monitoring this narrowing range for the next breakout. Ethereum (ETH) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Potential Breakout: Key Levels to Watch for Ethereum Ethereum’s symmetrical triangle suggests a pivotal juncture. A bullish breakout above $3,350 could target $3,520 initially, with the potential to rally further toward $3,700. This aligns with the 50-day EMA, which is currently positioned at $3,355, reinforcing the significance of overcoming this resistance level. However, failure to break above $3,350 could trigger a bearish move, pushing Ethereum back to test the $3,221 support zone, with further declines possible toward $3,097. The RSI is at 52, indicating neutral momentum and leaving room for movement in either direction. Key Resistance and Support Levels Immediate Resistance: $3,350 Next Resistance Levels: $3,520 and $3,700 Immediate Support: $3,221 Next Support Levels: $3,097 and $2,983 Ethereum Technical Indicators and Market Sentiment The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 52 reflects neutral market momentum, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. A break above the symmetrical triangle could signal a trend reversal, attracting bullish sentiment. Conversely, a downward breakout may amplify selling pressure as traders look to capitalize on bearish momentum. Ethereum at $3,352 is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern. A breakout above $3,350 could target $3,520 & $3,700, while support holds at $3,221. Key levels to watch as volatility looms! #Ethereum #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/1DOCquC41l — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 28, 2024 Ethereum’s trading volume of $18.71 billion highlights strong market participation, underscoring the significance of the current consolidation phase. As the price continues to oscillate within the triangle, traders anticipate heightened volatility leading to a decisive breakout in the coming days. Conclusion Ethereum’s symmetrical triangle pattern positions the asset at a critical crossroads. A breakout above $3,350 could unlock substantial upside potential, while a breakdown below $3,221 may open doors for further declines. With key technical indicators suggesting neutrality, the next few days will be crucial for ETH’s trajectory. $BEST Wallet Raises Nearly $6M: Limited Time to Buy Best Wallet continues to make waves in the Web3 space, supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

New tax rules for DeFi platforms will take effect from 2027. The IRS will treat DeFi platforms facilitating transactions as brokers. The U.S. Treasury Department, through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), has finalized regulation integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms into the existing tax framework. In a recent report, the regulatory agency noted that the new rules will be implemented in 2027, allowing the platforms to organize their data for proper reporting. It is worth clarifying that the new regulation targets “trading front-end service providers,” which the IRS has classified as brokers due to their intermediary roles in facilitating digital asset transactions. The IRS believes that this classification will improve tax compliance within the growing DeFi sector. According to the IRS, the new rule classifies platforms offering digital assets sales or exchanges as brokers, regardless of whether they use smart contracts.

In a new video, the analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 65,700 YouTube subscribers that payments-focused digital asset XRP has one of the most bullish market structures in crypto based on the charts. “[XRP] is probably the most bullish altcoin in the space right now… XRP is one of the few coins right now that is printing a very clear bullish impulsive structure on lower time frames, on higher time frames, on every time frame. And very easily cleanly identifiable… That’s kind of what we’re seeing here on XRP – is that very clean price action that shows impulsive price movement.” Source: Credible Crypto/X The pseudonymous analyst, who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, says that XRP could explode by up to 1,295% from the current level. In technical analysis, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave rally before a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Says Credible, “I do think XRP here is gearing up for that next impulse to the upside following the one that started off at $1.28. Again this next initial impulse to the upside should… take us to $4+ and new all-time highs. The exciting thing is that would be just a third sub-wave of a larger third-wave move that ultimately should take us to $5+ plus.

38226028,https://finbold.com/?p=223685,1735389574,Robert Kiyosaki accuses BlackRock of ‘suppressing Bitcoin price’,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull and author Robert Kiyosaki has shared an interesting theory regarding the asset’s current price struggles below $100,000 as the flagship cryptocurrency faces increased volatility. Specifically, Kiyosaki has accused BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ), the world’s largest asset manager, of manipulating Bitcoin’s price to benefit institutional investors , according to his X post on December 27. Kiyosaki suggested that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink may be intentionally “dumping Bitcoin” to suppress its price, encouraging institutional investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency at a lower cost below $100,000. It’s worth noting that BlackRock has emerged as a key player in the Bitcoin market after launching a spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Interestingly, Kiyosaki has long opposed investing in Bitcoin ETFs . In his post, the author of ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad’ urged investors to keep Bitcoin in personal wallets rather than entrusting their assets to financial management firms. “Larry Fink dumping Bitcoin. I love Bitcoin in my own wallet. I would not trust Bitcoin in BlackRock’s ETF. BlackRock suppressing Bitcoin price so the whales can buy Bitcoin at under $100k,” Kiyosaki said. At the same time, Kiyosaki reminded investors that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy had labeled Fink a “Marxist.” Ramaswamy accused BlackRock of prioritizing stakeholder capitalism over shareholder capitalism. He compared Fink to World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab, referencing Schwab’s statement that “someday you’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy.” BlackRock Bitcoin ETF outflows While Kiyosaki’s claims of price suppression cannot be substantiated, his comments come after BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), recorded its largest-ever single-day outflow of $188.7 million on December 24. Speculation about BlackRock’s Bitcoin activities has grown, especially after the asset management firm deposited 828 BTC, valued at almost $80 million, into Coinbase on December 23. This move fuelled speculation about the investment giant’s possible sale. Despite raising concerns about potential Bitcoin price manipulation, Kiyosaki remains bullish on the digital currency. In his latest prediction, he forecasts Bitcoin will hit $350,000 in 2025. He urged investors to continue accumulating the asset, projecting it will likely keep climbing. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki remains unfazed by price corrections. He criticized individuals who complain about price drops, referring to them as “cry babies,” and suggested that any BTC price retreat should be seen as an opportunity to buy more. Kiyosaki generally views alternative assets such as Bitcoin and precious metals, including gold and silver , as ideal for protecting wealth, particularly anticipating a predicted global economic crash . Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $94,545, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, while gaining a modest 0.8% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin faces a challenging holiday season , with the leading cryptocurrency experiencing notable capital outflows. Concerns have mounted about a potential crash, driven by factors like the large movement of Bitcoin into exchanges and the loss of key support levels at $97,000 and $95,000. Some analysts predict the asset could drop to $60,000. In the short term, attention is focused on Bitcoin’s interaction with the $90,000 support level, as losing this point could trigger sustained selling pressure.

A recent report from the data aggregator CoinGecko has provided a comprehensive analysis of what investors can expect in 2025. With the market experiencing a significant correction, many industry participants are left questioning their next steps. However, CoinGecko’s insights suggest a promising trajectory ahead. Broader Crypto Market Signs Point To Significant Growth One of the standout predictions centers around Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency. The report indicates that Bitcoin is positioned favorably within a logarithmic analysis of its monthly chart, revealing a consistent upward movement within an ascending channel. Related Reading: Ethereum On The Cusp Of Major Breakout In Q1 2025, Altcoins Expected To Follow Suit Currently, Bitcoin is nearing a pivotal axis point within this channel, echoing patterns observed during previous bullish cycles. Optimistically, the analysis forecasts that Bitcoin could soar to $250,000, reflecting a staggering 154% increase. This projection aligns closely with historical trends observed following Bitcoin’s Halving events, where supply constraints often lead to price surges. Such a milestone would not only reinforce Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market but also attract a wave of new investors. The broader cryptocurrency market is also showcasing signs of significant growth. The total market capitalization is currently navigating a rising wedge pattern, which historically has served as a precursor to substantial bullish rallies. Altcoin Season On The Horizon? In a more granular look at the market, the report highlights the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies outside the top 10. This segment has reportedly formed a classic “cup and handle” pattern on its monthly chart. Currently, it is testing a crucial resistance level of $370 billion. A breakout above this threshold could trigger a remarkable 317% rally, potentially pushing the total cap to $1.6 trillion. Such a move would signify the onset of what many are calling a “robust altcoin season,” where lesser-known cryptocurrencies could see substantial gains. Several key milestones from 2024 are expected to drive this anticipated growth. Bitcoin’s Halving event, which historically leads to supply constraints, is poised to play a critical role. Additionally, anticipated approvals for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for coins such as XRP, Litecoin or Solana could further legitimize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the eyes of mainstream investors, according to the report. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish CoinGecko further points to political factors, such as pro-digital asset policies from influential figures like President-elect Donald Trump, may also create a conducive environment for growth.

38227306,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53279,1735389005,4 Best Altcoins to Invest in This Weekend: Your Ultimate Guide to Profitable Picks,"Cryptocurrency markets are heating up this December, with savvy investors scouring for the next big altcoin. From major players that keep breaking new ground to promising upstarts offering unique real-world applications, there’s plenty to keep an eye on. If you’re still on the fence about which coins to add to your portfolio, we’ve done the legwork for you. Among the frontrunners are Qubetics ($TICS) , Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polkadot (DOT). Each offers something distinct and exciting, so let’s dive right into why these are the Best Altcoins to Invest in This Weekend. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Web3 Aggregator Revolution Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a powerhouse with a unique mission. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s not only pulling together disparate blockchain solutions but also bringing unprecedented functionality to businesses and individuals. At its current presale stage, Qubetics is priced at just $0.0377, with over $7.9 million raised, 12,100 token holders onboard, and 379 million $TICS sold . The numbers speak volumes about its growing popularity. One standout feature is Qubetics’ decentralised VPN (dVPN), which allows businesses and individuals to safeguard their online privacy without relying on centralised servers. Imagine a small e-commerce store that processes customer orders. With Qubetics’ dVPN, this store’s data becomes virtually untouchable by hackers, ensuring its reputation stays intact. Or think about freelancers working remotely—Qubetics makes it a breeze to secure sensitive client data without expensive tools. And here’s the kicker: the return on investment (ROI) projections for $TICS are staggering. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, translating into a 630.20% ROI. After launch, $TICS could soar to $1 (2820.78% ROI), $5 (14503.91% ROI), or even $15 (43711.73% ROI). If you invested $7,000 today, your tokens could be worth over $304,600 at $5 or a jaw-dropping $1,095,000 at $15. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it combines real-world utility, a proven growth trajectory, and a presale momentum that’s too good to ignore. If you’ve missed out on Bitcoin or Ethereum early on, $TICS might just be your second chance. 2. Cardano (ADA): Sustainability Meets Scalability Cardano has been a fan favourite for years, thanks to its scientific approach and commitment to sustainability. While other blockchains focus on speed or decentralisation, Cardano’s team has taken the slow-and-steady route, ensuring every upgrade is rigorously peer-reviewed. That’s why ADA, its native token, remains one of the Best Altcoins to Invest in This Weekend . This December, the buzz around Cardano is all about its Hydra upgrade. Hydra’s goal is to enhance scalability, making the network capable of processing a mind-blowing number of transactions per second. This makes ADA even more appealing to developers building decentralised apps (dApps). Picture a real estate marketplace running entirely on Cardano—users could buy and sell properties seamlessly, all while paying rock-bottom fees. Investors aren’t just hyped for Hydra—they’re eyeing ADA as a long-term hold. Analysts suggest that its price, currently hovering around $0.28, could climb to $0.50 or even $1 in 2025 as adoption grows. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s mix of environmental consciousness, cutting-edge upgrades, and rock-solid fundamentals makes it a must-have for December. 3. Avalanche (AVAX): The High-Speed Contender Avalanche is a blockchain that knows how to deliver. With its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of competitors, it’s no wonder AVAX has secured its spot as one of the Best Altcoins to Invest in This Weekend . If you’ve ever been frustrated by Ethereum’s high gas fees, Avalanche is like a breath of fresh air. What’s grabbing headlines this month is Avalanche’s Subnet feature. Subnets allow developers to create tailored blockchains that cater to specific use cases. Imagine a gaming company using a subnet to host a play-to-earn ecosystem where players trade in-game assets without lag or crazy fees. That’s the kind of efficiency Avalanche brings to the table. The numbers are equally exciting. AVAX is trading at around $11, and analysts predict it could rally to $20 by next year if adoption continues at its current pace. While it’s not a moonshot, Avalanche’s steady performance and innovative approach make it a strong bet for consistent returns. Why did this coin make it to this list? Avalanche’s blend of speed, cost-efficiency, and developer-friendly features makes it a no-brainer for anyone serious about crypto. 4. Polkadot (DOT): The Blockchain of Blockchains Polkadot has always been about connectivity. Its unique architecture allows different blockchains to talk to each other, creating a seamless network of networks. For developers and businesses, this interoperability is a game-changer. DOT, its native token, has gained traction as a go-to investment for those who believe in a multi-chain future. One of the coolest things about Polkadot is its parachain auctions. These allow projects to lease slots on Polkadot’s main chain, ensuring only the most promising ones make the cut. In December, the buzz is around the introduction of XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging). With XCM, developers can create apps that span multiple blockchains, opening up new possibilities. Imagine a supply chain app tracking goods from factory to store across several chains without skipping a beat. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s innovative architecture and focus on solving real-world problems make it a standout choice this December. Conclusion Whether you’re looking for the next big thing or a solid long-term play, these four cryptocurrencies have got you covered. Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rulebook with its Web3 aggregation and dVPN features, offering jaw-dropping ROI potential. Cardano (ADA) combines sustainability with cutting-edge upgrades. Avalanche (AVAX) delivers unmatched speed and affordability, while Polkadot (DOT) pioneers blockchain interoperability. With Qubetics’ presale nearing its end and other coins gearing up for big moves, the window to get in early is closing fast. Ready to jump in? Don’t wait—your portfolio will thank you.

38225994,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323208,1735388911,Dogecoin Market Cap May Hit $100bn in 2025: Will It Reach $1?,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the original “memecoin,” has long captured the imagination of retail investors, but now, predictions are surfacing that its market cap could hit $100 billion in 2025, potentially pushing its price to the elusive $1 mark. A recent tweet by Galaxy Research underscores this possibility, sparking debate within the cryptocurrency community. While speculative, these forecasts are bolstered by Dogecoin’s growing adoption and its unique status in the crypto ecosystem. Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? For Dogecoin to hit $1, its market cap must reach $100 billion, an ambitious yet achievable milestone given its current ranking and community support. At present, DOGE trades at $0.3167, with a market cap of $46.67 billion. A surge to $1 would require the cryptocurrency to more than double in value—a feat it achieved during the 2021 bull run. 23 – Dogecoin will finally hit $1, with the world’s largest and oldest memecoin touching $100bn market cap. However, Dogecoin market cap will be eclipsed by the Department of Government Efficiency, which will identify and successfully enact cuts in amounts exceeding Dogecoin’s… — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 Galaxy Research highlighted this scenario in a tweet : “Dogecoin will finally hit $1, with the world’s largest and oldest memecoin touching $100bn market cap.” However, they tempered their prediction with a disclaimer, emphasizing that such forecasts are not financial advice but rather insights into market trends. Current Market Dynamics and Technical Analysis Dogecoin is trading below key resistance at $0.3257, which aligns with a descending trendline. The 50-day EMA at $0.3287 acts as another significant hurdle, while immediate support levels are at $0.3040 and $0.2817. The RSI of 43.27 reflects weak momentum, suggesting that DOGE could remain range-bound unless it breaks above resistance. If a breakout occurs, price targets include $0.3470 and $0.3668. Conversely, a breach below support at $0.2817 could accelerate bearish sentiment, pushing DOGE toward $0.2625. Factors Driving Dogecoin’s Growth Community Support : Dogecoin’s strong and loyal community, including influential figures like Elon Musk, continues to drive adoption and media attention. Real-World Use Cases : Partnerships, such as DOGE being accepted as payment for Tesla merchandise, add credibility to its utility beyond speculation. Institutional Interest : With institutions increasingly eyeing crypto, Dogecoin could benefit from broader market participation. Risks and Challenges Ahead Despite its potential, Dogecoin faces significant challenges. Critics argue that its lack of robust technical innovation compared to rivals like Ethereum could hinder long-term growth. Additionally, volatility and reliance on social media-driven hype could make it vulnerable to sharp corrections. Galaxy Research acknowledged these risks in another tweet, disclosing that they hold positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, further highlighting the speculative nature of their forecasts. Conclusion: A Bold Prediction for 2025 Dogecoin’s journey to $1 hinges on a combination of market sentiment, adoption, and macroeconomic factors. While hitting a $100 billion market cap is within the realm of possibility, it will require sustained momentum and a supportive environment.

38225333,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634266,1735388015,Blockchain Association files lawsuit against IRS over its new DeFi regulations,"The Blockchain Association has filed a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over its new regulations for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The group is fighting against new IRS laws that will classify some protocols in the DeFi sector as brokers. The new regulation will mandate the protocols to give up user transaction details through the Know Your Customer (KYC) information. According to the IRS, the new regulation could affect about 875 DeFi protocols, a move that has triggered the entire crypto community. The new law intends to treat any platform that traders buy and sell assets in the DeFi sector as a broker. Legal experts strongly oppose the move, citing several constitutional rights violations. Investors are also wary about the security issues that the proposed KYC details may present. Blockchain Association files lawsuit to counter the IRS The initial IRS directive was met with market-wide dissatisfaction, with traders objecting to the regulations. In response to their dissatisfaction, the IRS said it will ensure that the right people are paying their taxes promptly. With the controversy still in the air, the Blockchain Association announced that it has filed its lawsuit challenging the new regulation. Today, @BlockchainAssn , @fund_defi , and @TXblockchain_ filed a lawsuit challenging the IRS’ broker rulemaking. This rule – as the countless comment letters warned – risks crippling the U.S. digital asset sector. https://t.co/D8VsDpNJvW pic.twitter.com/8HDvpIhBHC — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) December 28, 2024 According to its post on X (formerly Twitter), the Blockchain Association said it filed the lawsuit in collaboration with the DeFi Education Fund and the Texas Blockchain Council. The body stated that the rule could threaten the booming digital asset sector in the United States. It also mentioned that the same warnings had been communicated to the IRS through countless comment letters. According to the legal head of the association, Marisa Coppel, the IRS went beyond its statutory authority by leveling the protocols as brokers, noting that it is an infringement on people’s rights. “The IRS and Treasury have gone beyond their statutory in expanding the definition of ‘broker’ to include providers of DeFi trading front-ends even though they do not effectuate transactions. Not only is this an infringement on the privacy rights of individuals using decentralized technology, it would push this entire, burgeoning technology offshore.” She noted that the Blockchain Association will continue to stand with users and fight against any form of misguided regulations. “Blockchain Association continues to stand with innovators and users of DeFi and will continue to fight this misguided rule-making to ensure the United States remains a home for decentralized finance technology and developers alike,” she added. The crypto community criticizes the IRS Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, some high-profile individuals in the crypto sector, and the entire community have also criticized the move, with others offering support. Smith has urged the IRS to reverse the rules, expressing strong opposition to some aspects of it. She is also confident that the incoming Trump administration will understand the dire effects that such a move may have on innovation in the country. Representing the legal community and showing displeasure at the regulations, Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky has noted that the regulation is a dying gasp from the anti-crypto army. He also urged the court to overturn the regulations, saying if the court refuses to do the needful, the new administration will do it. General Counsel of A16z Crypto, Miles Jennings has criticized the rule, saying it is an overreach. He said the new rules give the IRS the authority to regulate, sanction, or even ban DeFi platforms. Some users on X have also called it an intentional move by the Biden administration to sabotage the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration. The crypto community has always come together to criticize regulations that may hinder the growth of the crypto industry. With the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration, there is confidence that laws like these will be rejected outrightly.

38225037,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27872,1735387367,US Government Will Not Buy Bitcoin in 2025,"US Government to Research Bitcoin Reserve Policy The research arm of Galaxy Digital expects the US government not to buy any Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025 but retain its current stock of 183,850 BTC worth close to $17.36 billion. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Research, said in a December 27 report: “The US government will not buy Bitcoin in 2025. However, there will be some movement at the departmental level to consider an expanded BTC reserve policy”. The fact that it’s considering the reserve policy suggests this is more about long-term positions rather than short-term market positioning. Bitcoin Act 2024: A Game-Changer? The proposed BTC Act 2024 by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming could be a game-changer in the US government’s approach toward BTC. If passed, the act would grant the government the power to purchase 200,000 BTC every year over a period of five years, amassing a reserve of 1 million BTC to be held for a minimum of 20 years. Such a daring move could place Bitcoin at the heart of the US Treasury’s approach. Broader Global Perspectives It’s not just about the US, however. Galaxy analyst “JW” believes up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and nation-states could join the party by adding BTC to their respective balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds by 2025. The Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, also acknowledged global interest but sounded uncertain. “It is difficult for the government to express its views”, Ishiba said, citing a lack of understanding about BTC reserve strategies by countries like the US. At the same time, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao suggested that smaller countries could very well take the lead in the implementation of BTC reserves. At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Zhao highlighted the gradual nature of this shift, saying strategic adoption could start with the smaller-scale nations. Competitive Dynamics in Bitcoin Adoption The shifting US government position might have implications for the global approach. JW believes that a more aggressive US position could result in a race to adopt Bitcoin among nations. “Competition among unaligned or adversarial nations will drive strategies to mine or acquire Bitcoin,” JW said. As BTC continues to mature as an asset globally, nations and corporations alike will likely revisit their strategies. While the US is unlikely to buy BTC in 2025, its policy shifts may pave the way for broader adoption and competition in the cryptocurrency space.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/us-government-will-not-buy-bitcoin-in-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

38225618,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53267,1735387227,Ethena And AAVE Investors Spot Stronger DeFi Potential On This New Altcoin And Target A Possible 50x Move,"Ethena (ENA) and Aave (AAVE) investors are turning their focus to a new altcoin that is witnessing increased demand in the market. They believe this new altcoin could shake things up in DeFi. What’s got them so confident? This new player has features that grab attention and a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Let’s find out more about this new altcoin! Meet DTX Exchange: The Game Changer in Crypto Trading DTX Exchange (DTX) is making waves in the crypto world. Many are calling it the best crypto to buy because it combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized platforms. This mix could make trading simpler and more flexible for investors everywhere. The DTX Exchange platform offers a variety of trading options, including stocks, forex, ETFs, and more than 100,000 currency pairs. With such a wide selection, DTX Exchange stands out in the growing DeFi market. The ability to trade many different assets in one place gives it a competitive advantage. One unique feature of DTX Exchange is its ability to bring real-world assets to the blockchain. By turning them into digital tokens, it lowers the cost for regular investors. This could make it an appealing option for those looking to save on trading fees. The presale for DTX has been a success, with the DeFi coin price jumping over 500%. This huge increase shows that there’s strong interest in the platform, and many believe it has great potential for the future. As more people learn about DTX Exchange, its market impact could grow. It’s a platform worth keeping an eye on if you’re interested in the latest trends in the crypto world. Massive ENA Stake Sparks Excitement: Is Ethena the Best Crypto to Buy Now? A huge move in the Ethena market caught attention when a whale withdrew millions of ENA tokens from Binance. The whale pulled out 9 million ENA, worth nearly $9.8 million, and staked them into Ethena. In total, the trader now has over $16.9 million worth of tokens staked in the Ethena platform. This move isn’t just about withdrawing funds. The trader has shifted their ENA into USDe, a synthetic coin tied to Ethena’s DeFi system. By staking USDe, investors can earn up to 27% annual interest. This new way of earning rewards has caught the eye of many, making Ethena a hot pick for those searching for the best crypto to buy. Meanwhile, ENA’s price movement has been slow recently. ENA is trading at $1.055, a slight 2.22% decline from last week when it traded at $1.079. Despite this decline, some experts foresee an uptrend for ENA because of certain patterns on its price chart. Thus, they have forecasted that the value of ENA could surge past $2 in a few weeks. Conversely, if ENA fails to pick up the momentum soon, it could fall as low as $0.80. Aave’s Latest DeFi Innovation: How SVR Oracle Impacts AAVE’s Price Aave is rolling out a new feature called the Smart Value Recapture (SVR) oracle. This tool, launched on December 23, 2024, is meant to help Aave users keep more of their earnings. It focuses on capturing profits that would normally be lost, particularly from maximum extractable value (MEV) in the platform’s liquidations. Meanwhile, AAVE’s price has been rising steadily since the start of December. In the past week, the value of AAVE has increased from $340.24 to $375.41, signaling a 9.37% surge. Top analysts are divided in the AAVE outlook regarding price predictions. The fear and greed index, which stands above 70, means that the token will surge. Hence, AAVE could touch $400 soon. On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index is at a neutral point. If the market turns bearish, then the price of AAVE could fall to $300 in a few weeks. DTX Gains Attention Ahead of a 50x Rally Aave and Ethena are key players in the crypto market and are known for their strong network and steady growth projections. But with their coin price slipping, DTX Exchange has stepped into the spotlight. This fresh DeFi coin has already caught attention by raising over $10 million in its presale. You can now buy DTX coins at $0.14 each in Stage 7 of its public presale. Many are calling it one of the best cryptos to buy right now because of its potential to give investors 50x profits. DTX stands out with a unique hybrid platform offering traders more flexibility. It supports diverse trades and gives users better options for managing their portfolios. Join the growing DTX Exchange community and enjoy this 50x surge!

38224933,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399110,1735387200,"Top 3 ETH Based Coins Set To Turn $1000 Into $100,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI) And Yeti Ouro (YETIO)","The post Top 3 ETH Based Coins Set To Turn $1000 Into $100,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI) And Yeti Ouro (YETIO) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Crypto world is evolving daily, and investors are always trying to find the next trending opportunity. With 2024 fast approaching, three Ethereum-based coins are becoming the talk of the town with the potential to make a smaller $1000 investment into a life-changing $100,000. So, we’ve got Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), and the new kid on the block, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), all of which offer their own unique features and growth potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Since its introduction, Shiba Inu dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has taken the crypto world by storm. Although there was a recent setback, with a decrease of 11.68% in the last month, SHIB price is still holding firm on the market and Shiba Inu has a strong community. 1-month Shiba Inu price chart- source: CoinMarketCap SHIB’s huge supply of 589.5 trillion tokens has created a minute price, but this hasn’t stopped its ardent fanbase. With developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it’s possible that the project’s ecosystem will continue to grow and drive future price appreciation. Floki (FLOKI): The Meme Coin Inspired By A Viking Named for Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, Floki has found its place in the meme coin space. FLOKI has fallen 18.98% in the last month but remains a community-driven project with an ambitious roadmap. 1-month FLOKI price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Through NFTs, gaming metaverse, and education platforms, FLOKI’s team is looking to build utility while stepping towards integrating its coins into the online merchant world. Such initiatives could result in massive value for FLOKI holders over the coming years. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): A Game Changer For New Users Now, let us consider the newcomer who is piquing the excitement of the crypto world: Yeti Ouro. YETIO is far from a run-of-the-mill meme coin; it is a utility generator in an innovative new gaming ecosystem. Yeti Ouro’s centerpiece is Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game developed on the Unreal Engine. This high-octane game aims to mix the fast-paced world of racing with the ability to earn crypto. Knock rivals from the platforms, use power-ups, dodge obstacles, and earn YETIO tokens; that’s what players will do. What makes YETIO unique is its actual use within the Yeti Go ecosystem: In-game purchases: Get skins, power-ups, and other items to customize your racing experience.

With the year coming to an end in just a few days, on-chain data actually shows that this could all change in a rather unexpected fashion. Trading Volumes Mean Gains? The broader end of 2024 was quite spectacular as BTC skyrocketed from under $70,000 to over $108,000 within less than two months after the US presidential elections. On a micro-scale, though, the asset has been struggling for the past ten days as it tumbled from that aforementioned all-time high to $92,000 in days and sits at $94,000 now. Moreover, the trading volumes have slumped in the past week, which is quite expected given the Holiday season. That, though, could actually be the propeller of a price rally, according to data from Santiment. The analytics platform indicated that in times of low trading volumes, whales play a particularly important role if their accumulation levels continue. In the final days of 2024, trading volume is way down across crypto sectors. Overall, there has been -64% less trading in the past week compared to the previous week (which included Bitcoin’s all-time high). The trading downtrend of trading, particularly among speculative… pic.twitter.com/ZTGbED2rak — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 27, 2024 Many large investors have been on a shopping spree lately for different assets, not just BTC. In fact, “speculative altcoins” are even more susceptible to price gains on such occasions, which could be beneficial for meme coins such as DOGE. On-chain data shared by Ali Martinez indicates that Dogecoin whales used the dip to acquire more of the largest meme coin in the past few days. Whales bought over 90 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/lGsMtz0iPp — Ali (@ali_charts) December 27, 2024 Stablecoins on Binance The other factor is the growing stablecoin reserve on the world’s largest crypto exchange. Binance has seen a massive intake of such assets, which are typically deployed to accumulate BTC or altcoins. According to CryptoQuant, the exchange now holds $29 billion in USDT and USDC, which “underlines Binance’s pivotal role in providing liquidity and stability to the market during this explosive growth phase.” “Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are critical for traders and institutions, serving as a bridge between fiat and crypto while enabling seamless trading during volatile periods,” – reads the report. It concluded that this particular surge of the two biggest stablecoins by market cap is a “bullish signal.” The post 2 Key Drivers of a Surprise Year-End Crypto Rally appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/2-key-drivers-of-a-surprise-year-end-crypto-rally-in-2024/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38224662.jpeg

This marked the highest trading activity in three months for the network, reaffirming its dominance in the NFT ecosystem. The surge underscores not just the Ethereum’s resilience but also its ability to evolve and capture speculative momentum. Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained NFT revival or a temporary bubble, the spotlight remains firmly on Ethereum and its ecosystem of innovators. Pudgy Penguins Drive Ethereum NFT Resurgence The surge was largely driven by the Pudgy Penguins collection, which generated an astonishing $108 million in trading volume. This spike followed the much-anticipated launch of the collection’s native PENGU token . The launch not only attracted traders but also saw individual Pudgy Penguins NFTs trading for over 29 ETH before a sharp cooldown post-token issuance. The $PENGU token distribution extended beyond traditional holders, incorporating eligible wallets from both Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. This strategy broadened the market impact, pulling in new participants and sparking speculative interest in Ethereum-based NFTs. Prominent Collections The Pudgy Penguins’ success appeared to set off a chain reaction across other leading NFT collections. Notable projects like Azuki and Doodles witnessed major upticks in trading activity, recording $23 million and $17 million in volumes, respectively. Speculators seemed to anticipate similar token launches from these collections, fueling a broader shift in market expectations toward tokenized NFT ecosystems. Ethereum’s commanding lead in the NFT sector remains evident, with its $186 million trading volume vastly overshadowing Bitcoin’s $33 million for the same period. While competing chains have made strides in building their own NFT ecosystems, the sheer scale of Ethereum’s activity highlights its continued role as the go-to platform for high-value transactions and innovation. As the market digests the implications of the Pudgy Penguins’ tokenization strategy, speculation grows over whether other major collections will follow suit. The success of $PENGU may well set a precedent, sparking a new wave of token launches aimed at revitalizing NFT markets.

Crypto Predictions for 2025 from @glxyresearch Featuring… bitcoin and ether price, ETHBTC, both Dogecoin and D.O.G.E., stablecoins, defi, L2s, policy, VC, and more… Here are the predictions we just sent to @galaxyhq clients and counterparties — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 Bitcoin and Ethereum to Go Higher Bitcoin is expected to surpass $150,000 in the first half of the year, potentially hitting $185,000 by year-end, driven by institutional, corporate, and even nation-state adoption. Ethereum, too, is set to shine, with its price predicted to climb above $5,500, fueled by regulatory clarity and partnerships between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). US Spot Bitcoin ETP Growth The total value of Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the U.S. will exceed $250 billion. This growth reflects increased institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin as a Top Asset Bitcoin will outperform most other assets globally when considering risk and returns. Its resilience will make it a favorite for both retail and institutional investors. Wealth Management Allocation Leading financial platforms will recommend allocating at least 2% of portfolios to Bitcoin. This will encourage more investors to include Bitcoin in their long-term plans. Corporate and National Adoption Five major Nasdaq-listed companies and five countries will add Bitcoin to their reserves. This will solidify Bitcoin’s role as a global asset for both corporations and nations. Bitcoin Protocol Upgrade Developers will agree on a significant upgrade to Bitcoin’s technology . This could include new features to improve functionality and scalability. Mining Partnerships with AI Over half of the top Bitcoin mining companies will partner with AI or high-performance computing firms. These collaborations will enhance mining efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Bitcoin in DeFi The amount of Bitcoin used in decentralized finance (DeFi) will nearly double. This shows Bitcoin’s growing utility beyond being just a store of value. Ethereum Staking Boom Over 50% of Ethereum’s supply will be staked, showing confidence in its long-term value. Staking will also strengthen the network’s security. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today (Dec 28, 2024): Bitcoin Stuck Below $95k, as Altcoins Struggle , ETH/BTC Ratio Fluctuation Ethereum’s value compared to Bitcoin will drop below $0.03 but recover to over $0.06 by year-end. This reflects shifting investor sentiment throughout the year. Layer 2 Dominance Layer 2 networks will generate more activity than alternative Layer 1 blockchains. They will offer faster and cheaper transactions, attracting more users. DeFi Dividend Era Decentralized applications will distribute at least $1 billion in rewards to users. This marks a shift toward sharing profits with participants. On-Chain Governance Revival DeFi projects will experiment with new governance models to involve users in decision-making. This will make the ecosystem more decentralized and innovative. Custodian Banks Enter Crypto The world’s four largest custodian banks will start offering crypto services. This will bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. New Stablecoins At least ten new stablecoins will launch, backed by traditional finance partners. These stablecoins will bring more liquidity and trust to the market. Stablecoin Supply Surge The total supply of stablecoins will double to over $400 billion. This reflects the growing demand for stable, blockchain-based assets. Tether’s Market Share Decline Tether’s dominance will drop below 50%, facing competition from alternatives like USDC and new offerings like BlackRock’s BUIDL. Crypto Venture Capital Boom Venture capital investment in crypto will exceed $150 billion, growing by over 50% year-over-year. This influx will fuel innovation across the industry. Stablecoin Legislation The U.S. Congress will pass laws regulating stablecoins , signed by President Trump in 2025. However, broader crypto market regulations will remain unresolved. U.S. Bitcoin Reserves The U.S. government won’t buy more Bitcoin but will use its existing holdings to build reserves. Agencies will explore policies for managing Bitcoin reserves. SEC Investigates Prometheum The SEC will investigate Prometheum, a special-purpose broker-dealer. This could set a precedent for how crypto platforms are regulated. Dogecoin Hits $1 Dogecoin will finally reach $1 , with its market cap soaring to $100 billion. This will make the memecoin a major player in the crypto world. The year-ending predictions are setting a bullish tone for the year 2025, though the market is also cautious about a potential market crash after Trump officially takes charge till then it’s all speculative. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The big banks, who once rolled their eyes at crypto and left it to the small fry, are now elbowing their way into the market. They see the dollar signs, and apparently, they’ve decided that reputation be damned. The fees are too good to ignore. Bitcoin’s transformation from “hyped-up fraud” (thanks Jamie Dimon ) to a cash cow has been nothing short of wild. The SEC approved Bitcoin spot ETFs. Add Trump’s return to office and his administration’s apparent crypto-friendliness, and you’ve got Wall Street rolling up its sleeves and getting dirty. Big money and bigger risks for Wall Street Barclays and Citigroup are leading the charge, underwriting multiple convertible bond offerings for MicroStrategy. JPMorgan’s also in the mix, doing the same thing for big Bitcoin miners like Core Scientific and Mara. Even Goldman Sachs is cashing in, raising funds for Applied Digital, a company that builds data centers for Bitcoin miners. More than $13 billion in crypto-related convertible bonds have been issued this year, most of it in just the past few months. Fees? Banks are raking in at least $200 million from these deals, according to estimates. MicroStrategy alone has handed over 2% fees on its mind-blowing $21 billion equity offering. But don’t think Wall Street’s gone full crypto fanboy. The big players are still picky. Coinbase, a well-established exchange, is a safer bet than, say, a startup Bitcoin miner. Even among similar companies, reputational baggage matters. MicroStrategy might be a Bitcoin darling, but Michael Saylor’s legal history isn’t exactly squeaky clean. Still, when the fees are this fat, banks seem willing to hold their noses. And since a few big banks jump in, the rest can’t afford to sit on the sidelines. Competition is fierce, and no banker wants to explain to their boss why they’re slipping in the league tables. That said, Wall Street’s love for crypto has its limits. The banks still draw the line with certain industries. Adult entertainment and cannabis—legal but taboo sectors—are still no-go zones for many. Crypto straddles that line, a gray area where respectability clashes with profit potential.

38225993,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323202,1735384982,Federal Bitcoin Reserve May Push Bitcoin Price to 1 Million,"The idea of Bitcoin reaching $1 million may seem like an ambitious projection, but experts suggest that it hinges on a transformative event: the creation of a U.S. Federal Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, has put forward this bold claim, estimating the probability of such a reserve being established at less than 10% for 2025. While the likelihood is slim, the implications of such a move could be monumental for the cryptocurrency market. The idea of a federal Bitcoin Strategic Reserve happening in 2025 is less than a 10% chance event. That’s the only math in which Bitcoin can hit $1mm+ in 2025 when it happens. — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) December 26, 2024 The Role of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve A federal Bitcoin reserve would represent a groundbreaking shift in how governments interact with cryptocurrencies. It would involve the U.S. Treasury allocating funds to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Park argues that such a reserve is the only scenario in which Bitcoin could reasonably achieve the $1 million price target by 2025. Here is a simple illustration of how probability math works– Bottom right looks most probable to me, ie. 2.5% chance. pic.twitter.com/KCsqHGnFMu — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) December 26, 2024 “The idea of a federal Bitcoin Strategic Reserve happening in 2025 is less than a 10% chance event,” Park stated on X (formerly Twitter). “That’s the only math in which Bitcoin can hit $1mm+ in 2025 when it happens.” Park’s analysis underscores the potential for governments to influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. As the cryptocurrency market matures, the introduction of a federal reserve could drive institutional adoption, spark unprecedented demand, and create a domino effect across global markets. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Key Levels and Market Trends Bitcoin is trading at $94,570, down 1.75% over the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $40.18 billion. The price remains below the $95,000 mark, facing resistance at $96,850. A break above this level could target $98,330 and $100,250, while immediate support lies at $92,140 and $90,400. The RSI at 43 reflects weak momentum, and the 50-day EMA near $96,850 reinforces bearish sentiment. A failure to break resistance may push prices toward $90,000, while a breakout could renew bullish momentum. Federal Bitcoin Reserve: A Game-Changer? Speculation about a U.S. Federal Bitcoin Strategic Reserve has intensified. Jeff Park of Bitwise Asset Management estimates a less than 10% chance of its establishment by 2025, but he argues it’s the only realistic path for Bitcoin to reach $1 million. Legislative and Market Developments Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed legislation for the U.S. Treasury to acquire Bitcoin, sparking debate. Proponents see it as a hedge against inflation; critics cite volatility and risks. Market sentiment remains split, with prediction markets assigning a 31% chance of a reserve by 2025. Bitcoin Outlook While speculative, a federal Bitcoin reserve could redefine market dynamics, boosting prices through institutional adoption. For now, Bitcoin’s resilience continues to capture global attention, even as its $1 million milestone remains uncertain.

The move potentially ends a legal saga and a standoff between the US and South Korea over competing extradition demands for Do Kwon. Do Kwon To Be Extradited The decision to extradite Do Kwon to the US was approved by Montenegro’s Justice Minister Bojan Bozovic. The move comes after a Supreme Court ruling and legal evaluation, which lasted for over a year. According to Montenegro’s Supreme Court, both the US and South Korea had met legal conditions for extradition. “JUST IN: Terra Luna Founder Do Kwon to be extradited to the United States.” Do Kwon and his business partner Han Cheng Jun were arrested in March 2023 at Podgorica airport, attempting to travel to Dubai using forged passports. Kwon also served a four-month prison sentence in Montenegro for document forgery. Montenegro’s Ministry of Justice said in a statement, “The Ministry of Justice examined all the facts and circumstances, including the severity of the crimes, the jurisdiction of the offenses, and the extradition requests. Most criteria favored the US request. Most criteria envisaged by the law are in favor of the extradition demands from the institutions of the United States of America.” Bozovic decided on Friday but did not specify when the handover would happen. The Charges Against Do Kwon Do Kwon faces charges in New York and Seoul over the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022, which led to losses worth a staggering $40 billion and the collapse of several prominent crypto companies. The Manhattan US Attorney’s office brought fraud charges against Do Kwon last year but has not commented on Montenegro’s decision. US authorities claim that Do Kwon misled investors and believe he is hiding substantial assets. Furthermore, it is unclear if Friday’s decision is final because courts in Montenegro have also previously ruled that Do Kwon must be extradited to South Korea instead of the US. Do Kwon’s lawyer, Goran Rodic, who attempted to get him extradited to South Korea, has also not spoken about the decision. Terraform and Do Kwon were found personally liable for fraud after a civil trial following allegations by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following the trial, Terraform has agreed to pay $4.5 billion and settle the case with the SEC. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38293914,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115355,1735383655,Spot Bitcoin ETF Assets Near Gold ETF Size Within a Year,"Spot Bitcoin ETF Assets Near Gold ETF Size Within a Year The cryptocurrency market reached another significant milestone as spot Bitcoin ETFs nearly matched the size of gold ETFs, just one year after their debut. According to Nate Geraci , CEO of U.S.-based wealth management firm The ETF Store , this development underscores the rapid adoption of cryptocurrency as a mainstream asset class. Bitcoin ETFs vs. Gold ETFs: A Quick Comparison Gold has long been considered the ultimate store of value, with ETFs making it easily accessible to investors. However, Bitcoin’s rise as “digital gold” has accelerated its competition with traditional safe-haven assets. 1. Growth of Spot Bitcoin ETFs In just one year, spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed billions in assets under management (AUM). The introduction of ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC has made Bitcoin more accessible to institutional and retail investors. 2. Gold ETFs’ Established Dominance Gold ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) , have dominated for decades, with AUM consistently exceeding $100 billion globally. The near parity between Bitcoin and gold ETF assets reflects Bitcoin’s increasing credibility among traditional investors. Key Drivers of Spot Bitcoin ETF Growth 1. Institutional Adoption High-profile financial institutions like BlackRock , Fidelity , and ARK Invest have introduced Bitcoin ETFs, attracting significant inflows. Institutional investors appreciate Bitcoin ETFs for their regulated structure and simplified exposure to cryptocurrency. 2. Retail Investor Participation Bitcoin ETFs simplify crypto investment for retail investors by eliminating the need for wallets, private keys, and direct custody. The ease of access through existing brokerage accounts has driven adoption. 3. Mainstream Acceptance of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s recognition as a legitimate asset has grown, bolstered by macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns and currency devaluation. Major corporations like Tesla and MicroStrategy adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has further validated its appeal. How Spot Bitcoin ETFs Compare to Gold ETFs Feature Bitcoin ETFs Gold ETFs Age of Market ~1 Year ~20 Years AUM Growth Rate Rapid (Billions in 1 Year) Steady (Billions over Decades) Volatility High Low Adoption Catalyst Rising Institutional Participation Historical Safe-Haven Asset Future Potential Blockchain and DeFi Integration Established Stability Expert Opinions on Bitcoin ETFs vs. Gold ETFs Nate Geraci, The ETF Store CEO Geraci highlights the swift rise of Bitcoin ETFs, stating they demonstrate “growing investor appetite for innovative, alternative assets.” He believes Bitcoin ETFs will likely surpass gold ETFs in size within the next few years if the current growth trajectory continues. Peter Schiff, Gold Advocate Schiff remains skeptical, arguing that Bitcoin’s volatility and lack of intrinsic value make it unsuitable as a long-term store of value. Cathie Wood, ARK Invest CEO Wood predicts that Bitcoin ETFs will continue to attract significant inflows, given Bitcoin’s capped supply and growing adoption. Potential Challenges Ahead for Bitcoin ETFs While the growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs is impressive, several hurdles remain: Regulatory Uncertainty Continued regulatory scrutiny in regions like the U.S. could hinder growth. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price fluctuations may deter risk-averse investors. Competition from Alternatives Gold ETFs maintain a reputation for stability that Bitcoin ETFs lack. What This Means for Investors 1. Diversification Opportunities Investors can consider allocating to both Bitcoin and gold ETFs to hedge against different types of market risk. 2. Short-Term Volatility vs. Long-Term Gains While Bitcoin ETFs offer higher potential returns, they come with greater short-term volatility compared to gold ETFs. 3.

38223443,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631418,1735383600,"$630 in This Altcoin Could Reach $63,000 in the Next 100 Days & It Isn’t Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP)","A $630 investment in this emerging altcoin could soar to $63,000 in the next 100 days, according to analysts—and it’s not Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP). Lightchain AI (LCAI) is capturing attention with its groundbreaking innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), seamlessly integrating AI with blockchain for unprecedented scalability and efficiency. Currently in its presale at just $0.003 per token, LCAI offers investors a unique opportunity to get in early on a project poised for transformative growth in decentralized technology and AI. The Next Big Altcoin Opportunity- What Sets It Apart From SOL and XRP The digital money market always looks for the next big altcoin, and this new player is different with special value ideas that go beyond Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP). Different from SOL which pays much attention to speed and size, and XRP which is about payments across borders, this altcoin brings a new way to use it that has no equal value in its system. Its strong token rules, new tech, and promise to fix real-life issues give it an edge. The mix of top AI tools and eco-friendly blockchain fixes draws in both regular folks and big investors. With a fast-growing group of users and smart deals boosting its use, this altcoin is ready for quick growth catching the eye of investors looking for big chances i͏n the blockchain area. $630 to $63,000- The 100-Day Growth Potential Explained The potential for $630 to grow into $63,000 within 100 days hinges on the exponential trajectory of a high-performing altcoin with solid fundamentals and market demand. This altcoin’s unique ecosystem positions it as a disruptor, targeting real-world challenges with scalable solutions. Its deflationary tokenomics, reduced supply over time, and innovative reward systems incentivize early adopters while driving value. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, its adoption is rapidly growing due to its seamless integration with trending technologies like AI and blockchain interoperability. Market catalysts such as strategic partnerships, a growing user base, and bullish sentiment in the altcoin sector amplify this growth potential. With its market cap still at an early stage, the possibility of rapid price appreciation is significant. Investors betting $630 today could see life-changing returns as the crypto market anticipates an explosive rally over the coming months. How Lightchain AI (LCAI) Will Convert $630 to $63,00 Investing $630 in Lightchain AI (LCAI) during its presale phase, where tokens are priced at $0.003, would yield 210,000 tokens. Analysts project that LCAI could reach $50 per token, which would value your investment at $10,500,000. This growth potential is attributed to LCAI’s innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, featuring unique elements like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These advancements position LCAI to address real-world challenges across various industries, enhancing its adoption and value. However, it’s important to recognize that such projections are speculative and depend on various factors, including market demand, technological advancements, and successful execution of the project’s roadmap. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments before committing funds. Why $LCAI Could Be the Biggest Opportunity of 2024/2025 Whenever a token starts gaining attention as a potential 100x or even 500x investment, the first question is almost always the same: Why should I trust this project? Here’s why Lightchain AI is different. 1. An Innovative Consensus Mechanism (PoI) Unlike traditional methods like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW), PoI rewards meaningful AI computations instead of wasting resources on unnecessary tasks. This approach not only saves energy but also contributes directly to AI innovation. Plus, it’s environmentally conscious. 2. Practical Utility With AIVM Blockchains that promise a lot but deliver little are a thing of the past. The AIVM is set to power the next generation of decentralized apps designed for AI-specific purposes—from predictive analytics to natural language processing (NLP). Developers are already considering this platform as the smartest choice for their next big project. 3. The Numbers Speak For Themselves A presale price of $0.003 is almost unheard of for a project with this level of innovation. Let’s break down how $300 could grow into $100K. $300 at $0.003 gets you 100,000 $LCAI tokens If $LCAI hits $1 (a reasonable target for 2025 based on its roadmap), that’s $100,000. For some context, early adopters of tokens like Solana and Binance Coin saw similar entry prices turn into significant returns. Lightchain AI is following a similar trajectory but with a groundbreaking focus on technology. 4. Supported By A Strong Roadmap This isn’t a short-lived project. The Lightchain Roadmap is detailed and extends all the way to its Mainnet Launch. Testnets are operational, validator nodes are ready, and discussions with major industry players are already underway. Progress is steady, and the timeline is clear. Phase 1- Prototype Creation and Community Development Phase 2- Testnet Release and Optimization Phase 3- Mainnet Activation (the big moment!) The milestones planned for 2024 are set to make waves. If $LCAI achieves even a portion of its goals, 100x gains may prove to be an underestimation. Wrapping Up Things Investing in Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity to gain exposure to the growing intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies. Its innovative approach, solid fundamentals, and potential for exponential growth make it a compelling investment option for those seeking transformative opportunities in the crypto market. However, as with any investment, it is important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before committing funds. With its upcoming Mainnet launch and strong roadmap, Lightchain AI has the potential to be one of the biggest success stories of 2024/2025. Are you ready to join the revolution?

38222975,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115331,1735382908,"Galaxy Digital: U.S. Unlikely to Buy Bitcoin in 2025, Focus on Existing Holdings","Galaxy Digital: U.S. Unlikely to Buy Bitcoin in 2025, Focus on Existing Holdings Research by Galaxy Digital , a crypto-focused financial services firm, predicts that the U.S. government will not purchase additional Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025. Instead, policymakers may leverage the country’s existing Bitcoin stockpile as part of a potential Bitcoin reserve policy , according to a Cointelegraph report . Current U.S. Bitcoin Holdings The U.S. government holds approximately 183,850 BTC , valued at $17.36 billion as of today. These holdings primarily stem from: Seizures of illicit funds , such as the Silk Road case. Auctioning of confiscated Bitcoin , which contributed to its reserve. Proposed Bitcoin Reserve Policy 1. The Bitcoin Act 2024 Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act 2024 , which proposes: Accumulating 1 million BTC over five years. Purchasing 200,000 BTC annually , creating a substantial Bitcoin reserve. 2. Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Reserves Advocates argue that a national Bitcoin reserve could: Diversify the country’s financial assets. Act as a hedge against inflation. Strengthen U.S. leadership in global digital asset markets. Why the U.S. Might Not Buy Bitcoin in 2025 1. Leverage Existing Holdings Galaxy Digital suggests the government may rely on its current Bitcoin stockpile, strategically utilizing it rather than expanding it through new purchases. 2. Policy Deliberations Ongoing debates about Bitcoin’s role in national reserves might delay significant action. Skepticism among policymakers regarding Bitcoin’s volatility and regulatory implications. 3. Alternative Approaches Instead of purchasing, the government could explore using Bitcoin for: Backing a digital dollar. Supporting financial aid programs or blockchain initiatives. Potential Impacts of the Bitcoin Act 2024 1. Market Influence If the U.S. commits to buying 200,000 BTC annually , it could: Drive demand and increase Bitcoin prices. Set a global precedent, encouraging other nations to follow suit. 2. Industry Growth A formal Bitcoin reserve policy could catalyze: Increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Development of blockchain infrastructure within the U.S. 3. Regulatory Considerations Policymakers would need to address: Tax implications of Bitcoin holdings. Security measures to protect the national reserve. What This Means for the Crypto Market 1. Government Influence The U.S. government’s stance on Bitcoin as a strategic asset will significantly influence global market dynamics. Speculation about a reserve policy could create price volatility in the short term. 2. Institutional Adoption A clear policy framework could encourage private institutions to increase their Bitcoin holdings, further mainstreaming digital assets. 3. Geopolitical Implications A national Bitcoin reserve would strengthen the U.S.’s position in the global digital economy , especially as other countries explore central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Conclusion While Galaxy Digital predicts that the U.S. government will refrain from purchasing more Bitcoin in 2025, the possibility of implementing a Bitcoin reserve policy highlights the increasing relevance of digital assets in national economic strategies. Whether through leveraging existing holdings or adopting a formal accumulation plan, the U.S. is poised to play a critical role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency.

38222877,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115363,1735382747,What Is Price Action in Forex? A Comprehensive Guide,"What Is Price Action in Forex? A Comprehensive Guide Price action in forex is a trading strategy that relies solely on price movement without relying heavily on technical indicators or external analysis. Instead, traders analyze historical price patterns, candlestick formations, and key support/resistance levels to make informed trading decisions. This method is popular among both novice and experienced traders because it provides a clear and straightforward approach to understanding market behavior. In this article, we’ll explore what price action in forex is, its importance, the strategies involved, and how you can use it to improve your trading skills. Understanding Price Action in Forex Price action refers to the movement of a currency pair’s price on a forex chart. It reflects the supply and demand dynamics in the market, driven by fundamental and technical factors. Unlike other trading methods, price action focuses entirely on interpreting raw price data.

While this marks a two-point decline from the previous day, the index remains firmly in the “Greed” zone , signifying overall optimism among market participants. This metric, developed by Alternative , gauges market sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100 , where 0 represents extreme fear and 100 denotes extreme greed. With its current position, the index highlights a market driven by confidence, though the slight dip suggests a mild cooling of sentiment. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a sentiment analysis tool designed to measure the emotional dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It aggregates data from six core factors: 1. Volatility (25%) Measures the degree of price fluctuations in the market. High volatility often correlates with increased fear. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Tracks the trading volume and momentum of major cryptocurrencies. High momentum typically reflects bullish sentiment. 3. Social Media (15%) Monitors mentions, trends, and activity on platforms like Twitter. Positive buzz amplifies the “Greed” reading. 4. Surveys (15%) Based on community polls about market sentiment. Offers insight into the perception of retail investors. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Reflects Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market cap. A declining dominance suggests increasing interest in altcoins. 6. Google Trends (10%) Analyzes search interest in Bitcoin-related terms. Spikes in search volume can indicate heightened attention. What Does a Score of 72 Indicate? 1. Sustained Optimism The “Greed” zone (scores between 55–75) reflects an optimistic market outlook. Investors are confident, potentially taking on more risk to capitalize on bullish trends. 2. Cooling Enthusiasm The slight dip from 74 to 72 suggests a tempered sentiment compared to previous days. External factors, such as market corrections or regulatory news, could influence this shift. Current Market Factors Influencing the Index 1. Bitcoin Price Consolidation Bitcoin has been trading within a relatively narrow range, fostering market stability. Stable prices reduce fear, encouraging greater participation in the market. 2. Seasonal Market Trends Year-end activities, including portfolio rebalancing, often impact market sentiment. The crypto market has historically seen increased activity during the holiday season. 3. Increased Altcoin Activity Rising interest in altcoins, as evidenced by gains in trading volume for projects like Ethereum and Solana , boosts market momentum. Risks of High “Greed” Levels While a high score in the “Greed” zone can signify bullish sentiment, it also presents potential risks: 1. Overbought Conditions A persistent “Greed” reading often coincides with overbought market conditions. This increases the likelihood of corrections as investors take profits. 2. Emotional Decision-Making High levels of greed can lead to irrational investment decisions, such as chasing pumps or over-leveraging positions. Potential Implications for the Market 1. Increased Retail Participation Positive sentiment can attract more retail investors, driving up trading volumes. The fear of missing out (FOMO) often amplifies during “Greed” phases. 2. Altcoin Market Expansion As Bitcoin stabilizes, funds may flow into altcoins, leading to increased activity in projects with strong fundamentals. 3. Heightened Volatility Risk A sentiment shift from greed to fear can trigger sharp market corrections, emphasizing the need for cautious trading strategies. How to Navigate the Current Market For Bitcoin Investors Monitor key support and resistance levels. Consider partial profit-taking if Bitcoin shows signs of overextension. For Altcoin Traders Focus on projects with high trading volumes and significant use cases. Stay vigilant about potential market corrections triggered by profit-taking in Bitcoin. For Long-Term Holders Stick to your strategy and avoid reacting emotionally to short-term sentiment changes. Use dips in the “Greed” zone as buying opportunities if fundamentals remain strong. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s score of 72 highlights sustained optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with a slight dip signaling tempered enthusiasm. As the market remains in the “Greed” zone, traders and investors should balance their strategies, recognizing the potential for both continued growth and heightened volatility. Keeping an eye on sentiment metrics like the Fear & Greed Index can help market participants make more informed decisions, navigating the fine line between confidence and caution.

Short-Term Caution Investors should prepare for potential volatility, particularly if Bitcoin dips below $60,000 . Stop-loss orders and risk management strategies are crucial during periods of uncertainty. 2. Long-Term Opportunity The current dip may present a buying opportunity for those with a long-term investment horizon.

JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America reported declines of 0.9% and 0.8% , respectively. 3. Consumer Discretionary Retail stocks like Target and Amazon struggled as holiday sales data revealed lackluster performance. Amazon fell 2.2% , reflecting broader concerns about consumer spending. Market Sentiment: What Are Analysts Saying? 1. Volatility to Persist Analysts expect heightened market volatility in the coming weeks as investors process economic data and corporate earnings reports. “This pullback is likely a response to mixed signals from economic indicators,” said a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley. 2. Buying Opportunities Amidst the Decline Some strategists view the downturn as a chance to accumulate quality stocks at lower prices. “Long-term investors should focus on sectors like healthcare and energy, which may offer resilience in a slowing economy,” noted an equity strategist. Global Market Impacts 1. Asian and European Markets The losses in U.S. markets followed a similarly weak performance in Asian and European markets earlier in the day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Germany’s DAX closed down 1.7% and 1.3% , respectively. 2. Impact on Cryptocurrencies The decline in equity markets mirrored the performance of major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down 2% and 1.5% , respectively. How Should Investors Respond? 1. Diversification is Key Investors should ensure their portfolios are diversified across various sectors and asset classes to mitigate risks during volatile periods. 2. Monitor Key Economic Data Keep an eye on upcoming economic reports, including the Federal Reserve’s next meeting and corporate earnings announcements. 3. Stay Focused on Long-Term Goals While market pullbacks can be unsettling, they often present buying opportunities for long-term investors. Conclusion The U.S. markets experienced significant intraday losses on December 27, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all declining amid growing economic uncertainty and pressure on the technology sector.

38222781,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634244,1735382105,Nonprofit Encode files amicus brief to support Elon Musk’s fight against OpenAI,"Nonprofit Encode has requested permission to file an amicus brief to support Elon Musk in his dispute with OpenAI. The billionaire CEO of Tesla has been in a long-standing battle with OpenAI, accusing the firm of going against its promises to investors. The SpaceX boss filed an injunction asking the court to block OpenAI’s transition into a for-profit organization. The brief was submitted by Encode’s legal counsel at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In the brief, the organization asserts that granting OpenAI’s for-profit status will undermine the company’s vision. This means that its technologies will no longer be developed and deployed in a way that will be safe and beneficial to the public. Encode joins the fight against OpenAI’s transition In its brief , Encode mentioned that OpenAI’s vision statement needs to be taken seriously. “OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,” the brief read. The brief also said that it is in the best interest of the general public to have a public charity control the firm’s actions. Encode believes that if the public charity controls OpenAI’s actions, it can prioritize public benefits and not just focus on generating returns for its privileged investors. Another portion of the brief mentioned that the move should be blocked because the general public already has vested interests in the technology. Encode’s lawyers also ripped into OpenAI’s move to cede control to a PBC. “The move would convert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to ‘balance’ its consideration of any public benefit against ‘the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders,” it said. The legal counsels noted in the brief, the company’s ethos of not competing with safety-conscious projects that are close to building AGI before it does. Meanwhile, if it moves to a for-profit organization, it would have to discard such initiatives. It also said that if the time comes for the non-profit arm to push for safety by returning investor’s equity, it would be blocked from doing so after the restructuring. Encode’s brief also said that the firm’s humanity-first responsibility to the public would evaporate if the move is approved. It claims the safety-focused approach would be breached, a move that could harm public interest. The non-profit arm could also be forced to relinquish control at any point in time with no commitment made towards public safety. OpenAI’s new model and its legal battle with Elon Musk OpenAI was initially founded as a non-profit organization in 2015, with the company just a research lab. Along the line, it needed capital to carry out some of its projects, paving the way for its current structure. The company has raised funds from several venture capitalists and corporations, including its biggest investor to date, Microsoft. Presently, the company has a hybrid structure, a profit arm that is controlled by its non-profit arm which provides a capped profit for investors and employees. The company has also hinted in a blog about its intention to transition its for-profit arm into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). With this, its non-profit arm will continue to exist but will surrender control of shares at the PBC. Elon Musk, one of the co-founders and an early contributor filed a lawsuit requesting the court to block the transition. Musk accused the firm of abandoning its original vision, denying the public from having access to its research. OpenAI hit back at Musk, calling his accusations baseless. The firm claimed he was the first to suggest the move to a for-profit model. Encode is not the first organization to back Elon Musk and oppose OpenAI’s transition. Meta Platforms sent a letter to California general attorney Rob Bonta arguing against the shift. According to the Facebook parent company and fellow rival in the AI scene, the move will have a shattering effect on Silicon Valley. The company also registered its faith in fellow rival Elon Musk to lead the case and represent the general public.

38222524,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115351,1735382073,USDT Dominance Recovery: Could This Signal a Bitcoin Crash?,"USDT Dominance Recovery: Could This Signal a Bitcoin Crash? Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish momentum may be at risk as market analysts observe a resurgence in Tether (USDT) dominance , raising concerns about a potential crash. According to TradingView contributor Forex Mindset , this trend could lead Bitcoin to test crucial support levels around $81,500 , fueled by bearish momentum and overbought RSI indicators. Understanding USDT Dominance and Its Implications USDT dominance refers to the percentage share of Tether, a popular stablecoin, in the overall cryptocurrency market. A rising USDT dominance often indicates: Increased Demand for Stability: Investors may be moving funds into USDT to hedge against potential market volatility. Weakened Buying Pressure: A shift away from BTC and other volatile assets toward stablecoins could signal waning confidence in the market’s short-term upside. Forex Mindset suggests that the recovery in USDT dominance aligns with historical patterns that precede Bitcoin price corrections. Key Factors Contributing to Bearish Bitcoin Outlook 1. Overbought RSI Signals The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin shows overbought conditions, hinting at a possible trend reversal. Historically, overbought RSI levels have been precursors to significant price pullbacks. 2. Weak Support at $81,500 Analysts identify $81,500 as a critical support level for BTC. A breach of this level could lead to accelerated selling pressure, dragging Bitcoin prices lower. 3. Macroeconomic Concerns Uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve monetary policies continues to weigh on investor sentiment. Rising interest rates and tighter financial conditions could further dampen appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Historical Context: USDT Dominance vs. Bitcoin Price Previous instances of rising USDT dominance have coincided with notable Bitcoin price declines: May 2021: USDT dominance spiked during Bitcoin’s crash from $64,000 to $30,000 . November 2022: A similar pattern emerged as Bitcoin plummeted to $15,500 amid market-wide turmoil following the FTX collapse. If history repeats itself, the current rise in USDT dominance could foreshadow another downturn for Bitcoin. Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Despite bearish signals, many market participants remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects: 1. Institutional Interest Remains Strong Large institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, with significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and custody services. Increased adoption by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity provides a strong foundation for BTC’s future growth. 2. Upcoming Halving Event Bitcoin’s next halving , scheduled for mid-2025, is expected to reduce supply and potentially drive prices higher. Historically, halving events have been followed by significant bull runs. 3. Expanding Use Cases Bitcoin is gaining traction as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Strategies for Investors Amid Volatility For those navigating the current market uncertainty, here are some strategies to consider: 1. Diversify Holdings Balance exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin with stablecoins or other less risky investments. 2. Monitor Key Support Levels Keep an eye on $81,500 and other significant support zones. Use stop-loss orders to protect against sudden downturns. 3. Stay Updated on Market Trends Follow indicators like USDT dominance, RSI levels, and macroeconomic developments to anticipate potential market movements. Conclusion The recovery in USDT dominance raises concerns about a potential Bitcoin price correction, with analysts pointing to $81,500 as a crucial support level. While short-term risks loom, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain robust, driven by institutional adoption and upcoming milestones like the halving event. Investors should tread cautiously, stay informed, and consider diversifying their portfolios to navigate potential volatility in the weeks ahead.

38222402,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667825,1735381840,Is Bitcoin Ending 2024 On A High Note? Analysts Say This Level Is Key,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to move sideways, investors wonder whether the flagship crypto will end the year positively or on a sour note. Some analysts suggest a close above recently lost levels could propel BTC’s price to new highs. Related Reading: Analyst Forecast ‘Highly Bullish’ 2025 For Ethereum: Is The Bleeding Over? Bitcoin’s Red Week, Green Year Since breaking past the long-awaited $100,000 barrier in early December, Bitcoin has seen two significant corrections to the lower zone of its one-month range. Throughout the month, the flagship crypto’s price has traded between $90,000 and $108,000, hovering between $96,000 and $102,000 for most of December. However, since reaching its latest all-time high (ATH) of $108,353 ten days ago, Bitcoin has lost the $100,000 support zone, falling to its lowest price in weeks. Over the past week, BTC has struggled to reclaim the $98,000 support zone, losing its Christmas retest above this level on Thursday. Now, the largest crypto by market capitalization moves within the mid-zone of its monthly range, displaying a candle that “doesn’t look great but also not the worst. Neutral, and still a few more days to go,” as Altcoin Sherpa stated. The analyst suggested that Bitcoin could see “some weird price action over the next few weeks with despair followed by an absolute moon mission and killer alt season.” Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades called BTC’s current price action the “end of the year chop.” He noted that as Bitcoin moves sideways, liquidity is “building on both sides,” with an area of interest below $94,000 and a key level above the $100,000 mark. Some investors asked the community to zoom out on BTC’s chart, highlighting that the cryptocurrency remains within a historical range despite the horizontal trajectory. If Bitcoin were to end the year at its current price, it would still record a 48.15% return in Q4 and a 122% increase in the yearly timeframe. Bitcoin Risks Fall To One-Month Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt considers that investors should watch the $92,500 support zone, as breaking below that horizontal level could send BTC’s price to $86,000. Similarly, Ali Martinez warned investors about a key level for BTC. Martinez asserted that investors “don’t want Bitcoin to dip below $92,730,” explaining that it is “essentially free fall territory” if the flagship crypto loses that level. According to the analyst, the flagship crypto could fall as low as $70,000 if it loses the key support zone based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart. In a previous post, he explored a bearish outlook where BTC could fall as low as $60,000, noting that several experts forecasted a correction anywhere from 23% to 36% for BTC. Martinez considers a 25% crash to the $70,000 mark possible, as the URPD chart shows minimal support below the $93,806 and $92,730 zones. “If this critical demand area doesn’t hold, we could see a sharp drop to $70,085,” he warned. Related Reading: New Solana Memecoin Leader? PENGU Flips BONK Amid Whale Accumulation He also pointed out that Bitcoin broke below one of its “most significant support zones at $97,300,” which suggests a bearish outlook while it isn’t reclaimed. However, the analyst asserted that this outlook would be invalidated if BTC has “a sustained close above $97,300 and, more critically, a daily close above $100,000.” Martinez added that reclaiming these levels could start the next leg toward the $168,000 target. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,587, a 1.24% decrease in the daily timeframe.

38222390,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115359,1735381751,How to Trade Gold in Forex: A Comprehensive Guide,"How to Trade Gold in Forex: A Comprehensive Guide Trading gold in the forex market offers a unique opportunity for traders to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of gold’s status as a safe-haven asset. With its deep historical roots and strong connection to global economic trends, gold (traded as XAU/USD ) has become a favorite among forex traders. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to successfully trade gold in the forex market. Why Trade Gold in Forex? Gold trading has gained immense popularity among forex traders due to its benefits and dynamic nature. Here’s why gold stands out: 1. Safe-Haven Asset Gold is often considered a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty. During times of financial instability, investors flock to gold, causing its price to rise. 2. High Liquidity The gold market is one of the most liquid in the world, making it easier for traders to execute trades with minimal slippage. 3. Diversification Trading gold allows forex traders to diversify their portfolios and reduce risk by not solely relying on currency pairs. 4. Strong Correlation with USD Gold is typically priced in U.S. dollars, and its price often inversely correlates with the strength of the dollar. This correlation offers additional trading opportunities. How to Start Trading Gold in Forex Step 1: Understand the Basics of XAU/USD Gold is traded as XAU/USD in the forex market. XAU represents one troy ounce of gold, while USD is the U.S. dollar. The price of XAU/USD reflects how many dollars are required to purchase one ounce of gold. Step 2: Choose a Reliable Broker To trade gold, you’ll need a broker that offers XAU/USD trading. Look for brokers with: Tight spreads Fast execution Access to advanced charting tools Regulation by reputable financial authorities Step 3: Analyze the Gold Market Gold prices are influenced by various factors, including: Economic Data: GDP reports, unemployment rates, and inflation data. Central Bank Policies: Interest rate decisions and monetary policy statements. Geopolitical Events: Wars, trade disputes, and political instability often boost gold prices. Strategies for Trading Gold in Forex 1. Trend Following Gold often exhibits strong trends, making it an ideal asset for trend-following strategies. Use moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) to identify trends. Enter trades when the price crosses above or below the moving average. 2. Breakout Trading Gold frequently experiences price consolidations followed by significant breakouts. Identify key resistance and support levels. Use volume indicators to confirm breakouts. 3. News Trading Gold prices are sensitive to economic and geopolitical news. Monitor economic calendars for significant events like Federal Reserve announcements. Trade based on anticipated reactions to news, such as interest rate cuts or geopolitical tensions. 4. Hedging with Gold Gold can be used to hedge against currency risks in your forex portfolio. For example, if you hold USD-based assets and anticipate a dollar decline, buying XAU/USD can offset losses. Technical Analysis for Gold Trading Key Indicators for Gold Trading Relative Strength Index (RSI): Identifies overbought or oversold conditions. Fibonacci Retracement Levels: Helps determine potential support and resistance levels. Bollinger Bands: Measures volatility and identifies breakout opportunities. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Signals potential reversals and trends. Chart Patterns to Watch Double Bottoms/Double Tops: Often signal reversals in gold’s price direction. Triangles: Indicate potential breakouts, either bullish or bearish. Head and Shoulders: Suggest trend reversals, particularly in trending markets. Fundamental Analysis for Gold Trading 1. U.S. Dollar Strength Gold and the U.S. dollar generally have an inverse relationship. A strong dollar often leads to lower gold prices and vice versa. 2. Inflation Rates High inflation erodes currency value, increasing gold’s appeal as a store of value. 3. Central Bank Actions Central banks are significant players in the gold market. Increased gold purchases by central banks often boost prices. 4. Geopolitical Risks Events like wars or economic sanctions typically drive demand for gold, pushing prices higher. Risk Management in Gold Trading 1. Set Stop-Loss Orders Protect your capital by placing stop-loss orders at strategic levels. 2. Use Proper Position Sizing Avoid risking more than 1-2% of your trading account on a single trade. 3. Diversify Your Trades Don’t rely solely on gold; diversify across different assets to mitigate risk. 4. Monitor Leverage While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases risk. Use leverage cautiously when trading gold. Best Times to Trade Gold in Forex Gold trading is most active during overlapping market hours, particularly: New York Session (1:00 PM – 10:00 PM GMT): High liquidity due to the U.S. market. London Session (8:00 AM – 5:00 PM GMT): European traders contribute to market activity. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Gold Trading 1. Ignoring Risk Management Failing to set stop-loss orders or over-leveraging can lead to significant losses. 2. Overtrading Avoid excessive trading based on emotional decisions or short-term price movements. 3. Neglecting News Events Economic reports and geopolitical developments can drastically affect gold prices. 4. Trading Without a Plan Always have a clear strategy and stick to it. Conclusion: Mastering Gold Trading in Forex Trading gold in the forex market offers immense opportunities for both novice and experienced traders. By understanding the factors influencing gold prices, employing effective trading strategies, and managing risks prudently, you can enhance your trading success. Whether you’re looking to hedge against market volatility or diversify your portfolio, gold remains a reliable and dynamic asset in the forex trading world. Ready to trade gold in forex?

38222326,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115361,1735381624,Forex Trading: Halal or Haram? A Comprehensive Islamic Perspective,"Forex Trading: Halal or Haram? A Comprehensive Islamic Perspective Forex trading has become a popular financial activity globally, offering opportunities to earn profit by trading currencies. However, for Muslims, the question arises: Is forex trading halal or haram? The answer to this question lies in understanding Islamic financial principles and how they apply to forex trading. In this article, we will explore the Islamic perspective on forex trading, the factors that make it halal or haram, and how Muslims can participate in forex trading ethically. What Is Forex Trading? Forex trading, also known as foreign exchange trading, involves buying and selling currency pairs in the global currency market to make a profit. Traders speculate on the price movements of currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY, aiming to capitalize on their value fluctuations. Forex trading operates 24/5 and is driven by global events, market trends, and economic indicators. The forex market’s leverage, liquidity, and profit potential attract traders worldwide, including those from Islamic communities. The Islamic Perspective on Forex Trading Islamic finance operates under specific guidelines to ensure all financial transactions are ethical, transparent, and free from prohibited activities. These principles are derived from Shariah law , and any form of trade or investment must comply with the following criteria: 1. Prohibition of Riba (Interest) Interest-based transactions are strictly forbidden in Islam. In traditional forex trading, interest may be incurred through overnight positions or swap rates, which contradict Islamic principles. 2. Gharar (Uncertainty and Speculation) Islam discourages excessive uncertainty and speculative transactions, which are prevalent in forex trading. Contracts must be clear and transparent to avoid exploitation or unfair practices. 3. Haram Activities Investments must not involve haram (forbidden) industries or activities, such as alcohol, gambling, or unethical businesses. 4. Immediate Settlement In Islamic finance, trades must involve the immediate transfer of goods or services. This principle raises questions about the legitimacy of delayed settlements in forex trading. When Is Forex Trading Considered Halal? Forex trading can be deemed halal if it complies with Islamic principles. To ensure halal forex trading, the following conditions must be met: 1. No Riba (Interest-Free Accounts) Forex brokers offering Islamic forex accounts ensure that no interest is charged or earned on overnight positions. These accounts are designed for Muslim traders, eliminating swap rates or interest charges. 2. Transparency in Contracts All transactions should be clear, transparent, and free from ambiguity. The terms of the trade, including profit and loss potential, must be explicitly defined. 3. No Speculative Gambling Forex trading should not resemble gambling. Instead, traders must base their decisions on analysis, research, and market understanding rather than blind speculation. 4. Immediate Execution Forex trades should involve the instant exchange of currency. Contracts that delay settlement or involve deferred payments are not compliant with Islamic principles. When Is Forex Trading Considered Haram? Forex trading is considered haram if it involves activities that contradict Shariah principles. Here are common scenarios where forex trading is deemed haram: 1. Earning Interest (Riba) If a trader earns or pays interest on overnight positions, it violates Islamic laws, making the trade haram. 2. Excessive Speculation (Gharar) Trading purely based on speculation or without proper analysis can be likened to gambling, which is forbidden in Islam. 3. Trading with Leverage While leverage allows traders to control larger positions with smaller investments, it often involves borrowing, which may include interest payments, rendering it non-compliant. 4. Haram Activities or Industries Investing in or benefiting from haram industries through forex trading is strictly prohibited. Islamic Forex Accounts: A Solution for Ethical Trading To cater to Muslim traders, many brokers now offer Islamic forex accounts . These accounts align with Shariah principles by eliminating interest-based transactions and ensuring ethical practices. Key Features of Islamic Forex Accounts: No Swap Fees: Swap rates or rollover fees are removed for overnight positions. Transparent Contracts: Terms are clear and straightforward. Ethical Trading: Brokers comply with halal trading practices, avoiding haram activities. Popular Brokers Offering Islamic Accounts: Exness XM IC Markets Pepperstone Before opening an Islamic forex account, traders should verify the broker’s credentials and Shariah compliance. Scholarly Opinions on Forex Trading Islamic scholars have diverse opinions regarding forex trading. While some consider it haram due to its speculative nature and involvement of interest, others believe it can be halal if conducted under specific conditions. Support for Halal Forex Trading: Scholars argue that forex trading, when done with Islamic accounts, eliminates haram elements like riba. Proper analysis and risk management ensure that trading does not become speculative gambling. Criticism of Forex Trading: Critics highlight the high-risk nature of forex trading, which can resemble gambling. The use of leverage and delayed settlements are common concerns. How to Trade Forex Halal? A Step-by-Step Guide If you’re a Muslim trader aiming to trade forex ethically, follow these steps: Step 1: Choose a Shariah-Compliant Broker Select a broker offering Islamic forex accounts to ensure your trades are free from interest. Step 2: Learn the Market Educate yourself about forex trading fundamentals, technical analysis, and market trends to make informed decisions. Step 3: Avoid Speculation Base your trades on thorough research and analysis instead of gambling or guesswork. Step 4: Use Proper Risk Management Implement stop-loss and take-profit levels to minimize risks and protect your capital. Step 5: Trade Ethically Ensure that your trades involve immediate execution and do not violate Islamic principles. Forex Trading Alternatives for Muslim Investors If you’re unsure about forex trading’s halal status, consider alternative investment options: 1. Stocks (Halal Stocks) Invest in Shariah-compliant companies listed on Islamic stock indices like Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. 2. Sukuk (Islamic Bonds) Sukuk provides returns without earning interest, making it a halal investment option. 3. Real Estate Investing in properties offers stable, long-term returns and complies with Islamic principles. Advantages and Risks of Halal Forex Trading Advantages: Ethical Compliance: Trade with peace of mind knowing your investments align with your faith. Access to Global Markets: Participate in one of the world’s largest financial markets. Financial Opportunities: Leverage forex trading to diversify your investment portfolio. Risks: Market Volatility: Forex markets can be unpredictable and risky. High Leverage: Even with Islamic accounts, using leverage can lead to significant losses. Complexity: Forex trading requires a deep understanding of market dynamics. Conclusion: Is Forex Trading Halal or Haram? The halal or haram status of forex trading depends on how it is conducted. By eliminating interest, avoiding speculation, and adhering to Shariah principles, forex trading can be considered halal. However, traders must exercise caution, choose Shariah-compliant brokers, and trade ethically to ensure compliance with Islamic laws. For Muslims interested in exploring forex trading, Islamic forex accounts offer a viable solution. Always consult with knowledgeable scholars or Islamic finance experts if you have doubts about the permissibility of forex trading.

The rule, set to take effect in 2027, mandates that front-end DeFi platforms disclose gross proceeds from digital asset sales and report user transaction details. Industry Leaders Voice Legal Concerns Crypto executives and legal experts, however, are skeptical about the rule’s longevity. Uniswap’s Chief Legal Officer, Katherine Minarik, voiced strong opposition, noting the lack of a “limiting principle” in the IRS’s interpretation. “The IRS appears to classify DeFi technology as brokers simply for being involved in part of a transaction,” Minarik stated in a Dec. 27 post on X (formerly Twitter), urging the industry to challenge the regulation. Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams also echoed similar concerns, expressing hope that the rule will be overturned under the Congressional Review Act. Even if it passes this legislative hurdle, Adams is optimistic that it won’t withstand legal challenges. Compliance Burdens and Industry Pushback The implications of the IRS’s rule are far-reaching, with compliance costs expected to weigh heavily on DeFi platforms . Robin Singh, CEO of crypto tax platform Koinly, explained that decentralized platforms lack the centralized structures required for traditional reporting. This fundamental difference poses major operational and technical hurdles. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at blockchain firm Consensys, criticized the regulation as “all cost, no benefit” from a revenue perspective. Hughes noted that the rule’s scope, which includes tracking global users and reporting on transactions involving stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), places an undue burden on DeFi platforms. Hughes further criticized the timing of the announcement, describing it as a calculated move by the outgoing administration to avoid scrutiny. He also pointed out that the rule is likely to face Congressional review, where lawmakers could block its implementation. As DeFi continues to grow, the resolution of this conflict could set a significant precedent for how regulators interact with emerging blockchain innovations.

Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is lacking strength on the monthly chart after falling about 13% from its all-time high witnessed earlier this month. “BTC monthly doesn’t look great but also not the worst.

This is a poor place to open longs and shorts. Don’t get chopped.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Zooming in, the analyst believes that if Bitcoin fails to hold the $92,000 range as support, the flagship crypto may revisit the $80,000 range. “One thing to note is that these support regions get weaker and weaker the more times they’re tapped. Still not calling for $80,000 or anything yet but it’s going to be important to see the reactions around this $92,000 region. For now, support is still support until shown otherwise.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Lastly, the analyst lays out one possible scenario where Bitcoin retests the $86,000 range before soaring to a new all-time high of $111,000. “BTC still wouldn’t surprise me to see this type of move.

38221809,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746774-ibit-the-largest-cheapest-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1735380446,"IBIT: The Largest, Cheapest Bitcoin ETF","Summary Bitcoin's breakout post-U.S. election led to a new ATH of $106k, driving robust inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing gold AUMs. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is recommended for Bitcoin exposure due to its size, healthy inflows, and lower fees compared to peers. IBIT's shares also trade at a marginal discount to its premium, and is the only spot Bitcoin ETF that trades at a discount to its premium as compared to peers. On a borad level, institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs surged, with IBIT managing ~$53 billion, nearly half of the total spot Bitcoin ETF AUMs. The long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin remains intact, with an expected price ascent through 2025; IBIT trades at a marginal discount, making it attractive. Investment Thesis Last month, Bitcoin finally broke out from the tight trading pattern it held for 7 months on the back of the U.S. election results. This led to the digital asset creating a new ATH record of $106k, backed by the optimism surrounding the pro-Bitcoin stance the incoming U.S. administration is expected to adopt. The bullishness in Bitcoin led to robust inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which also created their new records. For example, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently crossed $100 billion in AUM and have also overtaken gold AUMs, signaling a strong shift in appetite for Bitcoin as an alternative asset that deserves allocation in portfolios. The price of Bitcoin has pulled back since creating the $106k ATH a few weeks ago, and I believe the digital asset is currently in a consolidation phase with long-term bullish indicators remaining intact. Given my optimism for Bitcoin, I continue to recommend BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) as the primary vehicle to hold Bitcoin for those investors who prefer Bitcoin exposure via ETFs over digital wallets. IBIT is now the largest spot Bitcoin ETF available, sees healthy inflows, and is cheaper relative to its peers, making this recommendation an easy Buy. IBIT Is The Cheapest ETF Available - See Its Premium To NAV My overall outlook on Bitcoin is bullish, and I continue to expect Bitcoin to move higher through next year on the back of improved price discovery and elevated demand rising not just from retail investors but also institutional buyers. In my last note on IBIT, I explained why IBIT presented itself “as a stable alternative for investors looking to invest in Bitcoin without the bells and whistles that come with directly investing in Bitcoin.” In that note, I talked about strong retail interest, which was driving momentum in spot Bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT, and how the Bitcoin halving that occurred earlier this year would eventually lead to decelerating Bitcoin supply and higher prices. Heavy institutional demand in spot Bitcoin ETFs has led to surging asset volumes for Bitcoin ETFs, leading to one of the sharpest spikes in AUMs among spot Bitcoin ETFs. 21Shares, an ETP firm that specializes in crypto-based ETFs/ETPs and partners with ARK on certain crypto ETFs in the US, issued a report last month where they noted that: Institutions strategically accumulated more bitcoin ETF shares during Q3 than they did in Q2, indicating sustained confidence among major institutional investors. 21Shares compiled data from Bloomberg and noticed that not only was Bitcoin ETF AUM from institutional investors rising, but so was the volume of institutional investors, which was behind the rapid ascent of Bitcoin ETF AUM this year. Separate research showed that Bitcoin ETFs collectively crossed over $100B in AUM, surpassing gold ETFs AUM as well. Exhibit A: Bitcoin ETFs surpassed gold-backed ETFs this year in terms of assets managed. (K33 Research) At the time of writing this note, the value of AUM in all spot Bitcoin ETFs totaled $112.6 billion. This is a remarkable feat these ETFs have been able to achieve, considering that 11 months ago most of these Bitcoin ETFs never existed. Exhibit B: Total Bitcoin ETF AUM trends through 2024 show growth stacked at the start and end of the year. (coinglass) Compared to all the Bitcoin ETFs, State Street’s SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA: GLD ), the most popular gold ETF, has $73.3 billion in assets managed. Given that most gold ETFs, such as GLD, had a ~2-decade head start, the appreciation in AUMs by spot Bitcoin ETFs has marked a turning point in expandable appetite for Bitcoin ETFs. Leading the charge for Bitcoin ETFs is BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which is now the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets managed. With ~$53 billion in assets, IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF available to investors, surpassing its predecessor, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GBTC ). Via IBIT, BlackRock continues to offer investors a stable and relatively cheap alternative for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. IBIT’s $53 billion in assets managed also means IBIT’s assets account for almost half of the total ~$112 billion spot Bitcoin ETF AUMs I mentioned earlier. Exhibit C: Top Bitcoin ETFs ranked versus BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, ordered by AUM (Author's compilation of top Bitcoin ETFs) Clearly, from Exhibit C, I note that IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM and still has comparative ETF fees of just 0.25%, which is within the range of its peer ETFs, barring Grayscale’s GBTC ETF on the high end and BTC ETF on the low end of the fee spectrum. As can also be seen from Exhibit C, the YTD returns for most ETFs, barring Grayscale’s ETFs, fall within the ~104% average returns for the year. All the ETFs that I mentioned above in Exhibit C do trade at a premium to their NAV, which might put off some investors as they wait for a better entry point. Still, for those investors who have a bullish outlook on the underlying asset, Bitcoin, these nuances of ETFs don't really matter. But for those who are looking to deploy more capital, IBIT appears to be trading at a much more affordable premium as compared to its peers, as seen in Exhibit D below. Exhibit D: BlackRock’s IBIT trades at a much more affordable premium to its NAV as compared to the other top spot Bitcoin ETFs. (yCharts) Per the chart above, IBIT is trading at a razor-thin discount to its NAV as compared to its peers, which trade at razor-thin premiums as compared to their NAV. But as I mentioned earlier, as long as investors maintain a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, these specifics really do not matter for the average investor. My 2025 Outlook On Bitcoin Is Still Positive I had noted in my previous note on IBIT how halvings tend to be eventually positive for the price discovery of Bitcoin, leading to higher prices for the digital asset. With this year’s halving in April complete, we are now on our way to the fifth halving, and Bitcoin’s price ascent so far still looks on par if I look at the previous price trends since their respective halvings. Exhibit E: Bitcoin still has enough room to continue its ascent higher and should follow the price trajectories of its previous Bitcoin halvings. (glassnode) As noted by the fifth epoch, or cycle, in black in the chart above, we should continue to experience a higher price trajectory in Bitcoin, and I anticipate that to happen through the course of 2025. Additionally, global liquidity cycles also should get better through 2025, which is a strong indicator for Bitcoin to continue performing through next year. The chart below does indicate some compression in liquidity, but I view that as seasonal, and I expect the reversal in liquidity through next year, which should keep the momentum in Bitcoin and other Bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT. Exhibit F: elevated levels of Global liquidity bodes well for Bitcoin’s prices. (bGeometrics) Risks & Other Factors To Consider As I noted in the previous section, liquidity cycles globally tend to compress around the end of the year and the start of the new year. But in my opinion, these cycles usually will pick up unless there is a recession or severe global event that causes headwinds for global liquidity. In such cases, as we witnessed in Q1 2022, Bitcoin will face pressure and severe volatility. Another marginal headwind investors should note here is that 2025 could see an entire new suite of crypto-focused ETF products being pushed into the market. Last month, option-related products for many spot Bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, started trading on markets. These option products come after Ethereum-based ETFs were launched mid-year. Bitwise has also filed an S-1 to launch an ETF that offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum . There are more crypto products in the pipeline, which I expect will compete for crypto allocation of portfolio capital. This might put short-term pressure on Bitcoin. But, over the long term, these products harbor more opportunity for general crypto adoption, which is long-term positive for Bitcoin. Takeaway IBIT remains a strong ETF candidate for investors to allocate capital towards if they are interested in gaining or adding incremental exposure to Bitcoin via ETFs. The long-term indicators remain intact for Bitcoin to continue its ascent higher through 2025, and I expect ETFs such as IBIT to be beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s price ascent. The ETF also trades at a marginal discount to many of its ETF peers, which makes IBIT relatively attractive. I continue to recommend my Buy rating on IBIT.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746774-ibit-the-largest-cheapest-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38221809.jpeg
38221701,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399300,1735380279,South Korean Court Jails Bithumb CEO and Golfer in Crypto Bribery Scandal,"The post South Korean Court Jails Bithumb CEO and Golfer in Crypto Bribery Scandal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A South Korean court has sentenced a celebrity golfer and the former CEO of Bithumb, a major crypto exchange, to prison for their roles in a bribery and market manipulation scheme. Lee Sang-jun, the former CEO of Bithumb, was sentenced to two years in prison, while Ahn Sung-hyun, a well-known golfer married to actress Song Yu-ri, received a four-and-a-half-year sentence. Altcoin Price Manipulation and Bribes The trial, held on December 26, revealed surprising details about how these individuals attempted to rig the cryptocurrency market . Prosecutors revealed that Lee , in exchange for large bribes, agreed to list a specific altcoin on Bithumb’s platform. In return, Lee received around 3 billion Korean won (roughly $2 million) in cash, along with luxury watches, high-end bags, and even exclusive restaurant memberships. The bribes were given by Kang Jong-hyun, a reclusive businessman and close associate of both Lee and Ahn. His goal was to artificially boost the value of a low-cap altcoin by listing it on Bithumb, causing its price to rise quickly. Golfer Ahn’s Role in the Scam Ahn Sung-hyun played a key role in the plot as well. Businessman Kang provided Ahn with a large sum of money to bribe Lee into listing the altcoin. However, Ahn didn’t stop there. Prosecutors discovered that Ahn kept some of the money for himself and used it to buy stocks. In total, Ahn pocketed 2 billion Korean won (about $1.5 million), which he spent to make personal investments. The court was harsh on Ahn, describing them as “heinous” and accusing him of using stolen funds to further his financial interests. Ahn’s ties to both Lee and Kang played a central role in the crime, revealing a dangerous web of corruption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Kang’s Secret Ownership of Bithumb Kang, the businessman behind the bribes, was sentenced to one and a half years in prison.

His efforts to manipulate altcoin prices on the exchange were key to this bribery scheme.

38221762,https://invezz.com/?p=2408425,1735380120,BGB and VIRTUAL break out this week as Bitcoin stalls below $100k,"Last week was a volatile one for Bitcoin as it failed to recover to levels above $100,000 due to a lack of bullish momentum in the market. Overall, cryptocurrency market capitalisation dropped approximately 2.6% to $3.46 trillion by late Friday after hitting a weekly high of $3.6 trillion after Christmas day. A risk-off sentiment prevailed across the market due to a lack of any solid catalysts, and the market lull intensified towards the middle of the week, with liquidity and trading volumes dipping as a result of the holiday season. Early week profit taking by long-term holders and poor performance of US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds kept market sentiment subdued, with the effect spilling over to the altcoin market as well. The crypto fear and greed index had dropped to neutral levels around the low 50s, confirming the lack of momentum in the market. By the end of the week, only a handful of the top tokens managed to retain gains from the post-election rally that began after Donald Trump won the 2024 US elections. Even though some whale buying and institutional activity returned towards the end of the week, analysts remained cautious, with many expecting a deeper correction scenario to play out. Will Bitcoin rise again? Bitcoin showed some late-week resilience after a $14.2 billion options expiry with a ‘max pain’ point of $85,000, which initially had traders anticipating a major correction. However, the flagship cryptocurrency managed to hold above key support levels and even peaked above $97,330 at 9:06 a.m. UTC on Dec. 27, just an hour after the expiry event. Yet, a prominent trader on TradingView pointed to BTC’s negative correlation with the USDT Dominance Index, which measures USDT’s overall market share. Notably, the metric shows signs of a rebound, which is typically seen when BTC hits a local top. Basically, this rebound indicates a capital flight to safety as liquidity moves to Tether when traders expect volatility or further downside pressure. The analyst warns that a potential bulltrap scenario might be playing out soon where the bellwether sees a short spike before quickly correcting. He urged caution as the sudden rise could mislead many into believing the up trend has resumed again. Some other forecasts see Bitcoin dropping towards the $80 – $60k range in the coming days. According to Mark Newton, managing director at Fundstrat, Bitcoin will target price levels as high as $250,000 next year but could correct to as low as $60,000 before that happens. Fellow analyst Benjamin Cohen also expects a similar drop but notes it could be a flash crash on the day Donald Trump takes office , drawing parallels with past performance of the Invesco QQQ Trust as current BTC price action is showing similarities. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez believes Bitcoin needs to hold above $93,806, or else it could risk dropping towards $70k, pointing to factors such as increased BTC transfers to exchanges and increased profit taking. However, a sustained close above $97,300 or a daily close above $100k would invalidate this scenario. At the time of writing, the leading crypto exchanged hands at $94,171, down 2.7% over the past week. A more pronounced drop was seen for several altcoins, but the top performers managed to pull in notable gains over the week. Top altcoins this week Bitget token Bitget (BGB) outperformed the market with an over 100% rally over the past week. The altcoin boasted a market cap of over $11.3 billion, making it the largest altcoin on the list. Source: CoinMarketCap BGB continued to capitalise on the hype generated by several developments that were unveiled over the course of December. Most recently, the altcoin got a boost after the Seychelles-based crypto exchange announced it would merge BGB with the Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) into a single utility token. Prior to that, the exchange’s planned collaboration with the Tron blockchain and its meme coin launcher, SunPump, acted as a catalyst for the past week’s rally. Virtuals protocol Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) was one of the best-performing artificial intelligence-focused cryptocurrencies, with gains of over 44% recorded in the past week. On the yearly time frame, the gains are locked in at over 23,000%, making it one of the best-performing tokens this year. Source: CoinMarketCap VIRTUAL rode the AI agent wave and the broader growth in the AI sector. As a decentralised AI agent network, the protocol has drawn in a plethora of users over the past year to launch such agents. With the number of AI agents increasing on the platform, users have locked in VIRTUAL tokens, leading to a surge in its price. When writing, VIRTUAL held a market cap of $3.36 billion. Movement Movement (MOVE), an Ethereum layer 2 network, rallied 27% this week to hit a market cap of over $2.3 billion late Friday, just weeks after launching earlier in the month. Source: CoinMarketCap MOVE surged amid excitement surrounding its mainnet beta launch and token generation event (TGE) on December 9. 1 billion tokens were distributed as a part of the TGE, which led to increased trading activity. The price rally got a major boost after the network integrated Wrapped Bitcoin on December 19, bringing more liquidity towards its decentralised finance ecosystem. Alongside this, on-metric shows increased activity on the network with a surge in active addresses on the network.

Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens are set to revolutionize e-commerce rewards by offering unparalleled value, flexibility, and growth opportunities, redefining what smart shopping looks like for the modern consumer. The ongoing Web3Bay presale offers a prime opportunity for early adopters to acquire tokens that stretch beyond simple discounts. These tokens provide access to a vibrant decentralized marketplace, exclusive perks, and a voice in shaping the future of the platform, heralding a bright new chapter in e-commerce. Why 3BAY Tokens Are a Better Choice Genuine Value 3BAY tokens break away from the limitations of Amazon gift cards, which confine users to one platform. These blockchain-based tokens function across Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace and can be traded on exchanges, providing tangible financial prospects. Unlike gift cards, which are spent and forgotten, 3BAY tokens maintain their worth and have the potential to grow in value over time. Their integration with upcoming blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations promises exciting future opportunities. Discounts & Rewards 3BAY tokens are crafted to enrich your shopping experience. Owners enjoy a 5% discount on all purchases and earn additional rewards through active participation. This continual reward cycle vastly outperforms the one-off nature of traditional gift cards. Early birds in the Web3Bay presale can capture these tokens at significantly lower than their potential market value, with each stage of the presale raising the price by 15%, allowing early participants to see substantial growth in their investment. A Stake in the Platform’s Future More than just a means for transactions, 3BAY tokens grant holders a say in the governance of Web3Bay’s platform. This involvement ensures that Web3Bay evolves in ways that directly benefit its community. This contrasts sharply with Amazon gift cards, which provide no such influence over the platform’s operations. As Web3Bay transitions to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), token holders will gain even greater control, solidifying their position as key stakeholders in the Web3 revolution. Why Join Now? The Web3Bay presale, which launched on December 10, 2024, is an excellent chance to get in on the ground floor. The presale is set over 28 stages, with token prices starting at just $0.003 and increasing to $0.1959 by the final stage. With 40% of the total 5 billion token supply available for early investors, the presale offers unmatched value. Unlike Amazon gift cards, whose utility diminishes after use, 3BAY tokens represent a growing investment in the burgeoning field of e-commerce. As the platform expands, the value of these tokens is poised to increase, providing both immediate benefits and long-term gains. Web3Bay’s ambitious roadmap includes cross-chain compatibility, NFT-based loyalty programs, and staking opportunities, positioning 3BAY tokens as a forward-looking choice for those aiming to maximize their e-commerce experience. The platform also accommodates conventional payment methods like PayPal, ensuring it is accessible to all. Web3Bay: The Future of E-Commerce 3BAY tokens do not just substitute Amazon gift cards; they completely reimagine e-commerce rewards. They offer genuine value, continuous rewards, and a pivotal role in governance, delivering a suite of benefits that traditional gift cards cannot match. The presale is underway, with proactive shoppers already securing their future in this innovative marketplace. If you’re curious about the next big thing in e-commerce, look no further: Web3Bay is poised to lead. Don’t miss the opportunity to be part of this exciting evolution—join Web3Bay today for a smarter, richer shopping experience.

Token holders no longer require third-party custodians of their assets, passwords, and wallet keys. This add-on from Lunex Network clearly aligns with the core values of the crypto movement. Another differentiator is Lunex Network ‘s unified asset tracking that provides users with real-time analytics, simplifying portfolio management and decision-making. This toolset supports novice traders and experts as they navigate the crypto market. In the near term, Lunex Network could stand shoulder to shoulder with other well-known projects, with an exciting future ahead of it. DOT Expected To Catapult By 100% In Near Term Polkadot’s price is trading above $7, reflecting a solid 20% increase over the past month. DOT has maintained stability above its key support level of $6.8, while resistance at $7.2 remains a crucial hurdle for further upward movement. With 16 green days in the past month, DOT currently trades above its 200-day SMA. DOT ’s cross-chain interoperability remains a significant driver of its adoption, with parachain auctions continuing to fuel ecosystem expansion. The MACD level and moving averages indicate a consolidation phase for DOT , which could precede a breakout. Per analysis , DOT is forecasted to rise by 97% and hit $14 in the coming weeks. BONK Burn Event Sparks Excitement In Meme Community Bonk ( BONK ) is experiencing renewed interest after announcing a 1 trillion BONK burn in a BURNmas event . This strategic move has sparked excitement among the community and investors, leading to its appearance in the top gainers list. BONK is currently trading 1,412.30% above the 200-Day SMA as the doggo-themed coin closes in on top 50 status. Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend, with BONK aiming to retest its previous highs. According to crypto analysts like CoinCodex, the price of BONK is predicted to rise by 228% and reach $ 0.0001 before February 2025. If BONK continues to build on its community engagement and market activity, it could sustain its upward momentum. Conclusion The $LNEX presale is now live, with tokens available for just $0.0048 each. In addition to a deflationary system, presale investors who hold LNEX tokens for a minimum of 30 days can earn up to 18% APY in income. Unlike BONK and DOT, the potential for profits on the Lunex Network is limitless. Imagine the possibilities in the next bull market !

The altcoins have suffered as well, with many violent price corrections from the likes of AVAX, LINK, SUI, and others. BTC’s Struggles See No End The Fed-induced correction began last week as bitcoin dumped from its latest all-time high of over $108,000 to $92,000 in just a few days. It managed to recover some ground last weekend and even spiked to $99,000, but that was short-lived, and the asset headed straight south on Monday. After another slump toward $92,000, the bull took charge and pushed it to a multi-day peak of just under $100,000. However, this rally was halted quickly as well, and bitcoin started losing value once again in the following days. After failing at $97,000 yesterday, the bears drove it down once more to under $94,000. Although it has been able to recover some ground since then and now trades above that line, BTC is still more than 2% down on the day.

38221761,https://invezz.com/?p=2408360,1735378140,"Meme coins to watch in 2025: Doge, Shiba Inu, and Pepe lead the pack","Meme coins, born from internet jokes and viral memes, have carved out a unique space within the cryptocurrency landscape. These digital assets, often driven by strong community support and perceived decentralization, are no longer just a laughing matter; they’ve become a force to be reckoned with. As we approach 2025, it’s time to take a closer look at some of the top meme coins by market capitalization that are capturing attention, and possibly, investment. The power of community What sets meme coins apart is their fervent community backing. In many cases, these projects are more influenced by community decisions than other crypto ventures, adding to their perceived decentralization. While the actual level of decentralization is debatable, the fact remains that these coins enjoy massive participation and enthusiasm from their holders. So, with the end of 2024 in sight, let’s explore three meme coins that should be on every crypto-enthusiast’s radar in January 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): the original meme coin pioneer First up is Dogecoin, the undisputed OG of the meme coin world. Conceived as a lighthearted joke in 2013 by Jackson Palmer, a product manager at Adobe, and Billy Markus, a software developer at IBM, Dogecoin, with its Shiba Inu dog mascot, has become a cultural phenomenon. This open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, inspired by Litecoin, experienced a massive surge during the 2017 bull run, before declining with the 2018 crash. However, thanks to a very strong community, especially one fronted by Elon Musk, Dogecoin has made a huge comeback. Musk, a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, champions its utility as a low-fee, blockchain-based payment mechanism. The current price of Dogecoin stands at $0.31, with a market cap of $47.2 billion, and it has seen a YTD change of +258%. Dogecoin’s price has surged over 200% since November 2024, making it a top-performing memecoin. While the price has undergone a slight correction, trading near the $0.3 level, a breakout above $0.4 is critical for Dogecoin to regain its bullish momentum. On the downside, the $0.35 level provides significant support, aligned with its 50-day EMA. Shiba Inu (SHIB): the “Dogecoin killer” Next is Shiba Inu, arguably the second most recognizable meme-inspired crypto asset. Launched anonymously by “Ryoshi” in August 2020, Shiba Inu aims to be the “Dogecoin Killer.” Unlike Dogecoin, Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin, but it also features a Shiba Inu as its mascot. After a tough 2022, Shiba Inu has shown moderate recovery, following the wider market recovery led by heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The coin has a current price of $0.000022, with a market cap of $13.13 billion, and has seen a YTD change of +115.5%. Despite facing a 40% retracement from its December 2024 highs, Shiba Inu’s strong community has remained steadfast, actively supporting the token. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is evolving, with a metaverse where players can interact, earn rewards, and enjoy a decentralized experience. SHIB price needs to surpass the $0.00003 level to spark renewed bullish momentum. Immediate support lies near the 200-day EMA. Pepe (PEPE): the frog’s leap into the memecoin scene Finally, there’s Pepe, a relatively new Ethereum-based meme coin that has quickly surged in popularity. Based on the popular internet meme of a green cartoon frog, Pepe arrived with the promise of overthrowing dog-based meme coins. The project has seen explosive growth since launch, with a current price of $0.000018, a market cap of $7.68 billion, and an impressive YTD change of +1309%. According to its website, Pepe is designed to be the “most memorable memecoin,” with the caveat that it has no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. Despite this, PEPE has demonstrated a remarkable 400% rally since its launch, even breaking into the top 100 coins for a brief period. Pepe coin’s price has recently corrected, along with other market heavyweights.

Gasparino has followed the SEC vs. Ripple case from the onset. The journalist considers the SEC’s litigation against Ripple unnecessary. Charles Gasparino, a FOX Business journalist, foresaw that the SEC would drop the case against Ripple after Donald Trump assumes office as the next U.S. President. Notably, Gasparino has been following the SEC-Ripple case from the beginning and crypto lawyer John Deaton noted that Gasparino was the first mainstream journalist to report the SEC’s regulatory overreach in the case.

38220427,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634188,1735377297,Gold set for unprecedented rally in 2025 as Bitcoin slows down,"Gold is set for an unprecedented rally in 2025 as Bitcoin continues its slow activity as the year ends. Bitcoin enjoyed a spark towards the latter end of 2024, with the asset bursting out after a Trump-fuelled rally. It is no surprise that it did a remarkable job hitting over $100k this year. While Bitcoin did about 50% since November 3, other assets followed suit, with Dogecoin posting double its price. While the crypto assets enjoyed a stellar run towards the end of the year, gold has been dominating, having itself a wonderful year. Prices of the precious metal surged by 28%, pushing financial investors back to the asset as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical and economic tensions. Gold started the year at $2014, having itself a wonderful year amid several highs before hitting $2,719 in late November. Experts predict a wonderful 2025 for gold Usually, most assets in the financial market experience a pullback after a huge rally like gold’s. Investors are conversant with the market, more reason why they remain unfazed by the asset’s recent drop to around $2,603. But with many Western countries starring inflation in the eye amid other geopolitical issues, investors are predicting a great 2025 for gold. Gold Bullion Company’s Managing Director Rick Kanda lauded the asset’s rise in 2024, noting that it was a record year for the asset. “There’s no denying that 2024 has been a record year for gold,” Kanda said. He also made bold predictions about the precious metal heading into the new year. “It’s reached colossal new highs and broken records. This is… a result of economic uncertainty, changes in global inflation , and also increased demand,” he added. Gold has usually done well, especially when investors shift their funds into the asset while relying less on bond markets and equity. The popular notion is that gold also serves other purposes, giving it an inherent value. For instance, aside from its use as a currency, the asset is also used to mark jewelry and other technological products. According to UK-based gold marketplace Bullion Vault, investors are skeptical about the current global situation getting better next year. With Donald Trump preparing to enter the White House , experts are expecting several conflicts. In addition, the platform says it expects its users to consolidate their positions instead of selling. The recent survey carried out by the firm among its users shows that they believe the asset could hit $3,070 by 2025. Most of the respondents cited geopolitical tensions and economic issues driving the growth of the yellow metal. Donald Trump’s Bitcoin crusade amid rising debts With most people using the economic situation and geopolitical tensions as their reasons for holding gold, others are pointing to the increase in sovereign debt. Economies across the West are currently witnessing huge deficits as economic growths continue to mount pressure on countries to increase state spending. This trend had previously emerged in 2007/8 with the pandemic causing it to worsen. Meanwhile, Donald Trump may be relying on his new-found Bitcoin love. With most countries pushing to establish their Bitcoin reserve, the United States is looking to lead the pack. President-elect Donald Trump recently confirmed plans for a national Bitcoin reserve after Bitcoin hit above the $100k mark for the first time. In his speech at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Trump said the United States could do something nice with BTC. He highlighted the need to be ahead of other countries, a notion that the incoming United States President has always echoed. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else… but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead,” he said. However, the idea seems not to resonate with everyone as critics have poked holes in the strategy. Skeptics are seeing the move as the United States government playing a fool. They see the strategy as an avenue to run up borrowing costs, which could prove dire for the country. It could worsen the already bad inflation numbers, and the dollar would be at the receiving end. A Bitcoin reserve could also open financial institutions up for Bitcoin adoption, allowing customers to use the asset as collateral for loans. If the asset drops, it could prove costly for the financial institution.

Dogecoin is struggling to maintain dominance above the $0.30 price level after plummeting by 7.5% over the past week. However, analysts believe a turnaround is imminent.In a post on X, trader Tardigrade shared insights into Dogecoin’s yearly and weekly price movements. He pointed to historical cycles and technical signals that hint at a significant bullish run on the horizon.The Yearly Harmonic PatternThe yearly chart reveals a striking harmonic pattern that divides Dogecoin’s market history into three distinct phases: Bottom Years, Pre-Pump Years, and Pump Years.Notably, Dogecoin's bottom years were 2015, 2019, and 2023, according to the analysis. These years mark Dogecoin’s major market bottoms, where prices reach the lowest point of the cycle before an upward trajectory begins.Meanwhile, the pre-pump years are 2016, 2020, and 2024. These were often characterized by early signs of recovery and accumulation. These years set the stage for substantial rallies. For instance, Dogecoin registered a 5X surge between September and December.Notably, the pump years, including 2017, 2021, and the incoming 2025, have historically seen massive bullish candles, propelling DOGE to new heights.Based on this recurring pattern, Tardigrade believes 2024 has served as a setup year. According to him, it is paving the way for a potential major breakout in 2025, which could mirror the explosive gains witnessed in 2017 and 2021. Dogecoin historical chart Weekly Chart Signals Bottoming ZoneIn addition to the yearly analysis, the weekly chart provides encouraging signs for Dogecoin’s near-term prospects. Trader Tardigrade highlighted the appearance of a ""Spinning Top"" candlestick, a pattern that typically signals market indecision and a potential reversal.He noted that this is not the first time Dogecoin has displayed this pattern at critical junctures. He cited similar occurrences in September and October, periods from which Dogecoin exploded before consolidating. Essentially, the latest observation further reinforces the idea of a bottoming phase and that an uptrend is imminent. Adding to the bullish outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the weekly timeframe has reached a support level. Historically, RSI bounces from such levels have been followed by significant upward price movements.What’s Next for Dogecoin?With 2024 closing as a potential bottom year and technical indicators aligning with historical trends, traders are eyeing 2025 as a defining year for DOGE . In particular, many expect Dogecoin to break beyond $1 next year.Trader Tardigrade is among the analysts forecasting a $4 trillion market cap for Dogecoin. For context, this bold outlook would translate to a price point exceeding $30.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/here-are-dogecoin-bottom-pre-pump-and-pump-years-as-weekly-candle-signals-doge-gearing-for-the-next-run/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-dogecoin-bottom-pre-pump-and-pump-years-as-weekly-candle-signals-doge-gearing-for-the-next-run,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Instead, officials may focus on managing and safeguarding their existing Bitcoin reserve, totaling around 183,850 BTC, worth $17.36 billion, as identified by blockchain analytics platform Spot on Chain. Focus Shifts to Bitcoin Reserve Policy Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s head of research, highlighted that while no direct purchases are anticipated, discussions about a broader Bitcoin reserve policy could gain momentum within federal departments and agencies. Thorn suggested this could involve strategies to solidify Bitcoin as a critical reserve asset for the nation. A significant proposal in this context is Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act 2024 . If enacted, the legislation would enable the government to systematically acquire 200,000 BTC annually over five years, building a substantial reserve of 1 million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. The potential for such a policy underscores growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. Global Ripple Effects of US Bitcoin Strategy The US government’s actions—or inaction—on Bitcoin could have far-reaching implications. Galaxy Digital analyst “JW” pointed out that as Bitcoin continues to gain traction, up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and an equal number of nation-states might integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds. JW also warned of a potential race among nations to mine or acquire Bitcoin, especially unaligned nations or those with adversarial relations to the US. “Competition among nation-states, particularly those with significant sovereign wealth or geopolitical ambitions, could accelerate Bitcoin adoption strategies,” JW explained. While some countries, like Japan, remain cautious, others are exploring Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset . Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed uncertainty about the global shift toward Bitcoin adoption, noting that Japan was not yet prepared to formalize its stance. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated that smaller nations might be the first to adopt Bitcoin reserve, with China possibly leading strategic adoption efforts. As the conversation around Bitcoin reserve intensifies, the US’s next steps will likely shape global attitudes toward cryptocurrency as a financial and geopolitical tool.

Gasparino made harsh comments about the SEC’s handling of the Ripple case, calling the regulation unnecessary. He discussed the possibility that the ruling might be reversed, potentially putting Ripple back under legal scrutiny. He noted that with changes in political leadership, such as the potential influence of Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President there could be shifts in how the SEC handles the case. Gasparino made it clear that, as a reporter, he remains neutral in the crypto debate and will cover the story objectively, regardless of the outcome, as he does not have any personal stake in XRP. “I think there’s a chance it gets reversed and XRP and Ripple’s back on the hook. The SEC may drop the whole thing now that Trump’s in there. That’s a whole other thing you have to worry about. And this is why I get it from both sides, both pro-crypto and anti-crypto,” He Said.

Ripple Case Under Paul Atkins There is growing speculation about how the Ripple case could be affected by the incoming SEC chair, Paul Atkins , following the resignation of the current chair, Gary Gensler, on January 20 , the same day as President Trump’s inauguration. The SEC’s filing deadline for its appeal is approaching on January 15, after the agency requested a 90-day extension in October, pushing the deadline past the US Presidential Election . The transcripts for the appeal are set to be ordered by December 31 and must be fully delivered by January 30, 2025.

38219823,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667824,1735376430,"Galaxy Research Reveals Bitcoin, Ether And Dogecoin Price Projections In 2025 Crypto Forecast","Digital asset and blockchain company Galaxy Research, led by head of research Alex Thorn, has released a forecast for 2025, predicting significant price movements and regulatory changes across major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Bitcoin On Track For $185,000 By Year-End 2025 According to Galaxy Research, Bitcoin is poised to exceed $150,000 in the first half of 2025 and may reach or surpass $185,000 by the end of the year. This bullish outlook is underpinned by a combination of increasing institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption. Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed traditional asset classes, including the S&P 500 and gold, and this trend is expected to continue as it captures approximately 20% of gold’s market capitalization. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 The report notes that US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) are anticipated to surpass $250 billion in assets under management (AUM) by 2025. With over $36 billion in net inflows recorded in 2024, these ETPs have become the most successful launch cohort in history, attracting investments from major hedge funds and institutional players. As Bitcoin solidifies its position as a leading asset, Galaxy Research forecasts that at least one prominent wealth management platform will recommend a Bitcoin allocation of 2% or more. This shift is expected to further drive inflows into Bitcoin ETPs, increasing their AUM. The report also highlights the likelihood of reaching consensus on significant protocol upgrades among Bitcoin developers, which has historically been difficult to achieve, and is expected to include enhancements that improve transaction programmability. Dogecoin Poised For Resurgence Ethereum is projected to trade above $5,500 in 2025, driven by easing regulatory constraints on decentralized finance (DeFi) and increased institutional interest. Galaxy Research anticipates that Ethereum staking rates will surpass 50%, with the possibility of spot-based ETH exchange-traded funds being allowed to stake a portion of the ETH they hold. The decentralized finance (DeFi) market on Bitcoin is also expected to grow significantly. The amount of Bitcoin locked in DeFi smart contracts could nearly double in 2025, according to the firm.

The report also predicts that Dogecoin will reach a market cap of $100 billion, potentially crossing the $1 mark amidst broader market dynamics, including institutional adoption and new regulatory frameworks that may influence the future of meme-based cryptocurrencies. In the regulatory arena, Galaxy Research anticipates that bipartisan legislation governing stablecoin issuance will be enacted by the end of 2025, providing a clear framework for issuers. At present, BTC is trading at $94,648, showing a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, conversely, is priced at $3,359, reflecting a 1% increase over the same period. Dogecoin is priced at $0.314, experiencing minimal gains of only 0.5% during this timeframe.

38219790,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399198,1735376405,Kyrgyzstan Crypto Mining Faces 50% Drop in Tax Revenue In 2024,"The post Kyrgyzstan Crypto Mining Faces 50% Drop in Tax Revenue In 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2024, Kyrgyzstan experienced a sharp drop in tax revenue from cryptocurrency mining, despite the global rise in crypto valuations. The nation, known for its abundant hydroelectric resources, saw tax receipts from crypto mining fall by 50% compared to the previous year. How Does Kyrgyzstan Tax Crypto Mining? According to a report by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Kyrgyzstan collected just 46.6 million Kyrgyzstani soms (around $535,000) in mining taxes this year, a significant decrease from the 93.7 million soms ($1.08 million) collected in 2023. The decline was evident early on, with a 29.7% drop in revenue during the first seven months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Kyrgyzstan imposes a 10% tax on the electricity used by crypto miners, which also includes value-added tax (VAT) and sales tax. This taxation model initially helped boost revenue, particularly during the early stages of 2023. Back then, the country reported a dramatic increase in mining taxes, collecting 78.6 million soms ($883,000) in the first few months, far exceeding the 11.1 million soms ($133,200) collected during the same period in 2022. What’s Behind the Decline? The reasons for the sharp drop in mining tax revenue remain unclear. Some suggest that regulatory uncertainties or reduced mining activity may have contributed. Additionally, Kyrgyzstan’s affordable hydroelectric power has made it an attractive place for crypto miners, but recent changes in energy policies or costs may have impacted the sector. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Blockchain Association Files Lawsuit Against IRS Over New DeFi Regulations , New Opportunities for Mining Despite the fall in tax revenue, there are ideas worldwide to improve crypto mining. In Germany, for example, miners use extra renewable energy to power Bitcoin operations, which helps reduce energy waste and stabilize power grids. Countries like Kyrgyzstan could explore similar solutions to boost the sector while supporting their economy. This decline in tax revenue is a challenge for Kyrgyzstan, but it also opens doors to rethink strategies and create a more sustainable future for cryptocurrency mining . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38221187,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53325,1735376032,BitBoy Says XRP Will See Rocket Rally to $4.5 Once This Happens,"XRP is currently trading at $2.14, reflecting a 34% decline from its recent seven-year high. Market participants who entered during the token’s recent rally are experiencing losses, though sentiment remains hopeful. Some prominent crypto analysts suggest that XRP may soon break through this period of consolidation to reach new heights. Conditions for XRP Rally to $4.50 Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, known as “BitBoy,” has outlined the critical level XRP must surpass to initiate its next significant price rally. In a recent tweet, Armstrong emphasized the importance of XRP closing daily and weekly candles above $2.75. If this condition is met, he believes the digital asset could achieve a rally to $4.50. When $XRP is closing daily and weekly candles above $2.75 it’s time to rock and roll to $4.50 — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 17, 2024 XRP briefly reached $2.72 after Ripple announced the launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD . Many anticipated that this news would catalyze XRP’s price, but the token quickly retraced, largely impacted by Bitcoin’s market downturn. Despite this, Armstrong maintains that reclaiming the $2.75 level remains the key trigger for XRP’s upward movement. He has also suggested that this price target could be reached by the end of the year. XRP’s Path Toward Reclaiming Its All-Time High Adding to the bullish outlook, another prominent crypto analyst named “360 Trader” has presented an even more optimistic perspective. The analyst predicts that XRP is on the verge of recovering its all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and establishing a strong price base above it. They argue this would provide the foundation for XRP’s “true” bull run, potentially leading to unprecedented price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment: Optimism vs. Skepticism The broader crypto community continues to monitor XRP’s performance with mixed expectations. Optimists point to potential catalysts, including the anticipated resolution of Ripple’s ongoing legal battle and the possible approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Both developments are expected to boost market confidence significantly. On the other hand, skeptics caution against overestimating XRP’s potential in the near term. Some predict a possible decline to $0.50 , citing historical patterns and market volatility as key risks. As the end of the year approaches, XRP’s price movement remains a focal point for analysts and investors alike. While the asset has been trading within a narrow range over the past two weeks, key developments and market trends could dictate its next major move. Whether XRP can meet Armstrong’s $2.75 threshold and surge to $4.50, or face further pullbacks, remains to be seen. However, enthusiasts and critics agree that the coming months will be pivotal for the digital asset’s trajectory.

38218962,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399272,1735374691,Blockchain Association Files Lawsuit Against IRS Over New DeFi Regulations,"The post Blockchain Association Files Lawsuit Against IRS Over New DeFi Regulations appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced new regulations that classify certain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols as brokers. This move requires these protocols to disclose Know Your Customer (KYC) information for digital asset transactions. The IRS estimates that up to 875 DeFi brokers could be affected by these new rules, which has quickly triggered a community backlash. In simple terms, the new rules say that certain DeFi platforms, which help people buy and sell digital assets, will now be treated like brokers. On top of that, the proposed KYC details are creating security issues in the investor’s mind and legal experts are strongly objecting to the move stating it as constitutional violation. In response, the IRS stated that this will help make sure people are paying the right taxes. However, many people in the crypto world are worried about these new requirements. Lawsuit Filed to Counter the IRS Rule In place of the controversy, the Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the DeFi Education Fund and the Texas Blockchain Council, has filed a lawsuit against the IRS, challenging the new regulations. Today we’re taking action, filing a lawsuit that argues today’s broker rulemaking violates the Administrative Procedure Act and is unconstitutional. We stand with our nation’s innovators and will continue working to ensure the future of crypto – and DeFi – is here in the United… https://t.co/CwZWzjwT5O — Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) December 28, 2024 Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, expressed strong opposition, demanding to reverse the rules. She is hopeful that Trump’s pro-crypto Congress and Administration will understand the complications of such outreach which suppress innovation. Moreover, the legal community is also not happy with the laws, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, called the rule “the dying gasp of the anti-crypto army” and urged that it be overturned either by the courts or the new administration. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Kyrgyzstan Crypto Mining Faces 50% Drop in Tax Revenue In 2024 , Community Pours Their Support Adding to the sentiments, Miles Jennings, general counsel of a16z Crypto, criticized the rule as an overreach, calling it a “fantastical expansion” of the term “effectuate transactions.” He warned that the new rules could potentially allow the IRS to regulate or even ban DeFi platforms. Some X users see it as a sabotage plan of Biden to block Trump’s crypto plans. the Biden admin purposely trying to sabotage Trump's crypto plans — johnslade (@johnslade66) December 28, 2024 The community is united in objecting to this law which might violate their constitutional rights. Since Trump will take charge in January with his pro-crypto team it will be interesting to see how such anti-crypto rules will be dealt with by the congress. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38219130,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323195,1735374515,Uniswap CLO Says IRS Ruling on DEXs Should Be Challenged,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) latest ruling requiring decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to adhere to the same reporting standards as traditional brokers has drawn sharp criticism from crypto executives and legal experts. “No shortage of ways to challenge this, and it absolutely should be challenged,” Uniswap Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Katherine Minarik said in a December 27 post on X . She questioned the IRS’s rationale, arguing that the ruling incorrectly classifies DeFi platforms as brokers, despite their role being only a part of transaction processes. Uniswap CEO Expresses Similar Concerns Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams expressed similar concerns, stating that he hopes the ruling will be overturned through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or legal challenges. The IRS’s new regulations, unveiled on December 27, mandate brokers to report gross proceeds from digital asset transactions, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This expanded scope now includes front-end DeFi platforms and is set to be implemented in 2027. Critics argue that these requirements are ill-suited for the decentralized nature of such platforms, which often lack the infrastructure for traditional reporting. Robin Singh, CEO of crypto tax platform Koinly, warned that compliance could impose significant operational and technical burdens on decentralized businesses. “The decentralized structure of these platforms makes traditional reporting exceptionally challenging,” Singh noted. 5/ If you are a customer of a front-end trading service, expect the following in the future: – Share your KYC info similar to CeFi exchanges during onboarding. – Receive tax forms with only proceeds (you will still have to use a crypto tax software tool to keep track of your… — Shehan (@TheCryptoCPA) December 27, 2024 Bill Hughes, a lawyer at blockchain development firm Consensys, described the ruling as “all cost, no benefit” and criticized its global reach, which demands reporting for both U.S. and international users. He predicted that the regulation would face Congressional review and potential disapproval. Critics also slammed the IRS for releasing the ruling during the holiday season, suggesting an intentional move to limit public response. Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at venture capital firm Variant, labeled the rule an “unlawful” measure by the outgoing administration’s “anti-crypto army.” He argued that it could be overturned by the courts or a new administration. Crypto Veterans Call on New Congress to Repeal the Regulations Alexander Grieve of Paradigm called for the new Congress to repeal the regulations through the CRA. “Treasury/IRS just dropped their DeFi broker regs, which impose substantial centralized reporting requirements on DeFi (starting Jan 1, 2027), and hoover up user data to the govt,” he wrote on X. “The new pro-crypto Congress can, and should, roll these back via the CRA process next year.” Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, accused the IRS of overstepping by redefining “effectuate transactions” to encompass DeFi activity. When you challenge government abuses of power, the response is even more transparent and desperate abuses. The broker reporting rule is an obvious example — A fantastical expansion of the words “effectuate transactions” to enable the IRS to ban DeFi. This despite courts… — miles jennings (@milesjennings) December 27, 2024 Advocacy groups like the Blockchain Association echoed these sentiments, calling the rule a final effort to drive the U.S. crypto industry offshore. “On behalf of the industry, we’re prepared to take aggressive action to fight back. We also look forward to working with the new pro-crypto Congress and Administration to roll back this and other anti-innovation rules.” Kristin Smith, the group’s CEO, emphasized the urgent need for policymakers to reconsider the broader implications of the ruling.

38219420,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53315,1735374351,"Pundit Claims Bitcoin Creators Also Created XRP, Says Satoshi Nakamoto Is an Organization","Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, recently claimed that the same entities behind Bitcoin (BTC) also created XRP. His assertions have sparked significant debate, as they challenge widely accepted narratives about the origins of these digital assets. Farina specifically attributes the creation of Bitcoin to the National Security Agency (NSA) and asserts that XRP represents a more refined evolution of blockchain technology. Below, we examine his key points. The creators of BTC also created $XRP . The CIA & NSA deployed BTC to prevent foreign powers from developing similar tech that would dominate digital payments, and make billions. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is an organization. pic.twitter.com/rxtIWN1HZE — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 26, 2024 Bitcoin’s Alleged Government Origins Farina argues that Bitcoin was created by the NSA as a “beta test coin”. According to his theory, the pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” is not an individual but rather an organization linked to intelligence agencies. Farina posits that the major reason for creating Bitcoin was to monitor and control global financial transactions, serving as a precursor to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He also highlights Bitcoin’s limitations as a functional currency, emphasizing issues such as high fees, slow transaction speeds, and the reliance on secondary solutions like the Lightning Network to facilitate smaller transactions. Farina concludes that these shortcomings render Bitcoin unsuitable for widespread financial adoption, particularly for CBDCs. XRP as Bitcoin 2.0 Farina claims that XRP was designed to address Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, describing it as “Bitcoin 2.0.” He credits XRP’s co-creators— David Schwartz , Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Brito—with building a more practical and scalable blockchain solution. Farina highlights XRP’s speed, low transaction costs, and ability to handle large-scale financial transactions as key advantages over Bitcoin. He further argues that XRP is uniquely positioned to become the backbone of the global financial system, particularly in the context of CBDCs . Farina asserts that XRP’s regulatory compliance and technical capabilities make it the only digital asset capable of dethroning Bitcoin and facilitating instant, large-scale value transfers. Implications for the Financial System Farina suggests that blockchain technology, including Bitcoin and XRP, is fundamentally aimed at enabling CBDCs. He dismisses the notion that Bitcoin was created to undermine traditional financial systems, framing it instead as a government-controlled experiment. In his view, XRP and similar assets represent the “final product” intended to integrate seamlessly into a revamped global financial system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina also stresses the importance of early adoption. He advises individuals to invest in XRP and other promising digital assets, positioning them as key components of the future financial landscape. He predicts that XRP holders will benefit from opportunities such as lending their holdings to financial institutions and earning yields without selling their assets. Controversial Assertions and Public Reaction Farina’s claims have drawn criticism and skepticism from many within the cryptocurrency community. While the idea of government involvement in Bitcoin’s creation has been discussed in conspiracy theories, there is no concrete evidence for this narrative. While XRP’s capabilities are well-documented, the assertion that it was designed by the same people behind Bitcoin lacks credibility. Farina’s assertions raise important questions about the transparency and governance of blockchain technologies. Regardless of whether his claims hold merit, they underscore the need for continued scrutiny and debate within the cryptocurrency space.

38219129,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323192,1735374203,Solana Co-Founder in Legal Dispute with Ex-Wife Over Alleged Theft of Millions in Holdings,"Stephen Akridge, a co-founder of the prominent blockchain platform Solana, is embroiled in a legal battle with his ex-wife, Elisa Rossi, over allegations of misappropriating millions of dollars in Solana (SOL) token earnings. Rossi claims in a lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court that Akridge exploited his superior knowledge of cryptocurrencies to siphon staking rewards from her digital wallet, according to a report by Bloomberg . Staking, a process that involves pledging cryptocurrency assets to validate blockchain transactions, can yield significant returns in the form of additional tokens. Akridge Reportedly Controlled Her Accounts Rossi’s complaint alleges that Akridge covertly controlled her accounts, reaping all the staking commissions allocated to her. The value of the disputed tokens has been redacted in the court documents, but Rossi has described the amounts involved as “significant.” She has also requested portions of the case remain confidential due to the sensitive financial details. The legal dispute follows the couple’s divorce filing in February 2023 after a decade of marriage. Rossi is seeking damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud. NEW: Stephen Akridge, a co-founder of @solanalabs and holder of Solana tokens, a digital asset that has a total market cap of over $90 billion, is facing legal action in San Francisco state court. — Michael A. Mora (@MichaelAdamMora) December 26, 2024 Solana, known for its rapid transaction speeds and growing ecosystem, has been a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market despite earlier setbacks, including its association with Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX collapse. The platform’s recent resurgence in value has further amplified interest in the tokens at the center of the lawsuit. According to Rossi, Akridge previously worked at Qualcomm Inc. and served as Solana’s principal engineer, collaborating closely with co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. The lawsuit proceeds under the title Rossi v. Akridge, CGC-24-620900. Solana DEX Trading Volume Surpasses $100B Solana achieved over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for the second consecutive month in December. With a $107.865 billion in monthly DEX volume (as of Dec. 27), Solana outpaced its competitors in December, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which recorded $91.444 billion and $84.168 billion. In November, Solana also reigned supreme with $129.736 billion in DEX volume, well ahead of Ethereum’s $70.635 billion. As reported, Solana has overtaken Ethereum as the top destination for new developers in 2024, breaking Ethereum’s eight-year dominance in the space. According to a December 12 report by Electric Capital, Solana saw 7,625 new developers join its ecosystem this year, surpassing Ethereum’s 6,456. The surge was driven largely by increased developer activity in Asia. Notably, Solana also briefly surpassed Ethereum on two significant occasions. On March 18, Solana’s network activity exceeded Ethereum’s due to heightened demand for Solana-based meme coins. Later, on October 28, Solana’s daily network fee generation surpassed Ethereum’s for a 24-hour period. In another incident, earlier this month, prominent blockchain researcher Max Resnick announced that he has shifted from Ethereum infrastructure firm ConsenSys to SOL-focused R&D company Anza. Resnick previously led research at ConsenSys’ Special Mechanisms Group, where he voiced support for alternative scaling models.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-rally-15000-before-exchange-listings-as-bonk-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38219128,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323189,1735374000,"US Government Unlikely to Buy Bitcoin in 2025, Says Galaxy Digital Research Head","The United States government is not expected to purchase Bitcoin in 2025, according to Galaxy Digital’s head of research, Alex Thorn. In a report published on December 27, Thorn predicted that while discussions around a Bitcoin reserve policy may progress, the government will focus on managing its existing Bitcoin stockpile rather than acquiring more. Thorn suggested that there might be “movement within departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy.” US Government Holds 183K BTC As of now, the US government holds approximately 183,850 BTC, valued at $17.36 billion, according to blockchain analysis platform Spot on Chain . This Bitcoin is spread across various known wallet addresses. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed the Bitcoin Act, which, if enacted, would significantly shift the government’s approach. The act outlines a plan for the US Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually over five years, building a reserve of one million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. Galaxy Digital analyst “JW” also weighed in, suggesting that up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states could add Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds in the near future. JW argued that increasing global competition might push nations, particularly those unaligned with or adversarial to the US, to adopt Bitcoin mining or accumulation strategies. 21 – The U.S. government will not purchase Bitcoin in 2025, but it will create a stockpile using coins it already holds, and there will be some movement within the departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy. – @intangiblecoins — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has recently expressed skepticism, noting on December 26 that the Japanese government lacked sufficient understanding of the actions being taken by the US or other nations regarding Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated that smaller nations might be the first to adopt Bitcoin reserves. Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, Zhao also suggested that China could eventually embrace a strategic Bitcoin reserve, although he acknowledged that such changes would likely unfold gradually. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

In a new interview with Anna Tutova, the CEO of Coinstelegram, Hayes says Bitcoin could hit seven figures in about a year or so due to a massive expansion of monetary supply from governments. “I believe we can get to $1 million end of the cycle – $1 million… b ecause the amount of money that’s going to be printed is going to be absolutely insane as every government around the world does the same thing, which is print money to make my people feel happy because the global growth is slowing… I think that we’re in a transition period of a global financial system. We’re going to change it. The elites will resist the change, which means they’re going to print a lot of money and more money that’s ever been printed because they don’t want the post-World War II US hegemony to change.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,244 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Asked how long the current bull market may last, Hayes says, “ Maybe 2026, 2027 is my estimate, but who knows.” He also says that while some altcoins have plummeted, the overall crypto market cap is up compared to more than a year ago, indicating the upward trend remains intact. “The aggregate value of all of crypto has still increased over the last 12 to 18 months, so I believe we’re still in a bull market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This landmark move expands existing tax reporting obligations to include decentralized exchanges and similar front-end platforms that facilitate crypto transactions. Stricter Reporting Rules Starting in 2027, brokers must report gross proceeds from the sale of digital assets, including detailed information about taxpayers involved in these transactions. While not all DeFi platforms are directly impacted, those that serve as trading front-ends or exercise significant control over transaction processes will now fall under the “broker” category. This includes platforms or even groups of individuals acting as intermediaries, regardless of their operational structure or legal entity status. The IRS clarified that the regulations aim to provide consistent tax compliance standards, stating: “These final regulations will result in trading front-end service providers being able to provide to their customers the same useful information regarding gross proceeds as custodial brokers.” Implications for DeFi and Taxpayer Transparency The regulations will begin applying to digital asset transactions in 2027, with brokers required to start collecting relevant data by 2026. The IRS estimates that between 650 and 875 DeFi brokers will need to comply with the new rules. These platforms are expected to facilitate greater transparency by providing users with detailed transaction data, akin to what traditional custodial brokers already offer. While some in the DeFi community have raised concerns about these rules discouraging innovation, the IRS dismissed claims of bias, stating that the regulations treat DeFi no differently than other industries. According to the IRS, these changes have been in place for brokers across various sectors for over 40 years, and the updated framework merely brings digital assets into the fold. The potential impact is big, with the IRS estimating that up to 2.6 million taxpayers will be affected. By mandating this level of reporting, the agency aims to curb tax evasion and ensure that income from digital asset transactions becomes more transparent. The move underscores the growing scrutiny of the cryptocurrency sector as regulators aim to close loopholes and integrate digital finance into the broader financial ecosystem.

When it goes live, it will become the second memecoin ETP on a regulated stock exchange, following in the footsteps of the Dogecoin ETP. The coin has seen a jump of 400% this year showcasing immense community support to push it to new heights. Many seem to be taking for granted how incredible it is for a #memecoin to have an ETP. There are millions of memecoins, and there are at least 8 memecoins above $1 billion market cap! Of these, only one currently has an ETP on a regulated stock exchange: $DOGE . $FLOKI is next… https://t.co/mPEoIvHrUM — B (Da Viking) (@100bviking) December 27, 2024 Floki’s bullish move is creating a possibility of a memecoin breakout in 2025 as following the lead many others will jump on the ETP mania to leverage the success. Following the news Floki is expected to rise in price and may attract big institutional support. What is the Proposal? As per the proposal, it will allocate a portion of the 16.3 billion tokens in the community’s buyback wallet to provide liquidity for the ETP, while the remaining tokens will be burned. As a result, the token’s price surged 5%, reaching $0.0001797, with trading volume jumping by 58% in just 24 hours. The community-driven projects are seen as a hot choice for crypto investors as many meme coins are supported by political leaders and celebrities. Interest Market is Heating Up Hence, market analysts are bullish about Floki’s potential . With futures open interest (OI) increasing by 10% and derivative volumes up by 74%, there’s a noticeable surge in market interest. Some analysts predict that Floki could rally by over 50%, possibly reaching $0.00055, and even target $0.00080. This growing attention from both traders and analysts highlights Floki’s bullish outlook, especially as the ETP launch could significantly boost its market visibility and investor interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Decoding the Possibility of Reaching $1 , What Next? Floki Inu is in a recovery phase where its price is holding steady but at the same time it is getting ready for a potential jump. Right now, it’s stuck below a key price level of $0.0002761. If it manages to break through this level, it could soar, with some analysts predicting it could reach as high as $0.0005467, which would be a huge 200% increase from where it is now. The excitement around Floki comes from its strong community, growing partnerships, and increasing attention in the market. If the token can break out soon, it might offer a big opportunity for investors willing to take on some risk. Though the excitement is high, it is better to analyze the market first before investing in the hyped projects as many analysts warn that such projects can be fatal once the craze on social media fades. However after Trump’s win memecoin sector is considered as the best investment option for investors who are looking to divert thier portfolios. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38230581,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106793,1735372490,"Expert Says Stop Doubting XRP, States Reasons He Expects an Imminent Uptrend","A prominent market pundit urges investors to stop doubting XRP, presenting several reasons he believes an XRP explosive run is imminent. These remarks came from Armando Pantoja, an IBM blockchain award recipient and member of the Benzinga crypto advisory board, amid the persistent consolidation that has prevailed in the broader crypto market. XRP , which rallied 284% in November, is now facing an exhaustion of the bullish trend.Notably, while most experts believe XRP could resume the upsurge soon, this range-bound phase has triggered uncertainty among investors, leading to profit-taking trades. CryptoQuant data shows that XRP Exchange Reserve on Binance has spiked from 2.79 billion tokens on Dec. 16 to the current figure of 2.93 billion. XRP Exchange Reserve Binance XRP Exchange Reserve Binance ""Stop Doubting XRP""This increase in Binance exchange reserve indicates a campaign among market participants to deposit their assets to Binance, the world's largest exchange, for sales. Amid this prevailing sentiment, Pantoja has urged investors to stop doubting XRP.https://twitter.com/_TallGuyTycoon/status/1872801954835120132For context, this pessimism surrounding XRP emerged as it underperformed during the 2021 bull run and in the early stages of the ongoing bull market. Even market veterans such as Raoul Pal insisted that XRP investors could miss out on this bull run, urging them to seek gains elsewhere.Now, following its impressive performance on the back of the Donald Trump election victory, the pessimism has resurfaced. For context, some analysts have predicted loftier targets for XRP, such as the $27 mark and a more audacious $33 price . However, many have dismissed these targets as fantasies.Possible Surge CatalystsWhile some believe XRP might have exhausted its uptrend, Pantoja called attention to the altcoin's explosive run in the 2017/2018 cycle as one reason behind his optimism. It bears mentioning that XRP traded for as low as $0.003 in January 2017, as it dumped while other assets surged during the start of the bull run then.Interestingly, once it broke out, XRP outperformed the rest of the market, rallying from the $0.003 low to the $3.31 all-time high in January 2018. This marked a 110,233% increase within a year. Pantoja pointed out that, with this rally, XRP transformed $1,000 to $1.1 million.This historic run demonstrated XRP's potential and now serves as the foundation for confidence among analysts. Further, he highlighted other catalysts that could trigger a similar explosive run, including the possible conclusion of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, as a new leadership is set to take charge in January 2025.In addition to this, Pantoja also highlighted the incoming Donald Trump administration as another possible trigger of the next XRP upsurge. For context, Trump has promised to establish a more crypto-friendly administration, with his inauguration in January 2025 expected to kickstart another market rally.At press time, XRP currently changes hands for $2.16, up 10.71% in December despite the ongoing turbulence.

38217622,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376527,1735371925,ChatGPT Weighs in: Can Ripple (XRP) Finally Hit New All-Time High in 2025?,"TL:DR; XRP went on a wild ride at the end of 2024 but still came short when it was a matter of breaking above $3 and potentially reaching a new all-time high. Will that finally change for the asset in 2025? Here’s ChatGPT’s answer. Can XRP Break Above $3.4 in 2025? It’s safe to say that the Trump-induced rally after his decisive win in the 2024 US presidential elections benefited some assets more than others. XRP stood quietly below $0.6 but on the hopes that the SEC lawsuit will finally be resolved during a more favorable administration and better regulations, it skyrocketed within several weeks to almost $3. However, its run was halted there and Ripple’s native cross-border token even slipped below $2 on a couple of occasions. It now stands at around $2.15, which is more than 35% away from its January 7, 2018 all-time high of $3.4. With just a few days left in 2024, it seems highly unlikely that this record will fall by January 1. But, what are XRP’s chances for a new all-time high in 2025? Well, ChatGPT’s answer was quite bullish, actually. In the first part, the AI chatbot indicated that numerous analysts and forecasts envision XRP going to $4.5 in H1 of 2025, driven by “factors such as increased adoption and favorable regulatory develpoments.” Furthermore, the AI tool asserted that the asset could shot up to $7 if the aforementioed factors align with better market conditions and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, it also had a second part to its answer, suggesting that “XRP may underperform in 2025 as investors might shift their focus to newer cryptocurrencies, potentially impacting its growth prospects.” And Perplexity Says…? ChatGPT’s rival also outlined XRP’s spectacular price growth at the end of 2024 and highlighted three probable scenarios for the asset for the next year. The conservative one sees XRP stabilizing between its current level and $3. The more optimistic one foresees a price rally to uncharted territory of $4.44 and $5.25. The more outrageous prediction indicates a run toward $8 by the end of 2025. Such a price tag would put XRP’s market capitalization at roughly $500 billion, which would make it the second-largest by that metric if ETH’s stays the same. Perplexity mentioned essentially the same factors that could propel a price rally for XRP, including better regulatory landscape in the US, bullish market sentiment across the entire crytpo fieled, and growing institutional adoption. The last part could be fastlaned if the upcoming SEC administration approves a Ripple ETF , just like it did with BTC and ETH in 2024.

38217662,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53312,1735371815,"XLM Downturn, Japan’s Bitcoin Reserves Doubts, and SHIB Survival","The Stellar token (XLM) is currently experiencing substantial downward pressure, with market data signaling the potential for further losses. Recent technical analysis highlights a breach of the upper Bollinger Band at $0.6374, with the 20-day moving average acting as a median point at $0.21. This situation is reminiscent of 2021 when XLM peaked at $0.797 before suffering a sharp 48.73% decline within a week. Over the past three weeks, XLM has already dropped by over 40%, and at the time of writing, it is trading at $0.3541—down 0.4% in the last 24 hours, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Analysts suggest that XLM could face a further 45% drop if bearish market conditions persist. While historical patterns provide some context, external market forces and overall cryptocurrency sentiment remain key factors in determining the token’s future performance. Japanese Government Hesitant on Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset The Japanese government has recently expressed caution regarding Bitcoin’s adoption as a reserve currency. According to Wu Blockchain, citing CoinPost, Satoshi Hamada, a member of Japan’s House of Councillors, urged the government to follow the United States in incorporating Bitcoin into its reserve strategy. Despite these calls, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan lacks sufficient information on the U.S.’s actions concerning Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, crypto assets are not classified as foreign exchange under Japan’s regulatory framework, and concerns about the security and liquidity of such assets have further complicated their consideration as reserves. The government’s stance underscores a cautious approach toward integrating volatile assets into national financial policies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Critical Support Level Test Shiba Inu (SHIB) is grappling with significant market challenges, as bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the asset. On-chain data shows that SHIB is trading near $0.00002164, with its key support at the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) under considerable strain. The 200-day EMA is now closely aligned with the asset’s current price, creating an additional layer of vulnerability. A failure to hold these critical support levels could trigger a steep decline, potentially pushing SHIB down to $0.0000204 or lower. Large transaction volumes involving institutional investors have also declined sharply, suggesting reduced confidence in the asset. If key support is lost, panic selling could further amplify losses. However, there remains some potential for recovery if SHIB rebounds from the 200-day EMA and attracts speculative interest. The coming days are expected to be pivotal for XLM, SHIB, and the broader cryptocurrency market, as external factors and investor sentiment continue to shape their trajectories.

Dogecoin: The Meme Cryptocurrency with Growing Influence Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially considered a joke, it gained significant value in 2021, becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was driven by social media influence and interest from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s potential lies in its active community and the impact of social media on its popularity. Its appeal in the current market cycle depends on these factors and broader trends in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion With DOGE and XRP showing less short-term potential, attention shifts to Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero bringing financial freedom to all. Offering 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, Catzilla provides governance, loyalty rewards, and staking options.

Hoskinson provided an update about his recent discussions with the Ripple team in a recent AMA session. The Angry Crypto Show, an X account covering Cardano-related news, shared some clips of Hoskinson’s comments yesterday. It should be recalled that last month, the Cardano founder met with top executives at Ripple, including the company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CTO David Schwartz. Hoskinson Eyes RLUSD Potential Launch on Cardano Providing an update about his recent engagement with Ripple, Hoskinson emphasized that working with the San Francisco-based payments company has been easy. The Cardano founder revealed that he recently met the team behind Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. According to him, the RLUSD team is trying to recover from the intensive launch phase. For context, RLUSD, which launched earlier this month, is currently available on the Ethereum and XRP Ledger (XRPL) networks. Notably, Ripple plans to launch the stablecoin on other blockchain networks in the future. However, the company has yet to reveal the specific timeline for this expansion or identify which blockchains will be included in the next phase of the rollout. Interestingly, Hoskinson expressed confidence that the stablecoin team will launch RLUSD on other blockchain networks next year. He indicated that RLUSD could be incorporated into the Cardano ecosystem, stating that “there is no reason for us not to work together.” https://twitter.com/angrycryptoshow/status/1872746517817102576Adding Ripple to Midnight Ecosystem In addition, Hoskinson expressed a desire to include Ripple in the Midnight ecosystem, a privacy-focused sidechain on Cardano. He revealed that the Ripple and Midnight teams are in ongoing discussions. According to him, Cardano also has some technologies, particularly Marlowe, that could be of immense value to Ripple. Regarding the possibility of an official partnership, Hoskinson emphasized that such collaborations take time to materialize. He suggested that the first step involves engaging in technical conversations, which the Cardano team had with the Ripple CTO last month. Afterward, he speculated that other things, like an integration, might follow suit. Overall, Hoskinson is optimistic about the prospects of a partnership, as he looks forward to what the Cardano and Ripple ecosystems could achieve working together.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/hoskinson-hints-at-potential-launch-of-ripple-stablecoin-on-cardano/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hoskinson-hints-at-potential-launch-of-ripple-stablecoin-on-cardano,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

While these rules largely target DeFi trading platforms rather than individual taxpayers, they will impact how DeFi platforms operate and the experience of their customers. Under Section 6045 of the US tax code, brokers are required to collect know-your-customer (KYC) information from customers, calculate gains and losses, and report this data to the IRS via forms like 1099-B. Last year, the IRS expanded these rules to include custodial cryptocurrency brokers like centralized exchanges (CeFi). Now, the IRS has clarified how these rules apply to the DeFi ecosystem. Interface Layer: This layer allows users to interact with DeFi platforms, including screens, buttons, forms, and other visual elements on websites, mobile apps, and browser extensions. Application Layer: This layer facilitates the execution of trades, including verification and recording of transactions on the blockchain. Consensus layer: Responsible for recording financial transactions on the distributed ledger, including transactions made by users trading digital assets using DeFi protocols. Related News: Analysis Company Announced Crypto Money Predictions for 2025: “Bitcoin $150,000, Ethereum $5,500, Dogecoin $1...” The IRS will only treat Interface Layer (front-end commerce services) as “intermediaries” under the new regulations. These platforms, which have the most direct contact with users, will now face stricter reporting requirements. Starting January 1, 2027, DeFi platforms operating as front-end trading services must: Collecting KYC information from customers during onboarding, similar to centralized exchanges. Tracking client transactions and reporting income to both the IRS and clients via Form 1099-DAs. If you are a customer of a front-end DeFi platform, here is what you should expect: KYC Requirements: Similar to the onboarding process for centralized platforms, you will be required to provide your personal information for identification purposes. Tax Reporting: While platforms will report trading income, you will still need to use crypto tax software to track your cost basis and calculate your gains or losses. *This is not investment advice.

38217184,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667790,1735371027,"Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details","Although Bitcoin (BTC) remains range-bound – trading between the $90,000 and $100,000 price levels – some crypto analysts predict that a price correction may be on the horizon due to a bearish ‘head and shoulders’ pattern forming on the daily chart. Bitcoin To Drop To $80,000? Seasoned analyst and trader Aksel Kibar took to X to share his thoughts on the recent BTC price action. In his post, the chartered market technician highlighted a potential head and shoulders pattern forming on the daily BTC chart, with risk of the cryptocurrency dropping as low as $80,000. The analyst explained that the pullback could push BTC’s price to the broadening pattern that completed with a breakout above $73,600. However, Kibar emphasized that the head and shoulders pattern must fully materialize for a significant pullback in BTC price to occur. He stated: Seeing it is not enough. It needs to materialize with a breach below the neckline. There are many cases of failed head and shoulders tops especially in steady uptrends well above the year-long average. Other crypto analysts have also shared similar bearish outlooks for Bitcoin’s price. For instance, technical analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,730 as a crucial price level for the top cryptocurrency. According to Martinez, losing this level could push BTC into “free fall territory,” based on UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off Likely When This Metric Reaches 4%, Analyst Explains For the uninitiated, URPD is a metric that shows the distribution of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) across various price levels, based on when they were last moved. Essentially, it helps identify price zones where significant BTC accumulation or spending occurred, providing insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. In addition, former Wall Street derivatives trader Tone Vays warned that BTC trading below the $95,000 price level would be “very, very bad” for the flagship digital asset. Similarly, renowned trader Peter Brandt recently highlighted the risk of BTC breaking down from a ‘broadening triangle’ formation, potentially falling to the $70,000 level. While several analysts predict a potential price correction, others remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Capital projected that BTC could surge as high as $250,000 by 2025. However, he acknowledged the possibility of a short-term correction to $60,000 early next year before Bitcoin enters a historic bull run. The Long-Term Bullish Case For BTC While BTC may indeed face a looming price correction according to some analysts, the long-term price projections remain overwhelmingly bullish. Crypto asset manager Sygnum posits that BTC may face ‘demand shocks’ due to strong institutional interest in the asset, driving its price significantly higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Earlier this month, Ali Martinez highlighted the potential formation of a ‘cup and handle’ pattern on BTC’s chart. If this pattern plays out, it could trigger renewed bullish momentum for the digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $94,149, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Leveraging historical data and current trends, Rietveld offered his price target for XRP. He explained why investors should consider buying now to secure substantial profits in the near future.XRP Trend Has ImprovedRietveld noted that XRP exceeded his initial predictions, surpassing market expectations. This referred to XRP's performance in November when its price expanded by around 5X to nearly $3. Now, Rietveld feels confident about the XRP's trajectory moving into 2025. “Now that we have more updated information on what XRP has done today, I have a pretty good idea of what we can expect going into the new year,” Rietveld said. Accordingly, he analyzed the potential worth of a portfolio holding 1,000 XRP tokens for 2025.Why 1,000 XRP?Meanwhile, Rietveld addressed why he chose 1,000 XRP as a benchmark for his price predictions. According to him, 1,000 XRP makes the math easier and is a realistic goal for many investors. He also noted that the majority of XRP holders currently own fewer than 1,000 coins. However, Rietveld encourages his followers to aim for higher amounts, such as 10,000 to 25,000 XRP, to maximize potential returns.Market Dominance and the Path to $70Meanwhile, in exploring XRP's price outlook, Rietveld analyzed XRP’s historical market dominance . He noted that the coin has seen significant growth in recent months. From September to November 2024, XRP’s market capitalization more than tripled, increasing from 1.25% to 3.91% of the total crypto market.Rietveld predicts that XRP could achieve 20% market dominance by 2025, which would result in a 6X increase in its current price of $2.31. In this scenario, XRP could reach a price of $20 per coin, he added.Notably, 1,000 XRP today, which costs $2,310 today, would be worth $20,000 in this case.Meanwhile, Rietveld also pointed out that in an extremely bullish case, XRP could surge even higher, reaching a price of $70 per coin. Here, the value of 1,000 XRP would be $70,000.Notably, Rietveld drew inspiration for XRP to attain a 20% share of the global crypto market share from the figures XRP commanded during its peaks in the 2014 and 2017 cycles. Specifically, in both cases, XRP saw a dominance of 16.9% and 18.1%. XRP domiance chart XRP dominance chart Conservative Estimate for XRPWhile Rietveld remains optimistic about XRP’s potential, he provided a more conservative estimate for the coin's 2025 price. Assuming XRP captures 10-15% of the crypto market and the total market cap reaches around $12 trillion, Rietveld’s target price for XRP is around $20 to $23 per coin. “This price is very reasonable, considering how much the market capitalization has grown in past bull cycles,” he said.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/heres-what-1000-xrp-will-be-worth-in-2025-price-prediction/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-what-1000-xrp-will-be-worth-in-2025-price-prediction,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Who can forget the explosion of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Recently, however, things have been dicey. Popcat, one of the hottest meme coins on the Solana blockchain, saw its price nosedive over 50% in a month. Similarly, Snek, inspired by the classic Nokia snake game, has had its moments of glory but remains a niche player. Amid this chaos, a new star has emerged— BTFD Coin . Its presale has shattered records, pulling in over $4.6 million in just weeks and reigniting excitement in the crypto world. Let’s dive in and see why these three coins are some of the best crypto to invest in 2024. Meme coins have captivated the world for years. What started as jokes turned into full-blown financial movements. Investors and Gen Z traders alike can’t resist the charm of coins like Popcat, which bank on cultural quirks and nostalgia. But meme coins are no longer just about the memes. They integrate games, staking rewards, and community power to create lasting value. Enter BTFD Coin—a game-changer poised to set the meme coin market on fire with its play-to-earn (P2E) game , referral program, and staking rewards. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a powerhouse backed by a strong community and tangible benefits. Ready to explore the best crypto to invest in? Here’s a deep dive into BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Snek. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips Into Dollars BTFD Coin’s story is the kind of underdog success that crypto enthusiasts dream about. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the token has skyrocketed to a current Stage 13 price of $0.000142. That’s an 837.5% ROI for early investors ! With over $4.6 million raised and more than 60 billion coins sold, BTFD has proven it’s not here to play—it’s here to win. Let’s talk strategy. Imagine investing $20,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. By the end of the presale, when the coin lists at $0.0006, your $20,000 could balloon to over $187,500. That’s life-changing money, and it’s why analysts can’t stop buzzing about BTFD Coin’s potential. So, what makes BTFD Coin a standout? First, there’s its killer P2E game, where players can earn while having fun. Then there’s the referral program—bring in friends, and you’re rewarded in BTFD. And let’s not forget the staking rewards, which encourage long-term holding and boost the coin’s stability. Ready to grab your share? Head to the presale page at btfd.io . Connect your wallet, enter the bonus code BIG50 for extra coins, and secure your spot before the presale ends. Popcat: The Meme That Went Too Far? Popcat is the quintessential meme coin. Born on the Solana blockchain, it gained massive popularity with its quirky “pop-to-click” feature. At its peak, it crossed the $2 mark. But by December 2024, it had plummeted to $0.7. So, is Popcat still one of the best crypto to invest in? The answer—maybe. Popcat’s main selling point is its charm. Its interactive website, featuring a cartoon cat that “pops” when clicked, is undeniably fun. But there’s a catch: no pop-to-earn mechanism. Without real utility, the coin’s value hinges on market trends and meme culture. Analysts predict that if Bitcoin rallies in 2025, Popcat could climb back to $3 or $4. Otherwise, it may continue its rollercoaster ride, potentially sinking to $0.5 by 2030. Popcat’s community is its saving grace. Meme coins live and die by their fanbase, and Popcat’s supporters are nothing if not loyal. However, without updates or added functionality, it’s hard to see how it competes with dynamic projects like BTFD Coin. Snek: Nostalgia Meets Blockchain Snek taps into a different kind of nostalgia. Inspired by the classic Nokia snake game, this play-to-earn token combines gaming and crypto in a simple and charming way. At its recent peak price of $0.0094, Snek made waves among gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. But here’s the kicker: Snek’s appeal might also be its Achilles’ heel. Its gaming-centric approach is a hit among niche audiences, but it lacks the broader appeal needed for explosive growth. Unlike BTFD Coin, which offers multiple incentives like staking and referral bonuses, Snek’s success largely depends on its nostalgic gameplay. That said, Snek’s simplicity has its own magic. It’s easy to pick up, fun to play, and taps into a market of casual gamers. If you’re looking for a bit offbeat project but still among the best crypto to invest in, Snek deserves a spot on your radar. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Want to get in on the action? Here’s how to buy BTFD Coin and unlock bonus coins using the BIG50 code. Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply.” Input the amount of BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Easy, right? Don’t wait too long—the presale is in its 13th stage, and prices will only go up. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in right now. With its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and robust community, it’s set to redefine what meme coins can achieve. Popcat and Snek have their merits, but they’re no match for the momentum behind BTFD Coin. Don’t miss out. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and turn market dips into massive gains. Visit btfd.io now, use the BIG50 code, and get ready to ride the wave to crypto success!

38217660,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53304,1735369082,"Now that RLUSD Is Live, What Is Stopping XRP from Getting to $100? XRP Army Responds","A tweet by prominent crypto enthusiast XRP Avengers has sparked a spirited discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The post , which says, “Now that $RLUSD is now live, what’s stopping #XRP price getting to $100?” has generated diverse perspectives from supporters, skeptics, and market analysts. This discourse sheds light on the factors influencing XRP’s price and the challenges it faces in achieving the ambitious target of $100 per token. RLUSD’s Role in the XRP Ecosystem RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has recently gone live, signifying another milestone in XRPL’s ongoing evolution. Stablecoins like RLUSD are designed to provide liquidity, reduce volatility, and promote seamless cross-border transactions. Their integration into the XRP ecosystem strengthens its utility and appeal to financial institutions, retail users, and developers. While this is a significant development, it alone may not be sufficient to drive XRP’s price to the speculative $100 level. XRP Army’s Perspectives on the $100 Price Target George Vedelek, a commenter in the thread, attributed XRP’s potential price surge to future regulatory clarity. He speculated that a political shift, such as former President Donald Trump returning to office, could lead to executive orders fostering a favorable environment for cryptocurrency growth. While political and regulatory developments often impact market sentiment, the direct correlation between a single political event and XRP reaching $100 remains speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Andor Byrd, provided a more technical viewpoint, emphasizing the importance of network volume. He pointed out that XRP’s intended use case—facilitating high-volume transactions on a global scale—is essential for significant price appreciation. Byrd acknowledged the possibility of a rapid increase in transaction volume but expressed skepticism about the timeline, stating, “Sure, but when?” Similarly, TFC Guy outlined key factors needed to achieve a $100 price point: massive adoption, regulatory clarity, market optimism, and favorable supply-demand dynamics. He noted that while RLUSD adds utility to the XRPL ecosystem , broader adoption and systemic growth are critical for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. The community’s reactions to XRP Avengers’ tweet illustrate the diverse opinions surrounding XRP’s potential. While some view regulatory clarity as a catalyst, others emphasize the importance of network activity and real-world use cases. While RLUSD’s launch is a notable development, the $100 price target for XRP remains speculative and dependent on multiple variables.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-to-surge-17000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38216138,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399172,1735368799,Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack,"The post Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world stays to be the area of new discoveries on one hand, and hackers on the other. The major happenings for the current week were the creativity of hackers in hacking and the weak spots still existing in the ecosystem. Below, is a close-up view of the hacker attacks this week. Fraudsters in Pig Butchering Scams Defraud Victims of $3.6 Billion. In 2024, Pig Butchering scams took over $3.6 billion and are one of the most dangerous threats to crypto users. These elaborate schemes establish a foundation of trust, finally leading to the victims being manipulated into investing in fake crypto investment platforms. In total, there were 800,000 fake transactions made to over 150,000 Ethereum wallets. Phishing Ads con NFT users of Pudgy Penguins With a new phishing technique, fraudsters launched Google ads to trick Pudgy Penguins NFT project members into handing over their wallet information to fake sites. The campaign targeted ad networks and weak Web3 front-ends. That is why ad blockers, URL checks, and separation of wallets’ actions in safe zones are advised, according to the experts. Animoca Brands Chairman’s X Account Hacked Hackers managed to breach Yat Siu’s X account to pump up a fictitious “ANIMOCA” token before running off after the fraud was unmasked. Mishap which was worked around the 2FA security shows vulnerability within social media platforms and the need to confirm such announcements before putting resources on any investment offers. Crypto Miner Suffers $1MILLION Theft From Zoom Malware A DeFi miner lost $1 million after a phishing attack that seemed like a fake Zoom app. In addition to directly stealing funds, the malware obtained credentials of wallets and private keys to boost the threat of malware-based schemes. $500,000 Lost Through Fraudulent X Account Phishing Scams Phishing emails which copied official letters were used to con 15 high-profile X accounts, in which attackers stole more than $500,000 . Such scams made people provide their login information and 2FA codes. Security specialists advise to not re-use passwords, use hardware wallets, 2-factor authentication and confirm emails before acting on them. Lazarus Group Allegations Strike at Hyperliquid In the Layer-1 DeFi platform Hyperliquid, $250 million has been net outflow, after which it was accused of being hacked by North Korea’s Lazarus Group . Despite the platform’s denial of this, its token lost 20% of its value leading to discussions about the danger of centralization of validators and poor measures for security. The events of the week show that hackers are becoming more professional and equipped as the cryptocurrency market remains weak. From phishing attacks, and social engineering tactics to malware attacks, it is extremely important to keep an eye out and avoid leaving various assets open-ended. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38230578,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106782,1735368509,Court Approves Terra Founder Do Kwon’s Extradition to the US,"Montenegro’s Minister of Justice has approved the United States request to extradite Do Kwon, the infamous Terra (LUNA) founder. Minister Bojan Bozokiv signed the verdict on December 27, ending the lingering decision. Notably, the US and South Korea keenly contested the extradition of the embattled Terra boss, seeking to prosecute him for his alleged involvement in the notorious 2022 Terra implosion.For context, the Terra ecosystem tumbled in 2022, wiping out billions of dollars from the cryptocurrency market. Its native token, LUNA, crashed from over $100 to almost nothing after the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD depegged from the dollar valuation.Following the over $40 billion crypto wipeout, Do Kwon took to his heels, escaping to Serbia before moving into Montenegro. In March 2023, the Montenegro police force arrested him and his partner, Han Cheng Jun, in the Podgorica airport while they attempted to flee the country to Dubai.Justice Minister Issues Verdict Notably, the United States and South Korea had previously filed a request to extradite Do Kwon. Both countries' prosecutors sought to indict the Terra boss for his involvement in the 2022 crash.Bozokiv built on an earlier ruling by the Montenegro Supreme Court , stating that both the US and South Korea met the requirements to extradite Do Kwon from the Southeastern European country.Meanwhile, the Minister of Justice favored the United States. He considered criteria like the gravity of the crime, order of submission, citizenship, and the possibility of further extradition and concluded that Do Kwon would head to the US.Notably, the statement did not mention the extradition details, such as the date and means of movement. Moreover, Do Kwon remains in the facility for foreigners in Montenegro after being released from prison last year.South Korea Almost Captured Do KwonMeanwhile, the latest ruling came after an earlier conclusion that the Terra boss would be heading to South Korea. For context, a federal court ruled in March that Montenegro will extradite Do Kwon to his home country for further trial.South Korea placed a red label on Do Kwon and made several attempts to capture him, all to no avail. Notably, the Terra founder could face up to 40 years of imprisonment if convicted in his hometown.Consequently, Terraform’s crash affected major crypto firms like Three Arrow (3AC) and FTX. The firm filed for bankruptcy earlier in the year and paid the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a staggering $4.47 billion fine.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/court-approves-terra-founder-do-kwons-extradition-to-the-us/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=court-approves-terra-founder-do-kwons-extradition-to-the-us,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

His commentary highlights significant price levels that could dictate the asset’s future movement, framing them as pivotal for understanding potential bullish or bearish trends. #XRP – Noise Until One of These Happens Key Levels to Watch: 1⃣ $2.00 – A confirmed break here, and we’ll be heading toward the lower targets. 2⃣ $2.65 – Break this level, and fireworks will ignite! The upper targets will be in play! #XRPFamily STAY STEADY AND… pic.twitter.com/sDPUwY3fyK — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 26, 2024 Key Insights from Egrag Crypto’s Analysis Egrag Crypto identified two critical levels to monitor in XRP’s price action: $2.00 Level: According to Egrag Crypto, a confirmed breakdown of the $2.00 price point could signal bearish momentum, potentially driving XRP toward lower price zones. This threshold is seen as a crucial support level, and failure to maintain it could indicate increased selling pressure. $2.65 Level: On the flip side, a successful breakout above $2.65 is described as a bullish trigger that could pave the way for higher price targets. Egrag Crypto suggests this movement could ignite substantial upward momentum, implying the possibility of XRP reaching or exceeding the $2.91, $3.55, or $3.77 levels marked on the chart. XRP Price Analysis The accompanying chart visually depicts XRP’s price consolidating within a triangular formation, bounded by support at $2.00 and resistance near $2.65. This pattern often represents a period of indecision, where price compresses before a significant breakout or breakdown. The yellow box around the triangle highlights the broader consolidation range, while annotated price levels provide further clarity on possible scenarios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Community Reacts The analysis sparked discussions among the XRP community. An X user, Razor, offered a contrasting perspective, asserting that traditional chart patterns may be irrelevant in the current market environment. Razor commented: “Charts mean shit now, crypto has moved into a different space. Price will be determined on utility and the value it brings to the system. I see a lot more stability in the market for utility coins going forward.” This viewpoint highlights an evolving trend in the cryptocurrency space, where utility and fundamental value are increasingly seen as key drivers of long-term price stability, as opposed to speculative trading or purely technical indicators. Final Thoughts Egrag Crypto’s analysis provides a structured framework for understanding XRP’s potential price movement in the near term. It equips traders and investors with actionable insights by identifying critical levels and offering possible scenarios. However, as Razor’s comment suggests, the crypto market is maturing, with utility and adoption playing a larger role in determining long-term value. For now, XRP enthusiasts are advised to monitor the $2.00 and $2.65 levels, as the asset’s price action near these thresholds could provide crucial signals for its next major move.

As a new project, it brings massive promise for the 2025 bull run. That’s because DTX Exchange brings great perks and features for traders. They can use this new crypto trading platform to make higher profits while trading and improve themselves. The best part is that the DTX token also promises life-changing gains for investors. Namely, it’s set to surge by 100x by Q1 of 2025, fueled by the bull run and massive demand! DTX Exchange: The Future of Trading Starts Here DTX Exchange is a cutting-edge new trading platform. As such, it brings great features for traders, allowing them to finally have a better trading experience. One such feature is its easy-to-use platform. Namely, the DTX Exchange interface is suitable for both new and seasoned traders. It allows them to trade many different assets from one dashboard. This will help them a lot, as they won’t have to switch between multiple platforms to trade. Furthermore, DTX Exchange makes asset management much easier. It does this through its Phoenix Wallet. The Phoenix Wallet is a great new wallet that supports 10,000+ assets. So, it lets you manage all your investments in one safe place. This will reduce the time it takes for you to keep all your investments in check. So you’ll get more time to focus on your trading and strategy. DTX Exchange will also help you boost your profits. That’s because it offers a massive 1,000x leverage to traders. Such an offer can’t be found anywhere else right now, which is yet another feature that will attract many traders as the bull run heats up. With this kind of leverage, you can turn even a small trade into huge profits, making life-changing money with just a few trades. Also, you won’t have to make multiple trades every day to hit your goals anymore! In addition, DTX Exchange offers one of the best features you can have during a bull run—speed! Namely, by using the VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange offers a massive 100,000 TPS. This is an unparalleled speed by all accounts, trumping Solana’s 600 TPS significantly! A Fair Investment Opportunity for Everyone: Only With DTX Exchange DTX Exchange also brings some features that are extremely rare in today’s market. One of them is an incredibly fair launch system. Usually, new projects are supported by large investors like whales and VCs. In these cases, the large investors get in before everyone else. This gives them the power to manipulate the token price. Also, they will make much larger profits than others because they’ve entered much earlier. So, they can nuke the chart and take their profits out of the blue, leaving everyone else with nothing. This is why many see new projects as very risky. However, DTX Exchange is here to change all of that. Firstly, it isn’t backed by any large investors. Instead, currently, over 300,000 individual wallets are supporting DTX. And this number is growing with every new day. Also, DTX is currently in its public presale, giving everyone an equal opportunity to get in. So, there are no whales or VCs that can ruin DTX’s price. This is extremely rare for a new project, which is one of the many reasons why so many investors are scrambling to get in! Furthermore, DTX Exchange has an incremental cliff price system. This makes sure that the DTX price increases steadily as it starts and continues trading on exchanges. So, no investors will be left with their accounts drained, and everyone can profit massively off of DTX Exchange! Start the Bull Run With a Bang: Join the DTX Public Presale Now! The bull run is set to be extremely kind to DTX. Namely, experts see this promising token as the leader of the bull run, which is why they’re so confident in it. Also, DTX Exchange’s popularity will be fueled by the great perks it offers to traders. All of these combined can take DTX’s price to massive highs very soon! Right now, DTX is in Stage 7 of its public presale, as Stage 6 got sold out in record time. At this stage, you can purchase your DTX tokens at $0.14, but you’ll have to hurry. Stage 7 will end very soon, and Stage 8 will take its place with DTX selling for $0.14. DTX’s price will continue to rise during the presale, launching at $0.20 in the end. Once this happens, experts say DTX’s price rally will begin . They foresee DTX’s price rising by 100x in just a few months after the launch, bringing life-changing gains to holders as it does!

38230577,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106776,1735367603,"Shiba Inu Team Reacts to SHIB 2024 Transformative Journey, Says ‘What a Wonderful Wrap of the Year’","The team behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem publishes the closing edition of The Shib magazine for 2024, reflecting on the transformative journey the cryptocurrency experienced this year. According to the team, 2024 was a year of monumental growth, during which Shiba Inu transitioned from its meme origin into a global crypto powerhouse. This significant feat was driven by strategic partnerships, innovation, community-driven initiatives, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem. Shiba Inu’s 2024 Recap Notably, the magazine provided a recap of Shiba Inu’s major milestones in 2024. SHEboshis NFT Phenomenon Shiba Inu began 2024 in style, with its SHEboshi NFT collection selling out instantly in February. As reported earlier, the 20,000 units of SHEboshi NFTs sold out within five minutes following the launch of Phase 2 of the minting exercise. Shiba Inu’s Partnerships In March, the team behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem partnered with ZAMA to facilitate the integration of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enhance users’ security and privacy. A few months later, the team partnered with D3 to introduce the Shib Name Service (SNS). Through this collaboration, users were able to secure .shib domains in their wallets, reinforcing Shiba Inu’s vision of becoming a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem with enormous utility. Additionally, in February, Shiba Inu announced K9 Finance DAO as its official liquid staking and derivative (LSD) partner. K9 subsequently launched its LSD platform on Shibarium, astronomically boosting the total value locked (TVL) on the blockchain. Earlier this month, the team also partnered with Chainlink to make Shiba Inu tokens, including SHIB, BONE, and LEASH, accessible across 12 blockchains. Team Raises $12M to Build L3 Privacy Blockchain In April, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team stunned many when it announced it raised $12 million from prominent industry players such as Animoca Brands, Polygon Ventures, and Mechanism Capital. The rationale behind the fundraiser was to build a war chest for Shiba Inu in the form of an L3 privacy-focused blockchain. Shibarium Hard Fork and ShibaSwap Upgrade This year, Shiba Inu’s top projects, Shibarium and ShibaSwap, welcomed significant upgrades to enhance their performances. Specifically, Shibarium completed a major hard fork in May and another in December to boost its efficiency and scalability. This month also saw the launch of ShibaSwap 1.5, which transitioned the DEX transition to Shibarium. Notably, the team also launched the highly anticipated ShibaSwap 2.0 a few months later, which introduced features like centralized liquidity pools, a better reward structure, and seamless migration. ShibTorch Launch In August, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team finally launched ShibTorch, the much-awaited automatic burn portal, on Shibarium this year. This project was designed to automatically burn SHIB tokens through every transaction on Shibarium instead of relying on the manual process. Launch of ShibDev Portal and NFT Bridge September was an outstanding month for Shiba Inu, thanks to the launch of the ShibDev portal and NFT Bridge on Shibarium. The ShibDev portal is a platform that provides essential tools for developers to build on Shibarium. On the other hand, the NFT Bridge allows users to bridge NFTs like Shiboshi from Ethereum to Shibarium and vice versa. Other Major Milestones Recorded in 2024 The magazine also highlighted other significant feats achieved this year. They include the launch of different Shiba Eternity tournaments, Shibarium’s first birthday, the TREAT Yourself Tour, the revamp of The Shib magazine, and the Shifu airdrop. In addition, the team launched two new Shiba Inu games, Shiboshi Rush and Agent Shiboshi, and the Shiba Eternity game transitioned to Shibarium. Shiba Inu Team Reacts Reacting to the recap, Shiba Inu’s top developer, Kaal Dhairya, echoed , "" What a wonderful wrap of the year!” This comment reflects his enthusiasm and pride in Shiba Inu’s accomplishments this year. Also, Shiba Inu’s leader, Shytoshi Kusama, expressed excitement about the cryptocurrency’s accomplishment this year. He urged the Shiba Inu community and ecosystem team to maintain momentum and continue striving for success. “Let’s keep it up! Go SHIB! GO!!!!,” Kusama remarked .",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | SHIB | FORKS,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/shiba-inu-team-reacts-to-shib-2024-transformative-journey-says-what-a-wonderful-wrap-of-the-year/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-team-reacts-to-shib-2024-transformative-journey-says-what-a-wonderful-wrap-of-the-year,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38215905,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53282,1735367428,"After Seeing Stellar (XLM) Pump 600%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Are Now Accumulating New PayFi Star Remittix (RTX)","Stellar (XLM) made headlines recently after recording a 600% pump, and crypto enthusiasts started to rethink their portfolios. Wanting to be part of the next big move in the crypto market , Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are now gravitating towards a new player in the PayFi sector— Remittix (RTX) . Financial experts believe Remittix will outperform XLM’s recent meteoric rise as it gains more ground in the $190 trillion payment market. With RTX set to be the next 50x altcoin , it looks to thoroughly outperform SHIB which could increase by more than 240%. Stellar (XLM) Prepares for New Pump After Cooling Off In November, Stellar (XLM) was one of the best altcoins , skyrocketing by more than 600%. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Stellar coin increased from $0.09200 to trade as high as $0.5700. However, XLM has cooled off, dropping back to the $0.380 range. Despite the recent Stellar price action pointing towards bear action, Javon Marks, a top analyst and strategist has said that everything has led to a possible continuation. Marks also confirmed that Stellar (XLM) has formed yet another bullish pattern. According to his analysis, the Stellar crypto will rise to $ $0.681 first. If XLM can hold above this level, it will open up the altcoin price for a bigger increase in the coming weeks. The final target set by Marks for Stellar (XLM) is at $1.2, representing an increase of more than 220% from its current range. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Confirms Bullish Continuation Set for 240% As a result of the recent market correction, $SHIB tumbled from $0.00003400 to retest the support level at $0.00001800. However, the memecoin has bounced off this strong support to reclaim $0.00002300, per CoinMarketCap . This recent Shiba Inu price action has been confirmed to be the beginning of a bullish continuation by Javon Marks. TheMoonCarl has confirmed this, saying that the Shiba Inu coin is ranging within an ascending triangle on the 1W chart. According to his analysis, the conservative target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this bull cycle is around $0.000056. Marks is even more bullish, saying that the Shiba Inu token could well trade as high as $0.000081 in this cycle, a 240% increase from its current range. Why SHIB Investors Are Migrating To Remittix (RTX) While the memecoin could record substantial gains in 2025, it doesn’t compare to Remittix (RTX) , the next 50x altcoin, according to financial experts. The forecasts for RTX, a coin priced at $0.0163, are bullish because of its revolutionary cross-border payment solution. International money transfers are known for being slow, expensive, inefficient, and for most people in the world, unavailable. This issue is taken care of by Remittix which lets anyone send 30+ fiat currencies to any bank account from their cryptocurrency wallets. Remittix allows users to receive 50+ top crypto coins and convert them without any FX fees. It is also faster, cheaper, more reliable, and available to anyone from anywhere on earth. It does this by using Unified Compliance frameworks, advancing the right partnership with global corporations, and tokenizing fiat currencies. Remittix is not just for retail crypto users. Its use case naturally catches the eye of institutional investors who can quickly spur crypto adoption, and Remittix starts climbing up the crypto ladder. The DeFi project has already raised over $650K in its first presale week, highlighting how much interest there is from investors. Can Remittix Outperform Top Altcoins; Stellar and Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders pivoting towards this promising new PayFi project Remittix (RTX) underscores the allure of the new altcoin . Set in a $190 trillion market, RTX looks to score bigger gains than Stellar, with a potential rise of 50x in this bull cycle.

Let’s dive into what makes these coins worth your attention and why they’re the top new meme coins to join this week. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin is rapidly making a name for itself in the crowded meme coin market.

Fantom stands out because of its incredibly fast and scalable blockchain platform, which is perfect for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. While it’s not strictly a meme coin, its growing community and creative branding give it that meme-worthy vibe, making it a worthy contender in this list of top new meme coins to join this week.

Cronos (CRO) Cronos CRO is the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which powers the Crypto.com ecosystem. With its sleek branding and growing adoption, it’s no wonder Cronos has made waves recently. And while it may not scream “meme coin” at first glance, its community’s enthusiasm and dedication give it that playful edge we’re celebrating this week. Cronos’ charm lies in its focus on interoperability and decentralised applications (dApps). The blockchain’s compatibility with Ethereum and Cosmos networks allows it to support a wide range of assets and dApps. That means more opportunities for developers and users alike. And let’s not forget the massive backing from Crypto.com, which gives Cronos a level of credibility and reach that most meme coins can only dream of. But there’s more.

Stellar Stellar has been quietly making waves in the crypto scene for years, but its recent developments have given it a fresh buzz. Known for its focus on financial inclusion, Stellar’s blockchain aims to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible. It’s a noble mission that’s resonated with a growing number of users and investors. What makes Stellar stand out is its partnership with major financial institutions and its integration with traditional banking systems. It’s a bridge between the old and the new, allowing for seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrency. And while it’s not a meme coin in the traditional sense, its simplicity and widespread appeal give it that meme-like charm. Stellar’s ecosystem has also been expanding, with new projects and dApps joining the network. It’s proof that this blockchain isn’t just resting on its laurels; it’s constantly pushing forward. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newbie, Stellar offers a unique blend of innovation and reliability. Why did this coin make it to this list? Stellar’s ability to combine financial innovation with a fun, approachable vibe makes it a standout choice. Its recent developments and growing community show that it’s here to stay.

38230576,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106775,1735366378,"Here’s How Much It Would Cost to Buy 10,000 XRP in 2025 if XRP Rises 133% or 365%","The window to buy XRP at lower prices is fast closing, and 2025 could further constrict this opportunity if XRP manages an additional 133% or 365% rise. Interestingly, XRP has surged beyond the $0.5 average price it traded at for years. Amid this impressive rise to transcend the $0.5 level, XRP essentially closed up the window to procure it below the $1 mark . The altcoin accomplished this with a 284% spike in November, soaring from $0.5089 to $1.95. Meanwhile, in December, it has increased by an additional 10.68% despite the ongoing consolidation, now trading above the $2 mark.Despite the November push, analysts believe the uptrend is not yet over. As a result, XRP's current price might still represent a discount in comparison to the projected values for 2025 . With XRP currently trading for $2.15, if an investor looks to purchase 10,000 XRP now, he will need to spend $21,500.Cost of 10,000 XRP if XRP Rises 133% or 365% in 2025However, this would not be the case if XRP hits the price projections for 2025. For instance, while some market watchers have projected a rise to $5 , possibly in 2025, others expect a more ambitious surge to the $10 mark . At the current price, XRP would need to rise 133% to reach $5 and by a more substantial 365% to claim $10. Interestingly, if XRP ever claims the $5 price, the amount necessary to procure 10,000 XRP tokens would skyrocket. Notably, at $5, it would cost an investor up to $50,000 to accumulate 10,000 XRP tokens. The $50,000 figure represents an addition of $28,500 to the current rate of $21,500. Meanwhile, if XRP surges further to $10 next year, as some predict, this figure will increase further to $100,000. This marks an additional $78,500 to amass the same 10,000 XRP tokens.Notably, even the current $21,500 figure represents an increase from previous years but remains largely lower than possible rates in 2025 should XRP claim some of its price projections. Cost of 10,000 XRP Over the YearsFor instance, XRP consistently traded around the $0.5 price level for years. Notably, the altcoin observed persisted woes after correcting from the April 2021 peak of $1.96. XRP first collapsed to $0.51 in July 2021, and, after a mild recovery, slumped further to the $0.2 price region in mid 2022 following the Terra collapse.From this point, the altcoin underperformed, ranging between $0.3 and $0.6, with an average trading price of $0.5 for more than two years. It managed to hold above $0.60 for a few months in 2024 but performed worse than most other leading assets.This period presented a massive opportunity for investors to procure XRP at discounted prices, but most market participants forfeited the opportunity. Despite calls from several market analysts that an XRP breakout was imminent, accumulation was largely subdued. To put things into perspective, at the end of December 2020, XRP traded for $0.2195. During this period, procuring 10,000 XRP would have cost $2,195. Further, at the close of December 2021, XRP changed hands at $0.8294. With this price, it would have cost $8,294 to buy 10,000 tokens.Meanwhile, amid the 2022 bear market, XRP saw a price of $0.3390 at the end of December 2022. An investor would have spent $3,390 to amass 10,000 XRP here. However, in December 2023, XRP had risen to $0.61, necessitating an investment of $6,100 to get 10,000 tokens.Now, with XRP trading for $2.15, it would take a whopping $21,500 to get the same amount of XRP tokens. If XRP hits some of its price targets for next year, this figure might increase considerably by December 2025.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/heres-how-much-it-would-cost-to-buy-10000-xrp-in-2025-if-xrp-rises-133-or-365/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-it-would-cost-to-buy-10000-xrp-in-2025-if-xrp-rises-133-or-365,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

38214731,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399138,1735365851,Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close?,"The post Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin bulls have switched to the passive mode as they cannot exert enough pressure even in times of a drop in selling volume. This indicates a lack of interest among the market participants, as bears also remain inactive. In such a scenario, an extended pullback usually attracts buying volume and as a result, the last week of the year may attract another 10% to 12% loss, pushing the token under the bearish influence. Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure: Key Support Levels to Watch for Year-End The BTC trading volume has surged to some extent compared to the past couple of days, which suggests the volatility could pick up during the weekend. The star token continued to break the supports after failing to secure levels above the resistance, weakening the bulls to some extent. In such a case, the possibility of recovery could be only if the token manages to trade above the pivotal support of around $92,000, which may lay the foundation for the trade in 2025. The BTC price displays some possibility of a bullish rebound as it heads towards the lower support of the falling wedge. The two levels to watch at the moment are $95,767 and $93,211, which are the 50-day SMA & EMA, respectively, acting as interim resistance and support. Breaking any of these levels may have a huge impact on the yearly close, as a rise above the resistance could initiate an early breakout above the falling wedge. Besides, a drop below the support could drag the levels close to the support at $92,109 and collide with the descending trend line as well. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 28 , The RSI is decremental, which indicates the trend could remain under bearish influence, activating the lower targets. Therefore, if the Bitcoin price fails to initiate a recovery to $100K during the weekend, a bearish signal could be confirmed with the support lying between $71,000 and $81,000 while long-term support being around $65,000. Hence, these targets could be activated only if the token closes the weekly trade below the pivotal range of around $92,200, delaying a new ATH for several weeks. BTC Price Action Therefore, considering the current price action, it appears that the range between $80,000 and $85,000 could be a good buyback range, which could offer a good long-term opportunity for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin's 133% YTD performance and potential for further gains make it a compelling investment, despite its historical volatility and downside risks. The incoming Trump administration's potential National Bitcoin Reserve and favorable regulatory backdrop could serve as significant bullish catalysts in 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way to gain bitcoin exposure with lower transaction costs, and its growing AUM and trading volume reflect strong investor interest. Wall Street’s crystal balls are out in full force. With just a few trading days left in 2024, S&P 500 price forecasts are generally bullish (for the first time in three years) while prognostications for bitcoin are likewise sanguine. According to data gathered by Bitwise, the average 2025 price target for bitcoin is above $170,000. Of course, this is not as pure of a sellside look compared to SPX targets since not all of the big banks produce bitcoin forecasts and there are some small companies with vested interests in bitcoin growth also putting out forecasts. Still, it’s clear that bullishness around bitcoin remains in full force after a 133% year-to-date performance, making bitcoin the top sub-asset class of the year. I produced Seeking Alpha’s first analysis of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) back in January. It has grown to become the largest spot bitcoin ETF. I was neutral on IBIT back then, but turned bullish in the second quarter – that's when I bought the fund. While others have a much lower bitcoin cost basis, I see upside looking ahead to 2025 after the recent pullback from $108,000. 2025 Bitcoin Price Targets André Dragosch, PhD | Bitcoin & Macro YTD Asset Returns: Bitcoin Leads Goldman Sachs According to the issuer, IBIT seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin. The ETF enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. IBIT has been the most traded bitcoin exchange-traded product since its launch, providing investors with potentially lower transaction costs. IBIT has grown massively from its January inception. Total assets under management is now $53 billion, with increased volume since the start of the fourth quarter. Its annual expense ratio is low at 0.12%, though BlackRock notes that after the 12-month waiver period that began on January 11, 2024, the Sponsor’s Fee will be 0.25%. Share-price momentum has been very strong this year, though there have been bouts of volatility and drawdowns that shareholders of the ETF needed to stomach. I expect more volatility next year. Of course, IBIT does not pay a dividend , but I recently pointed out that there is a liquid covered-call bitcoin ETF: the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT) which I had a nearer-term hold rating on back when bitcoin was above $100,000 per token. IBIT is a risky ETF given its historical standard deviation trends, but liquidity is strong . Average daily volume is north of 25 million shares, while its 30-day median bid/ask spread is tight at just two basis points, per iShares. Turning to my opinions on bitcoin and why I’m optimistic about the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, take a look at the below graph. After gold’s 2024 rally, bitcoin is just 11% of gold’s market cap. I assert that there’s a runway for bitcoin to approach gold in total value. If that were the case, then bitcoin could eventually approach the $1 million mark. That would take years, in my view, but we have seen that bitcoin rallies can be intense. Bitcoin Still A Small Asset Compared to Gold In Gold We Trust Report It’s important to be realistic about returns and volatility, though. While bull runs in bitcoin have resulted in thousands of percentage points of gains, drawdowns have typically been on the order of 70% or more. So, prospective investors must be aware of the significant downside risk that’s possible. Recognize the Risk: Bitcoin Drawdowns Have Been Intense Koyfin Charts A potential bullish catalyst in 2025 is the so-called National Bitcoin Reserve that could be put in place by President-elect Trump. As it stands, there’s an implied 58% chance that it will be created before January 1, 2026. That’s a key variable – if it’s effectively constructed, then there would likely be added demand for bitcoin. High Hopes for a Bitcoin Reserve Kalshi With a favorable regulatory backdrop given the incoming administration and a new SEC chairperson set to take over in January, let’s also analyze historical seasonal trends. January has typically been a solid month for the token. The average gain since 2011 has been 12% with a median first-month return of 5%. Fifty-seven percent of Januarys have been up. For Q1 as a whole, it’s the only quarter with positive mean returns for each of the three months. So, seasonality is generally bullish right now. Bitcoin: Bullish Q1 Seasonal Trends Barchart The Technical Take With optimism on the sellside, a still-modest value compared to gold, some bullish political catalysts in the new year, and sanguine seasonals, the technical situation is decent. Notice in the chart below that bitcoin has pulled back from its all-time high above $108,000. The rally to triple digits came on weaker RSI momentum, which was a bearish harbinger. For now, I see support in the low $90,000s and just above $85,000. If it drops below those levels, then a retest of the March 2024 highs near $74,000 could be in play. But take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average – its slope is positive, which shows that the bulls control the primary trend, Bitcoin turned extended versus the 200dma earlier this month, so I see the current pullback as healthy. Moreover, the RSI momentum gauge has not turned oversold, which is another sign that the bears have not gained a whole lot of traction. On the upside, if we take the $55,000 range from late 2021 through earlier this year, and add that on top of the $74,000 breakout point, then we arrive at a ballpark target of near $129,000. Bitcoin: Bullish Long-Term Breakout Targets $120-$130k Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on IBIT. I own the fund, and I see further upside in 2025. I encourage fellow investors and prospective investors to recognize that IBIT and bitcoin will likely be highly volatile in the next 12 months as macro news, namely concerning developments with the Trump administration, could be up and down. But with some upside catalysts next year and positive seasonals and technicals, the bullish factors outweigh the bearish risks.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746746-bitcoins-bullish-q1-trends-bode-well-for-ibit-upgrading-to-buy-ahead-of-2025?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38214705.jpeg
38214689,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399127,1735365765,Dogecoin Millionaire Bets Big on a Real Estate Altcoin Set to Outpace DOGE by Q2 2025,"The post Dogecoin Millionaire Bets Big on a Real Estate Altcoin Set to Outpace DOGE by Q2 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has long held a unique position in the crypto market, capturing the hearts of investors with its meme-driven charm and loyal community. Yet, as the market matures, some prominent DOGE enthusiasts focus on projects with more tangible use cases. One such enthusiast is a prominent Dogecoin millionaire who is now betting big on a new real estate altcoin, PCHAIN , that promises to revolutionize the property investment landscape. This altcoin aims to democratize access to the $600 trillion global real estate market using blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. With the Dogecoin price struggling in recent months, top market analysts strongly believe this real estate altcoin could emerge as the next big winner, outpacing DOGE’s gains by Q2 2025. The Dogecoin millionaire’s move has sparked widespread interest in the crypto community, as this real estate altcoin presents a compelling alternative to meme-based investments. The altcoin seeks to bridge the gap between digital assets and tangible wealth creation by focusing on real-world applications. The Dogecoin Millionaire and the Quest for the Next Big Break in the Crypto Market This prominent DOGE millionaire turned a modest $10,000 investment in DOGE into over $2 million during its rally to $0.73 in May 2021. Riding on the enthusiasm of the “Doge Army” and tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, this DOGE millionaire epitomized the kind of success story that draws many to the crypto market. However, since its peak, DOGE has faced challenges. Its price has fluctuated significantly, losing much of its momentum. For the Dogecoin millionaire, DOGE’s declining momentum marked the beginning of a new search for the next big thing break in the crypto market. The DOGE millionaire has identified a real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, with the potential to outpace Dogecoin come Q2 2025. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform using cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the real estate industry. Unlike Dogecoin, whose value is driven primarily by hype and social media momentum, this real estate altcoin is backed by real-world assets and an innovative ecosystem poised to disrupt the $600 trillion global real estate market. With the clock ticking toward 2025, this DOGE millionaire believes this real estate altcoin will live up to its potential and leave Dogecoin in its shadow. The Dogecoin Millionaire’s Reason for Betting Big on the Real Estate Altcoin While explaining the rationale behind his huge investment in the real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, the DOGE millionaire, said, “Dogecoin was a phenomenal ride, but it’s primarily driven by hype and sentiment. I’m now looking for projects with real-world utility and long-term growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) ticks all the boxes.” The millionaire has reportedly allocated about 50% of his portfolio to PCHAIN, which he believes positions him for significant returns by Q2 2025. “Real estate is a multi-trillion-dollar market, and tokenization is the future. I’m confident that PropiChain will outpace DOGE in terms of market cap and adoption by Q2 2025,” he added. According to analysts, PropiChain’s growth potential is significant, given the global real estate market’s size. By tapping into this massive industry, this real estate altcoin has the opportunity to establish itself as a cornerstone of blockchain-based real estate transactions, further reinforcing the DOGE millionaire’s belief in the crypto token. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the global real estate sector with state-of-the-art technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, blockchain-based tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), and smart contracts.

PCHAIN’s blockchain-powered tokenization of real-world assets represents a transformative shift in the real estate industry. By converting physical property assets into digital tokens, the platform facilitates fractional ownership, enabling individuals with small capital to purchase fractions of high-value properties. This inclusive strategy opens doors to premium real estate markets for a broader audience and attracts a more diverse pool of investors. In addition, PropiChain enhances operational efficiency through the use of smart contracts, which automate key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals. These automated solutions reduce reliance on intermediaries, cutting costs and saving time while increasing the transparency and efficiency of real estate transactions. PCHAIN’s innovative approach sets new standards for accessibility, efficiency, and innovation in the real estate sector. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire’s bet on PCHAIN for its potential to outpace DOGE in 2025 underscores the prospect and profit potential of PropiChain.

38215904,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53296,1735365747,“XRP will dominate 2025” Analyst Claims. Here’s why,"A recent tweet by prominent cryptocurrency analyst BarriC has generated significant discussion within the XRP community . The analyst predicts substantial growth for XRP in 2025, suggesting that the current period offers a valuable accumulation opportunity. This article will analyze BarriC’s claims, considering supporting factors and recent market activity. XRP To Dominate 2025 BarriC’s tweet asserts that XRP will “dominate 2025.” This prediction is coupled with a specific timeframe for accumulation, suggesting that the current price range of $2-$2.30 in 2024 represents a “cheap” entry point. The analyst pinpoints the second week of January 2025 as the beginning of a significant “alt season,” implying widespread growth across alternative cryptocurrencies, with XRP leading the charge. $XRP will dominate 2025 That gives everyone a few days left to accumulate #XRP at the cheap price of $2-$2.30 in 2024 Once we get to the second week of January 2025 we will experience the beginning of the biggest alt season anyone has ever seen That’s when we see the next god… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) December 25, 2024 This period is expected to culminate in what the analyst describes as a “god candle” for XRP, signifying a large and rapid price increase, ultimately pushing the asset into double-digit valuations. Anticipated Regulatory and Political Shifts Two major factors have been cited to support this optimistic outlook. The inauguration of a new U.S. administration and the anticipated departure of Gary Gensler from his position as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The change in political leadership in the United States and a change of leadership at the SEC could potentially usher in a more favorable regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, including XRP. The context of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs is crucial here. The outcome of this legal battle has had a direct impact on XRP’s price and market performance. If the change in administration and at the SEC results in clearer regulations or a shift in the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies, it could be viewed positively by the market and potentially contribute to a price increase for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of Whale Accumulation In addition to these factors, recent market activity strengthens the case for a potential price surge. Crypto investor Armando Pantoja recently highlighted substantial whale accumulation of XRP. According to Pantoja, 50 million XRP was acquired by whales in a single weekend. Pantoja’s commentary on this activity, stating that “They move in silence before the storm,” suggests that these large investors are strategically positioning themselves for an anticipated upward price movement. Whale accumulation is often interpreted as a bullish signal, as it demonstrates significant investment and confidence from major market participants. Large-volume purchases can impact the market and can be a sign of increased confidence and market participation. While regulatory developments and whale activity can provide valuable insight, they do not guarantee specific outcomes.

38214619,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667815,1735365634,Is The Tide Turning For Bitcoin? Recent Reserves And Netflows Indicate Market Reversal,"Analysts from the market intelligence company CryptoQuant note that current patterns in Bitcoin (BTC) metrics indicate possible changes in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Faces Short-Term Volatility After a period of steady decline, spot exchange reserves have experienced a notable uptick, reflecting an inflow of 20,000 BTC. This increase suggests that more Bitcoin is being deposited into exchanges, which often indicates an intention to trade or sell. This type of behavior may add further selling pressure to the Bitcoin price, which has declined almost 7% over the last two weeks, signaling a potential early sign of short-term volatility. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Hold Ground: Another Drop Incoming? Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges have turned positive, with a net increase of 15,800 BTC. This reversal from the predominantly negative trend seen in recent weeks implies that inflows to exchanges are now exceeding outflows. When combined with rising reserves, this shift strengthens the likelihood of increased trading activity or profit-taking by investors, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis. While the broader trend in the market has favored accumulation and self-custody, these recent changes may reflect a growing caution among investors, who might be preparing for profit-taking or bracing for a potential price correction. Furthermore, a report by Bloomberg highlights a key metric gauging investor interest in Bitcoin from South Korea, which has risen to a four-month high amid ongoing political turmoil in the East Asian country. Trading Volumes Surge As Political Crisis Unfolds Known as the “Kimchi Premium,” this metric measures the price gap between Bitcoin on South Korean exchange Upbit and Coinbase. Recently, this premium surged to the range of 3-5%, indicating heightened demand from South Korean investors. Per the report, the political landscape in South Korea has been tumultuous, particularly following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief and controversial declaration of martial law earlier this month, which lasted only six hours before being rescinded. Subsequently, the National Assembly impeached Yoon on December 14, suspending his powers and elevating Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to the role of acting president. In a further development, the parliament voted to impeach Han as well, marking a historic first for an acting president in South Korea. These political upheavals have rattled financial markets, coinciding with growing economic challenges and increasing nuclear threats from North Korea. The South Korean won has also seen a decline of 0.35% against the US dollar. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Setting For a Big Move – Breakout Or Downturn? According to Bloomberg, South Korea remains one of the most active retail markets for cryptocurrencies, with trading volumes on Korea-based exchanges often surpassing those on traditional stock exchanges. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that corporate accounts are not permitted on Korean crypto exchanges, meaning that the vast majority of crypto activity in the country is driven by retail investors. The Kimchi Premium has become a well-known metric for measuring retail interest in cryptocurrency, and factors such as strict currency controls and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations have contributed to this phenomenon. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $93,938, experiencing a 2.5% decrease over the last 24 hours, with its closest support level at $92,000 serving to halt additional declines for the top cryptocurrency in the market.

Starting in 2027, DeFi platforms will have to collect user trading information, issue tax forms, and provide customer details like names and addresses. This rule is meant to make digital asset taxes similar to traditional ones. However, some experts worry that this could be tough for decentralized platforms since they don’t have centralized entities to collect this data. This change is part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but it’s facing opposition from crypto groups. Why Experts are Against the Rule? Crypto industry leaders are pushing back against the IRS’s new rule that treats decentralized exchanges (DeFi platforms) like traditional brokers. Uniswap’s Chief Legal Officer, Katherine Minarik, and CEO, Hayden Adams, both argue that the rule should be challenged, with Adams hoping it will be rejected through the Congressional Review Act. Yep, @CampbellJAustin beat me to it.

Moreover, Legal experts like Bill Hughes from Consensys argue the rule offers “all cost, no benefit,” adding that it will create significant hurdles without offering clear advantages.

Regulatory changes and a crypto-friendly SEC leadership could enhance Bitcoin ETF efficiency, making IBIT more appealing and reducing costs for investors. Short-term volatility persists, but demand-supply dynamics and miners' HODLing behavior support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and IBIT by 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way for investors to gain crypto exposure without direct ownership hassles, benefiting from BlackRock's management and liquidity. After a 15% dive from its mid-December peak of $60.7, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) trades around $53.5. It has heftily outperformed the S&P 500 this year, showing crypto's resiliency in a highly volatile year, as highlighted by the orange chart below. seekingalpha.com After the election of a crypto-friendly President and powerful rhetoric like elevating Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to become a national reserve asset, its value crossed the psychological $100K level about two weeks back. However, Jerome Powell's subsequently making unfavorable comments about the Fed's ability to hold digital assets, and sounding hawkish on monetary policy did send prices lower. In such a context, while volatility risks should persist in the short term, this thesis aims to paint a bullish outlook for 2025 based mainly on demand-supply economics. Also, after recent comments by one of the SEC’s commissioners, there is likely to be a policy shift towards crypto which may enhance BTC's appeal and improve the tracking efficiency of ETFs investing in the digital asset. Changes in Crypto Regulations Could Benefit IBIT First, looking at the leadership change at the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the current Chair Gary Gensler is preparing to vacate his position. While he can be credited with approving several Bitcoin ETFs in January this year, this came only after he faced legal pressure. For this matter, a U.S. appeal court ruled in favor of Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF in August 2023, a move that was initially opposed by U.S. regulators. Therefore with Gensler's departure, there are expectations of a more supportive regulatory environment for crypto investments. This is especially so because Paul Atkins who has been nominated by President-Elect Trump as his replacement has experience in financial services including crypto and regulatory compliance since he served as one of the SEC's commissioners from 2002 to 2008. Also, he currently leads Patomak Global Partners, a financial compliance consultancy company, and is co-chair of the Token Alliance , an industry-led initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Since the alliance focuses on connecting crypto exchanges with blockchain projects, it shows Atkins' commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain-based payment world. Tellingly, this is an area where the U.S. is behind other developed countries, and, in addition to providing more balanced regulatory oversight (in contrast to his predecessor), Mr. Atkins possesses the qualifications necessary for making sweeping changes. Thus, from strict regulation , regulators may be more open to deep crypto-related regulatory changes, a possibility supported by Commissioner Hester Peirce who indicated that under new leadership, the SEC may revise key decisions on crypto ETFs and in-kind redemptions . Well, these would allow ETF investors to redeem (sell) their shares for the underlying digital asset, for example, Bitcoin instead of going through cash. In other words, in-kind redemptions could enable the exchange of ETF shares for crypto, which could then be transferred to a wallet. This is also synonymous with more efficient transactions and eliminates costs (trading and taxation) associated with cash transactions for those wishing to convert their Bitcoins to ETF shares As a result, this can improve tracking efficiency or the degree to which an ETF's market price is aligned with its NAV. In this way, IBIT can track Bitcoin price movements more closely potentially reducing the 20% performance gap as shown below. seekingalpha.com Looking further, direct exchanges of ETF shares for crypto could potentially enhance liquidity in the ecosystem, in turn leading to lower costs for fund managers namely by avoiding the buy/sell spreads normally associated with converting Bitcoins to cash. Consequently, if these cost savings are passed on to investors, in-kind redemptions could lead to lower expense ratios, but this ultimately depends on the funds' structure and objectives. Volatility Risks are likely to Persist in the short term but Therefore, innovation, whereby Bitcoin is used for purposes other than storing value, can lead to more demand while in-kind redemption can increase efficiency gains in turn increasing the appeal of spot ETFs like IBIT. However, this cannot happen overnight or just by changing one rule. The reason is in-kind redemption introduces other challenges like having sufficient Bitcoin liquidity (compared to cash before), especially during volatile market conditions. The reason is a liquid market reduces the bid-ask spread and increases the efficiency of the trading experience each time there is a transaction, or a buy at the offer or sell at the bid. Also, for the mechanism to function well, the custody risks associated with transferring large volumes have to be addressed to avoid incidents like the Ronin Network hack (2022) involving $600 million worth of coins being lost. In the same vein, using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow people to transact directly should also incorporate risk mitigation strategies because of scams and hacks and millions of dollars of losses suffered. Therefore, it may take some time before crypto-friendly measures are implemented and in the meantime, due to high expectations, there may be further volatility, a possibility supported by the price situated below the 10-day moving average and the RSI of 55 being overbought territory at the time of writing (chart below). The momentum (www.seekingalpha.com) However, looking beyond the short term, as far as Bitcoin trades above the $80K break-even level, miners who are essential components of the ecosystem as the producers of digital assets should continue to stay profitable. Demand-supply economics is Favorable to Digital Asset Prices This suggests they can obtain relatively more cash per Bitcoin they sell on the open market to finance their operations, in turn allowing them to HODL or hold more coins in their treasuries, thereby reducing supply. Ultimately, this supports digital asset prices. On the other hand, Jerome Powell has said that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoins, which somewhat goes against Trump’s intent of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This may have reduced crypto allure in the minds of some investors and possibly contributed to BTC falling off its mid-December peak of $106K. Another contributory factor that also negatively impacted the broader market is interest rates likely to stay higher longer in 2025 as the fight against inflation lingers on. This makes the cost of capital dearer for miners planning to refinance or invest in new and more efficient equipment. Thus, in case asset prices fall further, miners may be constrained to sell more Bitcoins, resulting in more supply and pressurizing prices. However, this is currently not the case with a top crypto analyst stating that the BTC market is increasingly dominated by the HODLing sentiment since miners believe its value will go higher. Now, in the rapidly shifting dynamics of the crypto market, miners HODLing their Bitcoins is key as it means less supply is likely to reach the markets, implying that as long as demand is sustained, asset prices could rise. To come up with an estimate, I consider that currently, Bitcoin hovers around the $96K level which is near my prediction of $95.4K calculated some six weeks earlier in my previous thesis on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ). At that time, I used a multiplier of 9.18%, a figure obtained after accounting for past inflows, liquidity conditions, and price elasticity. Again, using the same multiplier and incrementing BTC's current value of 96K by 9.18%, I obtain a target of $104.8K or roughly $105K. Making the case for an investment in IBIT, Amid Volatility Now, by holding Bitcoin directly, IBIT tracks the digital asset's price movements closely. Thus, its shares should also gain, but, this time, I multiply its current share price of $53.5 by 7.34% (or 80% of 9.18%) to take into account IBIT's approximately 20% of deviation from Bitcoin's price. Hence, I obtained a target of $57.4, which represents only a modest upside of around 7% but is justified because of the risks. www.ishares.com One of these could be momentum-related or failure to sustainably break through the key resistance level of $100K, thereby causing selling pressure. Second, Bitcoin remains rate-sensitive not only because higher borrowing costs impact the finances of miners as mentioned earlier but also because higher interests could shift investor mindset to becoming more risk-averse. Thus, they could dump riskier digital assets like Bitcoin alongside growth stocks like tech and flock to value stocks. Third, with the investment products around BTC growing in sophistication, hackers may be tempted to target more vulnerable components of the ecosystem including crypto wallets, and exchanges. Talking of exchanges, any occurrence of an FTX-style scandal can be highly detrimental to the trust factor. Fourth, any news update about Bitcoin used for illicit activities as earlier emphasized by Gensler may undermine regulatory efforts to bring changes, especially innovation. Still, we are at a uniquely favorable juncture for Bitcoin with a Republican- controlled Congress , increasing crypto ownership among Americans, ETF-led adoption, and strong network effects, implying the cryptocurrency can rise further. Add to this drastically lower Bitcoin issuance, or the number of units awarded to miners which has dropped to around 412 daily from 943 before the April halving, implying more scarcity. Equally important, a more favorable regulatory environment could increase the efficiency of ETF transactions and reduce costs. For this purpose, IBIT is already trusted by many who want crypto exposure but without enduring the hassles of direct ownership, such as subscribing to an exchange and owning a wallet. Finally, another advantage is it is managed by giant asset manager BlackRock ( BLK ) and comes with better liquidity and trading volumes given its sizable assets under management. This is more than 2.5 times higher than its two closest peers Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) as shown below, making it easier for large investors to enter or exit positions. www.seekingalpha",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746745-ibit-potential-upside-based-on-less-supply-and-crypto-friendly-regulations?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38214323.jpeg

The pullback may be scary to some, but that’s just what happens in the crypto market. As these coins go through hard times, savvy investors are turning to Lunex Network and its trailblazing presale. This project is turning heads and has an explosive potential that would see it rise to unprecedented levels. That is why many have dubbed it the fastest growing crypto token today. Lunex Network Presale Keeps Soaring Higher Lunex Network is a brand new presale that is shaking things up pretty well right now. Even though it debuted just a couple of months ago, it has raised over $5.5 million from investors. In addition to that, 2.5 trillion tokens have been sold in the presale, since everyone wants a piece of it. The major reason investors are going in on Lunex is its potential for accelerated growth. The protocol champions crypto swaps across multiple blockchain networks, which is a groundbreaking feature in the DEX arena. To top that, Lunex favors community growth and development. This is evident in its staking rewards and revenue sharing strategies. Lunex tokens are purchased from the open market and a portion of this is shared amongst LNEX holders as staking rewards. In this manner, LNEX rewards loyal holders and simultaneously fosters a strong community. These features combine to paint a stellar future for the project. The Lunex presale is available for $0.0048 but it is billed to appreciate by 800% before the presale ends. This is why several experts have called it the fastest growing crypto of the moment. Will Chainlink Price Weather The Crypto Storm? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that is very important for the efficient execution of smart contracts. But this has not spared Chainlink price from the latest market correction. LINK has shed just about 15% from its peak in early December and now consolidates around $242. Despite the current slump, analysts still have a positive outlook for Chainlink. Technical indicators continue to show bullish LINK predictions. Given Chainlink’s importance to smart contracts, there’s a good chance of a LINK resurgence. Toncoin Slides Dangerously After November Boom TON is the native token of the Telegram Open Network (TON), and its November rally has drawn genuine interest from investors. But since the last market correction, Toncoin has shed significant portions of its value, and TON holders are starting to get concerned. To put things into perspective, TON fell by as much as 15% over the last couple of weeks and it has been on a downward trend since the market correction. Despite the temporary setback, experts maintain conservative optimism about TON’s future. But it’s better to take this optimism with a pinch of salt. Join the fastest growing crypto train Owing to their struggles after the last market correction, investors aren’t too keen on TON and Chainlink. This dip didn’t affect Lunex Network since it’s a crypto presale, and that is why it is a highly recommended investment option. Lunex Network is starting a revolutionary movement, and it’s only a matter of time before it goes viral. Joining the Lunex train before it hits the limelight could fetch investors profits in excess of 10,000%. No one should miss out on it.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

CIFR's strategic growth includes significant capacity increases in Texas, with new facilities like Black Pearl and Stingray, enhancing mining efficiency and computational power. Despite cash burn concerns, CIFR's low production costs and high gross margins position it well to capitalize on the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market. I upgrade CIFR to a ""Buy"" due to its growth potential in Bitcoin, AI, and HPC markets, though investors should expect high volatility. Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is currently working towards strengthening its positioning among Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and high-performance computing [HPC] infrastructure. To this end, CIFR focuses on obtaining low-cost energy and operational efficiencies as it builds its data center capacity. CIFR’s growing mining fleet is also adapting to the challenges of the 2024 Bitcoin halving and potentially volatile market conditions. So far, CIFR’s operations have increased with the acquisition and development of new facilities. Its target is to reach 23.5 EH/s by the end of 2025. Similarly, the company believes its business is also a good fit for the emerging AI and HPC market trends. For instance, Meta ( META ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) use CIFR’s infrastructure. So I lean bullish on CIFR’s as it has a low-cost production model backed by secular tailwinds with high Bitcoin prices. More than a Miner: Business Overview Cipher Mining Inc. is a technology and infrastructure company that develops and operates data centers designed for Bitcoin mining. It also uses excedent energy monetization by providing infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence [AI] and High-Performance Computing [HPC] tasks. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Since my previous analysis , CIFR has made surprising progress as it scaled its operations ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin [BTC] halving. This is why CIFR is now able to reap the rewards from those strategic decisions, as Bitcoin mining rewards are now cut by half, which typically heralds a secular bull market in cryptocurrencies. Texas Play: Strategic Growth Moreover, CIFR successfully increased its capacity by 300 MW with its 70-acre Black Pearl facility in Texas. This will essentially increase the efficiency and hash rate it uses to provide its mining and computing services. CIFR’s goal is to reach a production of 23.5 exahash per second [EH/s] by the end of 2025, which would basically make CIFR a leader in its industry. Thus, CIFR’s Black Pearl site’s production will contribute to this goal by enabling more mining rigs and boosting the computational power rate. The data center at the Black Pearl site is under construction and scheduled to be operational in Q2 2025. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Additionally, on November 26, 2024, CIFR announced the acquisition of another 250-acre site in Stingray, West Texas. As you may have noticed, Texas is a sector with low-cost energy resources, which is ideal for CIFR’s business model. The company disclosed it paid $4.1 million upfront and signed the agreement to a variable fee of $1.5 per megawatt-hour [MWh] for five years after the site started operations. The variable cost is linked to the amount of energy CIFR’s installation consumes from the grid. After all, this site is directly connected to the main power grid with an agreement with ONCOR that will be fully supplied by 1H2026. Mining Efficiency and Future Expansion Furthermore, on December 03, 2024, the company recently disclosed that 202 Bitcoins were mined in November. This included 30 Bitcoins mined at joint venture data centers and 13 Bitcoins from excess electricity monetized at $96,542 per Bitcoin. In other words, in that single month, it generated roughly $19.5 million in revenues, which implies an impressive annual revenue run rate of $234.0 million. However, CIFR actually sold 234 Bitcoin to manage its liquidity and still held another 1,383 Bitcoin in its treasury. In fact, it has 258 Bitcoin as collateral to ensure its financial operations. Additionally, CIFR has 76,000 mining rigs deployed, with 12.0 EH/s, which is close to their year-end 2024 target of 13.5 EH/s for bitcoin mining. Likewise, its fleet’s efficiency (energy consumption per terahash) was 20.8 joules per terahash [J/TH], slightly less than the projected value of 18.9 J/TH. So, while CIFR seems to have come in slightly below its internal projections, it’s still benefiting immensely from the ongoing bull market in Bitcoin. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. It’s also worth mentioning that CIFR’s Odessa site has upgrades that should be ready by year-end 2024. If they materialize, it could place its operations among the industry’s most efficient mining fleets. This matters because, together with the Black Pearl site, the new Stingray facility, and a total of 11 sites, CIFR would reach a total power pipeline of 2.6 GW by 2027. Bitcoin and HPC Markets Currently, the Bitcoin mining industry reported record-low hash prices in Q3 2024, which translated into reduced revenues. However, CIFR mitigated these headwinds with its low-cost units, which are as low as $0.027/kWH. This means that in 2024, the company achieved an all-in cost of production for one Bitcoin of approximately $18,162. This production cost implies an extraordinarily favorable ROIC, as Bitcoin trades multiple times higher than that. Note that these costs already include energy, grid fees, and other energy-linked expenses. Moreover, CIFR’s Odessa has the lowest electricity cost per Bitcoin, approximately $17,561. This facility is the company’s primary production hub and contributes around 83% of its Bitcoin mining operations. The rest of its mining comes from joint venture facilities with higher costs than Odessa, with a mean cost per Bitcoin of $22,928. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. CIFR is currently among the leading Bitcoin miners in terms of Bitcoin production costs. For comparison, miners such as the giant Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) had an average electricity cost of $22,000 to $24,000 per BTC. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) had a power-related cost average of around $26,000 . However, RIO has higher than CIFR’s mining costs, averaging approximately $20,000 per BTC. Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) is closer to CIFR because it also aims to be a diversified company that offers HPC workloads. But again, HUT’s costs are around $31,482 per Bitcoin mined as of Q3 2024. Moreover, in hash rate terms, CIFR’s target of 35 EH/s with fleet efficiency of 15 J/TH by year-end 2025 would only strengthen its cost advantage due to low energy costs and operational efficiency. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. According to its latest earnings call , the company plans on expanding its capacity to 927 MW in 2025. For this, it’ll increase by 866 MW with new facilities, like the Black Pearl, as it becomes operational. The increase in capacity from 327 MW in 2024 to 927 MW in 2025 is part of the company’s strategy to grow and produce Bitcoins as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, CIFR is leveraging its large sites, fast energization, and the use of its data centers by major companies like McKinsey, Meta, and Nvidia. In fact, the company believes it can become a key player in the HPC and AI markets. This is why CIFR is actually well-positioned to capitalize on the current power scarcity and support computing loads for these types of corporate tasks. In a way, CIFR’s mining operations give it a unique set of competitive advantages to fulfill those requirements. Diversification with AI and HPC is key because it’ll transform CIFR from a pure-miner play closer to a general computing firm. Mining is highly profitable during a bull market, but AI and HPC are much more stable with recurring revenue streams, which lowers CIFR’s exposure to Bitcoin’s cyclicality. You see, most of CIFR’s data centers, like the Odessa site, have Application-Specific Integrated Circuit [ASIC] mining rigs designed for cryptocurrency mining. However, the newer projects like the Black Pearl and Stingray facilities are developed to support dual purposes including Bitcoin mining and colocation agreements for AI and HPC tenants. Source: CME. These tenants use GPUs and other specialized equipment requiring specific cooling systems, high bandwidth, and redundant power supplies. The company plans to integrate its AI and HPC capacities into its broader 2.6 GW total power potential by 2027, which indicates an emphasis on the new focus of its portfolio. But it also shows its business will be much more flexible going forward. For instance, industry data suggests AI inference workloads can generate $7 in revenue for every $1 spent on GPU over four years. This is likely significantly higher than Bitcoin mining’s ROI during a bear market. So, dedicating a fraction of its capacity to HPC tasks lets CIFR tap into that growing global AI market . Computing demand from that sector is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 37% from 2024 to 2030. It’s also worth highlighting that on December 16, 2024, Bitcoin hit a record-high price of $106,449. For instance, the US elections were a positive catalyst for the price of Bitcoin because President Trump has repeatedly signaled a favorable stance towards this industry. Also, the Fed is on a rate-cutting cycle , which should act as an additional tailwind for asset prices as well. The CME rate probability tool suggests there’s an 82.7% aggregate probability of lower rates by December 2025. In my opinion this will give a macro environment for CIFR’s business. Relatively Cheap: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, CIFR trades at a $1.9 billion market cap. This means the company is no longer a microcap, but I also believe there’s still more room to grow as long as the cryptocurrency secular bull market continues. As of Q3 2024, CIFR’s balance sheet held $25.3 million in cash and short-term investments against no financial debt other than typical operating liabilities. I also see its balance sheet also has $95.5 million worth of Bitcoin. Its equity book value reached $672.0 million, suggesting a P/B of 2.3. This actually appears reasonable compared to its sector’s median P/B of 3.5. Source: Seeking Alpha. According to Seeking Alpha’s dashboard on CIFR, CIFR is projected to generate $301.1 million in revenues by 2025. Naturally, we need to take these projects with a grain of salt because they rely substantially on the price of Bitcoin. As long as the current cryptocurrency bull market continues, it should be a realistic projection, but I believe its long-term revenue growth will be highly volatile because the underlying commodity is highly erratic as well. Investment Caveats and Risk Analysis Nonetheless, $301.1 million in future revenues implies a forward P/S of 6.3. This is actually slightly higher than its sector’s median forward P/S of 3.3. Still, I believe the main metric to track is CIFR’s gross margins, which should capture its Bitcoin production cost relative to the price it realizes when monetizing it. Currently, CIFR’s gross margins stand at 62.3%, which is significantly higher than its sector’s gross margins of 51.0%. However, we can’t ignore that if CIFR’s infrastructure expansion somehow leads to higher production costs, it could hit substantially its margins. Similarly, if the price of Bitcoin declines substantially, it could lead to equally large shareholder losses. Investors need to fully understand that, for now, CIFR remains largely a derivative on the price of Bitcoin itself. In the long run, CIFR’s operations might diversify more into other areas like AI and HPC computing, but for now, it’s still largely a miner and nothing more. As with other mining companies, as long as the underlying commodity rallies, the stock will likely follow as well. But the inverse is also true, so new investors need to understand this is a highly cyclical security by nature. Source: CIFR’s latest 10-Q. Another potential red flag is that CIFR’s cash burn remains persistent despite its secular tailwinds. I estimate CIFR’s trailing nine-month cash burn reached $224.5 million by adding its CFOs and Net CAPEX. This figure includes its intangible asset purchases and Bitcoin sales. Clearly, CIFR has made substantial CAPEX investments expecting to monetize them into 2025, but if the price of Bitcoin declines, it could also lead to massive losses for investors. Source: TradingView. Nevertheless, on balance, I believe it’s fair to lean bullish on CIFR, as it’s focused on growing its operations to capitalize on a multitude of highly promising secular trends (Bitcoin, AI, HPC computing). Hence, I feel it’s fair to upgrade CIFR to a “Buy” for investors who understand this will be a volatile security. “Buy” Upgrade: Conclusion Overall, I believe CIFR has outpaced my initial expectations, which is why I feel it deserves a rating upgrade. In particular, I like its pivot towards potentially diversifying its business in the long run with AI and HPC computing. Also, as long as the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market persists, the company seems well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value. I do have some cash burn concerns, but if Bitcoin rallies more into 2025, then I anticipate CIFR will generate substantial revenues that will allow it to recoup its 2024 CAPEX. Thus, I rate CIFR a “Buy” for investors who understand this is a highly cyclical and volatile stock closely linked to the price of Bitcoin itself.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746743-cipher-mining-capitalizing-on-bitcoin-ai-and-hpc-trends-upgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38213846.jpeg
38214178,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53264,1735363839,Dogecoin Barks Back as Lunex Sparks a Fresh Wave of Investor Confidence,"With over 250% gains in the past year, there’s no doubt that Dogecoin (DOGE) has been having a good time. Dogecoin remains the leading crypto in the meme coin ecosystem. A recent change in fortune has seen the Dogecoin price drop by over 20%, but the Dogecoin bulls are fighting back. Meanwhile, DOGE investors are looking at Lunex Network , a new decentralized finance (DeFi) token, as a viable crypto investment to diversify their portfolios. Currently in presale, Lunex has raised over $5.5 million and there’s more to come. Let’s find out why investors are bullish on the relatively unknown crypto project before launch. A DOGE alternative is a great idea for investors While the numbers look good for DOGE presently, the meme coin faces a challenge – it’s a coin backed by social media hype from influential personalities like Elon Musk. That means a slowdown in its hype could result in less demand for the meme token, especially since competitors like PEPE and WIF have higher gains. That’s why utility-backed assets like Lunex are great options for Dogecoin investors. The Lunex Network is already showing how much utility has on price growth with its presale , which has raised over $5.5 million. What are these use cases? First, the Lunex ecosystem has a cross-chain DEX that supports trading across multiple blockchain networks. With over 50,000 crypto pairs, the DEX prevents liquidity issues for DeFi traders and investors. There’s also a self-custodial wallet to store any of the supported cryptocurrencies. With support for over 40 blockchains and thousands of assets, it’s easy to store and manage funds on a single device. Moreover, Lunex token holders can stake their coins for up to 18% APY. These exciting features make Lunex a great crypto investment for investors. Interestingly, the ongoing presale provides a limited-time opportunity for interested investors to stack up LNEX tokens at a discounted rate of $0.0048. Dogecoin maintains pole position in the meme coin market Dogecoin has been in the news after its year-on-year growth of over 250%. However, the recent price drop in the broader crypto market saw its market cap threatened. After falling into the red zone in the past week, the DOGE price and market cap are now back up. For context, the Dogecoin price is down by about 13% in recent days. However, DOGE bulls have been fighting back, evident through its rebounding price. Similarly, the DOGE market cap has increased by over 3% within the same period per data from CoinMarketCap, reinforcing the coin’s position as the top meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, there’s still a long way to go for DOGE to turn around the losses from the past weeks into gains. Can DOGE reach $1 in 2025? There have been different DOGE price predictions ahead of the new year. Many believe that DOGE will move from its current price of less than $1 to be the next meme coin to reach $1. The optimistic DOGE price prediction makes it a potentially rewarding crypto investment for investors and traders looking for short-term gains. The potential increase will be influenced by factors like Elon Musk and his social media hype, Donald Trump’s new administration, and increased demand for DOGE among traders.

38214176,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53294,1735363582,2.8 Trillion SHIB Transfer Sparks Concerns in Turkey,"A notable transaction involving Shiba Inu (SHIB) has drawn attention within the crypto community. Blockchain tracker Whale Alert detected the transfer of nearly three trillion SHIB tokens, an event linked to BTCTurk, Turkey’s second-largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange. The movement of such a significant amount of SHIB has sparked discussion and speculation about its purpose. Massive SHIB Transaction Uncovered The transaction involved the transfer of 2,884,590,622,344 SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $65.7 million. Whale Alert identified the funds as being moved from BTCTurk to an anonymous wallet. On-chain data reveals that the transfer occurred within the past 17 hours. This movement of one of the most recognized meme coins has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts, with some suggesting it could involve a large holder, or “whale,” moving their assets. BTCTurk, however, clarified that the transfer was part of routine operations. A statement says, “these transfers are fully managed by us, and there is nothing out of the ordinary.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Transactions and Speculation The SHIB transfer was not the only large movement tracked by Whale Alert. The platform also reported three significant Ethereum (ETH) transactions from BTCTurk. These transfers included 23,285 ETH, 20,000 ETH, and another 20,000 ETH, collectively valued at $220 million. BTCTurk explained that these transactions were part of their “wallet optimization efforts.” Despite this clarification, some crypto community members speculated about the nature of these movements, with concerns raised about the possibility of a security breach. The exchange responded to these speculations directly under Whale Alert’s posts, reiterating that the transfers were internal and standard operational procedures. SHIB Metaverse Launches on Shibarium Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu team has made progress on a long-awaited project. The SHIB Metaverse is now accessible for early users through the Shibarium blockchain. This development marks a significant milestone for the SHIB ecosystem after years of preparation by the team, including the pseudonymous leader, Shytoshi Kusama. Users can now connect their wallets to the Metaverse, claim virtual land plots, and explore various features. This virtual environment allows users to construct homes, explore temples, interact with nature, and participate in community-building activities. The launch represents a significant step in expanding the utility of SHIB beyond its meme coin origins. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

38213344,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399095,1735363004,Solana Co-Founder Stephen Akridge Accused of Misusing Ex-Wife’s Crypto Assets,"The post Solana Co-Founder Stephen Akridge Accused of Misusing Ex-Wife’s Crypto Assets appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News According to the Bloomberg report , Stephen Akridge is locked in a legal battle with his ex-wife, Elisa Rossi. She filed some grave charges against Akridge for using her blockchain expertise to take millions of dollars worth of staking rewards from her Solana holdings. According to the lawsuit, Akridge allegedly controlled her crypto accounts between March and May, taking all the staking commissions for himself. The couple ended their 10-year marriage in February 2023. Rossi has filed a lawsuit accusing Akridge of breaking agreements, unfairly benefiting from her money, and committing fraud. She is asking for compensation for the financial losses she says he caused her. Co-founded by Stephen Akridge, along with Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Solana has played a key role in advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies. Akridge, who previously worked at Qualcomm, was a principal engineer at Solana and is now the CEO of Cyber Grant, a cybersecurity company. A Complex Crypto Case The case highlights the challenges of managing crypto assets in personal disputes. Staking rewards are a popular way for crypto holders to earn passive income, with Solana offering annual yields of 5.6% to 12%. Liquid staking platforms like Jito make this even more attractive by allowing users to earn extra rewards through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Community Reactions and Next Steps So far, neither Akridge nor Solana Labs has commented on the allegations. The lawsuit has drawn attention from the crypto community, involving personal and financial disputes tied to the rapidly growing blockchain space. As Solana continues to grow in the DeFi world, this case reminds us of the importance of clear asset management, especially in high-stakes environments like crypto. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled.

38213127,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376077,1735362611,The Top 100 Crypto Assets’ 6 Best Performers in 2024,"Altcoins include all the other Internet currencies secured by cryptographic blockchains, in addition to Bitcoin, which is a seminal and first-in-class cryptocurrency. Their currency market exchange rates can vary with as much volatility as BTC and tend to track along with Bitcoin’s price. In fact, big rallies for BTC tend to lead to major bull runs in altcoin markets as well. Seasoned crypto day and swing traders refer to these movements as “alt season.” While Bitcoin posted a price gain of 121% from New Year’s Day to Christmas Eve this year, the following six altcoins saw increases ranging from 1,249% to a staggering 1.84 million percent for a latecomer to altcoin markets this year that only launched in October. Lower down in this article is the entire list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap ranked in order of gains they delivered from Jan. 1 through Dec. 24 this year. The author calculated these gains by taking the average crypto exchange price on Dec. 24 and dividing it by the average price on Jan. 1. Accordingly, some coins may be more or less profitable to day trade or swing trade than they appear on this list due to their market movements between the beginning and end dates for this calculation. Several of these coins would show much higher percentage gains if the end date were calculated from price peaks that happened earlier in the year. But here are the six that did best for investors who dollar cost average or hold long term. 1. Fartcoin Blew Investors Away This Year Fartcoin now valued at $1.2 Billion – what an explosion! pic.twitter.com/q53MnDbJwh — Barchart (@Barchart) December 24, 2024 The silent but violent creeper rally for Fartcoin blew away crypto markets this year. This hot meme coin is a fresh one. It began to rally right out the gate following its launch in mid-October. Following the November election, however, this Solana Program Library meme coin really ripped. Trump’s reelection saw most crypto markets rally, but Fartcoin posted a 300% gain in a matter of days from Nov. 5 through Nov. 18. Then in December, Fartcoin took another leg up to above $1 by Dec. 19. Now, Fartcoin is poised to run to $2 per token on popular Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Radium and Meteroa VD. What could be behind such a hilarious meme economy? Perhaps it has something to do with the name Trump being a traditional slang term for a—well for—a Bronx cheer. In addition, this meme coin is the latest demonstration of the ease of use, low fees, and high liquidity for issuing new currency on the Solana network. The smart contract Layer 1 blockchain continues neck-and-neck with Ethereum in the race to dominate decentralized finance. From its debut through Dec. 24, Fartcoin’s price posted a percentage gain of 1,847,357%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Who would have thought that a currency named Fartcoin would earn the highest percentage gains of any cryptocurrency in 2024? Anyone who’s been paying attention to the meme coin sector: These ragtag upstarts are decidedly the shock jocks of the digital finance industry. 2. MANTRA Bags Win For RWA Tokenization Several meme coins have flown up the price charts in 2024, but so also have altcoins with specific use cases and direct utility. That’s shown the market’s demand for currencies that power useful applications and artificial intelligence (AI). Mantra continued hitting new ATHs all year, in June, July, and October, and then surged to a major peak in November, which dwarfed all previous records. From January through December, this crypto gained the second most ROI out of any top 100 coin. Mantra’s (OM) crypto token is the currency that powers its Layer-1 blockchain focused on security and optimized for real-world asset tokenization (RWA). The platform is built from the ground up to comply with and enforce real-world regulatory requirements in accounting for real-world assets. Why Mantra’s Price Ratcheted Up In 2024 Launched in Q4 2020, Mantra has come a long way in the meantime. A big part of Mantra OM’s rise this year is its successful attainment of licensing from financial authorities to remain compliant with regulators as it expands to a global user base. Mantra secured licensing from authorities in the United Arab Emirates in addition to its license to operate and provide regulated financial services in Hong Kong. That will help it to become a key player in building a truly global “Internet of Things.” In June, Mantra’s (OM) tokens achieved an all-time high of $1.09. Moreover, this was a remarkable milestone because the rest of the cryptocurrency market was in a slump at the time. That milestone came as a result of a partnership between Mantra and the UAE’s Zand Bank. The two are collaborating to define clear frameworks for RWA tokenization that comply with the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority of Dubai. After that, OM hit another all-time record high in October. That came after Mantra’s price surged more than 60% in under 30 days to nearly $1.50 with a total market cap of $1.2 billion. Overall, Mantra (OM)’s price gained 8,776% on crypto markets from Jan. to Dec. this year. 3. Virtuals Protocol Wins Crypto AI Meta Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is a new Layer-2 decentralized protocol that works across blockchain L1s and the Web 1.0 and 2.0 layers. But its main feature is the tokenized, decentralized creation and management of “AI agents.” These artificially intelligent agents can be deployed from the blockchain to social media apps like Telegram and to online games and metaverses—hence the name Virtuals. As a result of its enormous increases, the token for Virtuals Protocol was the third biggest gainer in 2024. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, VIRTUAL grew in price by 6,068%. 4. Ondo, Another Sweep for RWA Tokenization Markets heavily rewarded real-world asset tokenization in 2024. They also liked currency platforms with other specific, unique, and valuable use cases (think Render token and AIOZ Network). The appearance, however, of not one but two different RWA tokens in the six leading cryptos by ROI in 2024 underscores the promise of this segment. Ondo is another RWA token that saw posted big gains. Ondo tokens allow users to participate in its decentralized autonomous organization and have special perks for users of Flux Finance, which is governed by Ondo DAO. Altcoin traders know that winners tend to win again. Ondo hit new all-time high exchange rates in April , March, and May before doing so again in December . That supported its class-leading gains this year. Ondo’s price increased from Jan. 1 to Dec. 24 by 1,758%. 5. Aerodome Chalks Boon For Decentralized Exchanges Utility and memes hauled the most annual ROI in 2024. Utility strikes again with Aerodome, an automated market maker (AMM) for Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 platform, Base. Aerodrome works by serving Base’s central liquidity hub with a clever liquidity incentive engine governed by a decentralized consensus model. Exchange rates for its AERO tokens took flight this year. Listed on crypto exchanges starting in Aug. 2023, Aerodome (AERO) hit soaring ATHs in Mar. and Apr. this year. The AMM altcoin did it again in Dec.. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, AERO notched 1,672%. 6.

38214175,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53291,1735362471,A new kind of alternative energy source. Del Mar Energy Inc. has patented a new technology,"Del Mar Energy Inc., a recognized leader in advanced energy technologies, has made a significant scientific breakthrough by proposing an innovative approach to energy generation that has the potential to fundamentally change the current energy paradigm. The developed methodology not only solves the problem of global energy supply, but also helps minimize environmental risks associated with traditional energy sources. The company’s key innovation is based on the use of piezoactive materials – complex composites that have the ability to convert mechanical vibrations into electric current. What makes the approach unique is the versatility of the technology, which allows energy to be extracted from a wide range of mechanical influences such as vehicle vibrations, acoustic waves and even human movement. This wide range of applications makes piezoactive materials a promising tool for energy systems of different scales – from stand-alone devices to large infrastructure facilities. At the official presentation, Del Mar Energy Inc.’s CEO, Michael Lattema, emphasized the strategic importance of the development, “We stand at the threshold of a new technological era. Our achievements are not only a scientific breakthrough, but also an opportunity to rethink the role of energy in ensuring the sustainable development of society”. One of the key characteristics of the new technology is its environmental neutrality. The process of producing and using piezoactive materials minimizes dependence on rare earth elements, which helps reduce the carbon footprint and vulnerability of global supply chains. In addition, an energy generation system based on these materials creates virtually no waste, making it environmentally friendly. Potential applications of the technology are already being actively discussed in expert circles. For example, it is proposed to use piezoactive materials in road surfaces, where energy can be generated by mechanical effects from vehicle traffic. Additionally, research is underway to integrate the technology into the architecture of energy-efficient buildings, which could partially power themselves through vibrations caused by wind loads or operational activity. Renewable energy experts praise the potential of this invention. Edward Hoffman, a professor of energy systems at Harvard University, said, “The technology proposed by Del Mar Energy Inc. opens new perspectives for the transition to sustainable energy. If it can be scaled and integrated into existing infrastructure, it will significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels.” The company intends to launch pilot projects in three key markets – North America, Europe and Asia. Successful completion of testing will pave the way for mass adoption of the technology in the coming decades. Del Mar Energy Inc. estimates that their development will become an integral element of the global energy system based on the principles of sustainability and efficiency. Del Mar Energy Inc.’s achievement represents an outstanding example of the synergy of scientific research and innovative technologies aimed at solving global challenges. The company encourages the international community of scientists and engineers to collaborate to create an energy ecosystem capable of ensuring a sustainable future for all.

38230575,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106771,1735362304,"Analyst Says XRP Pullback Shows Completion of Wave 4, Expects Wave 5 to Lead to $5","Mr. Xoom, a notable market analyst, believes the ongoing XRP pullback culminates in the completion of Elliott Wave 4. He mentioned this in a recent analysis amid the persistent market collapse. It bears mentioning that the broader crypto market has been in a bearish phase for most of December despite occasional recovery efforts. XRP is one of the victims of this turbulence, unable to transcend the $2 price level since recovering it on Dec. 1 for the first time in seven years. It suffered a pullback after reaching a peak of $2.9 on Dec. 3 and has consolidated since then.XRP About to Complete Wave 4In his recent disclosure , Mr. Xoom says this ongoing bearish consolidation represents the fourth wave of an extensive Elliott Wave structure.For context, his chart shows that XRP completed Wave 1 in September 2024 and traded within Wave 2 from September to November 2024. Meanwhile, the bullish Wave 3 began in early November following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. This Wave 3 ended with XRP's run to $2.9 in early December. XRP 1D Chart | Mr Xoom As the pullback and consolidation ensued, Wave 4 took form. Mr. Xoom believes XRP is about to complete this current wave amid a price drop to the $2.14 region. Once the Wave 4 concludes, the next wave would be a bullish one, which the bulls could leverage to recover the losses from Wave 4.Data from the chart also highlights a descending channel as XRP followed the trajectory of Wave 4. With Wave 4 on the verge of completion, XRP appears to be at the apex of the channel. The start of Wave 5 could trigger a rally that would allow the asset to breach the upper trendline of the channel.Wave 5 Could Push XRP Price to $5Mr. Xoom expects this Wave 5-based rally to push prices to $5, representing a new all-time high and a 133% increase from the current price. However, he insists that this $5 is conservative. Earlier this month, market commentator Vincent Van Code predicted XRP to claim this $5 by February 2025.The current market condition places XRP in a position to record higher gains once the broader market recovers. XRP currently changes hands at $2.14, but its CCI stands at -116.40, indicating possible oversold conditions. The last time XRP's CCI stood at -100 was in early November, when it traded at $0.51. XRP 1D Chart XRP 1D Chart The current CCI value suggests XRP still has room for more growth, and a 133% increase is a rather feasible goal. However, to overcome the current bearish state, XRP must first breach the 20-day SMA at $2.31 and subsequently push above the upper Bollinger Band ($2.54).",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/28/analyst-says-xrp-pullback-shows-completion-of-wave-4-expects-wave-5-to-lead-to-5/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-xrp-pullback-shows-completion-of-wave-4-expects-wave-5-to-lead-to-5,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With sections such as ‘Casino Reviews,’ ‘Crypto Guides,’ and ‘Bonuses,’ users can navigate various options confidently while maximizing their gaming enjoyment with cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s Impact on the Financial Market The surge of Bitcoin in 2024 has undeniably shifted the dynamics of the financial market. By outperforming traditional assets such as stocks and gold, Bitcoin has proven its worth as a reliable investment option amidst economic uncertainty. This shift can be attributed to several factors, including growing institutional adoption and enhanced regulatory clarity, which have collectively bolstered investor confidence. Institutional investors, who were once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, are now showing increased interest in Bitcoin due to its potential for high returns. The presence of big players in the market has not only legitimized Bitcoin but has also provided a much-needed boost to its liquidity. Furthermore, clearer regulatory frameworks have alleviated some of the concerns surrounding security and legality, making it easier for investors to participate in the crypto market. This shift towards Bitcoin is indicative of a broader trend where digital currencies are becoming integral to diversified investment portfolios. As traditional financial institutions begin to embrace cryptocurrencies , people can expect further integration and acceptance within mainstream finance. This evolution is poised to redefine how people perceive and interact with money in the years to come. Cryptocurrency in Mainstream Finance The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance marks a pivotal moment for digital currencies. In 2024 alone, several key developments have accelerated this trend. Notable among these is the integration of cryptocurrencies into payment systems by major corporations, enhancing their usability for everyday transactions. This mainstream acceptance is further underscored by the introduction of crypto-based financial products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. These products offer retail investors easier access to cryptocurrencies without needing to directly purchase or manage them. As awareness grows, more individuals are likely to consider incorporating digital assets into their investment strategies. As cryptocurrencies become more embedded within conventional financial systems, their role as legitimate assets continues to solidify. This transition reflects changing consumer preferences and technological advancements that favor decentralized financial solutions over centralized ones. Future Outlook for Cryptocurrencies Looking ahead to 2025, there are both challenges and opportunities awaiting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and altcoins. Technological advancements will continue driving innovation within blockchain networks while also addressing scalability issues that currently limit widespread adoption. Regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping future trends across global markets. However, greater transparency could lead to increased acceptance among regulators worldwide – ultimately benefiting long-term growth prospects within this dynamic industry sector. The convergence between technology companies investing heavily into blockchain research alongside existing financial institutions exploring new avenues presents exciting possibilities moving forward, bringing the world closer to realizing the full potential inherent within decentralized finance ecosystems today.

Similarly, in 2021, ETH saw significant gains of 78.5% in January, 8.4% in February, and 34.7% in March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report According to the expert’s analysis, these historical trends indicate that if Ethereum sustains its current price level for the rest of the year, it could experience a comparable path in 2025. Based on these historical figures and averages from the price increases between 2017 and 2021, it is possible that ETH might reach about $5,000 in January, around $6,400 in February, and by March, it could soar to $14,336 per token. Such increases would not only signify a recovery but also potentially triple Ethereum’s all-time high of $4,878 reached in November 2021. Beyond Ethereum, other altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and even meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) are also expected to benefit from this market correction and consolidation. Crypto Rover has also cautioned altcoin holders, stating, “Now is the worst time to sell. Our portfolios still have the potential to do a 10x from here. The next three months are going to be incredible.” Key Support Levels For ETH’s Price In addition to these bullish predictions, analyst Gabriel Maur has weighed in on Ethereum’s current price action, emphasizing key support levels between $2,800 and $2,900. The analyst notes that the structure of support has transitioned into resistance, which, once broken, becomes a crucial support level. The upward trend indicated by the 55-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) further supports the bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin $90K Level Is Crucial For Bulls – Price Could Tag $79K If BTC Loses It As long as ETH remains above this critical support region on weekly closes, the probability of continued upward momentum stays in favor of buyers. Maur identifies imminent targets of $4,093 and $4,868 (the previous all-time high), suggesting that if ETH closes above its all-time high, it may enter a price discovery phase with Fibonacci extensions indicating further upside potential.

38212375,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53286,1735360110,This Indicator Shows XRP Will Strongly Hold $2 Support,"XRP’s price trajectory remains uncertain, with technical indicators like Bollinger Bands suggesting continued volatility. Despite short-term declines, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilizing above a key support level. Recent Price Action Mirrors 2018 Trends Recent price movements have drawn comparisons to XRP’s behavior in 2018 when prices often surged beyond the upper Bollinger Band before retreating to the median line. XRP, which has dropped by approximately 5.18% over the past week, continues aligning with this historical pattern. Current projections suggest further declines could push the cryptocurrency to $2.103, a support level indicated by the lower Bollinger Band on the daily chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, this would represent an additional 2.18% decrease from its current value of $2.15. Weekly Indicators Suggest Stabilization is Possible Despite these declines, the weekly Bollinger Bands present a more optimistic outlook. If the lower band on the weekly chart shifts upward, it could prevent XRP from falling to the grim $1 projection. This development would mitigate fears of a deeper decline and allow the cryptocurrency to consolidate above $2 soon. While uncertainty lingers, this potential stabilization provides hope for investors monitoring XRP’s performance closely. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Activity Signals Strength Amid Volatility XRP remains a key player in the cryptocurrency market, trading above $2 per token and holding the position of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. With a market cap of $123 million and daily trading volumes reaching $4.67 billion, XRP’s activity underscores its resilience. These figures mark a significant turnaround compared to two months ago, highlighting how rapidly market dynamics can shift. While XRP’s current situation highlights opportunities and risks, its ability to hold above key support levels will determine its outlook. The weeks ahead will reveal whether XRP can capitalize on its current support level to mount a recovery or whether further declines are imminent. For now, market participants will continue to monitor the interplay between daily and weekly indicators to anticipate the next phase of price action. By staying above $2 and maintaining strong trading volumes, XRP is well-positioned to navigate this period of uncertainty, even as technical indicators point to potential short-term challenges.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-rally-15000-before-exchange-listings-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This move aims to provide investors new opportunities to leverage the Solana blockchain ecosystem. VolatilityShares Filled For Solana Futures ETF According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store VolatilityShares has recently proposed to launch a unique exchange-traded open-end index fund (ETF) based on Solana futures. As per the application, the proposed ETF will offer exposure to Solana futures with a variety of leverage options, including 1x, 2x, and -1x.

Solana ETF a Game-Changer? The proposed ETF will focus on Solana futures, trading exclusively on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This ensures a regulated and secure environment for investors, adding credibility to the crypto investment space. Solana, known for its lightning-fast transactions and low costs, has already captured the attention of the crypto community. If approved, this ETF could give investors a unique way to benefit from Solana’s growing ecosystem while catering to both risk-takers and cautious players. Volatility Shares Dual-Asset ETFs VolatilityShares is no stranger to innovation in the ETF market. The company previously introduced an innovative line of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer 100% leveraged exposure to two assets at once. This unique “one-plus-one” model allows investors to combine major asset classes like cryptocurrencies, stock indices, and market volatility in a single portfolio. The new ETFs include options such as BTC+ETH, Nasdaq+ETH, S&P+BTC, S&P+ETH, S&P+Nasdaq, and S&P+VIX, bridging the gap between traditional markets and digital assets.

Just last month, Bonk caught everyone’s eye with its explosive surge, but it seems there’s a new player in town that’s stealing the show. BTFD Coin (BTFD), with its presale performance skyrocketing past $4.6 million and growing, is breaking records like it’s smashing piñatas. If you thought meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had their moment, think again. BTFD Coin is proving that the best meme coins with 1000X potential aren’t a thing of the past—they’re just getting started. Over the years, meme coins have gone from a joke to some of the most lucrative investments in the crypto world. They’ve built communities, inspired memes, and, yes, created millionaires overnight. But here’s the kicker: BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype wave. It’s shaking things up with a killer play-to-earn (P2E) game , a robust referral programme, juicy staking rewards, and a tight-knit community that’s growing faster than you can say “HODL.” It’s not just riding the meme coin trend; it’s redefining it. So, what’s the scoop on Bonk and BTFD Coin? Why is BTFD dominating headlines, and what makes it the hottest presale of the year? Let’s dive into this ultimate showdown of the best meme coins with 1000X potential and find out why BTFD Coin’s presale is your golden ticket to the next crypto bull run. Bonk: The Viral Star That Keeps People Talking When Bonk burst onto the scene, it felt like the early days of Dogecoin all over again. As the first Solana-based meme coin to go mainstream, Bonk gained traction thanks to its loyal community and unique decentralised approach. It was fun, quirky, and completely on-brand for what people expect from meme coins. Its interactive “pop-to-click” feature drew thousands to its ecosystem, making it a viral sensation practically overnight. But here’s the thing—as fun as Bonk is, its utility is limited. It’s like a firework show that dazzles the crowd but fades fast. After peaking at $2 earlier this year, it’s now trading at around $0.7, a sharp reminder of how volatile these coins can be. Analysts predict that Bonk could recover if Bitcoin rallies, potentially reaching $3 or $4 next year. But without significant updates or additional use cases, it’s walking a tightrope. Despite its shortcomings, Bonk still holds a spot in the hearts of meme coin enthusiasts. It’s nostalgic and taps into that community-driven ethos that made Dogecoin a legend. However, when you’ve got a coin like BTFD that’s smashing presale records, Bonk starts to look a little like yesterday’s news. Could Bonk reinvent itself and climb back up the charts? Sure. But for now, it’s more of a gamble than a strategic play. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coins If Bonk is the cool kid everyone wants to be friends with, BTFD Coin is the overachiever breaking every record in the book. BTFD Coin has raised over $4.6 million in its presale, with 60 billion coins sold and 6,900 holders already in the mix. That’s not just impressive; it’s jaw-dropping. And the cherry on top? You can unlock 50% extra coins using the code BIG50. Seriously, who does that? But let’s not stop at the numbers. BTFD Coin has real utility, something that sets it apart from the pack. Its P2E game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a full-blown ecosystem where players can earn while having a blast. The referral programme sweetens the deal, giving users a reason to spread the word and grow the community. Add staking rewards into the mix, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s not just for laughs but for long-term gains. Let’s break it down with an example. Imagine you’ve got $25,000 burning a hole in your pocket. At Stage 13, with a price of $0.000142 per BTFD Coin, you’d snag 176,056,338 coins. Now, hold onto your hat: when the presale price hits $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $105,633. Yeah, you read that right. That’s more than four times your initial investment. Talk about a glow-up. And we haven’t even talked about the community yet. BTFD’s following is growing faster than a TikTok trend, with over 6,900 bulls rallying behind it. This isn’t just hype; it’s a movement. Analysts are already predicting that BTFD could become the poster child for the next crypto bull run, and honestly, it’s hard to argue with that. Why BTFD Coin Is the Smart Play Right Now When you stack BTFD Coin against Bonk, it’s like comparing a Tesla to a tricycle. Bonk has its charm, sure, but BTFD is the complete package. It’s got utility, it’s got community, and most importantly, it’s got potential. The best meme coins with 1000X potential aren’t just about riding a wave; they’re about building something that lasts. And that’s exactly what BTFD Coin is doing. With its presale already past $4.6 million and a total of 16 stages, the opportunities here are as juicy as a summer barbecue. The BIG50 code gives you 50% extra coins, making this one of the most generous presale offers on the market. If you’re looking for a meme coin that’s more than just a pretty face, BTFD is it. How to Buy BTFD Coin with the Bonus Code: The Easy Guide You’re ready to pull the trigger, right? Here’s how to buy more BTFD tokens in simple steps: Visit the Presale Page and prepare to make history. Connect Your Wallet: Link your wallet to the site (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) so you can get started. Use the Bonus Code: In the “Bonus Code” section, type in BIG50 and hit apply.

This is evident in Bitcoin reserves on spot exchanges, which had been in a steady decline for weeks, now seeing a notable uptick with an inflow exceeding 20,000 BTC, according to CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech. Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges turned positive, registering an increase of 15,800 BTC. These shifts mark a reversal from the consistent outflow trend observed in previous weeks, suggesting that traders may be preparing for increased activity on exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says Detailing The Increasing Exchange Reserves and Positive Netflows When Bitcoin reserves rise on exchanges, it typically signals an intent to trade or sell, introducing the possibility of selling pressure. Similarly, positive net flows indicate that the volume of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges is outpacing the volume being withdrawn. Historically, such patterns have often been associated with periods of increased market volatility. While the long-term accumulation trend remains intact, these new inflows highlight a short-term shift in sentiment, suggesting that investors may be positioning themselves for profit-taking or preparing for potential price corrections. IT Tech wrote: If reserves and netflows continue to rise, we could see increased volatility and potential downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the near term. This reversal highlights the importance of monitoring exchange activity for early signs of changing market sentiment. Another Bitcoin Metric Signalling Growing Buying Pressure While there have been signs of looming price action, another CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci has highlighted an opposite key observation: Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on Binance has surged to $8.3 billion. This metric tracks the total volume of buy transactions executed by “takers” on Binance—market participants who purchase BTC at current market prices using existing liquidity. An increase in Taker Buy Volume is generally interpreted as a sign of heightened investor interest and growing buying pressure.

Per Hankyoreh , the former Bithumb CEO Lee Sang-jun was sentenced to two years in prison for ordering his staff to list an unnamed altcoin. The same court also jailed the former golfer Ahn Sung-hyun for four and a half years at the same trial. Ahn is best known in South Korea as the husband of Song Yu-ri, an actress and former member of the K-pop group F.inKL. Altcoin Price Manipulation Accusations A branch of the Seoul Southern District Court jailed the duo on December 26. The Presiding Judge Jeong Do-seong called the crime “an act that harms the fairness and transparency of the cryptoasset market” and said it could “result in huge losses for honest investors.” The Seoul Southern District Court, in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: HoRo-Jo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Prosecutors said that the former CEO took 3 billion won (over $2 million) in cash and 400 million won ($271,000) worth of “luxury watches, luxury bags, and high-end restaurant membership cards.” Lee, the court ruled, took the money from the reclusive businessman Kang Jong-hyun (42) in 2021.

Kang, a close friend of both Ahn and Lee, was also jailed for a year and a half. The court heard that Kang provided Ahn with the money and goods the latter then used to bribe Lee. However, the court also heard that Ahn pocketed some of the funds he claimed Lee had demanded. The ex-golfer then used these stolen funds to buy shares. Prosecutors explained that Kang gave Ahn around $2 million worth of cash, but added that there was “no significant evidence to suggest that” he handed Lee “even a portion of this.” The judge said: “The nature of the crime is heinous, as [Ahn] embezzled 2 billion won to buy stocks.” Seoul shares down for 3rd day amid political upheaval, sliding won #Kospi #Kosdaq #stocks #updates https://t.co/nkgsojSOWw — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 27, 2024 Kang was convicted of a breach of trust, and the controversy over his alleged “secret ownership” of Bithumb continues.

Lightchain AI, currently in its presale phase at just $0.003, is attracting significant attention for its innovative use of artificial intelligence in blockchain. Positioned as a promising project, its unique features and tokenomics set it apart from other tokens in the space. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to maintain its place as one of the most recognized meme coins, with ongoing developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Both tokens offer intriguing opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the potential of these two altcoins and why they are worth keeping an eye on. Lightchain AI: Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is changing the blockchain world by smoothly combining smart machines with blockc͏hain tech. As a fresh idea, it offers special traits that boost growth, safety, and speed, giving a new type of blockchain answer. With its smart machine-led method Lightchain AI can make tasks automatic improve deal times and fine-tune network work. Right now in its early sale phase at $0.003, it shows a good chance for first buyers to join in a project that mixes two of the most changing technologies. The money system and plan of Lightchain AI also show its power to make a strong mark in the crypto area. Shiba Inu: Riding the Meme Coin Wave with Continued Developments Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin that has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community since its launch in 2020. As a decentralized cryptocurrency, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain and presents a fun and tongue-in-cheek approach to crypto investing. Despite its playful nature, SHIB has maintained strong support from its dedicated community and has recently made headlines with new developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. This includes plans for decentralized exchange listings, integration with online gaming platforms, and partnerships with major companies such as Amazon. With these exciting developments on the horizon, SHIB continues to show potential for long-term growth. In addition, SHIB has also shown resilience during periods of market volatility. While other altcoins may experience significant dips in value, SHIB has managed to maintain a relatively stable price range. This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for a more secure and less volatile alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which Altcoin Should You Watch? When deciding which altcoin to watch, two standout options in the current market are Lightchain AI and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Lightchain AI, with its innovative blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, is gaining significant attention. Currently in its presale phase at $0.003, it offers investors an early entry into a promising project focused on improving scalability and security through AI-driven solutions. With a solid roadmap and unique tokenomics, Lightchain AI stands out as a long-term investment opportunity. On the other hand, Shiba Inu continues to be a dominant force in the meme coin space, with a growing ecosystem and increasing community engagement. While Lightchain AI offers a tech-driven approach, Shiba Inu remains a popular choice for those looking to invest in a recognized and growing community. But lightchain AI is more potential and more opportunities to grow.",POSITIVE,SHIB,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/2-top-altcoins-to-watch-as-crypto-markets-break-out-lightchain-ai-and-shib/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38209429.jpeg

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-solana-memecoin-to-surge-17000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-as-shib-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Instead, the market is moving sideways, hinting at a period of consolidation within an overall uptrend. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.17. Uptrend Still in Play Despite the current consolidation, the overall trend for XRP is still bullish. The price action looks like a temporary pullback, rather than the start of a downtrend. If the price continues to move upward, it could challenge its all-time high of around $3.25 to $3.30, which also aligns with a critical Fibonacci level. Holding Above the 2021 High A key point to note is that XRP is holding above its 2021 high of $1.96. This is a strong signal of market strength. Maintaining this level is crucial for XRP’s continued positive momentum, and as long as the price stays above this, the market outlook remains favorable. Short-Term Market Behavior: Triangle Formation On the shorter time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern. While triangle patterns can lead to breakouts in either direction, they are fragile and tend to be less reliable. As a result, there is a possibility of short-term bearish action, but the price could also break to the upside. Key Levels for Risk Management For traders, it’s important to monitor the key support and resistance levels within this triangle. The price must hold above the $1.95 support level to maintain the triangle pattern. If it falls below this point, the likelihood of a bearish move increases, and the triangle scenario may be invalidated. The $1.95 level is the key support for XRP and if the price stays above this, the consolidation pattern is likely to continue. However, if the price drops below this level, we could see a more significant pullback, with the next support areas being around $1.80 to $1.39.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-28/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

As part of its expansive ecosystem, Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that aims to redefine internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which often centralise user data and risk breaches, the Qubetics dVPN leverages blockchain to decentralise operations. But what does this mean for users? The Qubetics dVPN ensures that no central authority controls user traffic, eliminating censorship and enhancing privacy. Its peer-to-peer network provides unmatched transparency and rewards users who share bandwidth with $TICS tokens. Imagine an internet where your privacy is protected, your data is encrypted, and you’re incentivised to participate. Could this be the future of secure browsing? Additionally, Qubetics has been fostering a stronger connection with its community by hosting an engaging AMA session .

Bitwise Eyes New Horizons with Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin continues to lead the charge in crypto innovation.

This initiative, detailed in a filing submitted on 26 December, includes rigorous criteria for companies to qualify, ensuring transparency and stability. By prioritising firms with significant Bitcoin holdings, the ETF aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin’s value while diversifying risks. This development underscores Bitcoin’s enduring role as a pillar of the crypto ecosystem. Arweave: A New Chapter in Decentralised Storage Arweave, the blockchain designed for permanent data storage, continues to make waves with its innovative use cases. Offering a decentralised solution to data archiving, Arweave ensures information is accessible and tamper-proof forever.

Qubetics Presale: Don’t Miss the Next Big Leap The excitement surrounding Qubetics’ presale is palpable. Currently, in Phase 14, the presale is structured to reward early adopters with significant price gains. Each phase introduces a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% jump in the final stage. At present, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.9 million already raised. This dynamic pricing model reflects the project’s growing demand and incentivises investors to act quickly.

Top Crypto to Buy Now Amid Solana’s $776M Inflows and Ethereum Whale Moves What if you could secure your financial future by investing in the right crypto at the right time? With blockchain technology rapidly redefining our digital interactions, picking the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term has never been more crucial. The latest updates on Ethereum and Solana are stirring the crypto market, but the buzz around Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight. While Ethereum faces market tremors from whale activity and Solana demonstrates its robust market recovery, Qubetics’ presale generates unmatched excitement. This article will explore the developments of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, helping you decide which crypto is the most promising to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics: Transforming Web3 Privacy with dVPN In a world where digital privacy is constantly threatened, Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rules. As part of its expansive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics offers a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPN providers, which often track and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN relies on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network. This decentralisation means no single entity can manipulate or monitor your online activity, ensuring true privacy and resistance to censorship. What makes this even more compelling is how it incentivises participation. Users who share bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Enhanced security features, such as multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, bolster anonymity and protect sensitive data. This innovation makes Qubetics a standout among the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics recently hosted an engaging AMA session, providing insights into their vision and addressing community questions. This transparent approach reinforces its commitment to building trust and fostering a loyal investor base. Solana: A Marriage of Innovation and Controversy Solana has made headlines for reasons beyond its technological advancements. Co-founder Stephen Akridge, embroiled in a legal dispute, faces allegations of withholding yield generated by Solana tokens during a divorce settlement. Despite this drama, Solana’s performance speaks volumes. With $776 million in daily inflows, the blockchain is cementing its reputation as a reliable platform for developers and investors alike. Boasting faster transactions and lower costs, Solana continues to attract attention as a leading competitor in the crypto space. It’s a testament to its potential for long-term growth, even amidst personal controversies. Ethereum: Whale Activity Sparks Investor Curiosity Ethereum, one of the most established blockchains, recently experienced significant activity. An ICO whale, known for strategic profit-taking, transferred 4,160 ETH—worth approximately $14.5 million—to Kraken. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure, which could lead to short-term price fluctuations. Historically, this whale has timed exits during market peaks, as seen with a $10.1 million sale earlier this month. Such activity fuels speculation about Ethereum’s immediate market trends. However, its long-term value remains undisputed, making it a staple in any portfolio. The Qubetics Presale: A Gateway to Early-Stage Gains The Qubetics presale is where the excitement truly builds. Currently, in Phase 14, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037. With over $7.9 million raised, 12,100+ holders, and 379 million tokens sold, this presale has already captured significant attention. Investors are flocking to secure their share, knowing that each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% surge in the final stage. Missing out now could mean paying more later, making it one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. The momentum surrounding Qubetics is growing daily, driven by its unique use cases and token economics. Early investors gain financially and position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Will you be one of them? Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Back? The crypto market is alive with opportunities, and each coin—Ethereum, Solana, and Qubetics ($TICS)—offers unique advantages. Ethereum’s proven history, Solana’s technological prowess, and Qubetics’ innovative dVPN service collectively highlight why these are the top cryptos to buy and hold long-term. Yet, the spotlight shines brightest on Qubetics . Its presale is a rare chance to join a project that combines cutting-edge technology with lucrative early investment opportunities. With price increases on the horizon, there’s no better time to dive in. Secure your stake in the future with Qubetics ($TICS), your gateway to blockchain success.

In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he pointed out that while the SEC was targeting Ripple, other high-profile figures like Sam Bankman-Fried were involved in serious financial misconduct without facing similar regulatory pressure. Gasparino argued that this was an example of regulatory overreach. He also said that Ripple’s technology, which underlies XRP, has potential but is now forced to operate overseas due to the lack of clear regulations in the U.S. The SEC’s legal actions have created uncertainty, and even after a judge made a decision in favor of Ripple, Gasparino criticized the ruling. “So they ( the SEC) bring the case, they get this judge who says, ‘Oh no, the investors, the retail investors don’t need the disclosure, they’re okay not disclosing to retail, but they should have disclosed it to the institution.’ This idiotic judge didn’t even know that she established precedent that there should be less disclosure for retail,” he said The judge had decided that Ripple did not need to disclose information to retail investors but should have disclosed it to institutional investors, a move Gasparino called “stupid.” He said that the ruling created a dangerous precedent for less disclosure for retail investors, explaining the mess that the case had become. Gasparino explained that his interest in Ripple began years earlier when he covered Ethereum’s efforts to establish its own regulatory framework, which led to a viral reaction after a clip of his reporting was shared by a Ripple supporter.

They’re also within reach for those with smaller budgets, offering chances to achieve significant returns. Deterred by Bitcoin’s steep price or its uncertain future returns? What if you could invest just $100 and position yourself for considerable short-term gains? The strategy involves selecting altcoins that offer affordability, innovation, and solid foundations. Let’s delve into the altcoins with the most potential available now, including a standout project—BlockDAG.

38206770,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667684,1735349445,Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators,"An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin has recently observed patterns in two indicators that could prove to be bullish for its price. Dogecoin Has Seen Positive Signals On TD Sequential & Whale Supply In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that Dogecoin has just witnessed on its 4-hour price chart. The “TD Sequential” refers to a technical analysis indicator that’s used for locating points of probable reversal for any asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals The indicator includes two phases, called the setup and countdown. During the first of these, the setup, candles in the price of the same color are counted up to nine. These candles aren’t necessary to be consecutive. When the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be finished, and the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal for the asset. Naturally, if the candles involved in the setup’s completion were green, the indicator would suggest a top, and if they were red, the signal would be for a bottom. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This phase of the TD Sequential works exactly the same as the setup, except for the fact that it involves thirteen candles, not nine. Once these candles have also been printed, the indicator gives another buy or sell signal for the price. Recently, Dogecoin has finished the first of these TD Sequential phases. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this signal in DOGE’s 4-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, the Dogecoin 4-hour price has completed the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the coin may now be set for a turnaround to the upside. This isn’t the only positive signal that DOGE has observed recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post that the whales have been busy purchasing during the last couple of days. The on-chain indicator cited by the analyst is the Supply Distribution from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the amount of supply that any particular wallet group is holding right now. Below is the chart for the metric that specifically shows the data for the whale cohort, massive investors carrying between 10 million and 100 million tokens: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Dogecoin supply held by the whales has registered an increase recently. More specifically, the whales have added a net amount of 90 million DOGE (worth around $28.7 million) to their holdings in the last two days. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over?

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/prince-elon-elonprin-memecoin-will-explode-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo – the four largest banks in the US – recorded $88 billion in collective profits in the first nine months of the year, the Financial Times reports , using figures from BankRegData. The banking giants now account for 44% of all the industry’s profits, and when you combine the “Big Four” with US Bank, PNC and Truist – the next three largest banks – the seven institutions are reaping 56% of all the profits in the field, up from 48% in 2023. PNC bank didn’t respond to FT’s requests for comments while the other six banks declined to comment altogether. Says Oppenheimer banking analyst Chris Kotowski, “Once you get much below the biggest banks, then it does become really hard to make the necessary investments and have the same name recognition… We’re a very mobile society, especially since Covid. Lots of people that move from New York to Florida for example, do you really need to have a different bank in Florida than you do in New York?” The consolidation of power by the biggest US banks highlights the struggle of smaller institutions to deal with regulation, volatile interest rates and the ability of larger banks to spread their presence digitally across the country.

As we approach 2025, investors and enthusiasts are keen to identify which cryptocurrencies will lead the charge. Here’s a curated list of the top five cryptocurrencies expected to make a substantial impact: 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is making waves by integrating decentralised Virtual Private Networks (dVPNs) into its ecosystem. This addition enhances user privacy and supports various decentralised services, including DeFi, NFTs, and decentralised storage. Qubetics dVPN upholds the core principles of autonomy and decentralisation central to Web3 by ensuring secure and private connections.Currently, in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers a compelling opportunity for early investors. With TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project has already raised over $7.9 million, attracted more than 12,100 holders, and sold 379 million tokens. The presale structure includes weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. Analysts project a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, indicating a potential ROI of 563.81% for early adopters. Forecasts suggest that Qubetics could reach $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, underscoring its potential as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 . 2. Bitcoin (BTC) As the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market. In 2024, Bitcoin experienced significant gains, surpassing $100,000 due to interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, a supply-reducing halving event, and expectations of pro-crypto policies following political developments. Analysts maintain a largely positive outlook for Bitcoin through 2025, with varying predictions. Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin could attain $200,000 and potentially $500,000 if the U.S. government adopts a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Standard Chartered shares a positive outlook, while VanEck projects Bitcoin reaching $180,000 amidst significant volatility. 3. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink’s decentralised oracle network is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem, providing reliable real-world data to smart contracts. Its effectiveness in integrating off-chain data with on-chain applications has led to widespread adoption across various sectors. As blockchain technology continues to permeate different industries, Chainlink's role becomes increasingly vital, positioning it as a promising investment for those looking toward 2025. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains at the forefront of decentralised applications and smart contract platforms. The anticipated full deployment of Ethereum 2.0 aims to address scalability issues, potentially leading to higher transaction speeds and lower gas fees. This evolution could further solidify Ethereum's position as a leading platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications. Analysts project that Ethereum could trade in a wide range, with a minimum price of $2,670 and a maximum of $5,990 by 2025, depending on market momentum. 5. VeChain (VET) VeChain focuses on enhancing supply chain efficiency and sustainability through its innovative use of decentralised technology. VeChain enables businesses to streamline operations and build consumer trust by providing transparent and tamper-proof data on products and services. As global supply chains become increasingly complex, VeChain's solutions are well-positioned to address these challenges, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming years. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is poised for significant developments as we approach 2025. Projects like Qubetics , with its innovative dVPN integration and established players like Bitcoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, and VeChain, offer diverse opportunities for investors and technology enthusiasts alike. Staying informed and conducting thorough research are essential steps for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic landscape and capitalise on the potential growth of these digital assets.

The exchange says the decision was driven by community demand. Explains Bitget chief executive Gracy Chen, “By merging BGB and BWB, we are taking a major step toward building a unified and robust ecosystem that bridges on-chain and off-chain applications. This move will enhance the utility of BGB, and ensure that every holder benefits from Bitget ecosystem growth.” Bitget says BWB holders on the exchange can automatically swap their BWB to BGB at a 0.08563 ratio, which the firm says was calculated using a 7-day average closing price of the BWB/USDT pair on Bitget. BGB is currently the 22nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap. The overall crypto market cap dropped by 4.7% on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

Sounds like a dream portfolio, doesn’t it? In the fast-paced crypto world, where fortunes can be made overnight, three names stand out: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Ponke (PONKE), and COQ Inu (COQ). Each is blazing a unique trail in the meme coin landscape. BTFD Coin has captivated investors with its massive presale success, Ponke is breaking boundaries with decentralised utility, and COQ Inu is charting new territory with cutting-edge interoperability. Here’s why these projects are the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. BTFD Coin: A Festive Presale Like No Other Let’s start with the hottest meme coin on the block—the BTFD Coin. Imagine an investment that not only promises massive returns but also rewards you with a 50% bonus just for getting in early. In Stage 13 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin, and with the BIG50 code, investors can maximise their holdings. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. “ Buy The Dip ” isn’t just a slogan—it’s a strategy. The project is built on the principle that dips are opportunities, not setbacks. It’s no wonder BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, sold 60 billion coins, and attracted 6,900+ enthusiastic holders. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, now in beta, is adding another layer of excitement. While rewards aren’t live yet, the gameplay is drawing attention from both gamers and investors. Add to this a staking system offering 90% APY and a referral programme that’s turning the community into a marketing powerhouse, and it’s clear BTFD is here to stay. To paint a picture, investing $5,000 at the current presale price would get you 35.2 million BTFD coins. With the BIG50 bonus, that jumps to 52.8 million. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $31,680. Joining is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, don’t forget to apply the BIG50 code for 50% extra BTFD Coins, and secure your investment before January 5, 2025. Act fast! Ponke: Utility That Sets It Apart Ponke is more than just another meme coin. With the launch of PonkeSwap, a decentralised exchange, it’s proving that meme coins can offer real-world utility. This move positions Ponke as a serious contender in the crypto space, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and utility-focused investors. Despite its innovative strides, Ponke has faced its share of challenges. After its Binance Futures listing, the coin experienced a short-lived surge, climbing from $0.44 to $0.55, only to settle at its current price of $0.32. While the volatility might deter some, it also presents an opportunity for those who believe in Ponke’s long-term vision. Ponke’s ability to adapt and innovate, particularly in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, makes it a coin to watch. Its commitment to blending entertainment and functionality sets it apart in a crowded market. COQ Inu: Innovation Through Interoperability COQ Inu is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Token Standard. This technological leap allows COQ to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains, making it more accessible and versatile than many of its competitors. Currently priced at $0.00000157, COQ Inu has seen a 15.74% price dip over the past week. While this might raise eyebrows, it’s important to remember that innovation often comes with growing pains. COQ’s focus on technological advancement positions it as a long-term player in the meme coin space. By addressing the interoperability challenge, COQ Inu is not just riding the meme coin wave—it’s leading it. Investors who value cutting-edge solutions in the crypto space will find COQ Inu’s approach both refreshing and promising. Turning Dips Into Opportunities The 1973 stock market crash taught us an invaluable lesson: downturns aren’t failures; they’re opportunities. Smart investors turned that chaos into immense wealth by buying undervalued assets. BTFD Coin embodies this ethos, offering a chance to invest before the next bull run. By focusing on presale opportunities, BTFD allows investors to get in early, maximise their returns, and ride the wave of its innovative ecosystem. Conclusion If you’re looking for the top new meme coins with 1000X potential , BTFD Coin is the standout choice based on current trends. Its limited-time 50% bonus, thriving presale, and innovative features make it a must-have for forward-thinking investors. While Ponke and COQ Inu bring their unique strengths to the table, it’s BTFD’s momentum and ROI potential that truly shine. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-cyborg-trumpcyb-solana-memecoin-to-explode-15000-before-exchange-listings-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38204245,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-whitepaper-v3-reveals-tech-progress-cardano-price-outlook-dogecoin-whale-activity-soar/,1735344063,BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3 Reveals Tech Progress! Cardano Price Outlook & Dogecoin Whale Activity Soar,"As the altcoin sector braces for an expected $2.5 trillion surge, giants like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are picking up steam. The Cardano price outlook is attracting attention with a surge in whale activity as hefty investors scoop up 160 million ADA tokens following its recent slip to $0.91. In tandem, Dogecoin whales are tactically maneuvering through critical support levels, eyeing the $0.684 mark. On the other hand, BlockDAG, fresh off the release of its Whitepaper V3, continues to draw in crypto whales eager for the next blockbuster financial opportunity. The whitepaper sheds light on significant updates and strategic plans for BlockDAG’s tech through 2025. What’s more, this utility-centric project is causing a splash in the presale market, having raised over $173 million across 26 batches, rapidly closing in on its ambitious $600 million target. Cardano Price Outlook: Will It Breach $1 & Hit $2.27? The buzz around Cardano price outlook is growing as major investors accumulate 160 million ADA tokens post its dip to $0.91. After a 6% recovery, ADA now trades at $0.95, with forecasts suggesting it could rise to $1.2 soon if it surpasses the critical $1 mark. Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook sets a $2.27 target, making the $1 level crucial for upward momentum. Yet, the road to recovery for Cardano price outlook is not without its bumps. The drop in daily active users by 58% poses questions about lasting engagement. Furthermore, there are worries about its resilience in holding the $0.90 support amid market ups and downs. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Push to $0.415? A recent update from @CryptoMichNL on platform X underscored that the “Altcoin market capitalization has beautifully retested and is set to climb to $2.5T.” This statement underscores the heightened activity across altcoins, notably Dogecoin, which continues to captivate due to significant whale movements. Currently at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have maintained the essential $0.264 support level, targeting $0.415 and $0.684. While such whales frequently ignite price hikes, their influence brings about concerns regarding market equilibrium. Observers note that Dogecoin’s limited utility detracts from its competitiveness, and its volatile price trends cause hesitation among investors, highlighting the need for more robust fundamentals to sustain long-term growth. BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3: Tackling Crypto’s Scalability & Privacy Issues The anticipated altcoin boom, projected to push the market to a staggering $2.5 trillion, has all eyes on ventures ready to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront is BlockDAG, a cutting-edge blockchain platform reshaping the crypto landscape. Having already amassed over $173 million by offloading more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has outstripped all expectations. Early backers have witnessed an incredible 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the price of BDAG coins skyrocketed from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. BlockDAG’s recently launched Whitepaper V3 has enthralled both developers and whales, unveiling advanced solutions that tackle scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. It seamlessly integrates the UTXO model for private transactions and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, creating an ideal platform for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The document also introduces the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, pioneering a partially ordered transaction system that slashes fees while safeguarding transaction integrity, setting a new efficiency standard in the blockchain arena. This innovation is igniting a flurry of interest among crypto enthusiasts, fueling a swift uptick in presale holdings. Market experts now believe BlockDAG could hit its $600 million presale goal sooner than anticipated. With BDAG coins in high demand, the ongoing presale batch is nearing completion, poised to trigger a sharp price rise in the subsequent phase. For those eyeing the best crypto project , the time to dive in is now, before the opportunity dwindles and prices spike. What is the Best Crypto Project? The altcoin arena is abuzz, with the Cardano price outlook hinting at renewed whale accumulations, and Dogecoin whale activity solidifying key supports. Yet, the spotlight is increasingly on BlockDAG, which is setting new standards with its latest Whitepaper V3 and impressive presale achievements. Having already surpassed the $173 million mark, BlockDAG is quickly nearing its $600 million goal. For those still pondering the next big crypto project, BlockDAG is emerging as a standout contender, offering unparalleled growth potential.

Currently, the Bitcoin price is retesting the support line of an Ascending Channel after crashing below $95,000. A crypto analyst has predicted that if it can hold this key support level, it could stage a recovery and skyrocket to its next bullish target, aligning with the upper resistance line of the channel. Bitcoin Price Retest Support Line; New Target In Sight In a chart illustrating Bitcoin’s price movement within an Ascending Channel, Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), revealed that the cryptocurrency has temporarily declined below the lower support line on the channel. The analyst labeled this decline a “False Break,” highlighting that the Ascending Channel remains intact despite the drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Total Value Locked Reaches Highest Level Since 2022 After Crossing $90 Billion, Will Price Follow? As indicated by the red circle in the price chart, the False Break suggests that Bitcoin’s brief move below the support level was short-lived and does not confirm the continuation of its previous downtrend. Trader Tardigrade noted that after Bitcoin’s False break, the cryptocurrency quickly moved back into the Ascending Channel to reclaim the lower support line. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s drop below the False break comes as the pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a sharp price crash below $95,000. Lately, the flagship cryptocurrency has been under significantly bearish pressure, recording notable declines as market volatility intensifies. Despite this bearish performance, Trader Tardigrade has disclosed that Bitcoin is now retesting the channel’s support line again, aiming to break above and trigger a price reversal. The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can hold this support line, it will likely continue moving upwards within the channel. Consequently, the analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin’s next price target would be the upper resistance line of the Ascending Channel. Looking at the price chart, the channel points upwards towards a range between $110,000 and $112,000. If Bitcoin can successfully recover toward the upper resistance line, it could signal the continuation of a bullish trend within the Ascending Channel. Additionally, a breakout above the resistance line could further validate the bullish momentum, setting up a stage for Bitcoin to potentially target higher price levels and possibly retest its all-time high. Related Reading: Here Are The Major Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch As Bulls Push For $100,000 Again Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Crash To $87,000 Bitcoin is currently in a downward trend, experiencing severe price declines despite analysts’ optimistic projections of a price surge. According to crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, the Bitcoin price could see another decline, with the support level at $87,000 being the next target. However, according to the analyst, a drop to this price low could bring “maximum pain” to both short—and long-term investors. Nevertheless, Titan of Crypto believes this severe price decline could also present a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next price rally. He emphasized that price movements are rarely linear, highlighting the crypto market’s inherent unpredictability and volatility. Despite Bitcoin’s bearish behavior, Titan of Crypto confidently predicts that a price rally to $110,000 is inevitable.
