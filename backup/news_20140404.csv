42397458,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUHv,1396640673,Canadian Government to End 'MintChip' Digital Currency Program,"The Canadian government has announced that it will end its MintChip electronic payment system, and that it will look to sell the business to the private sector.  Announced in 2012, MintChip was not a digital currency akin to bitcoin, but rather a digital payment mechanism meant to function as an electronic cash that could be transferred between users.  Still, MintChip was widely viewed as an alternative to bitcoin that was famously criticised by Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis for ""missing the point"" of the technology. A spokesperson for the Canadian Mint confirmed the news to The Wall Street Journal, stating:  ""The Mint is currently working with the [Canadian] Department of Finance to explore divestiture options. The Mint is also in the process of completing development of MintChip to package the assets for divestiture.""  The news is surprising given that as recently as this past September, the government was reportedly working on a second version of its MintChip concept.  Further, the development is notable as it was theorized by some in the community that Canada's potentially harsh rhetoric regarding bitcoin regulation was meant in some way to promote the government-made MintChip, though such a connection was never established.  How MintChip works  MintChip used a silicon chip with a unique ID as a store of value, which was then to be sent to brokers who would trade them to consumers and businesses.  Users could embed MintChip devices onto USB sticks, wallets, laptops and tablets, or store their digital cash with a third-party service provider. A value of '1' on the chip would equal one Canadian dollar.  For a more detailed overview of MintChip's design and how it could be used to facilitate payments, click here.  Bitcoin in Canada  The news comes as Canada continues to develop a robust bitcoin ecosystem. Home to the first bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, bitcoin's profile has been growing within the local community, even as major Canada-based bitcoin exchanges face operational resistance from financial institutions.  Just last week, the most recent version of Canada's 2014 Federal Budget Implementation Act mentioned potential regulations for bitcoin, though the only provision would apply cash-like controls meant to restrict the movement of sums of digital currency of more than $10,000.  The country's domestic bitcoin exchanges have reported difficulties since meeting their banking needs recently, a development they attributed to statements made by the Canadian government, which, like most countries, has yet to introduce bitcoin regulation.

42397475,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAURl,1396637658,Money-Spinners: Bitcoin ATMs Make Firsts from California to Congress,"Take out your smartphones and get those palms warmed up for a scanning, because it's time for CoinDesk's weekly bitcoin ATM roundup.  In the world of bitcoin ATMs, there are more first prizes than a kindergarten sports day, as installers claim blue ribbons such as first bitcoin ATM in their region, first two-way bitcoin ATM, first bitcoin ATM open to the public, first permanent unit and so on.  Nonetheless, all bitcoin ATM news is good news, as it can be argued that it gets more coins into more hands, and everyone wins in the end.  London, UK  We start in CoinDesk's hometown of London this week, which saw the first two-way ATM installation in the form of a Robocoin unit at an internet cafe in Holborn. Ordered in December, there was such demand for these machines that it took until April to get it up and running.  According to the video, London already has a Lamassu one-way machine operating, and another Robocoin is reportedly coming soon.  Zurich, Switzerland  Switzerland's first bitcoin machine, a Lamassu, came online last weekend at the Cafe Schoffel in Zurich, owned and operated by Rolf Leuenberger and Emanuel Muessli (pictured). The cafe itself, like most others with bitcoin ATMs, accepts bitcoin.  Mountain View, California  We reported on the machine that appeared at 500 Startups ‘Bitcoinference’ last week, but we're happy to tell you Robocoin now has a more permanent foothold in Mountain View at the heart of Silicon Valley.  The ATM is located in the main lobby of the Hacker Dojo, a community center for hackers and thinkers, and is operated by Cary Peters, President of Coinage, LLC.  “We’re setting the precedent for bitcoin ATMs and demonstrating to California's citizens and regulators just how this exchange business should be run with respect to anti-money laundering compliance and consumer protection,"" said Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley at the launch.  Auckland, New Zealand  Carrying the flag for the entire Southern Hemisphere this week is Bitto of New Zealand, which unveiled that country's first two Lamassu machines. These machines are a little different in that they're nomadic, moving around to special events, bookings or wherever else they're requested.  As the only two machines around, demand should be high, though there are rumors of another eight machines coming to NZ soon.  Coming soon  Just to whet your appetite for the coming weeks, we have HK Bitcoin ATM gearing up to launch not only a bitcoin ATM but a whole 'Bitcoin Museum' showcasing artifacts from bitcoin's long history in the Chic Castle Mall in Mongkok. The mall has been described by the Guiness Book of World Records as the busiest district in the world (CoinDesk has been there and can vouch that it is indeed very busy). The official launch is coming up on 12th April.  It also looks like there's another new hardware player on the scene with an innovative design and price as well.  BitXATM's one-way Sumo Pro machines also work as POS payment terminals and claim to the be cheapest around, at €2,900 each.  Other tidbits  Robocoin representatives will visit Washington, DC on 8th April to demonstrate their machines to Congress members, the first company to do so.  Speaking at the demonstration will be Congressman Jared Polis (D-CO), an entrepreneur himself who is known to be bitcoin-friendly and who once wrote a humorous reply to his colleague Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) after he suggested banning bitcoins. More to follow after the event.  GenesisCoin, who launched two machines in Tijuana last week that also dispensed dogecoin and potentially litecoin as well, announced it has received orders for 12 of its Genesis1 ATMs. The large, two-way Genesis1 machines cost $14,500, competitively priced against main competitor Robocoin, whose machines sell for $20,000.  And finally, there were a few complaints from Aussies last week that our reported 'first bitcoin ATM in Australia' was not actually the first. As we mentioned at the beginning of this story, though, everyone's a winner wherever bitcoins are being acquired and there are no special prizes for being named 'first' in these reports.  As a bonus, here is an Australian news report detailing the possible ATM bonanza that could soon hit that country.

42397464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAULr,1396636157,Inside Square's Stealth Approach to Bitcoin Integration,"Update 6th April - Square has indicated that it will send dollar payments from Coinbase bitcoin transactions directly to its merchants.  San Francisco-based mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) giant Square sent a jolt of excitement through the bitcoin ecosystem when it announced that it would allow users to pay for goods and services with the digital currency via its online marketplace, Square Market.  With a valuation of $5bn, Square is already a giant in the payments space despite its relative newcomer status. Founded in 2009, it's backed by millions in venture capital investment and a star executive, Twitter co-creator Jack Dorsey, who even tweeted the news that the company would accept bitcoin personally.  However, there were still some unanswered questions about how Square would integrate bitcoin payments into Square Market, what merchants could expect from the service and what Square's long-term vision for integrating digital currency would be.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a representative for the company elaborated further – indicating that Square saw bitcoin as a natural extension of its core value propositions:  ""We’re building tools so sellers can accept any form of payment their customers want to use. Making commerce easy means creating easy ways to exchange value for local goods.""  Still, Square also revealed that it has a particular vision for how to make bitcoin acceptance easy, one that may limit the potential for new merchants to be exposed to the digital currency the way they are through other services, at least in the short term.  Said Square:  ""The merchant will not know if the buyer bought an item using bitcoin since they get paid in dollars.""  As such, the new comments may offer a glimpse of what Square Market users can expect and what the company's approach may mean for larger, merchant-facing companies operating in the space.  Consistent experience  Square suggested that the goal with the new initiative will be for bitcoin to be as easy as possible for Square Market merchants, meaning, for now, that bitcoin will be kept behind the scenes.  Said the representative:  ""For sellers, the experience won’t feel any different.""  The company is processing payments through San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase, so its merchants will not have the ability to hold bitcoin. Further, the dollars that the merchant receives will be sent from Square, not Coinbase.  Square also indicated the 2.75% transaction fee on all bitcoin sales it generates would remain, keeping its pricing consistent with other methods.  Transactions will be priced according to Coinbase's rate at the time of checkout.  Buying and return process  Square has also released a new guide for bitcoin buyers that takes these individuals step-by-step through the purchasing process.  Bitcoin buyers simply need to enter their shipping address and email before electing to ""Pay by QR code"" or ""Pay by Bitcoin Address"" before confirming the payment, a process Coinbase users are likely to find familiar.  Square further detailed how it would handle payment disputes arising from bitcoin transactions. Notably, the company stressed that it is not directly involved in the transaction, writing:  ""Bitcoin payment disputes should be resolved between the Square merchant and buyer, without Square's intervention.""  Further, refunds will be treated the same as other payment methods. Customers will receive their refund in the ""original payment form."" Additionally, if merchants do not want to accept bitcoin payments they can opt out by contacting Square customer service.  No comment  Though Square did answer some questions, it didn't elaborate on other queries.  Most notably, it did not indicate how it would manage the risk of zero-confirmation transactions or comment formally on the recent IRS ruling and if Square Market merchants would be affected.  Furthermore, it did not comment on whether Apple's anti-bitcoin position will affect purchases made over the Square merchant app, or how long it has been monitoring the bitcoin space.  Impact  Still, there could be larger implications to Square's decision to take a more background approach to bitcoin with its Square Market. Namely, merchants may not realize that an increase in sales is attributable to bitcoin.  Notably, other merchant marketplace providers offer the ability for merchants to gain this insight.  For example, a representative of Shopify, which offers bitcoin as a payment methods to its 70,000+ online merchants, indicated that those who enroll in its Shopify Basic service can manually send ""all orders through a payment method-style export.""  According to Shopify, this lets merchants tell how much money they took from a certain payment gateway, which in turn lets them assess their success accepting bitcoin.  Members of its Professional Plan service can see this information automatically.  Still, the service is more affordable than Stripe's proposed processing plan, which charges 2.9% plus an additional 30 cents per transaction.  Industry reaction  Despite the questions about how Square has gone about testing bitcoin thus far, even those who are contributing for similar business see the move as a boon for the ecosystem at large.  Hieu Bui, CEO for bitcoin-centric marketplace BitDazzle, welcomed Square to the ecosystem, but stressed that Square might not be using the Bitcoin protocol or the bitcoin ecosystem to its fullest potential with the decision.  ""I believe there are benefits to having sellers directly interact with the bitcoin ecosystem, especially as more and more people have bitcoin to spend. So, our sellers benefit from the commerce as well as growing their base of shoppers.""  Bui also saw the bigger picture implications of Square's decision, suggesting that PayPal could easily follow a similar route, where benefits are lost in translation, should it decide to accept bitcoin.  BitDazzle charges a monthly fee for its service, which allows it to keep bitcoin transaction costs in line with the capabilities of the protocol.  Mitchell Callahan, a developer behind the merchant-friendly point-of-sale tool PocketPOS, believes that Square is right to focus on the end result, facilitating BTC payments, even at the potential expense of merchant awareness about bitcoin as a payment option.  ""Making this process simple is key as merchants have a lot to worry about. Today, most people likely don't care how Visa or debit works, they just need to make sure they can accept payment easily and it goes into their bank account.""  Plus, as Callahan indicates, the fact that Square is working with bitcoin at all is noteworthy, as it could signal that the company may be open to expanding the program, and adding millions of merchants to the bitcoin network in the process.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/04/inside-squares-stealth-approach-to-bitcoin-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98acc6e80378973738fa132edbfd3cba4e10b67b-1044x689.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397456,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUGw,1396633084,Neo & Bee CEO Danny Brewster Faces Fraud Allegations in Cyprus,"Danny Brewster, CEO of bitcoin services company Neo & Bee, is reportedly facing fraud charges filed by two customers in Cyprus who claim that they have never received any bitcoins from the company.  According to a report in the Cyprus Mail, the customers paid €15,000 and €20,000 respectively, for the bitcoins, which never materialised. Police are investigating, the newspaper says.  Earlier this week Neo & Bee was caught up in a media frenzy, after it emerged that the company may be facing insolvency. Neo & Bee then asked Havelock Investments to suspend trading of LMB Holdings shares.  LMB Holdings is the parent company of Neo & Bee, and the request was made after Neo & Bee detected what it described as ""questionable trading activity"".  Online statements  Neo & Bee had a potential PR disaster on its hands, as online commentators started making serious allegations, alleging that Brewster left Cyprus and defrauded investors.  Brewster returned fire on the Bitcoin Talk forum. He admitted that he was temporarily out of the country, but stressed that was away on business. The CEO then said he was looking for an investor for the troubled company.  However, Brewster consequently said he had changed his plans, after receiving threats targeted at his daughter. He is now looking to sell his entire equity in the company and pull out of Neo & Bee altogether, he said.  However, the Cyprus Mail states that it contacted the police authorities and learned that Brewster has not reported any threats, either against him or his family. Brewster claims otherwise. In his Bitcoin Talk post, he specifically said that the threats were reported to the authorities.  Jumping ship  Brewster referenced his staff and some personal matters in his most recent public statement. That led to suspicions that there was a falling out between Brewster and his Cyprus-based team.  Now it appears that the staff have had enough. One employee told Cyprus Mail reporter Elias Hazou that ""no one's in charge"" and that staff members were ""clearing out"". Hazou says the company's head office in Nicosia was ""all but deserted"" yesterday.  The staff member confirmed that the local staff had not received their March wages and that they did not know anything about Brewster's whereabouts. Brewster apparently left Cyprus on or before 19th March and the staff member had not heard from him since.  This would explain why Neo & Bee has not issued any public statements about the current situation, as they appear to have been kept out of the loop over the past two weeks. Moreover, since the staff have now, temporarily or otherwise, deserted the premises, it seems that there is nobody aside from Brewster to communicate for the company.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/04/neo-bee-ceo-danny-brewster-faces-fraud-allegations-in-cyprus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1ce9bbd172b7547204ce1dc68d662a2fe7fc1ad-2560x1347.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCpD,1396627786,Net Yourself a Plymouth Barracuda Supercar for 429 BTC,"A graphic designer and automotive enthusiast from Copenhagen, Denmark, has converted his 1970 Plymouth Hemi Barracuda into a modern-day supercar and is now selling it for 429 BTC.  Rasmus Porsager has put seven years and $240,000 into working this car into what he calls a ‘Supercar with Soul’.  He explains why he decided to work on this particular car:  “The 1970 Plymouth Barracuda is one of the best looking muscle cars ever built, but to keep it at a low price, the Plymouth had to make the usual sacrifices when making a car for the assembly line.”  He adds:  “This ’Cuda was custom built to undo those sacrifices, and the spectacular beauty of the ’Cuda body has come to life as was originally envisioned.”  The car can now boast a blistering 0-60mph time of 2.95 seconds, thanks to a 705 horsepower, 9.4-litre, all-aluminium, fuel-injected hemi engine, offering a massive 904nm of torque.  Exterior handles have been taken off and replaced with an RFID (radio-frequency identification) system, producing a sleek, black dream of a car that looks like something Batman would drive in his spare time.  The exterior has been oxyfuel welded and the entire body galvanised, and with a reinforced frame for extra rigidity, double wishbone suspension and Wilwood piston calliper brakes, the souped-up Plymouth is guaranteed to provide all the thrills you could want as it tears through corners, producing up to 1.02g.  It's pretty obvious, this car is the stuff of every petrolhead’s wildest fantasies. So, we wondered, why does Porsager want to part with it?  He explained:  “Two things: one is that I find the project itself exciting. So just having it to own it isn’t that interesting – it’s more fun to built it and solve the design issues and make a project out of it. The second reason is when I sell this, I’ll be able to start a new project with the money I can get from it.”  So far, Porsager has received two offers for his creation: one from a man in Australia who wanted to pay with bitcoin, and another one from St. Petersburg with a pile of fiat at the ready.  The Danish designer obviously wants a good deal for the ’Cuda, but if it comes down to two close bids, he indicates he will support the bitcoin community by accepting the offer in digital currency.  “It depends on the difference in the value at the time, but if they are around the same, I would definitely go for the bitcoin version,” said Porsager.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TRADING,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/04/net-yourself-a-plymouth-barracuda-supercar-for-429-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3efa0299cf3133c4422cd94abcd107144065a55d-1620x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397451,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUDz,1396620735,Ad Agency Joystick Interactive Now Accepting Bitcoin,"Ad agency Joystick Interactive has announced that it is now accepting bitcoin as payment and will also offer a generous discount to clients who choose to pay in the digital currency.  Joystick Interactive  is not a small outfit, having offices in New York, Los Angeles and London. The agency's client list is rather impressive too, featuring big names like Google, Toyota, Disney, Mazda, Sony and Activision.  Discount on bitcoin transactions  To mark the occasion, Joystick Interactive is offering a 20% discount to all clients who choose to pay in bitcoin. Since top notch ad campaigns don't come cheap, this could amount to a very sizeable discount.  It also makes the company's decision to embrace bitcoin somewhat puzzling, as big clients like Google and Sony are not very likely to pay in the digital currency, but perhaps there are enough startups in the bitcoin world now to constitute a market.  Joystick Interactive says it is passionate about bitcoin and that its decision to embrace it is merely a continuation of its creative streak. The agency emphasises innovation and digital technologies, so bitcoin sounds like a good match for Joystick's cutting-edge image.  Could this be just another publicity stunt? After all we are talking about an ad agency. Generating positive buzz is in their line of work.  Committed to bitcoin  The agency insists that it is drawn to bitcoin for all the right reasons, not publicity, and that the ""embryonic digital currency world"" of today reminds the founders of the early days of digital advertising. It seems to be a case of nostalgia and emotions rather than good publicity.  Said Chris Wilson, CEO at Joystick Interactive:  ""As an agency with global clients and a focus on creative innovation, we recognize the need for innovation and growth in digital currency; just as there is in digital advertising.""  The agency believes its decision to offer a 20% discount to bitcoin clients will demonstrate its commitment to bitcoin and digital currencies as a whole.  While this is a rather unusual niche for bitcoin, and Joystick Interactive does not obviously have much to gain from low transaction fees or other features of bitcoin, another big name adopting the digital currency is always good news.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/04/ad-agency-joystick-interactive-now-accepting-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4703c2c834a7a2791190fe1d88ab0ebc7200a421-1225x650.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397448,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUB2,1396609721,BTC China Dismisses PBOC Fears in Open Letter,"Shanghai-based exchange BTC China has published a statement reassuring Chinese investors that its operations will resume as normal despite looming regulatory uncertainty.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is widely expected to issue a public notice later this month, which would effectively put an end to bitcoin-related money transfers in China, including yuan deposits. The rumoured notice is expected to go official on 15th April.  However, since nothing is official yet, there is plenty of misinformation floating around. In turn, the spread of PBOC-related fear, uncertainty and doubt has been blamed for the latest price slump.  Until the rumoured PBOC statement is issued, it's unclear how it will impact exchanges and bitcoin-related businesses in China.  BTC China remains confident  However, in the face of this BTC China appears undeterred. The exchange points out that the so-called 15th April rumour and the uncertainty it spawned has already caused plenty of issues. In an open letter addressed to the Chinese bitcoin community, the exchange dismissed claims that it had received any official guidance from the PBOC:  ""We've been tracking this issue. Whether it is local banks, Beijing's central bank level, media channels and industry peers, we are paying close attention and keeping in contact. If we have any updates, we will immediately inform you.""  The exchange stressed that people are not afraid of the notice itself, but rather the ""unknown"" and uncertain future for the bitcoin space.  ""We just don't know what the outcome will be,"" BTC China CEO Bobby Lee told CoinDesk. “At this stage, it's too early for me to speculate on the options we have. We just don't know enough right now.""  Lee added:  ""What we're hearing is that banks will disallow us from using commercial bank accounts to store customer deposits, what's not clear to us yet is whether the business of running a bitcoin exchange will be classed as legal or not.""  Doom and gloom  BTC China then outlined the possible effects of the 15th April notice, dismissing many doomsday scenarios which have been proliferating in recent days. The exchange insists that the ""core values"" of bitcoin, notwithstanding the price, will remain intact regardless of what the PBOC chooses to do.  The exchange also argues that the notice will probably not have a long-term impact on the price, although it has already caused short-term price fluctuations.  BTC China also pointed out that many countries around the world are moving to supervise or regulate the bitcoin market. It cites recent regulatory moves in New York, the UK, Singapore and other financial hubs as proof that the world's most developed economies are becoming actively involved in bitcoin.  The exchange argues that central banks and regulators are expected to tread cautiously. The impact of bitcoin on the wider economy is negligible for the time being, so rather than ban bitcoin and force it underground, regulators are more likely to recognise it as just another trend and regulate it to mitigate the risks.  This is actually a very good point and for the time being regulators appear to be doing just that. A P2P system would be next to impossible to dismantle, forcing it underground would simply make the risks much greater.  The great bitcoin bubble of China  BTC China admits that the domestic bitcoin market is indeed a bubble. The exchange explained its creation as follows:  ""A general lack of domestic investment targets, coupled with the lack of understanding of bitcoin led to bitcoins becoming speculative grade. After the April 15 message, investors will re-evaluate bitcoin, an industry reshuffle may also occur.""  The exchange adds that it would welcome a reshuffle and that it sees the notice as ""pre-dawn darkness."" It insists that China's bitcoin community needs confidence to develop further. BTC China insists it is doing its part to restore confidence.  BTC China says it will upgrade its bitcoin trading platform, introduce regular third-party audits and publish their results, but more importantly it says it will expand its communication with regulators. The exchange is also planning to introduce new products which are currently in beta and it will also try to improve the overall user experience.  In essence, BTC China insists it is in it for the long haul.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/04/btc-china-dismisses-pboc-fears-in-open-letter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d746fb4ad9e698612d4014e7ba855a694d16733-1000x571.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUIu,1396605448,eBay Adds New 'Virtual Currency' Category to US Site,"eBay's main US site has introduced a category for 'Virtual Currency', with listings for dozens of bitcoin and altcoin-related activities – including shares in mining operations.  Although eBay is still not accepting bitcoin as an official payment, any recognition of the currency is significant since eBay is the parent company of PayPal, the payments firm long earmarked for disruption by many bitcoin fans.  The popular online auction site and marketplace quietly included the category in its 'Category Changes' list for April under 'Coins and Paper Money'.  At press time there were multiple entries for bitcoin and altcoin trades, Mining Hardware, and 'Mining Contracts', where investors are invited to buy per-gigahash shares in existing and proposed cryptocurrency mining operations. Search results revealed hundreds of mining-related listings not yet categorized.  One listing selling dogecoins had in its description:  ""This will be shipped via USPS, UPS, FedEX, or the shipping method of your choice. Note to eBay: these are NOT being emailed.""  There are, however, other listings promising the coins will be sent electronically. The 'Mining Hardware' and 'Mining Contracts' subcategories also have some currency sales listed with Auction and 'Buy it Now' options.  This is not permitted on eBay's UK site, which has had a 'Virtual Currency' category since February but stipulates listings must be classified ads.  eBay has a colorful history with digital currencies, appearing often in 'Will they or won't they?' stories throughout bitcoin's recent history.  A filing to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) in early 2014 referred to bitcoin as a 'potential competitor' to PayPal, which usually charges a 2-3% fee on transactions it processes.  eBay has also applied for patents in the last few months that suggest an interest in digital currency exchange and other payment 'tokens'.  Previous listings  Reactions  to the new 'Virtual Currency' category on reddit were a mixture of optimistic and wary, with many claiming the company has added it before, only to remove it at a later stage. This could have been due to eBay's overseas subsidiary sites, like the UK, adding the listing before the US one.  PayPal has also appeared to toy with the idea of accepting bitcoin in some form. President president David Marcus remarked in an April 2013 interview that he found digital currencies ""truly fascinating"" and added ""We're kind of thinking about it"".  eBay president John Donohoe has also mused on the possibility of PayPal integrating bitcoin ""one day"" in interviews, giving no commitment beyond saying ""we're looking at bitcoin closely"".  Potential pitfalls  There may also be concerns at the number of bitcoin mining share listings on eBay. Many of these deals have ended in tears as hardware manufacturers fail to deliver on time, or under-deliver on the kinds of profits investors were expecting due to the exponential increase in the network's hashing speed requirements.  The sheer number of listings under the category could create a potential customer relations nightmare for eBay, should buyers find themselves dissatisfied with purchases, scammed outright, or have refund claims disputed.  Even the Virtual Currency page itself has a large banner advertising the ""eBay Money Back Guarantee – Get the item you ordered or get your money back"".  Trading digital currencies themselves on eBay could also be a minefield, exposing sellers to credit card chargebacks and PayPal claims after the coins have changed hands.

42397450,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAUD0,1396585059,Tipping Platform Patreon 'Exploring Bitcoin Integration',"Online tipping and funding platform Patreon is planning to accept bitcoin ""hopefully soon"", allowing fans to make regular micropayments to their favorite online artists.  Founded in 2013, Patreon has to date raised more than $2m in seed funding, and is one of a host of recent startups looking to help content creators recoup revenue otherwise lost to online middlemen like YouTube.  The announcement comes courtesy of an email the company sent to reddit user 'camponez', who wrote to Patreon to enquire about bitcoin integration, and received the following reply:    ""Thanks so much for your note! We are actually exploring bitcoin integration right now.""      ""Be sure to follow us on Twitter @patreon because we will be making the announcement of when it is live on there!""    Patreon co-founder, musician Jack Conte, confirmed the message in a reply to the thread:  ""It's true, we've been talking about bitcoin for months. my co-founder, Sam, already built most of the code, but it's not pushed yet. We're fixing some bugs and tweaking. don't know when it will happen. hopefully soon.""  How Patreon works  Patreon is different to other project-funding sites like Kickstarter, focusing instead on creators who release a stream of smaller, regular works. Rather than raise a large sum of money for one big project, Patreon allows donors to set up payments closer to $1-10 to be paid out whenever their favorite artist or creator releases a new work; such as a YouTube video, podcast, web comic or even a news article.  Patrons have full control over the regularity and size of their payments, with monthly maximums. The system also allows creators to set rewards and perks for their patrons, such as tutorials, Google Hangouts or concert tickets.  Conte demonstrates how the system works in a video here, which also shows he gets over $4,000 in tips for every video he releases from his 1,200+ 'patrons'.  He said he was motivated to build Patreon after realizing the millions of views his YouTube catalog received was only earning him about $100 a month.  ""Surely my community thinks I'm worth more than that, right? Monetization of digital media is entirely broken. I don't know who decided that we should turn the internet into a billboard, but it doesn't even work that well,"" he said.  Bitcoin advantage  To use Patreon either as a Creator or a Patron, you need to sign up for an account (or use a Facebook login). Currently, Patrons must have either a credit card or a PayPal account, limiting the number of potential tippers.  Then there are fees. Patreon itself charges 5% for its service, but credit card fees bite into that. Payment processor Stripe gives Patreon a discount due to the large number of transactions, making fees about 2.1% plus 30 cents per transaction. Payments are aggregated into larger ones, eg: if a Patron makes eight $1 payments to different Creators, the card is only charged once rather than $1 eight times.  Of course, any artist with a web presence can simply publish a bitcoin address or QR code image to collect 100% of all tips. This technique is probably only better for one-off payments, since it requires a benefactor to actually visit your site and enter each tip manually.  ""With Patreon, payments can happen regularly and automatically without the need for a special visit, so if you make regular releases, signing up might well pay off. More of the money would go directly to creators. The goal of Patreon is to send as much money to creators as possible. So the idea of Bitcoin is super aligned with our mission,"" Conte concluded.
