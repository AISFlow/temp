33196607,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639793,1725490815,Investors Lose Sight Of MATIC As It Drops 16% Ahead Of Network Upgrade,"MATIC suffers another string of losses as the broader market pullback forces the bulls to the defensive. According to CoinGecko, the Polygon Network native coin has bled 16% more since last week as the bears reverse gains made back in August. This move occurred despite Polygon Network‚Äôs upcoming upgrade that switches MATIC to POL, improving the platform‚Äôs tokenomics. Related Reading: RENDER Flashes Red With 18% Short-Term Loss ‚Äì Details As the market moved 5% downward, investor confidence in MATIC has been shaken, possibly damaging the token‚Äôs performance in September. Short-term, investors are looking at more pain if the market continues to freefall. Momentum Lost After Hype-Led Rally For MATIC MATIC bears are currently attempting to break through the $0.39 support level after ten days of a consistent downward trajectory. This leaves the bulls in a precarious position in the short term as a bearish breakthrough on this support level will drive the token toward $0.33, a level unseen since March 2021. With the major cryptocurrencies also experiencing strong bearish momentum, we can expect MATIC to fall even further despite the improvements brought by the upcoming network upgrade. Investors and traders can expect the token to fall further, possibly flipping the $0.39 support level to resistance. Investors and traders could expect increased volatility depending on the condition of the larger market once this action starts. Although much of the market moves in line with the swings of the two leading cryptocurrencies, market movers like Bitcoin and Ethereum should also be under observation. Network Migration And New On-chain Developments The MATIC to POL migration will start today, September 4, which affects all facets of the network. According to an earlier blog post, the network migration will improve the tokenomics of the platform making it more attractive for users and future validators. Related Reading: SUI Crashes 23% As September Unleashes Market Panic‚ÄîIs A Comeback Possible? One of the most notable developments for the community is the enhanced protocol awards system that is expected to encourage more validators to the platform.

33194236,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639801,1725485457,Bitcoin Boom Over? Expert Calculates How High It Can Go In 10 Years,"Over the past seven months, the price of Bitcoin has moved in a range between $73,777 and $49,000, significantly depressing sentiment across the market. In a new analysis published via X, Will Clemente III, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, addresses the prevailing sentiment of impatience and uncertainty among investors, sharing why he still remains bullish. Clemente‚Äôs bullish sentiment draws from a long-term perspective over the next decade. Drawing upon his expertise in portfolio construction and asset allocation, Clemente emphasized the importance of identifying major economic trends likely to unfold over the next decade. ‚ÄúBeen thinking a lot about portfolio construction lately and position sizing. I keep coming back to there‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôd rather go into a coma for 10 years and hold than Bitcoin,‚Äù Clemente stated, emphasizing his confidence in Bitcoin as the superior long-term asset. His analysis is grounded in the anticipation of certain macroeconomic trends. Clemente suggests that investors should consider what the biggest trends are likely to be over the next decade and adjust their portfolio accordingly. This involves either significantly increasing investment in the highest confidence trend or spreading investments across several promising trends based on their potential impact. Related Reading: Critical Bitcoin Indicator: Analyst Foresees Major 75% Correction Ahead He personally favors focusing on the most probable trend, which he identifies as the ongoing growth of the US deficit and the subsequent need for the government to debase the currency to service this debt. This scenario, according to Clemente, offers a more predictable outcome than other technological trends like AI or space exploration. ‚ÄúCompared to other technological trends, the debasement one is pure math. In addition, the way to bet on other technological trends, for example AI or space, isn‚Äôt as clear as debasement, given there‚Äôs not a way to position for it as clear as Bitcoin,‚Äù Clemente writes. How High Can Bitcoin Go In 10 Years? Clemente‚Äôs bullish stance on Bitcoin is reinforced by his analysis of potential capital inflows from sovereign wealth and pension funds. He estimates that if these entities were to allocate just 1% of their capital to Bitcoin, it would result in approximately $460 billion of new investments into BTC, potentially doubling its market cap and driving prices to between $150,000 and $200,000 per Bitcoin. He further speculates on the impact of an increased allocation, suggesting that if concerns over the deficit intensify, these institutions might allocate as much as 3%, translating into $1.4 trillion entering Bitcoin. And the upside potential is even larger. ‚ÄúWhat happens if it eats into the $10t-$15t of gold‚Äôs monetary premium? How about the combined monetary premium in treasuries/equities/real estate that‚Äôs currently parked into these assets as SoV to protect against currency debasement?‚Äù Clemente pondered. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Repeat History? Analyst Sees This 2019 Pattern In Current Market Concluding his analysis, Clemente reasoned that a $1 million price per Bitcoin by 2034 is not out of the realm of possibility when factoring in the reduced purchasing power of the dollar. ‚ÄúAlso would like to sprinkle on top that this is not factoring in dollars being worth significantly less in the future due to debasement, so $1mm BTC in 2034 is not as crazy as $1mm BTC in 2024,‚Äù the analyst remarked. However, Clemente also acknowledged, ‚ÄúI do think Bitcoin‚Äôs days of 100%+ CAGR are gone, but that‚Äôs not to say it won‚Äôt outperform equity indices by a lot ‚Äî and on a confidence-adjusted basis, I don‚Äôt see anything as compelling in the marketplace today.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $56,481.

42390456,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1skX,1725485038,Siemens Issues $330M Digital Bond on Private Blockchain with Major German Banks Including Deutsche Bank,"The company used the permissioned, private blockchain of fintech firm SWIAT and the Bundesbank's trigger solution for settlement.  The issuance was part of a European Central Bank's trial to settle central bank money on blockchains.  German industrial giant Siemens AG said Wednesday that it issued a 300 million euro ($330 million) digital bond on blockchain rails as part of a European Central Bank's (ECB) trial.  Major German financial institutions BayernLB, DekaBank, DZ BANK, Helaba and Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg (LBBW) invested in the bond. Deutsche Bank also participated facilitating the settlement process.  Siemens said in a blog post that it built upon the company's previous experience gained during last year's 60 million euro bond issuance via Polygon {{MATIC}}, which then required two days (T+2) for settling the transaction.  ""Automated processing within a few minutes shows the enormous potential of this new technology and confirms our strategy of playing a leading role in continuously shaping the digital transformation,"" said Peter Rathgeb, Corporate Treasurer of Siemens.  The latest transaction was settled via SWIAT, a private permissioned blockchain, the company said.  Siemens' bond issuance is the latest example of traditional institutions exploring ways to put traditional financial instruments such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchain rails. The process, also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), promises operational benefits such as faster and more transparent transaction settlements, lower costs and greater efficiency and transparency.  Last month, CoinDesk reported that KfW, the largest development bank in Germany, teamed up with Boerse Stuttgart Digital (BSD) in preparation for a digital bond issuance. Italy's state-owned development bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA (CDP) and lender Intesa Sanpaolo also completed a bond issuance on Polygon in July. Both issuances were part of ECB trials.

33191765,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639729,1725480005,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Behavior Reminiscent Of 2019 As BTC Remains Below $60,000","A recent Quicktake analysis on the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant highlighted how Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term holders‚Äô (STH) behaviour is similar to that of 2019. This analysis comes as Bitcoin remains below $60,000, continuing the bearish September trend. Peak In Bitcoin‚Äôs Short-Term Holders Similar To 2019 Structure CryptoQuant contributor Avocado_onchain noted that there had been a ‚Äúsmall peak‚Äù in Unspent Transaction Outputs (UXTOs) under six months, which resembles a similar structure observed in 2019. The analyst explained that these UXTOs under six months are new investors (or short-term holders) who entered the market around March of this year when Bitcoin‚Äôs price hit a new all-time high (ATH). According to the analyst, the declining proportion of these UXTOs suggests that these investors have either exited the market due to Bitcoin‚Äôs choppy price action since March or have held and now transitioned to long-term holders (UTXOs of six months and above). The accompanying chart showed that a similar structure occurred around the halving event in 2019 when Bitcoin also reached a local high. After that, Bitcoin‚Äôs price cooled off and took almost 490 days to hit a new ATH, although Avocado_onchain noted that there was also the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development undoubtedly provides insights into what Bitcoin investors could expect from the flagship crypto in the long term, even though its price remains choppy. Avocado_onchain remarked that he is confident about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upward trend. However, in the short term, he believes it will be wise for investors to ‚Äútemper expectations and closely monitor the market.‚Äù Meanwhile, although the analyst admitted that there is no clear trigger for a Bitcoin breakout, he noted that the influx of capital from new investors has historically been vital for Bitcoin‚Äôs price increases. Bitcoin hit a new ATH in March following the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which introduced new money into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Looks To Continue Bearish September Trend Bitcoin looks to continue its bearish September trend this year, with the flagship crypto already down by over 4% since the month began. Historically, September is known to be a bearish month, as data from Coinglass shows that Bitcoin has suffered a monthly loss in six out of the last seven September, dating back to 2017. Related Reading: Major Dogecoin Indicator Flashes Bullish, Is It Time To Buy? Following his simulation of Bitcoin‚Äôs price for this month, CryptoQuant‚Äôs Head of Research, Julio Moreno, mentioned that, on average, the flagship crypto could end the month at $55,000. Moreno had earlier mentioned that a drop below $56,000 for Bitcoin puts the crypto at risk of a deeper price correction and entering a prolonged bearish phase. For now, the crypto community hopes that the US Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for September 17 and 18. A rate cut is believed to be one that could trigger Bitcoin‚Äôs price and lead to a successful breakout above $60,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $56,400, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index sentiment indicator sank to deep fear levels similar to the lows in early July and August.  Investor sentiment is so negative that a ""tradable local bottom"" could be close, Lekker Capital's Thompson said.  Continuing downward price action in crypto may be about to reverse in a big way, at least in the short term based on the readings of one popular sentiment indicator.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} during Wednesday U.S. trade recovered to around $58,000 from an earlier low of $55,600, now about flat over the past 24 hours, as is ether {{ETH}}. The broader crypto market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index was up 1% as native tokens of Solana {{SOL}}, Near {{NEAR}} and the Internet Computer Protocol {{ICP}} outperformed the two largest cryptos.  The price action happened as the widely-followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index returned to deep ""fear"" territory, sinking to as low as 26 out of 100 in the past few days. The metric represents market enthusiasm towards bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies, with zero showing extreme fear and 100 corresponding to extreme greed.  ""With recession fears reaching a fever pitch and crypto sentiment washed out, I believe we are at or very close to a tradable local bottom,"" Quinn Thompson, founder of digital asset hedge fund Lekker Capital, wrote in a Wednesday update.  Thompson pointed out that the U.S.-listed bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday saw their biggest daily outflow since May 1, which interestingly corresponded to a local bottom in bitcoin's price at $56,500. BTC then rebounded 27% in three weeks to $72,000.  And that's not the only time low levels Crypto Fear & Greed Index offered tactical long opportunities over the past few months.  The metric fell to 25 in early July as BTC plummeted to $53,000 amid sell pressure from the German and U.S. governments and Mt. Gox distributions. Prices then climbed 32% to nearly $70,000 by the end of the month. The early August crash to $49,000 pushed the index into the extreme fear zone of 17, subsequent to which bitcoin rebounded 32% to $65,000 in three weeks.

42390464,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1tKR,1725475832,The Protocol: The Secret Code Behind Trump Family Crypto Project,"It's been well reported that the allure of crypto has proven too much to resist for the family of former President Donald Trump, even in the midst of a major national campaign with fewer than two months to the election. CoinDesk reporters managed to get their hands on the secret ""white paper"" that lays out the family's plan to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet.""  ALSO:  Binance executive detained in Nigerian prison limps, curses in new video.  DeFi protocol Penpie hit by $27M exploit.  ZKsync developer Matter Labs cuts 16% of staff.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Lombard, Arbitrum, Cardano, Ripple, Polygon.  $67 million of blockchain project fundraisings.  Exclusive interview with Mark Karpeles, former CEO of the infamous crypto exchange Mt. Gox.  CoinDesk 20 index member performance rankings during an ugly August. (Spoiler alert: Aptos's APT token was the only gainer.)  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network News  The similarities are remarkable between the user interfaces for Dough Finance, left, and now-deleted code from World Liberty Financial (GitHub)  DEFI DON: It's only been a few weeks since The Protocol detailed Donald Trump's family's increasingly cozy relationship with blockchain, with son Eric Trump tweeting he had ""fallen in love with crypto"" and former president's own words inspiring scads of mostly worthless and duplicative memecoins. On Aug. 23, the elder Trump promoted a forthcoming decentralized finance (DeFi) platform called ""The DeFiant Ones"" to his 7.5 million followers on the social application Truth Social, before last week announcing that the endeavor would instead be called ""World Liberty Financial,"" part of a plan to make the U.S. ""the crypto capital of the planet."" Details remained scant, but a few of my CoinDesk colleagues have managed to scrape public sources and track down documents to bring more of the Trumps' plan to light.  As reported by our Danny Nelson, metadata associated with the website worldlibertyfinancial.com says ""the only crypto DeFi platform supported by Donald J. Trump"" will connect users to ""decentralized finance's best tools for secure, high-yield crypto investments."" It calls on users to ""join the financial revolution today!"" A trademark filed for World Liberty Financial in mid-July also points to an association with DeFi, and the lawyer who filed the trademark papers, Alex Golubitsky, confirmed to CoinDesk late last week that the trademark relates to Trump's crypto ventures.  Then on Tuesday, CoinDesk's Sam Kessler, along with Nelson and Cheyenne Ligon, reported on a secret white paper for World Liberty Financial that the president's inner circle has been privately shopping around. The story reads: ""The document and other reporting describe a borrowing and lending service strikingly similar to Dough Finance, a recently hacked blockchain app built by four people listed as World Liberty Financial team members. Other participants include all three of Trump's sons, including 18-year-old Barron, who is identified as the project's 'DeFi visionary.'"" (DeFi is short for ""decentralized finance."")  The project's figurehead is none other than the Republican presidential nominee himself, bearing the title, ""Chief Crypto Advocate,"" with Eric and Donald Trump Jr. involved as ""Web3 Ambassadors.""  As if this weren't all entertaining enough, the project is reportedly aided by a cast of characters who, in other times and other contexts, might give campaign-vetters pause. They include Zachary Folkman, listed in the white paper as World Liberty Financial's head of operations, and Chase Herro, its data and strategies lead. A limited liability corporation for World Liberty Financial is registered to Folkman, who, along with Herro, is the co-creator of Subify, which bills itself as a censorship-free competitor to both Patreon and OnlyFans ‚Äì both services that let customers pay content creators, with the latter skewing toward explicit content. Folkman previously registered a company called Date Hotter Girls LLC and posted seminars on YouTube on how to pick up women. Herro has appeared as a guest on popular podcasts including YouTuber Logan Paul's podcast ""Impaulsive,"" where he has discussed his past stints in prison for drug-related charges, and how he got rich as a ""self-made businessman.""  Herro, Folkman, World Liberty Financial and the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In an epilogue: Shortly after CoinDesk reported on project's whitepaper, social-media accounts for at least two Trump family members were hacked in an apparent effort to promote a crypto scam.  On Wednesday, the team reported that the current plan calls for some 70% of project's new WLFI tokens will go to project insiders, an unusually high proportion that compares with 5%-20% in other examples.  ELSEWHERE:  ""I'm not okay, this is f*cked up,"" Tigran Gambaryan, the Binance executive who has been detained in Nigeria since February, exclaimed at a prison guard in a video uploaded to X on Monday afternoon. Gambaryan was limping, and his lawyers claim he needs medical care for conditions developed in prison, including malaria, pneumonia, tonsillitis and complications from a herniated disc. CoinDesk reported on Wednesday that a Nigerian court deferred a decision on his latest bail application, with the next hearing on the topic scheduled for Oct. 9.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Penpie, built on top of tokenized yield platform Pendle, suffered an exploit on Wednesday that saw roughly $27 million of crypto assets drained, including various types of staked ether (ETH), Ethena's sUSDE and wrapped USDC stablecoin.  Matter Labs, the main developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 protocol ZKsync, laid off 16% of its employees as part of a restructuring to adapt to ""the different type of technology and support"" developers building on system now require, CEO Alex Gluchowski said in a post on X. Just last week, Gluchowski had done a round of media interviews during a visit New York, talking up plans to ""solve the fragmentation"" resulting from the explosion in competing layer-2 projects.  Mt. Gox Wouldn't Have Happened With Modern Tools, Mark Karpeles Says  Mark Karpeles (left), former CEO of Mt. Gox, talking to CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds at Korea Blockchain Week on Sept. 4. (Parikshit Mishra/CoinDesk)  As Mt. Gox wrapped up its bankruptcy redemption payments, it ended a nearly decade-long legacy, and the book is closed on what might be the greatest hack in all of crypto.  Mark Karpeles, the failed exchange‚Äôs CEO, was once a hated man in the crypto community, and Japanese prosecutors wanted to send him away for a decade. But now, Karpeles belongs to an exclusive club of the 1% which have fought the law in Japan and won ‚Äì something nearly unheard of in a country with a 99% conviction rate where the justice system prefers to coerce confessions rather than contest a case.  Now, with all this behind him, Karpeles is off on a new adventure: launching a new crypto exchange called EllipX, which takes the best modern practices of exchanges and lessons learned from Mt. Gox as well as continuing work on a crypto ratings agency called Ungox.  ‚ÄúI can say very confidently that Mt. Gox hack wouldn't have happened if we had even some of the tools we have today,‚Äù Karpeles said in an interview with CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds at Korea Blockchain Week in Seoul.  Read the full story by CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Schematic illustrating Lombard's V1 architecture (Lombard)  Lombard has publicly launched LBTC, a ""cross-chain, yield-bearing Bitcoin token designed for DeFi use."" According to the team: ""The launch follows a successful private beta that attracted more than $165 million in deposits from over 600 institutional allocators. LBTC allows users to stake Bitcoin through Babylon and utilize it across various DeFi protocols. Initial integrations include major DeFi protocols such as Symbiotic, Morpho, Pendle, Corn, Gauntlet, Derive, EtherFi and Gearbox.""  Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network atop Ethereum with $14.1 billion of total value locked, launched the Stylus upgrade on Tuesday, adding support for WebAssembly languages like Rust, C and C++, and expanding beyond Solidity, which has been the standard for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.  Cardano, the layer-1 blockchain launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, activated its highly anticipated ‚ÄúChang‚Äù upgrade on Sunday, marking the ecosystem's long-planned shift towards decentralized governance.  Ripple is enhancing the XRP Ledger by integrating Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via a new sidechain, expanding its functionality beyond basic transactions to include complex applications like decentralized exchanges and token issuance.  Polygon, a layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, was on track to activate an upgrade on Wednesday that swaps out its longstanding MATIC token for a new POL token, allowing for more flexibility on issuance of new supply.  Money Center  Fundraisings  Hypernative, a real-time monitoring, risk detection and automated response platform for Web3, raised a $16 million Series A round.

33189453,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639766,1725474649,Is Chainlink (LINK) Sliding To $9? On-Chain Metrics Expose Weak Network Activity,"Chainlink (LINK) is at a crucial level after a sharp 22% retrace from recent local highs, sparking concern among investors and analysts. The recent downturn is compounded by unsettling on-chain data that suggests Chainlink‚Äôs network activity may weaken, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the asset. This decline in activity, coupled with broader market volatility, has heightened fears of further losses. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Could Drop To $8 If It Loses Current Support: On-Chain Data Reveals If the current bearish sentiment persists, LINK will likely test the next significant demand level around the lower $9 mark. This level is critical for determining the asset‚Äôs short-term future. A break below could signal deeper declines, while a successful defense might provide a foundation for recovery. Investors are closely watching these developments, as the coming days will be pivotal for Chainlink‚Äôs price direction and overall market sentiment. Chainlink Driven By Low Network Activity Chainlink (LINK) has recently faced significant selling pressure driven by more than just market speculation. A decline in network activity also plays a crucial role in the ongoing bearish trend. According to key data from Santiment, the price-Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence currently stands at -56.35%. This negative divergence suggests a disconnect between Chainlink‚Äôs price and user engagement, signaling potential trouble. The DAA metric is vital for understanding whether network activity supports price movements. Generally, when active addresses, which measure user participation on a blockchain, increase with the price, it indicates strong underlying demand. It can suggest that the cryptocurrency is poised for higher values. On the other hand, if network activity rises while the price declines, it often presents a buying opportunity, signaling that the market may soon reverse. Related Reading: Can Avalanche (AVAX) Reclaim $30? Top Analyst Predicts A Dip Before A Bounce However, the current decrease in DAA for Chainlink paints a less optimistic picture. This drop indicates that user engagement isn‚Äôt supporting recent price action, a typically bearish factor. An increase in network activity is essential for LINK to see any meaningful consolidation and potential recovery. Without a corresponding rise in DAA, the cryptocurrency may struggle to break free from its current downtrend. Investors are closely monitoring this metric, as a continued decline in network activity could lead to further downward pressure on Chainlink‚Äôs price, possibly pushing it toward lower support levels. LINK‚Äôs $9 Lifeline Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $10.24, following a dip below the August 16 low of $9.92. LINK quickly recovered after briefly touching $9.84, signaling demand at this level. However, despite this bounce, LINK remains below the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA), a critical technical indicator currently at $10.80. Analysts see this MA as a key level, and a successful move above it could indicate a shift in momentum, potentially pushing LINK toward the next resistance at around $11.50. Conversely, if LINK fails to hold its current position and slips further, a deeper correction could drag the price to sub-$9 levels.

42390465,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1s5V,1725472096,How Ethereum 2.0 Can Transform DeFi,"The SEC‚Äôs decision in June to drop charges against Ethereum was a milestone in the platform‚Äôs journey toward maturity and greater acceptance in the financial world.  For those who didn‚Äôt follow the case, the SEC believed ether (ETH) was sold as an unregistered stock, with concerns that it was being sold without following certain rules and protocols. However, Ethereum‚Äôs proponents argued that, since the network is decentralized, it does not meet the criteria of an investment contract or security.  While the SEC may have decided against direct legal action, it did open the door for further discussions around centralization. Some technological aspects of Ethereum‚Äôs architecture have stimulated an important dialogue around contracting power among influential entities. While these discourses are mainly internal, addressing these concerns can enhance the network‚Äôs upgrade goals and support true decentralization.  This is especially true as the network tries to embody the ideals of ‚ÄúEthereum 2.0,‚Äù the stronger, more accessible, and more practical version of its token and infrastructure. Some say it‚Äôs already here, while others point out gaps that still need to be filled to definitively claim its arrival.  Yes, Ethereum 2.0 holds significant potential for transforming DeFi and the broader ecosystem, but we can‚Äôt just have a foot halfway through the door. To reach its full potential, key developments still have to be reached.  Validator centralization  By transitioning to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism in September 2022, Ethereum now allows validators to stake ETH, with large stakes increasing validation chances and rewards. This upgrade clearly underscores Ethereum‚Äôs key role in DeFi by sparking countless innovative financial tools being created on the network for lending and trading, among other use cases.  However, emphasizing token ownership over the number of validators could potentially concentrate power among smaller groups, going against crypto‚Äôs ethos of decentralization. Moreover, staking requires an input of 32 ETH, meaning that validators with significant ETH staked can wield disproportionate influence over network governance and decision-making processes. This creates a feedback loop that favors certain participants, and can lead to power and wealth accumulating in the hands of a few individuals.  In March, Vitalik Buterin even expressed his concerns about ‚Äúlazy stakers,‚Äù or those who engage solely in staking pools rather than solo staking ‚Äî clearly indicating the relevance of the centralization issue.  At its core, Ethereum represents a shift in the way financial services are designed, accessed, and utilized. However, relying on a few entities continues to introduce risks and questions about how decentralized Ethereum 2.0 really is.  Shifting gears to DeFi  Ethereum‚Äôs path towards centralization sets the stage for more severe complications down the line ‚Äî namely with regulators and reduced network resilience. Ultimately, Ethereum‚Äôs future within DeFi and the blockchain ecosystem as a whole hinges on balancing technical advancements while limiting centralization wherever possible. And there are ways to make it achievable.  If implemented correctly, concepts like rainbow staking could further enhance Ethereum‚Äôs adaptability while also combatting centralization. In essence, rainbow staking allows users to stake ETH across multiple pools and strategies simultaneously, effectively creating a ‚Äúrainbow of rewards‚Äù, so to speak, that stakers receive while mitigating anti-competitive risks and building a more resilient ecosystem. The ETH validation process is separated into ‚Äúheavy‚Äù and ‚Äúlight‚Äù staking ‚Äî with ‚Äúheavy‚Äù focusing on validation services for finalization and ‚Äú‚Äòlight‚Äù staking zeroing in on censorship resistance of transactions.  For example, liquid staking protocols like Lido or Rocket could offer heavy service staking, while existing stakers can opt to run light service operators. Rainbow staking will eventually result in a more efficient and competitive network while granting more liquid staking provider diversity. However, executing it won‚Äôt be easy and could add confusion to the overall staking structure.  Beyond rainbow staking, Ethereum could leverage network-wide advancements already introduced in its initial 2.0 updates, like sharding. While sharding has been scrutinized for its security issues, justifying the shift to Layer 2 and zero-knowledge developments, that doesn‚Äôt mean the technology should be outright abandoned.  We have seen evolutions here thanks to developments like ‚Äúdanksharding‚Äù specifically for Layer 2s. Danksharding involves proposer-builder separation (PBS), a deviation from how Ethereum validators function now ‚Äî proposing and broadcasting blocks entirely on their own. Instead, PBS shares the love and splits up these tasks among multiple validators.  Ultimately, danksharding helps implement data availability, allowing validators to verify blob data quickly and efficiently, while simultaneously identifying missing data.  The aim here is to make transactions on Layer 2 as cheap as possible for users and scale Ethereum to validate over 100,000 transactions per second. This would allow dApps such as Uniswap to process transactions at a significantly lower cost with quicker transaction approval times.  However, danksharding‚Äôs highly technical infrastructure and implementation leave out smaller rollups and potentially encourage centralization. So, while the technology has fallen out of favor as is, its benefits in reducing hardware and helping scalability show that the technology itself could be improved upon to benefit the next generation of Ethereum. Perhaps an Ethereum 3.0.  Ethereum 2.0‚Äôs significant strides in the regulatory and decentralization arenas shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. Reducing the network‚Äôs reliance on small groups of actors for network operations and legal wins are all positive steps forward. However, the next phase of Ethereum as a network must include adapting to evolving legal requirements to firmly establish itself as a transformative force in DeFi and mainstream blockchain usage alike.  Despite these hurdles, Ethereum 2.0‚Äôs current achievements have set the ecosystem on the right path. By focusing on the future and reaffirming a commitment to decentralization, Ethereum has the force behind it to maintain a dominant role as an innovator in the blockchain landscape.  Getting its affairs in order is just a small part of cementing its legacy.

42390460,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1szv,1725471251,Building Robust Digital Asset Custody Solutions: Key Considerations,"In the rapidly evolving digital finance landscape, securing digital assets is a paramount challenge. As an expert in custody engineering, I'd like to share some critical considerations for building a sophisticated custody architecture that effectively safeguards digital assets.  A robust custody solution should consider advanced technologies to ensure the security and integrity of stored value. One option is a private and permissioned blockchain, which can serve as the backbone for transaction integrity and auditing, providing a reliable mechanism for tracking asset movements. The design of such blockchains assures that transactions are both auditable and immutable, which is crucial for maintaining trust and security. While a simple database can provide some of these functions, a private blockchain delivers them out of the box, offering enhanced security, transparency, and reliability.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Using a private blockchain offers several strategic advantages. It enhances security through cryptographic proofs, requiring authorization for transactions and block signing. This ensures all operations are traceable and protected against tampering, establishing a secure infrastructure critical for asset protection. Each transaction is authorized via private keys that are rigorously managed within a secure infrastructure, establishing cryptographically provable states.  The private blockchain operates under a zero-trust model, rigorously validating every transaction, block, and signature independently. This extensive cross-validation forms a comprehensive safety net, ensuring all operations adhere to the highest security standards. Every transaction is immutably and permanently recorded, allowing for full traceability from inception to execution, which supports regulatory compliance and operational auditing.  Smart contracts are another essential technology. These contracts automate and enforce security protocols, executing automatically under specific conditions. This automation establishes consistent adherence to predefined rules and reduces the potential for human error, streamlining processes and enhancing the scalability of operations.  Moreover, the smart contracts on a private blockchain execute transactions with deterministic outcomes, generating consistently predictable and reliable results. This consistency is crucial for maintaining the integrity of core business processes and supports repeatable validation processes essential for auditing and regulatory compliance.  Adopting Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Secure Computing provides robust protection against both internal collusion and external attacks. This approach enhances the security of transaction signatures by ensuring no single party holds the complete authority, adding an additional layer of security by decentralizing and distributing control over assets.  Additionally, incorporating specialized oracles that interface securely with external data sources is vital. These oracles validate compliance and operational data in real-time, providing alignment with current regulations and market conditions. For instance, an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Oracle can integrate seamlessly with compliance systems to monitor and verify transactions, maintaining rigorous compliance standards.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) significantly enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of custody systems. Beyond traditional anomaly detection through machine learning, Generative AI can be leveraged for test automation, improving the capability for writing effective unit and integration tests. This application of AI shifts quality assurance earlier in the development process and integrates more deeply into workflows, promising improved efficiency and a better developer experience.  Continuous development and optimization of these technologies are essential for maintaining a robust custody environment. By understanding and integrating these elements, companies can build secure and efficient digital asset custody solutions that set new benchmarks in the industry.

42390463,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1tAB,1725470451,A Hunt for Yield: The Next Chapter in Crypto Portfolio Optimization,"As the cryptocurrency market establishes new higher ground, led by key assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, investors are increasingly focused on optimizing their portfolios. While the resilience and growth potential of these major cryptocurrencies are clear, the evolving challenge in this maturing market is the hunt for yield ‚Äî particularly for Bitcoin holders and those seeking effective collateral options.  The Yield Gap in Bitcoin  Bitcoin‚Äôs primary appeal has always been its potential for significant capital appreciation. However, unlike Ethereum and Solana, which offer staking rewards to holders, Bitcoin lacks a straightforward method for generating yield. Traditionally, investors have resorted to lending their Bitcoin to earn interest. Yet, this approach carried significant risks, particularly due to rehypothecation, where assets were used as collateral for further lending. This practice led to a credit bubble that ultimately burst in 2022, resulting in widespread insolvencies and a loss of trust in many facets of the market.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A New Path: Tokenized Money Market Funds  The fallout from the 2022 crisis has pushed the industry to innovate. One of the most promising developments has been the rise of tokenized money market funds. These funds offer a way to generate yield with the speed and efficiency of crypto combined with the safety of government-backed Treasury bills. Unlike stablecoins, which are also backed by similar assets but often fail to provide yield, tokenized money market funds offer an efficient option for collateral and margining purposes, aligning with the needs of investors seeking both yield and safety.  Tokenized Money Market Funds  Source: RWA.xyz | Tokenized Treasury, Treasury Product Metrics, Treasury Market Caps, Grouped by Issuer Data as of August 28, 2024   Growth of Tokenized Money Market Funds  Source: RWA.xyz | Tokenized Treasuries, Top Entities Issuer Data as of August 28, 2024  Innovative Yield Strategies  In addition to these funds, some of the top digital asset managers have devised strategies to generate yield on long Bitcoin positions without the need for lending. By entering into carefully selected derivatives structures, investors can earn options-yield while retaining segregated custody of their assets and without sacrificing upside. This approach addresses the dual challenge of income generation and asset security, offering a viable alternative for long-term holders who have traditionally relied on buy-and-hold strategies.  The hunt for yield in crypto is evolving. As the market matures, integrating yield-generating mechanisms like tokenized money market funds and secure options vaults will likely become essential for professional portfolios. These innovations represent a new frontier in crypto investment, where the focus is not just on capital appreciation but also on generating steady, reliable income. For investors, this marks a significant shift‚Äîone that could redefine the role of crypto in diversified portfolios.

33186865,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639754,1725469202,"Bitcoin Bearish Move: Indicators Suggest Next Stop Could Be $53,541","Bitcoin faces mounting pressure as crucial indicators signal a potential drop to the $53,541 mark. With sellers gaining momentum and technical charts flashing red, the cryptocurrency is struggling to find a foothold in a volatile market. Traders are watching closely to see if the bearish trend will continue or if a reversal is on the horizon as BTC hovers near critical support levels. The next few days could be crucial in determining Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term trajectory. As Bitcoin faces increasing selling pressure, this article explores the recent bearish signals affecting its price movement, analyzing key technical indicators that suggest a potential drop to $53,541. By examining the critical support levels to watch, insights into whether BTC will find stability or continue its slide will be provided. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $56,691, reflecting a 4.04% decline with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion and a trading volume surpassing $31 billion. Over the past 24 hours, BTC‚Äôs market cap has dropped by 3.96%, while trading volume has surged by 22.55%. Analyzing BTC‚Äôs Recent Price Action And Key Indicators On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has displayed strong bearish momentum below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) following its failure to break above the $60,152 mark. The price is now attempting to fall toward the $53,541 mark. If the cryptocurrency successfully breaches this key level, it could begin a more pronounced downtrend, potentially driving the price down to other crucial support levels. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the 50% mark, currently resting at 32%. This decline highlights growing bearish momentum and suggests that selling pressure could intensify. On the daily chart, BTC is showing significant negative movement below the 100-day SMA by printing two bearish momentum candlesticks. This downbeat surge reflects strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of BTC reaching the $53,541 mark soon. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows that bearish pressure on BTC is intensifying. The signal line has recently dropped below 50%, now resting at 39%, which also signals growing selling pressure and a pessimistic sentiment for the digital asset. Investor Outlook: Preparing For Bitcoin Potential Downside With bearish pressure mounting and key indicators pointing to further declines, Bitcoin appears poised to drop to the $53,541 mark. Should the cryptocurrency breach this level, it could signal a more significant pessimistic move, potentially driving the price down to the next support at $50,604 and beyond. However, if Bitcoin hits the $53,541 support level and the bulls manage to stage a comeback, the price could start moving upward toward the $60,152 resistance mark. A successful breach of this resistance might lead BTC to test its all-time high of $73,811, with the potential to set a new record if it surpasses this level.

Over the course of last month, subpoenas from James' office were sent to some venture capital firms that have invested in decentralized-finance giant Uniswap, including Andreessen Horowitz (widely known as a16z) and Union Square Ventures, the two sources said.  A spokesperson for Uniswap said via email: ""Uniswap Labs is a proud 'Made in New York' pioneer of DeFi technology, which offers a path for all of us to better, fairer access to financial services. We don't wish the burden of unnecessary subpoenas on anyone. But we welcome dialogue any time with any government agency or elected official about the future we can build together when we champion responsible DeFi innovation, especially in our home state.""  The NYAG's office and Union Square Ventures did not respond to a request for comment, while a16z declined to comment.

The SEC also reportedly recently sent letters regarding Uniswap to a16z and Union Square Ventures.

42390452,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1sQ1,1725467577,Nigeria‚Äôs Crypto Thaw: Not What It Seems,"The past couple of weeks have seen a couple of big crypto-related developments in Nigeria, the very same country which until recently had a complete ban on platform crypto trading.  One is that Nigeria (population: 233 million) is preparing a crypto tax proposal ‚Äî if the government is planning to tax it, then the government is planning to support its use. Although, as we saw with India, tax policy can be wielded to dampen crypto activity.  Another is that the country‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted its first official licenses to two crypto exchanges, Busha and Quidax. It has also admitted five crypto asset startups (Trovotech, Wrapped CBDC, HXAfrica, Dream City Capital and Blockvault Custodian) into a pre-registration regime designed to ‚Äútest run‚Äù digital asset business models.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  This is a big about-face for a government that has so far seemed determined to dampen crypto interest. In 2021, it banned commercial banks from servicing of crypto firms . While financial institutions still can‚Äôt trade or hold crypto themselves, the ban was removed last December and initial licensing requirements were established.  No real change  It hasn‚Äôt been smooth sailing for the industry since then. Far from it. In February, access to Nigerian exchanges was reportedly blocked (in some cases temporarily), and officials detained two Binance executives that had flown to Nigeria to help sort out issues with the tax authorities. One later escaped, but Tigran Gambaryan ‚Äî a U.S. citizen ‚Äî is currently still in a Nigerian jail, charged with money laundering and currency speculation (the charge of tax fraud was recently dropped).  In April, four of Nigeria‚Äôs leading fintech platforms were blocked from onboarding new customers because of their use by crypto traders, and over 1,100 bank accounts linked to crypto traders were frozen. Not long after, Nigeria‚Äôs National Security Adviser classified crypto trading as a national security issue. According to officials, the crypto market is largely to blame for the country‚Äôs currency woes, not the eye-watering inflation, fiscal mismanagement and social unrest.  The ‚Äúbig stick‚Äù approach seems to be softening, however. In May, the agency appointed Emomotimi Agama, a self-declared crypto and fintech ‚Äúenthusiast,‚Äù to the post of Director General.  Finally, there seem to be moves to encourage crypto ecosystem development, while insisting on regulation. Why the change of heart?  Economics at work  Let‚Äôs start with the optimistic scenarios:  It could be that the authorities finally recognize the popular support. According to crypto forensics firm Chainalysis, Nigeria‚Äôs ‚Äúadoption‚Äù index was the second highest in the world in 2023 (after India). The rationale could be that removing a few crypto restrictions just might deflect some of the anger seen in last month‚Äôs nationwide protests. Branded with the hashtag #EndBadGovernance, these were triggered by the rising cost of living amid inflation of almost 35%, and resulted in more than 20 dead and over 1,000 arrested (some of whom face possible death penalty).  Another factor for the government‚Äôs shift could be the potential for investment. Nigeria desperately needs investors to start trusting its markets again. Capital flight is a deep concern in a country struggling with an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù depreciation against the US dollar of over 45% so far this year.  Against this backdrop, any boost to capital retention or inflow would be welcome. Nigeria accounts for roughly 60% of all crypto trading volume in Africa, and the size of its potential market could attract investment not just in the assets themselves, but also in businesses building related services.  This could in turn encourage the development of better market infrastructure around the region, as other jurisdictions follow Nigeria‚Äôs regulatory lead. A couple of weeks ago, the central bank of Ghana published proposed licensing rules for crypto exchanges.  The real incentive  A more likely motive, however, is the potential for greater control over crypto trading and investment. One of the reported reasons for the arrest of the Binance executives was their refusal to hand over client data. We can assume that the newly licensed platforms will be more cooperative with the state.  And in May, Nigeria‚Äôs SEC proposed rules banning P2P crypto trading. I haven‚Äôt seen the text, but it‚Äôs likely it contains severe penalties for anyone caught doing so. After all, earlier this year, authorities arrested around 200 foreign exchange agents (many of them street traders) for ‚Äúmarket manipulation.‚Äù  Furthermore, it‚Äôs worth noting that the two licenses mentioned above were granted under the SEC‚Äôs ‚ÄúAccelerated Regulatory Incubation Program,‚Äù which allows limited activity with close scrutiny from the regulator, and the possibility of shut-down at any time. None of the companies have full registration yet.  What‚Äôs more, banks arereportedly still reluctant to serve the few authorized crypto businesses, due to an understandable lack of confidence in the government‚Äôs approval.  So far, this isn‚Äôt looking like full support.  Crypto regulation in most of Africa is inevitable, as governments accept that trying to stop activity is futile. Note that Nigeria became the world‚Äôs second most ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù economy, according to the Chainalysis global adoption rankings, even after a blanket ban on crypto firms accessing fiat. For many of Africa‚Äôs youth, crypto trading is one of the very few available sources of income. And, for savers terrified of losing value amid painful inflation and freefall devaluation, holding crypto assets can be not just a lifeline, but also a way to access scarce dollars.  Read more: 'Why Are You Doing This to Me?': Detained Binance Exec Begs Prison Guard for Help in New Court Footage  It doesn‚Äôt hurt that, in naira terms, BTC is up almost 380% over the past year.  But obviously, increased regulation comes with greater control, and it remains to be seen just how much Nigerians care about the new framework, especially given the population‚Äôs low trustin their central bank andlaw-enforcement authorities.  Corporates and institutions can now trade/invest in crypto assets, but their participation in the crypto market also puts them on a list somewhere which means they could come under additional scrutiny. Also, their access can change on a whim.  If corporations and banks don‚Äôt yet trust the regulatory shift, why would the individual trader or saver? They just might decide that the P2P market, despite its illegality, is worth the risk.  And other jurisdictions developing their frameworks will hopefully take note that talking the regulatory talk is not enough, especially when trust in institutions ‚Äî one of the key drivers of the very industry the authorities want to control ‚Äî is low.

Related Reading: 21Shares Parent Firm Becomes Switzerland‚Äôs Crypto Giant As Gets Valued At $2B Commenting on the development, Alexandra Scriba, Head of Institutional Clients & Multinationals at Zurich Cantonal Bank said: Our newly launched offering in the area of cryptocurrencies offers a high level of security and allows the integration of additional currencies and applications. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the Zurich Cantonal Bank assumes the critical function of the safe custody of private keys. Customers and third-party banks therefore do not need their own wallet and therefore do not have to worry about storing their own private keys. The Zurich Cantonal Bank takes care of both. The press release notes that Zurich Cantonal Bank‚Äôs latest crypto offering isn‚Äôt just limited to its customers. The bank offers business-to-business (B2B) solutions that allow other Switzerland-based banks to provide their customers with crypto trading and custody services. Swiss cantonal bank, Thurgauer Kantonalbank is already leveraging this service. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt the bank‚Äôs first exposure to digital assets, as in 2021, the institution was involved in issuing the world‚Äôs first digital bond on the SIX Digital Exchange. Europe Continues To Embrace Bitcoin and Ethereum Europe‚Äôs history with cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin has been rather convoluted. Due to its strict privacy laws and lack of a standard regulatory framework for digital assets, businesses have typically steered clear of entering the emerging industry in Europe.

Uniswap developed a user interface and a set of smart contracts that let users trade tokens on the platform, the CFTC said. This included tokens developed by third parties ‚Äì meaning people who don't work for Uniswap ‚Äì that exposed investors to margined or leveraged returns against the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}.  ""During the Relevant Period, the digital assets traded on the Protocol through the Interface included a limited number of leveraged tokens, which provided users approximately 2:1 leveraged exposure to digital assets such as ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), both commodities in interstate commerce,"" a CFTC filing said.  Uniswap did not register as a designated contract market with the CFTC, and was not allowed to offer leveraged trading products as a result, the CFTC said.  CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger dissented with the application of rules intended for centralized platforms to decentralized ones.  ""This case has all the hallmarks of what we have come to know as regulation through enforcement: A settlement with a de minimis penalty that bears little relationship to the conduct alleged, sweeping statements about the broader industry that are not germane to the case at hand, and legal theories that have not been tested in court,"" she said, in a public statement shared alongside the CFTC's press release.  Uniswap took steps to try and block users from trading leveraged tokens, Mersinger said.  Fellow CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham also dissented, saying in a statement that the administrative record did not confirm whether the leverage tokens actually offered leverage, and criticizing the regulatory agency's approach to the enforcement action.  ""I must dissent on the basis that this administrative proceeding is both legally unsupported under the CEA and is a violation of the APA, in addition to the serious public policy concerns that this settlement order will create further regulatory uncertainty, put small cash market businesses in jeopardy of violating the law, and stifle American innovation,"" she said.  Uniswap Labs is also facing a potential enforcement action from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it received a Wells Notice in April, indicating the SEC believes it has enough evidence to start a lawsuit.  In a statement, Uniswap Chief Legal Officer Katherine Minarik said, ""today Uniswap Labs resolved a CFTC investigation, about a small fraction of a percent of trading through our interface related to a handful of tokens, for a $175k fine in a standard no admit-no deny settlement.

Of the remaining 30% of the tokens distributed via a public sale, the founding team will also receive a portion of the proceeds.  When asked if a 70% allocation to insiders is high, one source who advises projects on such matters replied, ""LMAO. Nice joke, ser.""  World Liberty Financial, the new crypto lending platform promoted by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his sons, advertises itself as a way of ""putting the power of finance back in the hands of the people"" and a solution to the ""rigged"" traditional finance system.  CoinDesk has obtained a draft white paper for the project. It reveals that the vast majority of the power promised by World Liberty Financial will be concentrated in the hands of a select few insiders: 70% of WLFI, the project's ""governance"" crypto token, will be ""held by the founders, team, and service providers.""  The remaining 30%, according to the white paper, will be distributed ""via public sale,"" with some of the money raised from that also going to project insiders ‚Äì though some will be reserved in a treasury ""to support World Liberty Financial's operations.""  A 70% allocation to insiders is unusually high. Ethereum's Genesis block reserved a combined 16.6% of ether {{ETH}} for the Ethereum Foundation and early contributors (though co-founder Vitalik Buterin later said they received even less). The three companies behind Cardano, another popular blockchain project, retained a combined 20% of ADA at its launch. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, is estimated to hold a little over 5% of the total supply.  Asked if a 70% allocation to insiders is high, one source who advises early stage projects replied: ""LMAO. nice joke ser.""  World Liberty Financial has not finalized its plans yet, according to a person close to the project.  ""The team is working with a lot of contributors, and we're not quite sure which version [of the white paper] you are referring to at the moment, but they have not finalized their tokenomics yet,"" according to a statement from World Liberty Financial. ""All the information we've shared so far that is final/approved can be found on WLF's Twitter (X) and Telegram. Those will be the main channels for any announcements.""  The token details from the draft white paper follow a CoinDesk report Tuesday about World Liberty Financial, which revealed that the project's team includes members of the Trump family plus people behind a recently hacked crypto app. CoinDesk also reported that World Liberty Financial will be built atop Aave, the popular Ethereum-based lending platform.  Read more: Inside the Trump Crypto Project Linked to a $2M DeFi Hack and Former Pick-Up Artist  World Liberty Financial's allocation raises the question of whether the project is an attempt to cash in on the Trump family's fame rather than build a novel DeFi platform. Pre-sale proceeds have historically been largely invested back into projects, to grow them. If insiders plan to hoard most of the World Liberty Financial money for themselves, how will it deliver on its lofty promises?  One of those lofty promises is to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet."" In a Wednesday Telegram post, the World Liberty Financial team advised skeptics that its ""plan will speak for itself. The brightest minds in crypto are backing us, and what's coming will make all doubters think twice.""  ""Our mission is crystal clear: Make crypto and America great by driving the mass adoption of stablecoins and decentralized finance,"" the post added. ""We believe that DeFi is the future, and we're committed to making it accessible and secure for everyone.  In general, public token pre-sales are rare in today's crypto industry, largely because initial coin offerings (ICOs) ‚Äì which were once the preferred method for crypto startups to raise funds by selling tokens directly to investors ‚Äì have fallen out of favor. This shift occurred due to increasing regulatory scrutiny, widespread fraud and the emergence of alternative fundraising models that offer more oversight and investor protections.  World Liberty Financial's approach differs from a traditional ICO, however, because the WLFI token will be non-transferable, meaning it cannot be traded between users. This restriction is likely intended to protect World Liberty Financial from securities law violations.  WLFI token that can't be transferred  According to the white paper, ""All $WLFI will be non-transferable and locked indefinitely in a wallet or smart contract until such time, if ever, $WLFI are unlocked through protocol governance procedures in a manner that does not contravene applicable law.""  It continues: ""Each purchaser of $WLFI will be screened to ensure that no specially designated nationals or other persons sanctioned by FinCen are permitted to purchase $WLFI."" ""FinCen"" seems to be a mistaken reference to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, a U.S. Treasury Department office that's distinct from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  Earlier this week, CoinDesk revealed World Liberty Financial's links to Dough Finance, a recently hacked lending app whose founders include Zak Folkman, a former pick-up artist and entrepreneur who is officially registered as the owner of World Liberty Financial LLC.  While Donald Trump appears to hope that World Liberty Financial could help him earn favor with the blockchain industry, even some of the former president's supporters in the industry are warning that the plan could backfire.  ""Is there something that we, as crypto twitter, can collectively do to stop the launch of world liberty coin,"" Nic Carter, a prominent crypto industry figure and Trump supporter, asked on X (formerly Twitter).  He added: ""I think it genuinely damages trump's electoral prospects, especially if it gets hacked (it'll be the juiciest DeFi target ever and it's forked from a protocol that itself was hacked). it's also an obvious target for the SEC. at best it's an unnecessary distraction, at worst it's a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble. so are we signing a petition or what?""  Ahead of its launch, the project has attracted the attention of fraudsters and hackers. Yesterday, the X accounts of Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump and Trump's youngest daughter Tiffany Trump were hacked and used to promote a crypto scam crafted to look like World Liberty Financial.  Read more: Trump Family Members Hacked to Promote Apparent Crypto Scam  Donald Trump is officially listed as the project's ""Chief Crypto Advocate."" His two oldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric, share the role of ""Web 3 Ambassador."" Barron Trump, the former president's 18-year-old son, is World Liberty Financial's ""DeFi Visionary.""  Though the Trump family appears to have been heavily involved in the promotion and inception of the project, the white paper takes pains to distance the project from any political affiliation, stating: ""World Liberty Financial is not owned, managed, operated, or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, or any of their respective family members, affiliates, or principals. However, they may own $WLFI and receive compensation from World Liberty Financial and its developers. World Liberty Financial and $WLFI are not political and have no affiliation with any political campaign.""  Danny Nelson contributed reporting to this story.

33184675,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639891,1725464764,"Bitcoin Analyst Points To $55,000 As Potential Bottom ‚Äì US Liquidity The Key","Bitcoin has been under intensified selling pressure since the start of the week, with the largest cryptocurrency experiencing a nearly 4% drop in value over the past seven days. This decline brought Bitcoin to a one-month low of $55,690 earlier on Wednesday, raising concerns among investors about its near-term trajectory. Could Fed Rate Cuts Drive Bitcoin Beyond $100,000? A market expert known as ‚ÄúChicken Genius‚Äù recently shared his insights on social media, suggesting that the $55,000 mark could represent a significant bottom for Bitcoin. He points to a notable surge in US liquidity, which has climbed to $6.117 trillion since the beginning of the month. Related Reading: Stunning Fall From Grace: Cardano Suffers 90% Plunge In Market Share Since ‚Äô21 This influx of liquidity could signal a potential reversal in the crypto market, providing the necessary support to bolster Bitcoin‚Äôs price and generate the buying pressure that has been notably absent in recent weeks following a failed attempt to consolidate above the key $60,000 threshold. In his analysis, Chicken Genius also highlighted expectations that US interest rates may decrease from 5 to 3 over the next six months. The expert argues that such a shift from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) could propel Bitcoin beyond the $100,000 mark, significantly exceeding its current all-time high of $73,700. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. Market Uncertainty Another analyst, known as Crypto Data, cautioned that historically, Bitcoin has dropped an average of 15% following five instances where the Federal Reserve cut rates. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could fall to around $48,000 from its current levels. This perspective reflects a more cautious stance amid the current economic climate, particularly given the proximity of the upcoming US elections in November, which could have significant implications for the BTC price and the entire market. Related Reading: Critical Bitcoin Indicator: Analyst Foresees Major 75% Correction Ahead Many believe that a potential victory for former President Donald Trump could lead to a looser regulatory climate and a surge in crypto prices, led by BTC, as the coin has been at the forefront of Trump‚Äôs plans in the US, such as paying off the country‚Äôs $35 trillion debt with BTC and creating a strategic reserve based on the cryptocurrency. To further complicate the situation, Crypto Data noted that historically, September has been bullish two-thirds of the time during Halving cycle years. This factor adds another layer of uncertainty, as it could also mean a notable boost for the Bitcoin price amid the broader bearish sentiment in the market. After falling towards the $55,690 mark, the leading cryptocurrency regained the $57,400 mark at the time of writing.

ZKB is handling the custody of crypto-assets a service that can be offered to other Swiss banks.  The fourth-largest bank in Switzerland, Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank (ZKB), has begun offering retail customers the ability to buy, sell and hold the two most popular cryptocurrencies: bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum {{ETH}}.  Thanks to a collaboration with Deutsche B√∂rse-owned digital assets broker Crypto Finance, customers of the cantonal bank will have access to BTC and ETH through ZKB‚Äôs existing Mobile App, eBanking, and other established channels, the companies said in a press release Wednesday.  Switzerland is ahead of the curve when it comes to digital assets, with many financial institutes offering customers ability to trade crypto in the country. ZKB is also no stranger to crypto innovation, as the bank was involved in the issuance of the world's first digital bond on Switzerland's SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) back in 2021.  ‚ÄúWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank takes on the critical function of securely storing the private keys. Customers and third-party banks therefore do not need their own wallet and therefore do not have to worry about storing their own private keys. Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank takes care of both,‚Äù said Alexandra Scriba, head of institutional clients and Multinationals at Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank, in a statement.  ZKB‚Äôs new service allows other Swiss banks to offer customers the trading and custody of cryptocurrencies, with Thurgauer Kantonalbank being the first partner bank to use the service.

33184146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639730,1725463805,Bitcoin Breakout: Pundit Shows Similarities Between 2023 And 2024,"A crypto pundit has identified striking similarities between the Bitcoin (BTC) market behavior in 2023 and 2024. Based on the analyst‚Äôs observation, he believes that Bitcoin is experiencing a comparable cycle of decline, characterized by widespread investor sell offs, which could precede a significant price breakout to new levels. Comparing The Bitcoin Markets Of 2023 And 2024 In a rather lengthy X (formerly Twitter) post on September 3, a crypto pundit identified as ‚ÄòDana Crypto Trades‚Äô shared some intriguing details about the current Bitcoin market, comparing it to the market environment and trends observed in 2023. The analyst noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs price fluctuated within a range for over six months, much like it did last year. Related Reading: Major Dogecoin Indicator Flashes Bullish, Is It Time To Buy? He highlighted that despite the cryptocurrency‚Äòs bearish performance, the expectations about the market‚Äôs future outlook in the fourth quarter of 2024 remain particularly optimistic. Last year, numerous crypto investors¬†chose to¬†sell off their Bitcoin holdings when they were¬†priced around $25,000, hoping to buy back at a lower value. This massive sell-off occurred despite the more than 90% probability that Spot Bitcoin ETFs would gain approval this year. Interestingly, A similar behavior is unfolding in the present Bitcoin market. The market sentiment has turned negative due to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price volatility, leading investors to become bearish. Most of these investors are now liquidating their holdings, with the expectation to repurchase it at a 10% to 20% lower price. Daana Crypto has warned that while trying to buy Bitcoin at a lower price might seem like a great investment strategy, it carries a significant amount of risks. Basically, if the market moves upwards instead of the expected decline, investors who sold their Bitcoin may miss out on substantial gains. He referenced a situation last year, where some investors had missed out on a 3X price increase in Bitcoin because they had sold off their coins and were waiting for a slight price dip. While providing insights into current market set up, Daan Crypto acknowledged that he is unable to predict Bitcoin‚Äôs short term market movements, therefore advises that investors remain cautious. He indicated that for most investors, holding Bitcoin over the long term might be the best strategy, especially if the market could witness a significant breakout to the upside once bearish trends turn stable. BTC Eyes Next Target At $100,000 In Q4 Another crypto analyst, known as ‚ÄòStockmoney Lizards,‚Äô on X has also drawn comparisons between Bitcoin‚Äôs current market patterns with those from the early years. Related Reading: Solana Sees 7,600% Surge In Institutional Inflows, Here‚Äôs Why He observed similar trends in Bitcoin‚Äôs price action in 2016 and 2024, indicating that the pioneer cryptocurrency could experience a comparable but less dramatic price increase to what was seen in 2016. Despite this, the crypto analyst has set a price target of $100,000 for Bitcoin by the end of Q4 2024.

33183256,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639883,1725462055,"Meme Titan DOGE Falls Behind New Dogecoin Competitor With Casino Utility, Here‚Äôs More","Dogecoin (DOGE), the reigning memecoin champion, is beginning to face stiff competition as new contenders enter the cryptocurrency space with added utility. One such competitor, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is making waves with its unique integration into the online casino industry, offering features that Dogecoin (DOGE) simply can‚Äôt match. From decentralized gaming to instant rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining attention as the next big thing in the memecoin universe. Let‚Äôs explore why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is outperforming DOGE and why it‚Äôs becoming the go-to token for casino gaming. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Memecoin That Started It All Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been celebrated as the original memecoin, known for its viral appeal and strong community support. With endorsements from major figures like Elon Musk, DOGE has maintained its status as the most iconic memecoin in the market. However, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has retained its popularity, it‚Äôs limited by its lack of advanced use cases beyond simple transactions. As the memecoin space evolves, newer tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging with enhanced utility, particularly in decentralized gambling and gaming ecosystems. This shift is drawing attention away from DOGE and towards tokens that offer more than just hype. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Revolutionizing Casino Gaming with Meme Power Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Mpeppe (MPEPE) goes beyond memecoin speculation by offering real-world applications within the online casino industry. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has embraced decentralized finance (De-Fi) and blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and seamless gambling experience. The integration of smart contracts and blockchain ensures that online gambling transactions are immutable and tamper-proof, providing players with a sense of security that is unmatched by traditional gambling platforms. For investors and players alike, Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings a new dimension to the memecoin world, blending the excitement of meme culture with the utility of blockchain-powered gaming. Decentralization Unleashed: Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs Edge Over Dogecoin One of the primary advantages Mpeppe (MPEPE) has over Dogecoin (DOGE) is its decentralized infrastructure. In online gambling, decentralization guarantees transparency and removes the need for intermediaries, delivering a more efficient and trustworthy experience for players. With decentralized ledgers, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides unparalleled clarity in transactions, making it an attractive option for the online gambling community. While Dogecoin (DOGE) may be known for its simplicity, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs ability to offer a decentralized gambling environment positions it as a leader in blockchain-based casino gaming, drawing both investors and gamers into its ecosystem. Smart Contracts: Revolutionizing Gameplay with Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) takes online casino gaming to the next level with its use of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts allow for transparent and fair gaming agreements, ensuring that players can trust the outcomes of their bets. Smart contracts revolutionize gameplay by removing the need for third-party oversight and guaranteeing the fair execution of wagers. For Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, the lack of smart contract functionality limits its potential in decentralized applications. Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs integration of smart contracts gives it a unique edge, providing a more interactive and reliable gaming environment that DOGE simply cannot match. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) Surpasses Dogecoin (DOGE) with Casino Utility While Dogecoin (DOGE) has undoubtedly made its mark as the original memecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is stepping into the spotlight by offering real utility in the online gambling industry. With its decentralized infrastructure, immutable blockchain technology, smart contracts, and instant rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a level of functionality that Dogecoin (DOGE) cannot match. As more players and investors recognize the potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE), it‚Äôs clear that this token is poised for long-term success in both the memecoin and casino markets.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to dominate the market, many of these high-profile investors are turning their attention to new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE).

Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs Integration of De-Fi Offers More Than Just Memes While Dogecoin (DOGE) has gained its popularity through community support and viral memes, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers something much more substantial‚Äîan integration of decentralized finance (De-Fi) protocols.

Additionally, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides enhanced security and privacy through blockchain technology, which appeals to players seeking a discreet and secure gambling environment.

33183247,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639876,1725462008,Elon Musk‚Äôs Dogecoin Targets $0.13 As DOGE Rival Gains Momentum,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite in the memecoin space, especially with the support of high-profile figures like Elon Musk. As DOGE aims to hit the $0.13 mark, a new contender is gaining traction‚ÄîMpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly rising as a rival to Dogecoin (DOGE), bringing decentralized finance (De-Fi) into the world of memecoins. But what is Mpeppe (MPEPE), and how does it compare to the iconic Dogecoin (DOGE)? Let‚Äôs explore how these two cryptocurrencies stack up. Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes $0.13: The Influence of Elon Musk Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced wild price swings, but its loyal following remains strong. With Elon Musk‚Äôs constant tweets and references to DOGE, the cryptocurrency has cemented itself as the original memecoin. Recently, DOGE has been targeting the $0.13 mark, buoyed by renewed interest and support from its community. The meme-based token continues to thrive as it leverages its viral appeal. However, while Dogecoin (DOGE)‚Äôs success is undeniable, the market for memecoins is evolving, and new challengers are emerging. One such contender is Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is making waves by introducing decentralized finance (De-Fi) elements into the meme token ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender with DeFi Power Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which relies heavily on its community and viral nature, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is taking a different approach by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) into its ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE) introduces features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance, giving its community members more ways to earn and engage with the token. By leveraging DeFi protocols, Mpeppe (MPEPE) adds utility to the typical memecoin structure, allowing holders to stake their tokens and participate in governance decisions, all while earning rewards. This level of utility makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an attractive alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE), particularly for investors looking for more than just price speculation. Decentralized Governance: Empowering the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Community Decentralized governance is another significant aspect of Mpeppe (MPEPE). Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), where decisions are made by a small team of developers and influencers like Elon Musk, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs community has a say in the direction of the project. Token holders can vote on proposals and contribute to the development of the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem, creating a more inclusive and decentralized structure. This sense of ownership and involvement gives Mpeppe (MPEPE) a distinct advantage over Dogecoin (DOGE), particularly among investors who prioritize decentralized platforms and governance models. The Viral Nature of Memecoins: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Dogecoin Compared Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are both popular for their viral internet culture, attracting mainstream attention through memes and celebrity endorsements. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, blends meme culture with blockchain innovation and decentralized finance, attracting a broader audience beyond crypto enthusiasts interested in entertainment and financial growth. Conclusion: Dogecoin Targets $0.13, But Mpeppe (MPEPE) is on the Rise Dogecoin (DOGE) is aiming for $0.13 with its community and Elon Musk‚Äôs endorsements, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum in the memecoin space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates decentralized finance and community-driven wealth creation, offering a unique value proposition for investors. As both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) grow, competition is expected, offering exciting possibilities for the future of memecoins.

42390446,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1rq7,1725459136,Japans Financial Regulator Mulls Taxing Crypto as Financial Asset,"Japan's Financial Services Agency said it may be worth taxing crypto as a financial asset.  The country currently taxes crypto profits as income, which can result in a 45% tax rate for high earners.  Capital gains from sales of financial securities face a flat rate of 20%.  Japan's Financial Services Agency said it's worth considering if crypto holdings should be taxed as financial assets rather than as income.  ‚ÄúRegarding the tax treatment of crypto asset transactions, it is necessary to consider whether crypto assets should be treated as financial assets that should be the subject of investment for the public,‚Äù the agency wrote in a document examining tax reform on Friday.  Any change might lead to the highest-earning crypto holders paying a lower rate of tax. The country currently taxes crypto profits as income, which can be as high as 45% for people earning over 40,000,000 yen ($276,000). Capital gains from sales of securities such as shares face a flat rate of 20%.

42390450,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1sKt,1725458537,Crypto-Fan Deaton Gets Chance to Battle Elizabeth Warren for U.S. Senate,"A prominent lawyer in crypto legal circles, John Deaton, has won the Republican nomination in the Massachusetts Senate race, and he'll now face Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  Sen. Warren, who is arguably the most influential crypto critic in Congress, has a massive money advantage and has beaten past Republican challengers easily.  The hope of crypto enthusiasts weary of industry pushback from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) remains alive after the crypto sector's top candidate, lawyer John Deaton, won the Republican primary in Massachusetts and a chance to face Warren in the general election.  Massachusetts Republicans supported Deaton with almost two-thirds of the vote, according to unofficial results after the polls closed on Tuesday. Early polling had indicated the edge may have been with Robert Antonellis, an engineer who favored former President Donald Trump's views on a range of social issues, but he trailed far behind Deaton.  ""Only in America could someone like me be elected to take on one of Washington's most entrenched elites,"" Deaton said at a victory celebration Tuesday night. ""It'll be an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.""  Still, polling in that state (and her record against Republicans in her last two races) suggests that Warren is enjoying a powerful lead against any Republican trying to prevent her third term, so the general election in November may still bring heartache for crypto enthusiasts.  Warren, one of the most prominent leaders of the U.S. progressive wing of the Democratic Party, has lashed crypto with sharp rhetoric and heavy legislative proposals that could crack the financial movement's foundations. She amassed almost $20 million in direct donations for her Senate campaign, outpacing would-be Republican challengers to an extreme extent.  The cash disparity is especially noteworthy in the context of the crypto's industry's massive outlay of campaign spending that's outpaced other industries in the U.S. primaries. The Republican field included two strong crypto candidates in Deaton, who has weighed in on crypto's battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ian Cain, who founded a startup incubator that cultivates blockchain projects.  Read More: Warren Rival for Senate Race John Deaton Argues for Coinbase in SEC Challenge  The industry's leading campaign-finance arm, the Fairshake political action committee, didn't touch this race. Deaton did receive about $1.3 million in super-PAC support, but from a smaller Commonwealth Unity Fund, a PAC backed by crypto names including Ripple Labs, the Winklevoss brothers (Tyler and Cameron) and Phil Potter, a former Bitfinex and Tether executive.  That spending falls far short of the massive spending Fairshake and its affiliates have devoted to elevate its chosen, crypto-friendly candidates and to specifically defeat candidates who would be expected to follow in Warren's footsteps, such as Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), whose Senate campaign was opposed with about $10 million in Fairshake spending.  Now that Deaton has the win, he may have a stronger argument for industry support.  Sporadic polling had left the GOP primary battle with little certainty as to an obvious frontrunner, though Deaton had the clear money lead among Republicans. For his primary run, Deaton was able to take in about $1.8 million in direct donations, including $1 million from his own pocket, according to the most recent public filings. Cain, who had been endorsed by noted crypto advocate Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), had trailed with about $400,000 in direct giving to his campaign.  ""While tonight‚Äôs results are disappointing, I hold my head high for the movement and progress we have made over the course of this campaign,"" Cain said in a post on X. ""This was never about a singular person, but about highlighting the failures of our current representation and pushing for a brighter future for Massachusetts.""",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/04/crypto-fan-deaton-gets-chance-to-battle-elizabeth-warren-for-us-senate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd03027e86ad3e91ab96eab48c641635f6570fab-649x365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33181375,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639719,1725458434,Crypto Guru Arthur Hayes Is ‚ÄòShort-Term Bearish‚Äô: Here‚Äôs Why,"In a recent essay titled ‚ÄúBoom Times ‚Ä¶ Delayed,‚Äù Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, delves into why impending Federal Reserve rate cuts may not initially rejuvenate the crypto markets as many investors hope. Published on Substack, Hayes presents a detailed analysis interwoven with his perspective on broader economic policies and their implications on asset prices, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. A New Paradigm Hayes starts by challenging the typical investor crypto reflex to ‚Äúbuy the fucking dip‚Äù (BTFD) in response to rate cuts‚Äîa behavior ingrained from past experiences during periods of subdued inflation in the US. He recalls times when the US Federal Reserve aggressively counteracted deflation threats with massive liquidity injections, benefiting asset holders significantly. However, Hayes argues that the current economic climate, shaped heavily by post-COVID fiscal policies and resulting inflation, alters the effectiveness of such monetary interventions. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Is ‚ÄòTruly In Limbo‚Äô If This Happens, Warns Crypto Analyst ‚ÄúThe effects of global fiscal policies to fight the COVID pandemic ended an era of deflation and ushered in an era of inflation,‚Äù Hayes states, emphasizing the delayed recognition of these inflationary impacts by central banks, which led to reactionary rather than preventative measures. Focusing on the US Treasury market, Hayes points out its pivotal role due to the dollar‚Äôs status as the global reserve currency. He notes that even with the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes, the bond market has shown a belief in the central bank‚Äôs commitment to controlling inflation, as evidenced by the containment of the 10-year US Treasury yield below 4% during significant inflationary periods. However, a turning point came during the Federal Reserve‚Äôs August meeting at Jackson Hole, where Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a rate cut, introducing uncertainty into the markets. Hayes critiques the continued high government spending, which he views as a political strategy rather than fiscal prudence, influencing inflation and consequently the Fed‚Äôs policy decisions. ‚ÄúThe primary driver of inflation that the Fed sought to quell, government spending, was left unchecked, leading the market to do the Fed‚Äôs job for it,‚Äù Hayes explains, referencing the swift rise in the 10-year Treasury yield following Powell‚Äôs announcement. This reaction underscores his argument that while the Fed may cut rates, the bond market will continue to react dynamically to underlying economic factors. Bitcoin And Crypto Are Short-Term Bearish Hayes points out Bitcoin‚Äôs extreme sensitivity to dollar liquidity conditions. ‚ÄúI believe Bitcoin is the most sensitive instrument that tracks dollar fiat liquidity conditions. As soon as the RRP started rising to the tune of ~$120bn, Bitcoin swooned. A rising RRP sterilizes money as it sits inert on the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet, unable to be re-leveraged within the global financial system,‚Äù Hayes notes. Related Reading: Crypto Market Update: Expert Anticipates Bull Run After Choppy August, Here‚Äôs Why He suggests a direct correlation between Federal Reserve policies, dollar liquidity conditions, and the Bitcoin price. He further predicts that if the Fed doesn‚Äôt cut rates before their September meeting, the rising balances in the Fed‚Äôs Reverse Repo Program (RRP) could see the Bitcoin price either stabilize or potentially decline further towards $50,000. ‚ÄúAssuming the Fed doesn‚Äôt cut rates before the September meeting, I expect T-bill yields to stay firmly below those of the RRP. As such, RRP balances should continue to rise, and Bitcoin, at best, will chop around these levels and, at worst, slowly leak lower towards $50,000. Let‚Äôs see how the cookie crumbles. My shift in opinion keeps my hand hovering over the Buy button. I am not selling crypto because I am short-term bearish,‚Äù Hayes explains. Despite this, Hayes remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, particularly in response to policy shifts that might stimulate liquidity. Hayes speculates that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will stimulate financial markets ahead of the US presidential election. He states, ‚ÄúObviously, Bad Gurl Yellen will only stop once she has done everything possible to ensure Kamala Harris is elected as the US President.‚Äù Hayes predicts that Yellen might deplete the Treasury General Account (TGA) to prompt a favorable market reaction and instruct Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cease quantitative tightening (QT) and restart quantitative easing (QE). ‚ÄúAll these monetary machinations are positive for risk assets, especially Bitcoin. The magnitude of the money supply injections must be large enough to counteract the rising RRP balance, assuming the Fed continues cutting rates. If this scenario occurs, I expect intervention to begin in late September. Between now and then, Bitcoin will, at best, continue to chop, and altcoins could dive deeper into the gutter,‚Äù Hayes predicts. He concludes his analysis noting a shift in his expectations for a bull market. Originally anticipating a resurgence in September, he now foresees a more turbulent period for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but remains steadfast in his long-term strategy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still long as fuck in an unlevered fashion. The only additions to my portfolio will be increasing position sizes in solid shitcoin projects at deeper and deeper discounts to my perception of fair value,‚Äù he declares. At press time, BTC traded at $56,615.

33179492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639848,1725454855,Memecoins Floki and Mpeppe Gain Major Investment From Gen-Z Cryptocurrency Community,"The memecoin market has long been dominated by big names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, the ever-growing Gen-Z cryptocurrency community has recently shown a significant shift in investment patterns, gravitating towards newer, promising tokens such as Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These two tokens have captured the imagination of younger investors, who are drawn to their unique offerings and the potential for massive gains. Here‚Äôs why Gen-Z investors are increasingly putting their money into Floki and Mpeppe. A Fresh Perspective on Memecoins and Mpeppe‚Äôs Positioning Gen-Z investors are known for their willingness to explore unconventional and emerging trends. They have grown up in an era dominated by digital innovation, which has shaped their investment strategies and perspectives. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way for memecoins, Floki and Mpeppe represent a new wave of tokens that resonate with this younger demographic. Floki, named after Elon Musk‚Äôs Shiba Inu dog, has cleverly positioned itself as more than just a memecoin. It has a vibrant community and a clear vision for the future, including partnerships and projects that extend beyond the typical memecoin narrative. This appeals to Gen-Z investors who are not only looking for quick gains but also want to be part of a movement that has a broader impact. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, has captured attention with its explosive presale and rapid community growth. The token‚Äôs meme-based branding, combined with its robust marketing strategy, has made it a popular choice among younger investors who appreciate humor and cultural references in their investment choices. The potential for high returns, as seen in the early stages of Mpeppe‚Äôs presale, further cements its appeal to this audience. The Appeal of Utility and Community Engagement One of the key factors driving investment in Floki and Mpeppe among Gen-Z investors is the perceived utility and strong community engagement these tokens offer. Unlike earlier memecoins that were often criticized for lacking real-world use cases, both Floki and Mpeppe have made efforts to integrate more tangible benefits for their holders. Floki has taken strides in building partnerships that enhance its utility, such as its recent collaboration with the University of Miami Athletics. This partnership not only raises awareness of the token but also demonstrates its commitment to creating real-world applications that go beyond mere speculation. This aligns with the values of many Gen-Z investors, who seek investments that offer more than just financial returns. Mpeppe‚Äôs community-driven approach is another reason why it resonates with younger investors. The token‚Äôs success is largely attributed to its active and engaged community, which has played a crucial role in its rapid rise. For Gen-Z, who value social connections and community involvement, Mpeppe offers a platform where they can contribute to the token‚Äôs growth while potentially reaping significant financial rewards. The Influence of Market Trends and Cultural Shifts Gen-Z investors are highly influenced by market trends and cultural shifts, often driven by social media and influencer endorsements. Both Floki and Mpeppe have capitalized on these trends, leveraging their cultural relevance to attract a younger audience. Floki, for instance, has benefited from the broader trend of meme culture intersecting with the cryptocurrency world. Its association with Elon Musk, a prominent figure in both the tech and meme communities, has given it a significant boost. The token‚Äôs ability to stay relevant in the fast-paced world of social media has made it a favorite among Gen-Z investors. Mpeppe‚Äôs rise can be attributed to its clever use of memes and internet culture to build a brand that resonates with younger investors. The token‚Äôs marketing strategy has been particularly effective in capturing the attention of Gen-Z, who are known for their affinity for humor and irony. By positioning itself as a fun yet potentially lucrative investment, Mpeppe has managed to carve out a niche in the crowded memecoin market. Final Opinion On Meme Coin Market As the memecoin market continues to evolve, the investment patterns of Gen-Z are becoming increasingly influential. Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have emerged as top choices for this demographic, thanks to their fresh approach to memecoins, strong community engagement, and alignment with cultural trends. As more Gen-Z investors enter the market, it‚Äôs likely that we‚Äôll see continued growth and innovation in the memecoin space, with tokens like Floki and Mpeppe leading the charge.

33179491,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639845,1725454853,"Shiba Inu: Top SHIB Analyst Compares SHIB, PlayDoge & Mpeppe For Future Potential","In the diversified world of cryptocurrency, three meme coins are currently grabbing the spotlight‚ÄîShiba Inu (SHIB), PlayDoge (PLAY), and the rapidly rising Mpeppe (MPEPE). Each of these tokens has its unique appeal and potential, but how do they stack up against each other for future growth? In this article, we‚Äôll dive into a detailed comparison, guided by the insights of top Shiba Inu analysts, to see which of these coins holds the most promise. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A ‚ÄòFoundation‚Äô Meme Coin Shiba Inu, often dubbed the ‚ÄúDogecoin killer,‚Äù has been a dominant force in the meme coin sector since its launch. Despite its success, SHIB has faced significant challenges in maintaining its momentum. Recent data shows that Shiba Inu‚Äôs burn activity spiked by an impressive 2,600%, with over 280 million SHIB tokens burned in a single day. This burn was initially seen as a strong bullish signal, potentially reducing the circulating supply and driving up the token‚Äôs value. However, the momentum from the burn seems to have slowed. The burn rate has not continued to rise, and SHIB‚Äôs price remains relatively stagnant, currently trading around $0.00001359. The slowdown in burn activity might suggest a fading interest or a strategic pause as the community reassesses its next steps. Despite this, Shiba Inu has a lot going for it. Upcoming ecosystem updates, including the use of SHIB as collateral and the launch of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), could reignite interest in the token. Analysts believe these developments, alongside favorable market conditions, could push SHIB to new heights. Yet, in an increasingly competitive market, Shiba Inu faces stiff competition from newer tokens like PlayDoge and Mpeppe, both of which are attracting considerable attention. PlayDoge (PLAY): The Play-to-Earn Innovator PlayDoge (PLAY) represents a fresh take on the meme coin concept by integrating the popular play-to-earn (P2E) model. Since its debut, PlayDoge has made a significant impact, particularly within the gaming community. The token‚Äôs recent surge of 24% post-launch highlights its growing popularity, supported by its innovative approach to combining cryptocurrency with gaming. PlayDoge‚Äôs success is fueled by its strong presale performance, raising over $6.5 million, and its strategic listing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. With a market cap of $23.3 million and over $550,000 in locked liquidity, PlayDoge has quickly established itself as a formidable player in the meme coin market. The appeal of PlayDoge lies in its dual nature as both a meme coin and a P2E platform. This combination not only attracts traditional crypto investors but also gamers who see the potential to earn while playing. As the P2E sector grows, PlayDoge is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, potentially leading to significant price increases. However, the question remains whether PlayDoge can sustain its momentum in the long term, especially with the rising star of Mpeppe making waves in the market. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Biggest Meme Presale in 2024 Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the newest entrant in the meme coin arena, and it‚Äôs already causing a stir. With a presale that has captured the attention of both Dogecoin and PlayDoge investors, Mpeppe is being hailed as the next big thing in the meme coin space. The coin‚Äôs presale has been so successful that it‚Äôs nearing its end with overwhelming support, indicating strong investor confidence. What sets Mpeppe apart from its competitors is its strategic community engagement and marketing. The project has managed to build a robust following in a short period, leveraging social media and influencer partnerships effectively. As a result, Mpeppe is not just another meme coin; it‚Äôs seen as a potential successor to the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Investors from both Dogecoin and PlayDoge have started doubling their Mpeppe (MPEPE) holdings, drawn by the prospect of high returns. The anticipation surrounding Mpeppe‚Äôs official launch suggests that the token could see significant price appreciation, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Analysts have noted that Mpeppe‚Äôs momentum is similar to the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with the potential to replicate their success. As the presale nears its end, the focus will shift to Mpeppe‚Äôs performance in the broader market, where it will face the challenge of sustaining its growth and delivering on its promises. The Verdict: Which Coin Holds the Most Potential value? While Shiba Inu (SHIB), PlayDoge (PLAY), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) each have their strengths, the future potential of these tokens varies. Shiba Inu remains a strong player with a loyal community and upcoming ecosystem updates that could boost its value. However, its ability to break out of its current consolidation phase is uncertain. PlayDoge offers a unique proposition with its P2E model, appealing to a niche market that could drive its long-term growth. Its recent success post-launch shows promise, but sustaining that momentum will be key. Mpeppe, on the other hand, stands out for its rapid rise and strong investor backing during its presale. If it can maintain this momentum post-launch, it could very well become the next big meme coin, offering substantial returns to early investors. In conclusion, while Shiba Inu remains a reliable choice with potential for future gains, PlayDoge and Mpeppe are emerging as strong contenders in the meme coin space. For investors looking to diversify and maximize their returns, Mpeppe offers an exciting opportunity that could deliver significant rewards in the near future.

33179490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639839,1725454839,"$11M Dogecoin Investor Adds Mpeppe and PlayDoge to Watchlist, Here‚Äôs Why","In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, savvy investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, a prominent Dogecoin (DOGE) investor, who has accumulated a staggering $11 million in DOGE holdings, has expanded their watchlist to include two emerging players: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and PlayDoge (PLAY). But what is it about these two coins that has captured the attention of a seasoned DOGE investor? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. The Rise of Mpeppe: A Meme Coin with Unstoppable Momentum Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been making waves in the crypto world, quickly establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with. What began as a meme coin, inspired by internet culture and fueled by community enthusiasm, has rapidly grown into a serious contender in the cryptocurrency market. The coin‚Äôs meteoric rise has been nothing short of spectacular, with its value skyrocketing by 100x in recent weeks. So, what‚Äôs driving this incredible surge? The answer lies in Mpeppe‚Äôs unique blend of virality and community engagement. The Mpeppe community, known for its creativity and dedication, has been instrumental in promoting the coin across social media platforms, generating a buzz that has attracted a wave of new investors. This grassroots movement has propelled Mpeppe to the forefront of the meme coin space, rivaling even established giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For the $11M DOGE investor, the appeal of Mpeppe is clear. The coin‚Äôs rapid growth, coupled with its strong community backing, suggests that it has the potential to replicate the success of DOGE and other top meme coins. By adding Mpeppe to their watchlist, the investor is positioning themselves to capitalize on the coin‚Äôs continued upward trajectory. PlayDoge: Tapping into the Play-to-Earn Revolution While Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the attention of meme coin enthusiasts, PlayDoge (PLAY) is carving out a niche in the burgeoning play-to-earn (P2E) gaming sector. PlayDoge recently made headlines with a 24% surge in its initial trading minutes following its listing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This impressive debut has positioned PlayDoge as a rising star in the crypto gaming world. PlayDoge‚Äôs success can be attributed to its innovative approach to P2E gaming. The project combines the nostalgic appeal of Tamagotchi-style gameplay with enhanced graphics and engaging side adventures, creating a platform that is both fun and rewarding for players. With the P2E market projected to reach $6.3 billion by 2031, PlayDoge is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend. For the $11M DOGE investor, PlayDoge represents a strategic diversification opportunity. By adding PlayDoge to their watchlist, the investor is hedging their bets on the future of P2E gaming, a sector that is poised for explosive growth in the coming years. The recent success of PlayDoge‚Äôs presale, which raised over $6.5 million, further underscores the project‚Äôs potential to deliver significant returns. Why This Investor is Watching Mpeppe and PlayDoge So, why has this seasoned Dogecoin investor chosen to add Mpeppe (MPEPE) and PlayDoge (PLAY) to their watchlist? The answer lies in the unique strengths of each project. Mpeppe‚Äôs viral potential: Mpeppe‚Äôs rapid rise is a testament to the power of community-driven marketing. The coin‚Äôs ability to capture the imagination of investors and generate significant momentum makes it a compelling addition to any portfolio, particularly for those who have benefited from the meme coin phenomenon. PlayDoge‚Äôs strategic positioning in P2E gaming: As the P2E gaming sector continues to expand, PlayDoge is strategically positioned to become a major player in this space. The coin‚Äôs strong debut, combined with its innovative approach to gaming, makes it an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the next big trend in crypto. For the $11M DOGE investor, the decision to add Mpeppe and PlayDoge to their watchlist is a calculated move. Both coins offer unique opportunities for growth, with the potential to deliver significant returns in the coming months. By diversifying their portfolio to include these emerging projects, the investor is not only hedging their bets but also positioning themselves to ride the next wave of crypto success. Overall Synopsis As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the ability to identify and capitalize on emerging trends is more important than ever. Mpeppe (MPEPE) and PlayDoge are two projects that exemplify the diverse opportunities available in the crypto space, from the viral power of meme coins to the transformative potential of play-to-earn gaming. For investors like the $11M DOGE holder, the key to success lies in staying ahead of the curve and being open to new opportunities.

33179488,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639843,1725454837,Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Presale Giant Mpeppe Readies For Launch As PlayDoge Holders Flock In,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), once a shining star in the meme coin universe, has hit a rough patch as it struggles to break free from a prolonged consolidation phase. Meanwhile, new contenders like Mpeppe (MPEPE) and PlayDoge (PLAY) are quickly gaining ground, attracting the attention of investors who are seeking fresh opportunities in the volatile crypto market. As SHIB faces uncertain prospects, Mpeppe is gearing up for a significant launch, and PlayDoge holders are increasingly shifting their focus to this presale giant, hoping to ride the next wave of meme coin success. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Struggles Causing Negative Downturn Shiba Inu has been stuck in a frustrating sideways range for most of August, failing to establish any clear upward momentum. Despite multiple attempts to break out, SHIB has remained under pressure, with its price hovering between $0.00001462 and $0.00001281. This lack of movement has led to growing pessimism among SHIB holders, as reflected in the declining market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator for SHIB has recently signaled a bearish crossover, suggesting that the current downtrend may persist for another 23 days. During this period, SHIB is likely to remain under pressure, with little chance of a significant price rally. This extended consolidation phase has left many investors wary, prompting them to explore alternative investments such as Presale Token Mpeppe (MPEPE) and others in the rapidly evolving meme coin market. Mpeppe‚Äôs Imminent September Launch and Its Impact on the Market While Shiba Inu struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is preparing for a highly anticipated launch that could shake up the meme coin landscape. Mpeppe has already generated significant buzz during its presale, with investors eagerly awaiting its debut. The presale has been a massive success, and with the official launch just around the corner, Mpeppe is poised to become a major player in the meme coin market. What sets Mpeppe apart from other meme coins is its robust community support and innovative marketing strategies. The coin‚Äôs presale success has been driven by a strong social media presence and viral marketing campaigns that have captivated the crypto community. As a result, Mpeppe has attracted a diverse group of investors, including those who were previously focused on other meme coins like Shiba Inu and PlayDoge. PlayDoge Holders Shift Focus to Mpeppe PlayDoge (PLAY), another rising star in the meme coin market, has also been gaining traction, particularly in the play-to-earn (P2E) gaming sector. PlayDoge made headlines with a 24% surge in trading volume following its launch on decentralized exchanges. The project‚Äôs innovative approach to integrating gaming and meme coins has resonated with investors, drawing significant attention to the $PLAY token. However, as Mpeppe‚Äôs launch approaches, even PlayDoge holders are beginning to shift their focus to this new contender. The excitement surrounding Mpeppe‚Äôs potential for explosive growth has led many PlayDoge investors to diversify their portfolios by adding Mpeppe to their holdings. This migration of capital from PlayDoge to Mpeppe underscores the growing belief that Mpeppe could be the next big success story in the meme coin world. The Future of Shiba Inu, PlayDoge, and Mpeppe As Shiba Inu continues to grapple with its ongoing consolidation phase, the next few weeks will be critical in determining its future trajectory. If SHIB fails to break out of its current range by late September, it may struggle to regain its former glory, especially with new competitors like Mpeppe and PlayDoge gaining ground. For PlayDoge, the future looks promising as it continues to build on its initial success in the P2E gaming sector. However, the growing interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) suggests that PlayDoge may face stiff competition as investors flock to the presale giant in search of higher returns. Mpeppe, on the other hand, is entering the market at a time when meme coins are once again capturing the imagination of the crypto community. With its presale success and strong community backing, Mpeppe is well-positioned to make a significant impact upon its launch. If the coin lives up to the hype, it could easily outshine both Shiba Inu and PlayDoge, offering substantial returns to early investors. Conclusion In a market as dynamic and unpredictable as cryptocurrency, the rise and fall of meme coins are driven by a combination of market sentiment, community support, and innovative strategies. Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent struggles highlight the challenges faced by even the most established meme coins, while the rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and PlayDoge showcases the potential for new players to disrupt the market. As Mpeppe prepares for its official launch, all eyes will be on this presale giant to see if it can deliver on its promise and create a new wave of crypto millionaires. For investors, the decision to back Mpeppe, PlayDoge, or stick with Shiba Inu will depend on their appetite for risk and their belief in the future of the meme coin market.

Pepecoin (PEPE), once a dominant force in the meme coin market, now faces fierce competition from rising stars like Mpeppe (MPEPE) and PlayDoge (PLAY).

However, like many other meme coins, PEPE has experienced significant price fluctuations, leaving investors wary of its future prospects. Despite the challenges, PEPE remains a strong player in the meme coin space, with a dedicated following that continues to support the coin.

While PEPE has struggled to regain its previous highs, Mpeppe and PlayDoge have been gaining traction, attracting investors with their innovative features and strong community support. Mpeppe: The Meme Coin with Explosive 100x Growth Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly risen to prominence as one of the most promising meme coins in the market. Launched with a focus on community engagement and viral marketing, Mpeppe has managed to capture the imagination of the crypto world. The coin‚Äôs value has surged by an astonishing 100x, prompting many to consider it the next big thing in the meme coin space.

Why Mpeppe and PlayDoge Could Make Millionaires The potential for Mpeppe and PlayDoge to create millionaires lies in their ability to capture and sustain investor interest. Both coins have demonstrated impressive growth in a short period, driven by strong community support and innovative features. Mpeppe‚Äôs (MPEPE) viral marketing strategy and active community engagement have positioned it as a formidable competitor in the meme coin market.

The crypto exchange previously worked with auditing firm Mazars to produce a proof-of-reserves report for crypto clients, however, Mazars in December 2022 said it had paused work with Binance and other crypto clients amid concerns over the public‚Äôs misunderstanding of those reports.

But proof-of-reserves only shows a snapshot of an exchange‚Äôs balance sheet at a given time, leaving possible loopholes for companies, which Mazars claimed to be the reason behind it pausing its work on those reports.

33178686,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639737,1725453055,Stunning Fall From Grace: Cardano Suffers 90% Plunge In Market Share Since ‚Äô21,"After stealing the thunder of cryptocurrency in September 2021, Cardano fell about 90%. Its native token, ADA, lost its position in the top 10 cryptocurrencies as a result of significant losses in market capitalization. Related Reading: RENDER Flashes Red With 18% Short-Term Loss ‚Äì Details This slump in market share sends quite a few questions running through the minds of people: what about the future of the Cardano platform and are its highly talked-about smart contracts good enough? The Rise And Fall Of Cardano Cardano was riding high back in 2021. The Alonzo upgrade was supposed to make it a main event player due to the introduction of smart contracts. In that flush of excitement, ADA surged as high as around $3.10. Fast-forward to the present, and that excitement has vanished. ADA has plunged to about $0.49, with further falls predicted by many analysts. When the first optimism around the smart contracts has worn off, and many wondered whether they had played a role in the decline of the platform. Whereas the smart contracts of Cardano were meant to open the floodgates, the reality on the ground is rather not up to speed as expected. Most developers have had difficulties in deploying their applications, and the explosion of dApps was expected but not realized. The slow development has frustrated investors and developers alike, causing the erosion of confidence in the platform. Competition And Market Sentiment The intense rivalry in the DeFi area further fuels the hardships. From its initial inception, well-known platforms like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain had already been able to build high-functioning ecosystems for Cardano, therefore rendering many things quite challenging. Making matters worse, it rolled out some major projects-including the Hydra scaling solution-painfully slow. Although there has been some progress on Cardano, it generally falls behind the very high expectations set during its earlier days. Cardano also suffered due to market pessimism. The cryptocurrency markets are unstable, susceptible to global economic fluctuations, and speculation. Interest by cryptocurrency investors in ADA waned as the price continued lower. Reaction To Hoskinson‚Äôs Bitcoin Remarks Meanwhile, in recent days, Bitcoin community prominent figure Tuur Demeester got into a spat with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. The latter had made some pretty provocative comments about Bitcoin. Classic projection. In just 3 years time, Cardano went from 10% of bitcoin‚Äôs market cap to a paltry 1%. pic.twitter.com/CkfQ0izHcd ‚Äî Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) September 2, 2024 Hoskinson was quoted to have insinuated that the cryptocurrency industry doesn‚Äôt necessarily need Bitcoin, going as far as to predict that a more secure ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù would emerge and make Bitcoin as obsolete as the Windows operating system, which has seen more forward-thinking platforms like iOS and Android eclipse its importance. Demeester took Hoskinson to task, underlining the irony of his comments by indicating the shrinking market presence of Cardano. He said ADA‚Äôs market cap had fallen from 10% of Bitcoin‚Äôs to just 1% in the last three years. This aspect in turn hikes up the pressure on Cardano over its status as one of the major cryptocurrencies. The strong wake-up call from Demeester was that Cardano-from its bright beginning-may struggle much more for survival in today‚Äôs fast-changing cryptocurrency environment. Related Reading: NEAR Investors Hope New Projects Will Help Coin Rebound From 21% Loss Will Cardano Recover? Despite these obstacles, there are signs of recovery. A minor price increase in ADA over the past week suggests that some investors still believe in the coin. The recent Chang upgrade could also have something to do with revitalizing interest in Cardano, including on-chain voting aimed at improving governance. This may provide a better way of involving the community in decision-making and foster more user commitment. But all is not straightforward and easy from here. Cardano needs to sort out its technical issues, and quicken the pace of development regarding its ecosystem to give it the confidence boost it so desperately needs.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,786.39 ‚àí3.8%  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,607.61 ‚àí4.24%  Ether (ETH): $2,395.39 ‚àí4.4%  S&P 500: 5,528.93 ‚àí2.12%  Gold: $2,488.75 ‚àí0.17%  Nikkei 225: 37,047.61 ‚àí4.24%  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $56,000 during the Asian morning, the lowest since Aug. 8, reversing nearly all of the past month's gains. BTC subsequently recovered some ground, trading above $56,500, still more than 4% lower in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broad measure of the digital asset market, has fallen around 3.5%. U.S. stocks tracked by the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indexes fell as much as 3.5% on Tuesday to kick off a historically bearish September as weak U.S. manufacturing data reignited concerns over an economic slowdown. The move spread to Asian markets with Japan's Nikkei 225 sliding more than 4%.  Bitcoin mining profitability is stuck at record lows, JPMorgan said in a new research report. ""We estimate bitcoin miners earned an average of $43,600 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in August, the lowest point on record,"" the analysts wrote. That compares with a peak value of $342,000 in November 2021, when the BTC price was $60,000 and the network hashrate was 161 EH/s. The network hashrate, a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty, increased for the second straight month in August, JPMorgan noted. ""The network hashrate averaged 631 EH/s in August, up 16 EH/s from last month, and about 20 EH/s below prehalving levels,"" the authors wrote.  Crypto derivatives protocol Volmex Finance unveiled a new implied volatility index for Solana's SOL token to measure expected price swings in the world's fifth-largest cryptocurrency. The SVIV index measures forward-looking 14-day expected volatility in SOL, Volmex said in an email to CoinDesk. Traders can track the index to see the degree of potential SOL price swings (in either direction) over the following two weeks. Volmex said it will eventually debut longer-duration SOL implied volatility indices, including the popular 30-day gauge and derivatives linked to that, allowing market participants to place bets on volatility. Perpetual futures tied to Volmex's bitcoin implied volatility index and the ether index have been trading on Bitfinex since early April.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's seven-day options skew has dropped to three-week lows, indicating a renewed demand for puts offering downside protection.  It's a sign of traders preparing for a more profound price drop in the wake of renewed U.S. growth concerns and NVDA's sell-off.

42390470,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2071,1725449289,The Sandbox's Largest Market for Creators Is Now India: Co-Founder Sebastien Borget,"India has more than 66,000 content creators on the Metaverse platform The Sandbox, more than any other country.  The increase follows the platform's decision to push for growth in India, and it's now targeting 1 million users in two years.  India has become Metaverse platform The Sandbox's largest supplier of content creators as the number of users doubled to 350,000 less than a year after the Web3 project said it planned to make the nation its largest market.  The country now supplies 66,000 creators, who develop games for the immersive environment, compared with 59,989 in the U.S. and 25,335 in Brazil. The plan to focus on India was announced in December, and the platform is now targeting 1 million users in two years, co-founder Sebastien Borget told CoinDesk in an interview.  Growth was propelled by projects run directly by The Sandbox or with its Indian venture, BharatBox, which is partially backed by CoinDCX, an Indian crypto exchange with around 16 million users.  ""India became the No. 1 overall across all countries ... thanks to all the different boot camps and education programs that we've run on the ground, either directly with BharatBox or with some of our partners, like CoinDCX,"" Borget said.  BharatBox was initally capitalized with $1 million. Another $200,000 will be deployed by the fourth quarter, BharatBox CEO Karan Keswani said. While The Sandbox raised $20 million at a $1 billion valuation earlier this year, India didn't need further investment because the venture was designed to be ""self sufficient and autonomous,"" capable of generating its own revenue, Borget said.  ""We've proven that India is not like just the tech workforce of the world,"" Borget said. ""We've shown that blockchain projects can be successful by introducing development blockchain but also in the content and entertainment side.""  As many as 1,060 avatars of the highly successful Indian film, Jab We Met, were sold within two weeks of the collection going on sale, Keswani said indicating a successful foray into the nation's cinema industry.  Talking about the larger Web3 market, Borget said, ""I think we are still not in the bull market.""  The industry has seen a rise in interest since the approvals of spot-crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., which have driven more institutional money into crypto, but that hasn't translated into more user adoption specifically because it's not retail investors using their savings to put into crypto, he said.  Still, strong interest in Web3 adoption has continued because of the emergence of better-quality new games and the messaging service Telegram's distribution network, Borget said.  Borget also commented on the arrest last week of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France on charges including being complicit in allowing illicit transactions and the dissemination of child exploitation material on the platform.  ""Privacy is a fundamental right but if an application is being used to commit serious crimes, we cannot be neutral and not help the authorities,"" Borget said.

The level reflects the increasing scarcity of BTC in the market and a potential bullish impact on its price.  Almost three-quarters of bitcoin produced is considered illiquid, a record level that suggests increasing scarcity of the cryptocurrency in the market and a potential bullish impact on its price.

The altcoin‚Äôs price saw a run-up back in 2023, leading up to its halving. Since then, it has failed to maintain this upward momentum, falling short of the triple-digit level. From here, though, it seems the tide might finally be changing for the Litecoin price, as a notable prediction from an analyst suggests that a rally could send the price to a new all-time high. Litecoin Price To Reach $7,000 According to a crypto analyst on the X (Formerly Twitter) platform, the Litecoin price is set to outperform all of the large cap cryptocurrencies in the market. The analysis focused on Litecoin‚Äôs long-term growth, which could see it surpass the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: Major Dogecoin Indicator Flashes Bullish, Is It Time To Buy? The chart shows that the LTC price is still trending below $70, which is an 84% decline from its all-time high price of $412. However, all hope is not lost as the crypto analyst believes that there is still more to come for the altcoin. Not only does the analyst believe that the Litecoin price will eventually cross the triple-digit level once again, they also believe that four-digit is in the cards for the altcoin. Targets for the Litecoin price include an initial surge that takes it above $100. From there, the crypto analyst expects the recovery to continue. An eventual break above the $1,000 level is mapped out, which would be an around 1,600% price increase from here. However, it doesn‚Äôt end there. The crypto analyst expects the price to eventually reach as high as $7,000. Now, if this were to play out, it would mean an over 11,000% price increase from the current price level. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $40,000, But There‚Äôs Good News As for the timeframe for when this is expected to play out, the crypto analyst seems to expect it to happen before 2026. This would put it in the expected 2025 bull run, where the likes of Bitcoin are expected to touch new all-time highs. But an 11,000% increase could easily make the Litecoin price the best performer out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. ‚ÄúIf you hate it or not, but IMO Litecoin will outperform all the big cap Crypto‚Äôs. See you at $7000,‚Äù the post read. On its own, the Litecoin price has not been very impressive. According to data from Coinmarketcap, the price is up only 1.42% in the last year, showing sluggish movement.

It holds substantial BTC reserves and has very low mining costs. The company‚Äôs strategic focus on high-performance computing (HPC) and AI could lead to higher revenue per watt and enhanced operational efficiencies. When comparing it to incumbent data center REITs based on capacity, we can see a large value discrepancy indicating Hut 8 trades at a severe discount. The margin of safety is huge. Hut 8 ( HUT ) is a Bitcoin miner. It operates up to 762 MW of data centers which are currently used for Bitcoin mining. The bullish thesis is simple: HUT has the best chance of transforming a non-trivial amount of capacity into AI data centers, which would make HUT trade at a substantial discount when compared to incumbent data center REITs. A Steal Within The Mining Space First of all, before talking about the bull thesis, let's consider HUT within the context of other Bitcoin miners. Its market cap is only twice the value of the BTC it holds in reserves, which is the lowest on the market for miners. Basically, every single company that has a Bitcoin treasury has a higher ‚Äúmarket cap to BTC reserves‚Äù ratio. The fact that for every dollar of HUT shares, you are getting ~57 cents of BTC is a pretty good deal considering that this number for other miners like CleanSpark and MARA are in the 15 to 30 cent range. The chart below is from BitcoinTreasuries.net , which aggregates BTC treasuries based on public info. The second column from the right shows the value of the BTC held as a percent of market cap. I have marked the miners in red. Bitcoin Treasuries (Bitcointreasuries.net) Second, HUT‚Äôs cost to mine bitcoins is extremely low compared to most miners. You can back out the cost to mine by looking at how much bitcoins were mined in a quarter and then dividing it by the all-in operational costs as expressed in a quarterly statement. HUT also has a slide for this in their presentation from May , but this uses pre-Halving numbers. Miners all report their stuff a little differently, so it is very tedious to get everyone‚Äôs cost per BTC mined to do an apples-to-apples comparison. Here‚Äôs how we can get a quick estimate for where HUT stands in the lineup of miners. TeraWulf‚Äôs ( WULF ) Q2 presentation has this slide which shows gross profit margins. I‚Äôm going to assume that the other miners on this slide‚Äî CleanSpark (CLSK), MARA (MARA), Riot (RIOT), Core Scientific ( CORZ ) ‚Äîhave slightly higher cost per BTC, since their gross margins are lower. WULF Comps (TeraWulf) Later on, TeraWulf states a cost of $41587 per BTC. WULF Cost Per BTC (TeraWulf) Also, Bitfarms ( BITF ) states in their Q2 report that they have a $47300 cost per BTC: BITF Earnings (Bitfarms) Meanwhile, HUT is reporting a cost to mine of $26232, which is substantially lower than all of these other miners. HUT Earnings Q2 2024 (Hut 8) Just by these numbers alone, I think HUT is a very compelling investment in the mining space. It clearly has the ability to grow BTC per share and it is the miner trading at the lowest premium to its respective BTC reserves. When thinking about miners, it's always helpful to look back at the points I've established in this article about mining in general . Mining is a tough business because no other industry is as perfectly competitive as mining is. Basic economics tells us that a perfectly competitive industry contains firms with zero economic profits. This means that large scale miners will inevitably suffer from diseconomies of scale because the overhead of publicly traded compliance will eat into already razor-thin margins. So does this mean that publicly traded Bitcoin miners are immediately bad investments? No! What it means is that you have to look for miners that are doing things outside of simply mining BTC. For many miners, this outside action is diversifying into high performance computing. You see, some miners are acquiring Nvidia H100 GPU clusters for AI along with SHA-256 ASICs for Bitcoin mining. They are taking the energy capacity they have already established for ASICs and diverting some of this power to HPC and AI, which has a much higher revenue per watt of power consumed (read: higher gross margins). As it turns out, HUT is very well positioned to transition into HPC and AI. AI Upside Transitioning from a Bitcoin mining operation to an HPC operation is not simple. While mining is famous for handling flexible loads, HPC cannot be curtailed. Imagine if your computer was making a computation and was suddenly shut down: all the progress would be lost and you‚Äôd have to restart from the beginning. So at the energy infrastructure level, there are certain requirements that differ between HPC data centers and mining data centers. HUT has known this for a long time. In the most recent earnings call , CEO Asher Genoot called it their ‚Äúpower first thesis,‚Äù where HUT approaches the issue of site procurement and development with the intent of building for a multitude of use cases. Here‚Äôs what he had to say about deploying a new 205 MW site: With that said, we are currently in discussions for a large scale partnership for our site in the Texas Panhandle, which can power up to 205 megawatts of Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, or up to 16.5 exahash of next-generation ASIC miners. With engineering, procurement and construction efforts underway, we anticipate energizing the site in the first half of next year. Stay tuned for more. When later asked about Texas Panhandle, he said: And so that site today, we're having conversations with customers about a HPC AI build, but we're also having discussions with them about other sites in our pipeline which may be more interesting from them -- from a -- kind of fiber connectivity standpoint, that's a little less rural. And so, we're having active discussions in the multi 100 megawatt size in regards to AI expansion, and looking at both, our current fleet and also our expansion pipeline. Another interesting quote from the call: It became increasingly evident that incumbent data center operators and developers do not have sufficient infrastructure nor resources to meet the power capacity required to facilitate the advancement of AI. More importantly, they are not well equipped to provide what hyperscalers demand, timely access to multi 100 megawatts worth of long-term reliable low cost power. I believe that Hut 8, however, is uniquely positioned to solve this critical challenge. The $150 million investment from Coatue is also a signal that HUT has been thoroughly vetted for their ability to transition into AI data centers. Let‚Äôs do some napkin math. Currently HUT has at least 762 MW of capacity used for mining. They also have an additional 36,000 sq ft for HPC. HUT Platform (Hut8) We heard about Texas Panhandle being 205 MW. And we heard about a few more ‚Äúmulti 100 megawatts.‚Äù Let‚Äôs assume this is 400 MW energized for HPC by the end of 2025. HUT‚Äôs market cap is $820 million. As I write this, the price is $9.09 per share. Digital Realty ( DLR ) is probably the most well-known data center REIT. Unlike HUT, DLR doesn‚Äôt even own much of the machines it hosts: it only owns the power and real estate infrastructure that the machines are using. DLR has 2500 MW in place and over 3000 MW of buildable capacity. It has a market cap of $50.6 billion. The market cap per MW for HUT‚Äôs HPC-only capacity after everything is built is $2.5 million per MW‚Äî divide 820 million by 400. The market cap per MW for DLR after everything is built is $9.2 million per MW‚Äî divide 50.6 billion by the sum of 5500. So $2.5 per watt versus $9.2 per watt. That is some big value dislocation. Now consider that over 50% of HUT‚Äôs market cap is actually just BTC. And also consider that there is another 700 MW that HUT is using for mining BTC at very low costs per BTC. Some of this capacity can likely be used to support AI too. This is an option that HUT holds. Lastly, consider that global liquidity is rising, which has always dramatically pushed up the value of BTC. The base case for AI is simply that HUT is a data center REIT disguised as a Bitcoin miner that is getting ready to decisively capitalize on some very intelligent capex. It also has a lot of dry powder to make it happen: over $500 million of BTC and $150 million of cash from Coatue. Once more people start catching on to the economic reality of the situation, the upside is literally massive. Risks The core risk to this thesis is that the move to HPC fails for various reasons. The premise here rests on the undervaluation of HUT relative to data center REITs on a ‚Äúmarket cap to useful capacity‚Äù basis. There could be operational failures which lead to these endeavors being ultimately value destructive. In this case, it would have been far better for HUT to stick with mining at low costs. Another way this AI thesis could fail is if AI itself falls out of favor. I think while AI tools are cool, it remains to be seen how it can really be used in very specialized settings. Maybe training LLMs on custom data sets is the answer, but then again maybe we are all too early and the market has gotten ahead of itself. In this case, such AI-themed capex might not generate a return soon enough to be justifiable. Given that a miner like CORZ has successfully closed on HPC deals, I don‚Äôt think HUT is that far behind from monetizing their HPC investments after the infrastructure has been built and the machines have been energized. Another risk would be in the BTC price. If BTC falls, then that will adversely impact what is responsible for 57% of HUT‚Äôs market cap. At this point, HUT is economically a leveraged version of BTC. The first avenue for being a leveraged BTC play is its leveraged capital structure plus a large amount of BTC holdings. This is akin to borrowing money to buy BTC. The second avenue is that HUT derives a good portion of revenue (at least for now while HPC segments are being developed) directly from mining. This is akin to a call option on BTC where the strike price is the cost per BTC. The final risk I‚Äôll mention is actually in the network hashrate increasing far faster than anyone has expected. This is possible, but improbable. Hashrate increases point to more competitiveness in the mining industry. More hashrate coming online dilutes the value of existing hashrate, so such a risk could see the cost per BTC rise. Given that HUT‚Äôs cost per BTC is quite low compared to other miners, I think at the very least it would be less hurt than the other miners if this risk were to materialize. Conclusion Overall, I rate HUT a Strong Buy. It is clearly a very undervalued miner given its enormous BTC treasury and low cost to mine. This offers a substantial margin of safety. The HPC conversion makes for a very favorable special situation and deep value play. HUT is a miner, but it is really also a data center REIT that no one is calling a REIT yet. It has many operational efficiencies which incumbent data centers don‚Äôt even have, which adds to its competitiveness. I am hopeful that HUT‚Äôs AI vertical will eventually generate revenues to pay off all power costs, so that the company can hold nearly all the BTC it mines. This could justify a much higher price: possibly over 4x the BTC holdings, as is the case for miners like CLSK and BITF.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718876-hut-8-massively-undervalued-ai-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33175070.jpeg

42390481,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd20wJ,1725442870,"Mt. Gox Wouldn't Have Happened With Modern Tools, Mark Karpeles Says","SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA ‚Äì As Mt. Gox wrapped up its bankruptcy redemption payments, it ended a nearly decade-long legacy, and the book is closed on what might be the greatest hack in all of crypto.  Mark Karpeles, the failed exchange‚Äôs CEO, was once a hated man in the crypto community, and Japanese prosecutors wanted to send him away for a decade. But now, Karpeles belongs to an exclusive club of the 1% which have fought the law in Japan and won ‚Äì something nearly unheard of in a country with a 99% conviction rate where the justice system prefers to coerce confessions rather than contest a case.  Now, with all this behind him, Karpeles is off on a new adventure: launching a new crypto exchange called EllipX, which takes the best modern practices of exchanges and lessons learned from Mt. Gox as well as continuing work on a crypto ratings agency called Ungox.  ‚ÄúI can say very confidently that Mt. Gox hack wouldn't have happened if we had even some of the tools we have today,‚Äù Karpeles said in an interview with CoinDesk at Korea Blockchain Week.  Better crypto wallets  One thing that Karpeles wishes he had during the heyday of Mt. Gox was hierarchical deterministic, or HD, wallets. HD is a type of wallet that securely manages and generates multiple public and private key pairs from a single master seed.  Karpeles‚Äô exchange was hacked because of stolen private, encrypted private keys and a transaction malleability exploit, which led to the loss of around 850,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} from the exchange's vulnerable hot wallets.  ""In retrospect, if we had tools like custodians and HD wallets, we wouldn‚Äôt have stored private keys on the servers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe could have provided public seed access to an accountant for real-time monitoring of transactions, which would not only have prevented the Mt. Gox hack but also allowed us to detect suspicious activity much earlier.""  EllipX, Karpeles‚Äôs new exchange, will be set up like the New York Stock Exchange, with separate segmented groups handling trading, brokering and storing assets.  Japanese crypto regulation  The necessity of this sort of structure come from lessons learned in blood.  Karpeles pointed out that Japan now has strict custodian rules for exchanges, hence why Japan was the safest place to be an FTX customer.  ""Before Mt. Gox, nobody in Japan knew what bitcoin was, but when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy happened, it was covered all over national TV. Despite having only 10,000 to 20,000 customers in Japan, the event was streamed live on every TV station and widely reported,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúAlong with the Coincheck hack four years later, these incidents led Japan to implement much stricter security rules and regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges,"" he continued.  The final chapter of the Mt. Gox legacy was closed a few months ago as bankruptcy creditors were paid back. And while some thought this would lead to significant selling pressure on BTC and push down the price, the reality was the market digested everything calmly and quietly.  ‚ÄúI think you're seeing a lot of OG buyers of bitcoin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhile some may have sold when they got their holdings back, most still believe in crypto and want to see where it‚Äôs going.""  So what does Karpeles think of the blockchain industry today? Too much centralization risk, and too many ‚Äúbad projects‚Äù.  ""There are too many, I'm going to use the word 'bad' in a very large sense, because it could be either a scam project or just projects that don't bring anything new that stand out too much,"" he said.  Karpeles said he wants to see a safer crypto world, where you can see a project, find it interesting, and buy into it without having to worry if it's a scam or not.  ‚ÄúWhen people read about crypto, they see whatever thing was a scam, people lost money, and so on,"" he said. ""It's always the same story.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/04/mt-gox-wouldnt-have-happened-with-modern-tools-mark-karpeles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd811109d72cd4e403aeff2d48a944ca18b2d4a1-4096x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33174049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639559,1725442246,Bitcoin Investors Beware: MVRV Has Given Bear Market Signal,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score is currently giving a bearish signal for the BTC market. Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Seen A Bearish Crossover Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed the latest trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score. The MVRV Z-Score refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the BTC market cap and realized cap, divided by the standard deviation of the market cap. The market cap here is naturally just the simple total valuation of the cryptocurrency at the current spot price. The realized cap, however, is an on-chain model that calculates the coin‚Äôs capitalization differently. Related Reading: ‚ÄòPaper‚Äô Bitcoin On The Decline: What It Means For BTC Instead of taking the current price as the same value for all coins in circulation, it uses the last price at which each coin moved on the blockchain as its value. Since the last time any coin was transferred was likely the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would denote its current cost basis. Thus, the realized cap is a sum of the cost basis of all circulating tokens. One way to view this sum is as a measure of the investors‚Äô capital into the cryptocurrency. As the MVRV Z-Score compares the market cap, which is nothing but the amount of capital the investors are holding right now, against this initial investment, it tells us about the investor profitability. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of this Bitcoin indicator over the last few years. As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has been down in recent months, suggesting investor profitability has decreased. With the latest continuation of the decline, this MA has crossed below the 365-day MA, suggesting the MVRV Z-Score‚Äôs average value in the past month has been lower than that for the past year. In the chart, the CryptoQuant author highlights some zones for the indicator based on the pattern in these two lines. Historically, the 30-day MA sinking below the 365-day has signaled a bearish phase for Bitcoin (colored in light red). Interestingly, such a bear market signal had also appeared in January 2020, after the market had been cooling down from the 2019 rally. This bearish period was followed by another venture into the bull territory (light green), but the unexpected COVID-19 crash reset the market once more before the bull market kicked off for real. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP See Declining Whale Activity: What It Means While it‚Äôs possible the latest bear market signal in the MVRV Z-Score could suggest a transition away from a bull market for Bitcoin in the current cycle, it could very well instead go the way the market did in January 2020, with this crossover serving as a healthy reset for a proper bull rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,700, down more than 6% over the past week.

The aggregate market cap of the U.S.-listed bitcoin miners tracked by the bank fell 15% last month, JPMorgan said.  The bank noted that mining difficulty rose 9% from the previous month.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining profitability is stuck at record lows, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Tuesday.  ""We estimate bitcoin miners earned an average of $43,600 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in August, the lowest point on record,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  That compares with a peak value of $342,000 in November 2021, when the BTC price was $60,000 and the network hashrate was 161 EH/s.  Mining stocks declined as the average price of the world's largest cryptocurrency fell for the third consecutive month and the network hashrate rose. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  The total market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed miners tracked by the bank shrank 15% month-on-month to $20 billion, with only three of the miners outperforming bitcoin in the period, the report said.  The network hashrate, a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty, increased for the second straight month, the bank noted. ""The network hashrate averaged 631 EH/s in August, up 16 EH/s from last month, and about 20 EH/s below prehalving levels,"" the authors wrote.  JPMorgan noted that mining difficulty rose 9% last month, and is 4% higher than before the halving.  There was a brief spike in transaction fees in August, to as much as 120% of the block reward, which is an ""incremental positive"" for the miners, the report added.  The bank noted that bitcoin's annualized volatility rose to 62% in August, from 45% in July.

33171878,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639668,1725436833,Critical Bitcoin Indicator: Analyst Foresees Major 75% Correction Ahead,"The Bitcoin price has been unable to break out of its current downtrend after losing the $60,000 mark this week, trading as low as $57,790 on Tuesday. However, one indicator is pointing to further price corrections for the largest cryptocurrency on the market that could send the coin well below current levels. Bitcoin Faces Major Risks In a recent social media post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed to the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) on Bitcoin‚Äôs 2-month chart, which has recently indicated a trend reversal from bullish to bearish. This is noteworthy because historical patterns over the past decade show that similar signals have often preceded significant price corrections of 84%, 59%, and an average of 75.5%. Related Reading: Crypto Firm Galois Capital Faces $200K Fine From US SEC For ‚ÄòInvestor Violations‚Äô The Stochastic RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the level of a security‚Äôs closing price relative to its price range over a specific period. When it indicates a bearish trend, it suggests that the asset may be overbought and due for a price drop. Interestingly, the last notable trend reversal occurred in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading around $60,000. Following that signal, the cryptocurrency plummeted to a cycle low of approximately $16,000 before embarking on a recovery that culminated in new all-time highs of $73,700 in March of this year. If the current bearish trend holds, Bitcoin could face a dramatic decline. Should a 75% correction materialize from its current trading level of $57,000, the largest cryptocurrency could potentially drop to around $14,200 per coin. Such a significant downturn would likely dampen bullish expectations for the market, especially in a year marked by the Halving event that took place in April, which historically has been a catalyst for price increases. Can BTC Bounce Back After September? In addition to the bearish sentiment in the market, which could spell short-term trouble for BTC, the leading cryptocurrency faces a challenging September, historically known as its worst performing month. Market expert Alex Thorn emphasizes that over the past decade, Bitcoin has experienced declines in seven of the last ten Septembers, with losses ranging from 5% to as much as 18%. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Drops 15% Despite Continuous On-Chain Developments ‚Äì Details However, Thorn points out that October tends to provide a stark contrast to September‚Äôs declines. Historically, October has been Bitcoin‚Äôs best month, with the cryptocurrency often rebounding significantly. Gains in October have typically ranged from 20% to 52%, making it a critical month for bullish investors. If Bitcoin can maintain lower support levels and successfully navigate September‚Äôs challenges, the market could be poised for a robust performance in October.

42390472,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd201t,1725436800,"Polygon Begins Token Swap, in Move to Allow More Issuance","Polygon, a layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, was on track to activate an upgrade on Wednesday that swaps out its longstanding MATIC token for a new POL token, allowing for more flexibility on issuance of new supply.  The swap was due to start at 4 a.m. ET (8 a.m. UTC). The planned switch was originally disclosed more than a year ago, in July 2023.  While the planned switchover was well-telegraphed, the changeover is being closely monitored, since the token is widely held across crypto investor portfolios. MATIC is the 13th biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the CoinDesk 20 index, at about $3.8 billion. For many users, the swap will take place automatically, without any action on their part.  The migration comes as a part of Polygon's planned revamp laid out last year in its ‚Äú2.0‚Äù roadmap, to make POL the native token of its main chain ‚Äì known as the Polygon PoS chain ‚Äì and eventually other chains in the ecosystem.  According to Polygon, in the initial phase of the migration, ‚ÄúPOL replaces MATIC as the native gas and staking token for the Polygon PoS network. In subsequent phases, POL will serve a crucial role in the AggLayer.‚Äù The AggLayer is another element of the roadmap, essentially a system for aggregating affiliated blockchains built using Polygon technology.  There are proposals for POL to support broader roles in the Polygon staking hub ‚Äì to be released in 2025 ‚Äì including block generation, zero-knowledge proof generation and participation in Data Availability Committees (DACs).  ‚ÄúThis community-driven upgrade comes at a crucial moment when every aspect of Polygon is changing,"" according to a blog post.  POL migration  The migration from POL to MATIC will also bring some tokenomics changes. Polygon shared that the token will have a new emission rate of 2% annually, where part of the supply goes to validators on Polygon PoS for rewards, and the other part to the community treasury, ‚Äúa self-sustainable ecosystem fund that can support the above activities.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe biggest reason why the upgrade was needed from a technical perspective, is that the MATIC upgrade keys were burned very intentionally years ago. Which basically means that we can't make changes to that token,‚Äù said Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk. ‚ÄúSo one of the things that we wanted was to introduce emissions that way. We could use it for the community, we could use it for growth. It was literally impossible to do that otherwise.‚Äù  Boiron reiterated that introducing emissions is supposed to help the Polygon community ecosystem by introducing a grants program as part of the community treasury, allowing them ‚Äúsome form of control by the community over the funds so that you can grow the ecosystem.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd then the second one is a means for, effectively, validators to receive emissions,‚Äù Boiron added. ‚ÄúEffectively, if you think of these new chains that pop up, what's going to happen is that with time, they're going to want to decentralize. And so instead of just having a centralized sequencer, they're going to need to incentivize people to actually run a decentralized group or a decentralized prover. And if they don't have a token, or if they don't want to launch a token yet, how do they do that? Well, effectively, what this does is that a portion of that POL emissions can actually be used to decentralize their network, and then POL holders will then receive fees from that network.‚Äù  Read more: Polygon Sets September Date for Migration to POL Token from MATIC",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/04/polygon-begins-token-swap-in-move-to-allow-more-issuance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1182ca87e4ae835d5c08a5c03c54eaebe63af97f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33170397,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639641,1725433252,Will Bitcoin Repeat History? Analyst Sees This 2019 Pattern In Current Market,"Following its renewed peak above $73,000 back in March, Bitcoin has been experiencing a prolonged period of price stagnation ever since, leaving many investors wondering about the potential for future movements. According to a recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym ‚ÄòAvocado,‚Äô this stagnation may bear a resemblance to a similar pattern observed in 2019. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Recovery Rally: Breaking Through This Level Is Key To Bullish Momentum ‚Äì Analyst Why Is Bitcoin Price Still Below $60,000? In the report uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst suggests that the lack of volatility in Bitcoin‚Äôs price is largely due to the increased prevalence of over-the-counter (OTC) trading compared to exchange-based trading, which has reduced the frequency and intensity of price fluctuations. This conclusion was made after the analyst assessed one of Bitcoin‚Äôs key metrics‚Äîlifespan of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)‚Äîwhich is used to analyze investor behavior. By examining UTXOs held for less than six months, the analyst classifies these holders as new investors and compares their behavior to similar periods in previous market cycles. The data reveals a small peak in UTXOs under six months, which closely mirrors a structure seen in 2019. These new investors likely entered the market around March of this year when Bitcoin‚Äôs price peaked, according to the analyst. However, as the price has remained stagnant, many of these investors may have exited the market due to losses, while others have transitioned into the six-month-and-above holding category, the analyst added. The 2019 Pattern And What It Signals For Current Market The analyst, Avocado, further explained that this similar pattern, which was also observed in 2019, occurred around the time of the halving event, which eventually led to a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin. However, it took approximately 490 days for Bitcoin to reach this ATH, a timeline that was also influenced by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price stuck in a large range for more than six months, the current situation raises questions about the potential for a similar outcome. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Rally Over? Top Analysts Predict Imminent Price Corrections The analyst remains confident in the long-term upward trend of Bitcoin but advises caution in the short term. Avocado noted: Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has been stuck in a large range for more than six months, with no clear trigger for a breakout. While I have no doubt about the long-term upward trend, in the short term, I believe it‚Äôs wise to temper expectations and closely monitor the market. Historically, the influx of capital from new investors has been a critical condition for Bitcoin‚Äôs price increases.

33168927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639650,1725429615,"Crypto Market Update: Expert Anticipates Bull Run After Choppy August, Here‚Äôs Why","August proved to be one of the toughest months for the crypto market, marked by a significant decline in overall market capitalization, which fell to a six-month low of $1.96 trillion amid what analysts called ‚ÄúBlack Monday.‚Äù This downturn saw Bitcoin (BTC) plummet from $68,000 to approximately $49,000, igniting concerns among bullish investors. However, market expert Lark Davis suggests that the choppy sideways price action may soon come to an end, paving the way for a potential surge as bullish factors align for the fourth quarter. Final Opportunity To Buy At Discounted Prices? In a recent social media post, Davis highlighted that the coming 3-4 weeks could represent a final opportunity for investors to acquire their favorite cryptocurrencies at discounted prices. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) have seen notable declines, with losses of 6.7% and 5.7%, respectively, over the past week. Among the cryptocurrencies that Davis identifies as particularly attractive, Solana (SOL) fits the bill as it is currently trading at around $129, down nearly 16% over the same period. Related Reading: Solana Sees 7,600% Surge In Institutional Inflows, Here‚Äôs Why Despite these tempting prospects, historical data shows that September is typically a challenging month for BTC. Analysis shows that in six of the last seven years, Bitcoin has finished September in the red, with an average loss of around 4.5%. If this trend continues, some analysts predict that Bitcoin could fall to around $55,000 by the end of the month. This could have a ripple effect throughout the cryptocurrency market, as other tokens often mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. A Key Catalyst For Crypto Market Recovery Adding to the complexity of the current market landscape are upcoming interest rate decisions that could significantly affect Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term volatility and long-term trajectory, as Bitcoinist reported on Monday. Per the report, a potential 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve may signal the beginning of an easing cycle, potentially increasing liquidity and promoting long-term price appreciation for Bitcoin. On the other hand, a 50 basis point cut could trigger an initial price spike, followed by a correction as recession fears resurface. Bitfinex‚Äôs recent report warns that a rate cut could lead to a 15-20% decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, with projections suggesting a bottoming out between $40,000 and $50,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Surge To $18 In Third Elliott Wave Phase Despite the potential for short-term volatility, a notable bullish development could support Davis‚Äôs optimistic outlook. The anticipated distribution of $16 billion in cash from FTX to its customers may inject significant capital back into the market. Analysts believe that a significant portion of this payout will likely be reinvested in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Solana, creating significant buying pressure for the last part of the year. Ultimately, the potential influx of capital from the FTX distribution, combined with the expected cyclical surge in the crypto market in the year of the Bitcoin Halving event, could lead to significant gains for various tokens and an overall increase in market capitalization.

The token saw a 12% surge in the early hours of Tuesday, propelling the price above the $1.6 mark. As the memecoin tries to reclaim key support levels, some crypto analysts forecasted WIF‚Äôs next targets. Related Reading: FET Price Targets $3.4 After Breakout, Here Are The Key Levels To Watch Dogwifhat Leads The Memecoin Recovery Dogwifhat (WIF) became the market sensation in Q1 after leading the memecoin frenzy. The token surged to its all-time high (ATH) of $4.83 at the end of March, pushed by the market sentiment and its growing community. During its 2,000% growth phase, WIF saw many crypto investors put their hats on, which prompted a massive fundraising campaign to display the memecoin in the Las Vegas Sphere. However, the market fluctuations have driven the token‚Äôs price to a decline of over 66% from its ATH. The August retraces made WIF‚Äôs price drop 28% to a 6-month low of $1.1 before starting its recovery. Since then, it has reclaimed its early August levels, registering a 1% increase from its price one month ago. Following the weekend retrace, Dogwifhat saw a price surge of over 12%, reclaiming the $1.5 support zone again. This performance crowned the memecoin as the third largest gainer in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Moreover, WIF became the top 10 memecoin with the largest gains in the last 24 hours, followed by Popcat (POPCAT) and Floki (FLOKI)‚Äôs 9.2% and 7.6% jump. WIF Price Targets $2.2 As Dogwifhat‚Äôs price began to surge on Monday, several market watchers noted that reclaiming the $1.51 support level could push the token‚Äôs price to higher levels. To Ameba, a successful breakout above the downtrend line would drive WIF‚Äôs price to a retest of the next key area of $1.84. The analysts suggested the push could also propel the price to the $2.2 price range. Similarly, The Cryptonomist concurred that a strong breakout above $1.5 could see a reclaim of the same resistance level. Crypto trader Bluntz emphasized Dogwifhat‚Äôs performance as the token retested the $1.6 resistance level on Monday night. To the trader, the cryptocurrency did a ‚Äúperfect channel retest.‚Äù Bluntz highlighted the a,b,c zig-zag pattern in the token‚Äôs chart, suggesting that the price could jump to $2.4 as it bounces from the c wave levels. Previously, the trader predicted that WIF‚Äôs chart suggested a retrace to the $1 support zone before its next leg up. At the time, the memecoin sensation displayed a macro five-wave impulse followed by the formation of an a,b,c zig-zag pattern, with the c wave aiming for the $1-$2 price range. Following its most recent performance, the trader considers that investors are not ‚Äúready for the V reversal that‚Äôs about to happen.‚Äù Nonetheless, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa warned investors about WIF‚Äôs short-term price action. To the analyst, the token won‚Äôt hit ATH anytime soon despite displaying a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù performance in the support region. Related Reading: PEPE Open Interest Plunges 72% From ATH, Is A Recovery Imminent? Ultimately, Sherpa considers that WIF‚Äôs price will ‚Äústill see more chop and consolidation‚Äù around the $1.44-$1.95 area and advised the community to be patient while the rally resumes.

However, despite this struggle to rally, a CryptoQuant analyst named Kripto Mevsimi recently shared an intriguing observation regarding Bitcoin price on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Breakout Blueprint: Analyst Reveals Roadmap For Imminent Surge Bitcoin‚Äôs Sharpe Ratio Hits New Lows: Bullish Signal Or A Warning? According to the analyst, Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term Sharpe ratio has dipped to levels last seen during September-October 2023. For context, the Sharpe ratio is a measure used in financial markets to assess risk-adjusted returns, helping investors understand whether the returns of an asset are worth the risk involved. Mevsimi revealed that in September-October 2023, a similar drop in the Sharpe ratio was observed. This period marked a significant turning point for Bitcoin, as the top crypto rebounded strongly after the ratio hit its lows. The current scenario, according to the analyst, could indicate a potential opportunity for those with a bullish outlook. Particularly. The dip in the Sharpe ratio might suggest that Bitcoin‚Äôs price is poised for another recovery, offering a favourable entry point for investors looking to buy into the market with a risk-adjusted strategy. However, despite the bullish signal this metric might currently be suggesting Mevsimi cautioned: On the other hand, a bearish interpretation could see this as an indication of sustained volatility and caution against entering the market until a clearer trend emerges. Furthermore, the analyst explained that in 2023, the dip in the ratio coincided with the news of the Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), which played a significant role in driving the market‚Äôs momentum. This time, however, the situation might be different, as external factors like macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment will also play crucial roles in determining Bitcoin price trajectory. Bitcoin Market Performance And Outlook Over the past week, Bitcoin price has experienced a mixture of bulls and bears. After trading as high as above $62,000 last Friday, the asset has seen a noticeable correction, dropping below the psychological price level of $60,000. Although Bitcoin price attempted to reclaim this level earlier today reaching a 24-hour high of $59,812, it has since been pulled down back by the bears to currently trade at a price of $57,653, at the time of writing down by 1.5% over the past day. Amid this price performance, a renowned crypto analyst known as Crypto Jelle on X has commented on BTC‚Äôs latest price action, disclosing that the asset is now forming a weekly golden cross for the first time. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Potential: Analyst Maps Path To $700,000 And Beyond According to the analyst, forming this pattern in the traditional financial market is often considered bullish. However, Jelle questioned, is it possible for the pattern to work for BTC too? #Bitcoin is forming a weekly golden cross, for the first time in its history!

According to CoinGecko, the token bled by 18% since last week, continuing the bearish market consensus. With the market continuing to underperform, the altcoin might be on the pain train in the next couple of weeks. Related Reading: SUI Crashes 23% As September Unleashes Market Panic‚ÄîIs A Comeback Possible? However, the market has shown signs of a possible flip in sentiment with Bitcoin and Ethereum retesting their crucial resistance levels in the short term. But with a macro-packed week alongside the broader market‚Äôs optimism, the upside potential for the crypto remains stunted in the short term if the market continues to fall. $5.1 Resistance Crucial For Long-Term Gain As of writing, the token is struggling to retake lost ground against the bulls in the short term. The coin is currently trading between the $3.3-$5.1 trading range, a pretty wide range leaving space for both the bulls and bears to maneuver. In the short term, the bears have the advantage by a small margin. The token‚Äôs relative strength index (RSI) shows that the bulls are gathering momentum for a medium-term swing with a breakthrough on the $5.1 resistance level occurring within the next few weeks. However, the current timeline for the altcoin remains blurry as the market‚Äôs volatility hinders altcoins from making semi-autonomous movements. As of press time, the broader crypto market has fallen by 10 basis points after rising by nearly a percent a couple of hours ago. This volatility coupled with investor FUD will continue to hinder its upside in the near future. For now, investors should exercise caution as the week might be more rocky for the broader market. Render: Macroeconomic Indicators As Focal Points This Week Multiple labor indicators will be released this week by the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics with investors optimistic that the United States economy will have a soft landing. The labor market has been scrutinized as it was one of the primary factors the August selloff occurred. Forecasts for the payroll indicators are surprisingly optimistic. The Nonfarm Payroll forecast is 164k from the previous 112k, indicating that the market sees a future rate cut. Related Reading: NEAR Investors Hope New Projects Will Help Coin Rebound From 21% Loss If this week‚Äôs macro indicators flash bullish, the market will see renewed strength with capital returning to cryptocurrencies in the long run. Investors are also eyeing the consumer price index (CPI) releases next week which will signal whether the US Federal Reserve will cut or keep the current rates. Market indices are bullish with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones up by a couple of percentage points in the short term.

33162098,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639600,1725413431,"Major Dogecoin Indicator Flashes Bullish, Is It Time To Buy?","Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a major indicator for Dogecoin (DOGE), which is flashing a bullish signal. This suggests that now may be the right time to buy the foremost meme coin, with a price rebound looking imminent. TD Indicator Flashes Buy Signal For Dogecoin Martinez revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the TD indicator is flashing a buy signal for Dogecoin. He added that the foremost meme coin is also showing a bullish divergence against the relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart. The crypto analyst noted how these positive signs suggest that a potential price rebound for Dogecoin is on the horizon. Related Reading: PEPE Open Interest Plunges 72% From ATH, Is A Recovery Imminent? Dogecoin‚Äôs price action has remained tepid so far, as the meme coin continues to range at the crucial price level of $0.10. However, these technical indicators show that Dogecoin could soon achieve a successful breakout above $0.10 and rise to new highs. Dogecoin‚Äôs price recovery will also largely depend on Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin‚Äôs correlation with Bitcoin is at 0.91, indicating a strong positive price correlation between the prices of both crypto assets. As such, Bitcoin, being the flagship crypto, will need to make a bullish move soon enough so that Dogecoin can also enjoy a bullish reversal. This reversal should happen soon enough, with crypto analysts like Mikybull Crypto predicting that Bitcoin will enjoy a huge rally in the coming weeks. The analyst predicted that the flagship crypto could reach a new all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up. This will undoubtedly pave the way for Dogecoin to surpass its year-high of $0.22, which it reached when Bitcoin hit its current ATH of $73,000 earlier in March of this year. DOGE Could Reach $0.30 ‚ÄúWithin Few Days‚Äù Crypto analyst World of Charts has predicted that Dogecoin could surpass its year-high of $0.22 and reach $0.30 within a few days. He made this prediction while noting that the meme coin is consolidating within a falling wedge. He claimed that a breakout will send Dogecoin to this price level if the falling wedge plays out. Related Reading: Road To $5,000: Ethereum Maintains Similarities With 2016 Price Movements Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also recently made a bullish case for Dogecoin. He noted that the meme coin had formed the second low after the last touch to the support. He revealed that in previous cycles, Dogecoin pumped ‚Äúdrastically‚Äù right after the second low. This also suggests that a mega rally is on the horizon for Dogecoin. Based on the chart he shared, Dogecoin could rise to as high as $4 when it witnesses this parabolic move. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.099, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Top Analyst Predicts A Dip Before A Bounce,"Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading at a crucial level after a 24% retrace that began last week. The crypto market is experiencing extreme fear and uncertainty, with most altcoins hovering near yearly lows. Analysts and investors closely monitor AVAX‚Äôs price action as the market remains volatile. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Consolidation Continues As Funding Rate Signals Possible Market Shift Top analyst and trader Kaleo has shared his insights, predicting AVAX may dip further before a recovery occurs. This forecast has caught the attention of many, given the current market conditions and the pressure AVAX faces. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether AVAX can find support and begin its recovery or if it will continue to decline along with other altcoins. As the situation unfolds, the stakes are high for both short-term traders and long-term investors. Avalanche Holding Above $20 Avalanche (AVAX) has entered a consolidation phase after experiencing aggressive corrections, resulting in a staggering 73% loss in its price since March. This significant drawdown has captured the attention of many analysts and investors, who are now closely monitoring AVAX‚Äôs next moves. Among them is top analyst and investor Kaleo, who has shared a detailed analysis of X, drawing comparisons between the current price structure of AVAX and its performance in 2021. That year, AVAX witnessed a substantial pump, followed by a massive correction, before embarking on an explosive rally that propelled it to new all-time highs. Kaleo suggests that a similar pattern could unfold now, indicating that AVAX might be on the brink of a new uptrend. His analysis shows that AVAX is expected to dip to the low $20 level before starting a strong recovery. Related Reading: The Curse Of September: Is Another Massive Bitcoin Sell-Off Coming? Kaleo‚Äôs prediction appears to be holding, as AVAX has managed to stay above the critical $20 support level. This resilience suggests potential strength and indicates that the next target could be the $30 mark if the current support is maintained. Investors are watching these levels closely, as they could signal the beginning of a significant upward move for AVAX shortly. AVAX Technical Analysis Avalanche (AVAX) trades at $22.22, following a modest 4% bounce from the $21.17 low set on Sunday. For bullish momentum to build, AVAX needs to reclaim the 4-hour 20 moving average (MA) at $23.75. This level is a crucial indicator of short-term strength, as it often marks the transition to a more consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows when the price stays above it. A sustained move above $23.75 could set the stage for AVAX to target the critical $30 level. Breaking through $30 is essential for reversing the current bearish structure, as it would likely trigger a more rapid recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Struggles To Break Past $2,600: What‚Äôs Driving ETH Down? However, if AVAX fails to hold above $20, it could signal further downside potential.
