The demand-supply equation behaving irrationally, the mining hash rate seemingly having reached a top and the possibility of investors diversifying away from Bitcoin all constitute risks. Therefore, it is not the right time to invest since volatility may continue as the Bitcoin ecosystem adjusts to the realities of the fourth halving. On the other hand, the drop in miners' output following halving tends to show that the Bitcoin system has delivered on the scarcity mandate. As such, it is better to wait for a better margin of safety and be on the watch-out for miners' performance to obtain an indication of whether things have stabilized. This is my first thesis on Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) since the halving event which occurred on April 20, as marked in blue in the chart below and the price seems to be moving sideways. www.seekingalpha.com As one of the first securities to be passively invested in the cryptocurrency, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ((BTC)) ETF ( GBTC ) also seems to be taking a breather after seeing its price soar by about 275% or even more than Bitcoin's 113% upside itself. While the halving itself illustrates the Bitcoin network's resilience as I elaborate later, this thesis aims to show that volatility should reign in the short term. The main supporting arguments are BTC's appreciation in the pre-halving period being something abnormal based on historical data and also because of the adjustment period in mining activities, which impacts Bitcoin's supply and ecosystem. Demand Supply Equation Seems to Behaving Irrationally First, one of the reasons for the upbeat crypto demand seen over the last six months follows the Security and Exchange Commission's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. Since the market tends to be forward-looking, news about a potential approval had already induced upward momentum in the price as from October last year as shown in the above chart. Thus, from 40K , the value of one coin reached $73K in March this year which is about the same as the November 2021 peak. This created windfall gains for the miners who play a crucial role in the ecosystem as the producers of the cryptocurrency since each issuance could fetch a higher market price. Every time they add a block to the blockchain they are paid 3.125 BTC, but tellingly, this figure was 6.25 BTC before the halving which means that depending on the quantity of coins produced, their revenues can potentially be reduced by half. As a result, there has been a drastic fall in the number of coins produced, with daily issuance falling from 975 on April 15 to 462.5 on April 21, or one day after the halving. This means that the supply has dropped considerably while the price has not reached the moon as some had anticipated despite the drastic reduction in supply (issuance). Nonetheless, demand has not evaporated since the price remains above $60K. As to the reason for it not being higher, I look at historical data. For this purpose, halving happens every four years with the price action before and the peak achieved after each event shown in the table below. Table prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Focusing on the latest or the fourth such event, what differentiates it from previous ones is the price at the time of halving. At around $64K, this is slightly lower than the peak of $67K reached in 2021 which is in sharp contrast to the two previous events, when the price at halving was much lower. This is further illustrated by the ratio of halving to peak price, which from 0.57 in 2017, and reached 0.95 during the last one. This is a big difference, possibly due to the advent of spot ETFs less than four months before halving, which may also indicate risks going ahead, and, for this purpose, understanding miners' activity is useful. Miners' Activity, Hash Rate, and Risks For Bitcoin which uses Proof-of-Work to validate transactions on the blockchain, in addition to producing coins, miners also secure the network and keep it operational. As such, they are not only the first to broadcast new blocks, but they also play a key role in the verification process and contribute to the impenetrability of the network, which, by the way, has continuously been operational since 2009 with no coin ever stolen. Now, as mining rewards are cut in half, some miners will become unprofitable in case the price of Bitcoin continues to depreciate since their cost of production increases. In this respect, given the interest rate of 5.5% , the cost of capital remains relatively high compared to past halving events. Moreover, stubbornly elevated inflation, which increased to 3.5% in March also contributes to higher expenses. Looking across the industry, miners have adopted different approaches to address the halving problem as I elaborated in a previous thesis , and while some of them have HODLed crypto, others have migrated to countries with lower energy costs. Thus, it is unlikely for all of them to unilaterally shut down their mining machines resulting in no more blocks being produced, something not good for the crypto. Nonetheless, some will likely become unprofitable as in addition to rewards being divided by two, mining difficulty which normally increases after every 2016 blocks are added to the blockchain, increased just after the latest halving. To get an idea of overall mining activity, one can consult the hash rate which is the total computational power of all the participating mining nodes in the network. As charted below, after increasing since October last year, the hash rate appears to be rising at a less rapid pace. Data by YCharts The risk here is that in case the chart slopes downwards, this could indicate a decline in hash rate, a phenomenon called miner capitulation which, according to some industry participants could act as a precursor for Bitcoin decline. Another risk is the possibility of some investors switching to alternative coins or altcoins like Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) which could have been the case sometime after the 2020 halving. However, at that time, the digital asset's dominance had peaked at 73% , but it is only 52.7% this time signifying that crypto wallets are not overly concentrated in Bitcoin . Moreover, as per my verification on CoinMarketCap , altcoins Ethereum USD ((ETH-USD)), Solana USD (SOL-USD), Polkadot (DOT-USD), or ChainLink USD (LINK-USD) have not gained market cap which would have indicated investors diversifying away from Bitcoin. However, this could change but up to now, investors do not appear to have dumped their Bitcoin holdings, but volatility should continue, namely because of monetary policy. GBTC Could drop Further But Halving Shows Bitcoin's Ecosystem is Working In this respect, 2021 also saw the launch of the first Bitcoin futures-linked ETF in the United States called the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ), but this did not prevent distress in the crypto world, and, Bitcoin fell below $17K in November 2022 following the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates at an aggressive pace only seen since the Paul Volcker era. Also, volatility was caused by the crypto exchange FTX collapsing. Now, given that rates are likely to stay higher for longer because of persistently high consumer prices, there is limited chance for any sustained upside till the Fed does not pivot. On the contrary, Bitcoin could suffer as miners have to continuously upgrade their equipment to the latest generation, and those who do not have enough coin reserves in their treasuries, rely on debt financing. Some may even have to liquidate reserves, boosting supply in the short term. In the ensuing volatility, GBTC could revisit the $40 level, which is the price at the start of this year as shown in the chart below. This roughly 30% correction is not far from the 33% slide in Bitcoin price predicted by analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) based on the digital asset dropping to $42K compared to its present value of $62.5K. Data by YCharts Now, depending on the way Bitcoin's hash rate progresses this dip could constitute an investment opportunity. To this end, the halving event has once again worked in terms of reducing Bitcoin output, proving that Bitcoin's preprogrammed algorithm to reduce its supply has been working. For investors, the cryptocurrency was designed as an alternative to fiat currency whose value is impacted both by inflation and the quantity of notes printed by their country's respective central banks. Thus, unlike traditional currencies which can be printed at will, crypto comes with a restricted supply which leads to the concept of scarcity meaning that if demand increases, Bitcoin's value will go up, making the asset class a hedge against inflation. At the same time, halving has occurred automatically and as predicted, despite the absence of a central authority to control its production, thereby validating the resiliency of Bitcoin's decentralized operations. However, adding some caution, since Bitcoin is mostly speculative and can be used to finance illicit activity like ransomware, the asset class is no safe haven. The Grayscale Differentiator Consequently, for those who are prepared to take the volatility risks, GBTC appears best positioned given it was launched in September 2013 and has already been through three halvings. Thus, for those who want to invest without setting up a wallet (or an account) or on a crypto exchange, it also boasts one of the longest operational histories as pictured below. etfs.grayscale.com Furthermore, despite charging higher fees of 1.5% it has been performing better than both BITO in the last three months while matching the performance of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF` ( IBIT ) which charges only 0.12% and is one of the most invested recently incepted spot ETFs. Comparison GBTC, BITO and IBIT (seekingalpha.com) In conclusion, this thesis has shown that after the halving, volatility should persist. However, it is unlikely for doomsday to knock out Bitcoin, but this will be more of a period of adjustments to the ecosystem. These will ultimately depend on miners' financial performance, and factors such as location, energy source, and equipment efficiency, without forgetting size. Consequently, for those interested in investing or averaging down, it is better to be patient and wait for a dip.

He further suggests that this price breakdown might be necessary for the continuation of BTC’s bull run. How Bitcoin Could Drop To As Low As $47,000 In an update to his Bitcoin analysis, DonAlt noted that Bitcoin had dropped back to around the $60,000 price range and could eventually break that support if it continues to be tested. From the accompanying chart he shared, the crypto analyst hinted that a price breakout below the $60,000 range would see Bitcoin drop to $52,000 or even further down to $47,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says Prepare For 700% Jump To $4, Here’s When Source: X Meanwhile, he added that this might be something even the bulls want, so there could be a washout below $60,000, which would shake off weak hands. DonAlt also seems to support a price breakout below the support area, as he shared his belief that there is currently complacency in the market. This is when crypto investors ignore the risks associated with Bitcoin, having seen price increases for an extended period. DonAlt said he would continue to hold this complacency belief until proven otherwise. For that to happen, he remarked that Bitcoin would need to reclaim $68,000 or drop below $60,000 and reclaim that support level again. Denis Baca, Head of Product at Zivoe Finance, also recently suggested that BTC could drop below $60,000 before it makes any parabolic move. This was a huge possibility, especially since Baca noted that the flagship crypto historically retests the support level of the 20-week SMA (small moving average) in May. He claimed this could cause Bitcoin to drop to $56,000. BTC Bulls Are Getting Overwhelmed By The Bears Bitcoin bulls look to be succumbing to the pressure from the bears. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in an X post that there has been a “noticeable dip in Bitcoin whale activity” since March 14. This suggests the current market downtrend could be diminishing their confidence, as these whales are always known to accumulate more during every price dip. Martinez added that a “surge in whale transactions could be the spark needed to boost” BTC’S price. Related Reading: Brace For Price Impact: Dogecoin Whales Move Massive 456 Million DOGE To Exchanges Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, recently noted that Bitcoin’s price has remained tepid due to the slowdown in demand. He alluded to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen their demand decline this month. Like Martinez mentioned, Moreno stated that there needs to be a “demand growth” for Bitcoin to experience another rally.

According to Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, market data shows that urgent “market sells” responsible for forcing the coin from all-time highs are now falling. This development may prop up prices, preventing further sell-offs. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Easing This preview is due to falling Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) data, an on-chain indicator that can also track market sentiment. Specifically, it tracks buying and selling aggression from market participants. Now that CVD is dropping, Woo says more BTC holders are likely willing to weather the storm. Their decision may directly support prices. Woo adds that BTC must reject selling pressure and end the current short-term weakness as things stand. As on-chain data shows, BTC should stay above $59,600. The CVD lie has historically separated bullish and bearish zones. Related Reading: Polygon In Peril: Will MATIC Bounce Back Or Stay Stuck In The Sub-$1 Doldrums? Based on this, BTC should remain above the $60,000 round number for the uptrend to be sustained. If not, and bears take over, pressing prices lower below the CVD level could signal the beginning of a new bear regime. Thus far, BTC is under immense selling pressure, shaving approximately 15% from all-time highs. The coin has support at around the $60,000 and $61,000 zone, moving inside a range. Resistance is at an all-time high of around $74,000 on the upper end. Based on this preview, any losses below $60,000, as Woo notes, would likely see BTC dump. The coin might drop to $53,000 in the short term, torching stop losses and fueling the sell-off. Will Hong Kong Spot ETF Launch Lift Prices? Whether BTC bulls will flow back depends mostly on institutional involvement in the days to come. Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, prices spiked higher, breaking previous all-time highs. Institutional involvement has been vital. However, inflows have slowed down, especially in the last two weeks of April. Analysts are now looking at the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong on April 30.

Daan believes the ETH/BTC ratio is a superior indicator of altcoin market sentiment over the SOL/BTC ratio, showing data that suggests the potential for an upcoming altcoin season. Related Reading: Crypto Guru Reveals Top Altcoin Picks And DeFi Risks: What You Need To Know ETH/BTC vs. SOL/BTC: Decoding The True Alts Barometer Daan Crypto Trades has challenged the emerging view that SOL/BTC might be a better gauge for altcoin strength, arguing instead for the enduring relevance of ETH/BTC. According to Daan, while Solana’s performance has been notable, it hasn’t significantly impacted Bitcoin’s dominance, which remains strong. This observation suggests that SOL/BTC may not accurately reflect broader alternative coins market trends. On the other hand, ETH/BTC has historically mirrored shifts in altcoin market sentiment more closely, making it a more reliable metric. This distinction is crucial for investors seeking to understand the real-time health and potential shifts within the broader altcoin market. Seeing a lot of people claim $SOL/BTC is a better proxy for general alt strength than ETH/BTC.$SOL performed extremely well and the general alt market underperformed BTC as BTC.D grinded higher. Therefore, I would not say SOL/BTC is a good gauge for overall altcoin strength at… https://t.co/8KpdnACoOt — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) April 28, 2024 Daan’s analysis points out that significant movements in the ETH/BTC ratio have often preceded dynamic phases in the altcoin market, commonly referred to as ‘altcoin seasons.’ These periods are characterized by rapid price increases across altcoins, often outpacing Bitcoin. Signs Of An Emerging Altcoin Season? Current market analysis by Daan and on-chain data from Santiment underline a brewing sentiment that could lead to another alternative coins season. Santiment’s report highlights an unusual accumulation pattern across altcoins, with their Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios suggesting many are undervalued. Related Reading: Are Altcoins Cooling Off?

BTC.D has dropped from 57.10% as of the middle of this month to roughly 54.69% as of today. This decline could suggest that capital is beginning to flow more substantially into altcoins. Notably, the combination of favorable MVRV ratios and shifting dominance lends credence to Daan’s assertion that an alternative coins season may be on the horizon, ready to unleash notable gains similar to past cycles.

Crypto markets were lower across the board, with bitcoin {{BTC}} wavering near $63,000 as the upcoming Hong Kong crypto spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) debut has failed to spark excitement among investors.  BTC drifted lower during the day from $64,000 over the weekend, slipping briefly to $61,800 before recovering to just near $63,000 at U.S. afternoon hours. The largest crypto by market value was recently changing hands at $63,000 down about 1% in the past 24 hours, holding up better than the broad-market CoinDesk Market Index (CD20), which lost 3% over the same period.  Most altcoin majors also gave up their weekend gains, with ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}}, dogecoin {{DOGE}} declining 4%-6%.  Crypto markets have been drifting sideways for the last few weeks in lack of a strong investment narrative to drive prices, cooling from last month's record-breaking BTC price action and altcoin and memecoin frenzy. CoinDesk's Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators both remain in neutral reading, indicating a market without a clear direction.  Even though spot-based bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong will start trading on Tuesday morning local time, the incoming debut didn't spark a similar level of anticipation ahead of the event as to the fever pitch that preceded the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Notably, BTC nearly doubled in price during three months leading up to the January 11 debut, and significant inflows helped propel BTC over $73,000 in March.

Rodriguez, 35, and his Samourai Wallet co-founder William Lonergan Hill, 65, were arrested last week – Rodriguez in Pennsylvania and Hill in Portugal – and charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years and five years, respectively.  Prosecutors have alleged that, between 2015 and the seizure of Samourai Wallet’s servers last week, the app “facilitated more than $100 million in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets,” and around $2 billion total in “unlawful transactions.”  The arrests and shutdown of Samourai Wallet come as the U.S. government prepares for its case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, and have led to an outcry among many in the crypto industry, who believe the case is a sign the government is attempting to criminalize financial privacy.  In the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) press release announcing the pair’s arrest last week, prosecutors said that Rodriguez and Hill “encouraged and openly invited users to launder criminal proceeds” and considered “restricted markets” to be a target demographic.  Rodriguez was initially arrested around 6 a.m. at his home in Harmony, Penn. on April 24. He was subsequently released by a Pennsylvania judge on a $25,000 bond and ordered to present himself before a magistrate judge in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Monday morning.  Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses ruled to release Rodriguez on a $1 million bond on Monday, accepting the conditions set in a bail package that both federal prosecutors and Rodriguez’s lawyers – Sean Buckley and Michael Keilty of international law firm Kobre Kim – had agreed to.  Rodriguez’s bond will be secured by real estate in Pennsylvania and the signature of his wife and another family member. Other than traveling to and from court proceedings, Rodriguez will remain at home and will be monitored by location tracking technology.  Rodriguez’s next hearing will be in Manhattan on May 14 at 2 p.m. in front of District Judge Richard Berman.

This move is believed to be the beginning of a trend reversal for the crypto token, which has several bullish signals on its chart. Ethereum Has A Bullish Chart Crypto analyst Derek revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the signals on Ethereum’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator “seem to have ended the decline and changed upward direction.” He also highlighted the Ethereum Dominance chart, which has confirmed three bottoms and gave a strong rebound. Related Reading: Expert Says Bitcoin Price Has Topped And Is In Exponential Decay, Why This Is Not A Bad Thing The analyst explained that “leading a rebound after confirming the bottom three times means that further decline is unnecessary, and there is a high possibility that there is no intention to do so.” Interestingly, the analyst drew attention to the fact that Ethereum has experienced this price rebound without volume. Source: X This phenomenon occurs when individual investors are more active than institutional ones who are more cautious during this period. This instantly brings recent buys by Ethereum whales like Justin Sun into the picture, as they have contributed significantly to Ethereum’s recent resurgence. NewsBTC recently reported that a wallet believed to belong to the TRON founder recently bought $405 million worth of Ethereum. This wallet and another suspected to belong to Sun have accumulated $891 million worth of ETH since February 12. Meanwhile, NewsBTC also reported about another whale, who, despite losing $4.5 million worth of longing ETH, opened another long worth over $17 million. Other Bullish Signals For ETH Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently revealed that Ethereum experienced a decent breakout to a descending trendline on the daily chart of its Bitcoin pair. He added that Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also shows an associated breakout from a symmetrical triangle. The crypto analyst claimed that the value of the RSI is also now above 50, which is considered bullish for a crypto token. Based on these signals, Trader Tardigrade stated it is “time for Ethereum.” He also suggested that other altcoins will moon once Ethereum begins its parabolic move to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Transactions Just Hit A New ATH – What’s Driving It? Derek also predicted this, stating that the “rise of Ethereum will drive the explosive rise of altcoins that have been oppressed.” While sharing his bullish sentiment towards Ethereum, crypto analyst Crypto Prof echoed a similar sentiment, remarking that altcoins will “run even more” as Ethereum trades significantly higher in the coming months. Before now, Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe predicted that the narrative would shift toward Ethereum post-halving and that the crypto token and other altcoins would bounce in their Bitcoin pair once the hype around the halving was over. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,170, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42408336,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnp6,1714419096,Wasabi Wallet and Phoenix Leave the U.S.; What’s Next for Non-Custodial Crypto?,"Two Bitcoin wallets are pulling out of the U.S. market — likely as a response to recent regulatory action taken against the non-custodial Samourai Wallet and indications that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the most popular Ethereum access point MetaMask.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On Friday, Paris-based Bitcoin company Acinq announced it is pulling its popular Lightning network wallet, Phoenix, from app stores in the U.S., citing regulatory uncertainty. Users are recommended to close their channels and move their funds before access is terminated on May 3, 2023.  See also: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets  A day later, zkSNACKs announced it is closing off access to its privacy-preserving Wasabi Wallet in the U.S., saying “In light of recent announcements by U.S. authorities, zkSNACKs is now strictly prohibiting U.S. users from using its services,” in an April 27 statement.  The point was echoed in Acinq’s statement, which said “recent announcements from U.S. authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.”  It’s unclear exactly what announcements Acinq is responding to, but legal action taken against Samourai Wallet and the recently disclosed Wells Notice inquiring about MetaMask indicate that non-custodial wallets could fall under U.S. regulatory purview.  Further, an April 26 U.S. Department of Justice court document responding to a motion to dismiss a case against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm indicates that even decentralized, non-custodial services likely need to implement KYC/AML and register with FinCEN, based on Section 1960 of the U.S. Code.  “This would extend the MSB laws to encompass practically everything in the cryptocurrency space outside of a user who runs their own node,” crypto advocate Seth For Privacy wrote on X. “If no control is required for money transmission, then anything that makes it easier to use Bitcoin could fall into this overbroad definition.”  Many observers in the crypto community have noted that the decision to pull Phoenix from the U.S. is regrettable, but largely understandable given the legal uncertainty. Jack Dorsey, founder of fintech firm Block, which built a hardware wallet, lamented that Acinq’s move “feels completely unnecessary.”  “Agreed. This is not the way,” Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark said in response to Dorsey.  The news comes off the heels of the latest crypto company indictment, the arrest of Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and Chief Technology Officer William Hill, for running an unlicensed money transmission business. The DOJ alleges that Samourai processed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, earning more than $4.5 million in fees since 2015.  While legal experts have challenged the ground for going after non-custodial platforms that do not hold assets on behalf of users, authorities around the world have for years tried to bring these software systems under some sort of regulatory oversight.  See also: UK Government Backtracks on Unhosted Wallet Data  The E.U., for instance, has been mulling a 1,000 euro ($1,080) limit on crypto transactions from self-hosted crypto wallets as part of new anti-money laundering laws. U.S. authorities have also considered introducing legislation that would essentially ban “unhosted wallets,” which was successfully beaten back in 2022.  But new legal actions and statements from authorities have upped the uncertainty, raising the prospect that many core crypto activities beyond building wallets could fall under money transmission laws, including even hosting a Lightning node. Like much else in crypto, these concerns will likely come down to court decisions, which is partially why Consensys, for one, has decided to sue the SEC.  It’s unclear whether Phoenix and Wasabi will be the only wallets to leave the U.S., though at least one wallet company, Zeus, has vowed to stay. “We’re not going anywhere,” the Zeus account said on X.  “We believe that Zeus is following the letter of the law right now. If the law changes or any judgments are made, we will make adjustments accordingly,” Zeus founder Evan Kaloudis said.  “If Zeus falls, all other Lightning node operators are next. If Lightning node operators fall, self-custody is next. This is the hill to die on: self-custody. If you don’t agree, you were never in Bitcoin for the right reasons. So get behind us, or go home. Future generations are watching and depending on us.”  See also: Samourai Wallet Charges Raise Existential Questions",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/29/wasabi-wallet-and-phoenix-leave-the-us-whats-next-for-non-custodial-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b4ec4cfa43094c7ea992292576858cac9693ef9-5980x3364.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the crypto clampdowns in Asia, the digital asset drama in 2022 and continuing regulatory sanctions in the U.S., European crypto markets benefited from less intensive regulatory scrutiny. As growth in the eurozone continues at pace, the importance of regionalized risk management tools will become more prevalent. By Payal Shah At A Glance Europe is the second-largest cryptocurrency economy in the world, accounting for 17.6% of global transaction volume The launch of Micro Euro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts aims to accelerate the institutionalization of the European crypto market European investors have become a leading force in the crypto world, with their fervor expected to keep pace this year and beyond. Central, Northern and Western Europe (CNWE) is the second-largest cryptocurrency economy in the world, behind North America. The region accounted for 17.6% of global transaction volume between July 2022 and June 2023, according to the 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report by Chainalysis. There are four major factors behind Europeans embrace of crypto: 1. Shutdowns in other regions With the crypto clampdowns in Asia, the digital asset drama in 2022 and continuing regulatory sanctions in the U.S., European crypto markets benefited from less intensive regulatory scrutiny. The euro is the second highest traded fiat currency for spot crypto transactions after the U.S. dollar (USD), with growing liquidity. The transaction volume in Europe has mostly been driven by the decline in trading activity in Asia, where countries like China have banned crypto trading and mining. There is also tremendous activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) coming out of Europe, familiarizing European markets with the notion of disintermediated financial transactions. The growth is also driven by institutional inflows. Year-to-date, 24% of Bitcoin and Ether futures volume at CME Group has been transacted from the EMEA region. Given the recent volatility in the euro FX markets, and recent USD/EUR parity, accessing BTCUSD-based spot markets is more expensive for euro-funded or euro-income based investors. 2. Liquidity at the heart of investments For an asset to be investable by institutions, it needs to have sufficient liquidity. European institutions have access to exchanges that offer a broader range of crypto ETFs, exchange-traded notes ((ETN)), funds, derivatives, perpetual contracts and a maturing array of platforms on which to transact. Reliable onramps have notably improved over the past few years, as a handful of European exchanges have raised significant funding rounds and global exchanges have expanded their European presence. 3. Yield through decentralized finance (DeFi) Across the region, DeFi is the most popular service category, accounting for 54.8% of cryptocurrency value received. DeFi has played a key role in CNWE’s crypto adoption over the past few years, most notably with decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Why are European investors banking on DeFi? The answer can be summed up in two words that characterize the European banking landscape: yield and technology. European institutions are accustomed to receiving interest payments on their bank deposits and typically consider an account offering a rate higher than inflation as a valuable investment option. However, with interest rates hovering near zero or even dipping into negative territory in recent years, institutions have been compelled to seek yield elsewhere. There is a growing recognition that yield must be sought in technological ventures, with DeFi platforms emerging as alternative avenues. These evolving dynamics are driving crypto assets closer to integration with traditional financial systems, opening up new avenues for yield generation for both investors and entrepreneurs. The recent performance of crypto markets, coupled with in depth analysis of investment trends, underscores a robust demand for such assets. The resulting wave of innovation meets this demand and may end up benefiting market participants of all types. 4. Technological advancements European financial institutions are avid adopters of technical advancements, a tendency stemming from their historical emphasis on IT infrastructure, surpassing that of U.S banks. This inclination has been driven by the need to remain competitive compared to their U.S. counterparts. Innovation has been pivotal in propelling the recent expansion of the banking sector, to the extent that many Europeans cannot recall the last time they used a paper check. Consequently, financial institutions are starting to view decentralized finance not as a threat but as a promising opportunity. Several prominent stock exchanges are already setting up for the convergence of traditional and crypto asset trading. Many banks are looking into both centralized and decentralized blockchain-based applications and have intentions to offer crypto trading, a process that is likely to accelerate as their institutional clients become more active in the field. Regional Risk Management As growth in the eurozone continues at pace, the importance of regionalized risk management tools will become more prevalent. The euro-denominated, and euro-margined, Micro Bitcoin Euro and Micro Ether Euro futures contracts provide market participants with additional tools to hedge exposure to bitcoin and ether – the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

The discussion intensified following the Ripple CTO David Schwartz and Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson’s debate on X. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reverse Gains, Can ETH Bulls Save The Day? Is There A Double Standard For Ethereum? On Thursday, crypto firm Consensys sued the US SEC, accusing the regulator of “unlawful seizure of authority” over Ethereum. Following the news, an online conversation sparked regarding the SEC’s alleged favoring of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. X users commented on crypto exchanges’ “double standard.” Many pointed out platforms like Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Bitstamp delisted XRP after the SEC’s crackdown on Ripple. Hey @coinbase @cryptocom @BinanceUS @Bitstamp @BittrexExchange when delist Ethereum? Are you still trying to comply with regulatory concerns or no??? pic.twitter.com/QiWG9qEUbZ — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) April 26, 2024 Moreover, members of the crypto community also asked for ETH’s delisting. One user stated that if the crypto asset “doesn’t get delisted, we know #ETHGate is real.” The theories about the SEC attacking Ripple and XRP in favor of Ethereum are part of an ongoing saga that has raised concerns and speculation over the agency’s regulatory inconsistency. Last year, lawyer and crypto expert Jeremy Hogan weighed in on the publication of Hinman’s emails and drafts from his 2018 speech. Hogan alleged that the former SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance director was likely paid by someone related to the Ethereum Foundation to give a speech giving ETH a “free pass.” Ripple CTO Questions Hoskinson’s ETH Gate Stand Charles Hoskinson stated that an apology from the XRP army and Ripple executives was needed before a project collaboration. Hoskinson alleged during a recent X Space meeting that XRP’s community has attacked him daily since 2022. Following the session, members of the XRP army cursed him out and declared he was wrong. Hoskinson replied, seemingly trying to prove his point, alleging the hate “It’s never-ending and completely devoid of reason.” Jack, a prominent figure in the XRP community, argued that platforming those who attacked Hoskinson would not help the situation. Cardano’s founder then corrected someone, claiming he “misspoke” and “mischaracterized” the community’s allegations. Hoskinson clarified he didn’t misspeak, as people believe “members of the Ethereum community bribed the SEC to take out XRP.” According to him, this narrative has reignited several times with “no evidence of it.” Ripple’s CTO joined the discussion, questioning Hoskinson over his claims of lack of evidence. Schwartz stated: “So, was Hinman not intimately involved? Did he not have a financial interest in Ethereum? Did he recuse himself? Or is that not evidence for some reason?” So, was Hinman not intimately involved? Did he not have a financial interest in Ethereum? Did he recuse himself? Or is that not evidence for some reason? — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 28, 2024 To Hoskinson, Schwartz was “inciting a mob by spreading false information.” He also denied invalidating the ETH Gate arguments, claiming his “grand conspiracy statements have always been related to the belief that somebody from Ethereum bribed the SEC to go after XRP.” The back-and-forth between the two crypto gurus ended with Ripple’s CTO further doubling down on his questions. He asked whether Hoskinson didn’t think any of his statements were evidence that Hinman’s interests influenced and affected the litigation against Ripple, which received no reply.

42408334,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnln,1714416033,Press Briefing With ChinaAMC Executive Ahead of Tuesday Launch of Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs,"In addition to the higher seed money, Zhu Haokang also took note of the availability of in-kind subscriptions and redemptions as well as the regulatory clarity in Hong Kong that allowed a spot ether ETF before one was available in the U.S. Also participating in the briefing was Wayne Huang, head of ETF and custody at crypto exchange OSL.  Source: Foresight News  What does China Asset Management (Hong Kong) think about the scale of capital inflows on the first day of listing of Hong Kong cryptocurrency ETFs tomorrow?  Zhu Haokang : I am very confident that the initial listing scale of Hong Kong’s virtual asset spot ETF (more than US$125 million) can exceed the issuance scale on the first day of the United States. The issuance scale of the 10 US Bitcoin spot ETF issuers on the first day of January 10 this year was $125 million. Huaxia is confident that it will become the largest ETF issuer among the three issuers. The details will be revealed to everyone at 9:30 tomorrow morning.  Wayne Huang : There will be an announcement from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at 9:30 tomorrow morning, but OSL has indeed completed its first day of raising funds on OSL today with two funds (including Huaxia and another fund that cooperates with us). Judging from the numbers, the transactions are indeed far greater than the capital inflow of the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF on its first day of trading.  What is the difference between Spot China Bitcoin ETF and Spot China Ethereum ETF and other ETFs?  Zhu Haokang : The first difference is that compared with the US spot Bitcoin ETF, we have spot and physical subscriptions and redemptions, which the US spot Bitcoin ETF does not have.  In addition, there are two differences between ChinaAMC's products and the other two: ChinaAMC's Hong Kong spot ETF is the only ETF with Hong Kong dollar, US dollar and RMB counters. The second is that in addition to listed shares, we have unlisted shares. These two points are not available in the other two companies.  In addition to Hong Kong, where else have investors participated in the Hong Kong virtual asset spot ETF?  Zhu Haokang : Thanks to the physical subscription method, first of all, investors include Bitcoin mines, etc. They can use their Bitcoin holdings to directly purchase virtual asset spot ETFs in Hong Kong. Secondly, in countries and regions that have not yet issued ETFs outside of Hong Kong, such as Singapore and the Middle East, we have also come into contact with a large number of investors who are extremely interested. In addition, although the current spot Bitcoin ETF market in the United States is very large, compared with the United States, Hong Kong uses cash and physical subscriptions and is open for trading during Asian trading hours, which will still attract many American investors. Finally, several family offices in Asia and overseas are also very interested in spot crypto ETFs.  Is there currently only one securities firm, Victory Securities, qualified to conduct relevant transactions in physical subscriptions?  Wayne Huang : Not only Victory Securities can do physical subscription, but also Huaying Securities with the support of OSL. Currently, there are three securities firms that can do physical subscription, and there will be more follow-up later. Therefore, after the ETF is listed tomorrow, many brokers will follow up, and it is possible that more brokers will participate in the entire ecosystem of virtual asset ETFs in May.  What are the specific operations for physical purchase?  Wayne Huang : Physical subscription is a pioneering initiative for Hong Kong ETFs that is different from US ETFs. First, the brokerage firm needs to upgrade its No. 1 license to be able to handle virtual asset transactions. Investors can transfer their coins to OSL through this brokerage firm, and then finally transfer their equity back to OSL. Transfer it to the fund's custody account and complete the entire process of physical subscription.  What is OSL’s anti-money laundering process in physical subscription? Is it acceptable for the counterparty to be the wallet of the other exchange?  Wayne Huang : First, investors must connect to OSL through a brokerage firm to open an account. We will perform a whitelist verification on the wallet that is about to transfer money to prove that this wallet is held and controlled by the investor. Second, we will verify the investment. The user's private wallet must be screened to see if there are any suspicious transactions in the wallet's past dozens of transactions on the chain. Only wallets that have passed the whitelist verification can allow him to transfer money.  Can a wallet be the wallet of another exchange? In theory, this can be done. If the anti-money laundering rules of the other exchange are consistent with the OSL rules, we can accept the other party's transfer of coins, but we need the other exchange to provide certain customer information.  Can Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency spot ETFs be open to mainland investors? Or will there be a possibility of opening it up to mainland investors in the future?  Zhu Haokang : Currently, mainland Chinese investors are not allowed to invest in Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency spot ETFs. Hong Kong’s qualified investors, institutional investors, retail investors, and international investors that meet the regulations can all invest in cryptocurrency spot ETFs. For details, you can consult brokers and sales channels, and continue to pay attention to whether there are corresponding regulatory adjustments or the introduction of a specific regulatory framework in the future.  Hong Kong’s Ethereum spot ETF is the first in the world, but if the United States finally determines that “Ethereum” is a security, will it affect Hong Kong’s Ethereum spot ETF?  Wayne Huang : Probably not, because whether the United States defines Ethereum as a security does not affect the independent decision-making of the Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission. The Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission has its own set of procedures for determining whether a certain virtual asset is a security and whether it can be opened to retail traders. It will not be affected by different opinions between various departments in the United States, or ultimately their own unilateral definition. to Hong Kong.  I also want to emphasize why Hong Kong can be the first in the world to launch an Ethereum spot ETF, rather than the United States? The regulation of cryptocurrency in the United States has multiple departments speaking out at the same time, or trying to regulate it. Who should supervise cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong has long been decided, namely the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has given some very clear regulatory frameworks. Hong Kong has already had a clear definition of Ethereum. Ethereum It is not a security, but the first non-securities virtual asset to be included in Hong Kong supervision together with Bitcoin, and it is one of the two targets that can be provided to retail investors.  Will Hong Kong launch other virtual asset ETFs?  Wayne Huang : Only Bitcoin and Ethereum for now. We have repeatedly discussed with the China Securities Regulatory Commission the process of how to list coins in compliance transactions in Hong Kong. Let me share briefly. First, we need the issuer of the virtual asset or ourselves to find a legal opinion stating whether the coin is a security or a non-security. And turn the legal opinion and our due diligence on the currency into a detailed research report and submit it to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. After final approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, it will be first opened to professional investors. When a certain level of liquidity is reached, it will be included. After a period of time within the scope of an index, we can apply to the Securities Regulatory Commission to upgrade the currency to be traded by retail investors.  But so far, after 4 years of operation, OSL still has only two assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, open to retail investors for trading. That is to say, for the time being, only these two coins meet the conditions for launching ETFs. , but we have been discussing and studying with the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  Will you consider launching ETFs such as inverse leverage of virtual assets?  Zhu Haokang : ETF itself is full of financial attributes, which involve the innovation of many financial products. We have also seen some international investment banks make some financial innovations and develop similar derivatives on existing US products. We are also paying close attention and communicating with a large number of investment banks and securities firms. To give a simple example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange also allows ETFs to be short-selling and even margin trading. We are also communicating with our partners to create more income and more innovation in financial products for our ETF investors. .  How do you think the next cryptocurrency ETF will affect the price of cryptocurrency?  Zhu Haokang : Based on the analysis of various factors, we believe that cryptocurrency ETFs will be beneficial to cryptocurrency prices. First, Hong Kong’s crypto spot ETF market injects more liquidity into the crypto market. Second, accelerate the compliance of the industry. Third, funding channels have been expanded. Fourth, investors may obtain arbitrage opportunities between ETF prices and spot prices, allowing more market makers and arbitrage investors to actively participate. Fifth, with the passage of our crypto spot ETF, trading factors in traditional markets will also directly affect the cryptocurrency market. Sixth point, we believe that Hong Kong’s regulatory framework is relatively clear, and the issuance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products provides great convenience. Seventh point, we believe that Hong Kong, as an international financial center, will attract more Chinese investors to trade during Asian time periods, improve market liquidity, and perform better than similar products in Europe or Canada.  Huaxia’s rates are higher than those of the other two Hong Kong companies. Are you worried about lack of competitiveness?  Zhu Haokang : I think everyone is more concerned about the fee issue. First of all, the fee structure of China Asset Management Hong Kong fully follows the standards of thematic and complex ETFs listed in Hong Kong. You can refer to the past listed cryptocurrency, futures ETFs and various thematic ETFs. Charges. Our charges are lower than similar charges. Second, our products provide very high flexibility in trading options, not only supporting listed and unlisted shares, but also supporting three types of over-the-counter transactions in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and RMB. This is our unique advantage. Thirdly, the complexity and innovation of our products determine the importance of our risk management and operational stability.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/29/press-briefing-with-chinaamc-executive-ahead-of-tuesday-launch-of-hong-kong-spot-bitcoin-and-ether-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ba24e4d9cb54970fed2b3aa45aa6799e3b49d17-5517x3679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26569917,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605546,1714415441,"This Bitcoin Metric Foreshadowed Recent Price Drops, Quant Reveals","A quant has pointed out how a Bitcoin metric may have detected selling pressure in the market, and therefore, the subsequent price drops, in advance. Bitcoin CDD Registered Spikes Before Recent Price Plunges In a new post on X, an analyst has discussed about how the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) on-chain indicator may be used to identify selling pressure in the market early. A “coin day” refers to the quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after staying still on the blockchain for 1 day. When a token stays dormant for a while, it naturally accumulates some number of coin days, and once it’s finally transferred on the network, its coin days counter resets back to zero. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Active: Here’s Where They Are Sending Coins The coin days that this token had been carrying prior to this movement are said to be “destroyed” by the transaction. The CDD keeps track of the total number of such days being reset across the network on any given day. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the CDD for Bitcoin over the last couple of months: The pattern that the indicator has followed alongside the BTC price in the past two months | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin CDD observed a large spike just a few days ago. Whenever this metric’s value shoots up, it means that a large amount of coins previously dormant are now on the move. Such transfers are generally correlated with the long-term holder whales, who are large entities who carry their coins for significant periods, and thus, accumulate a large number of coin days. Often, when these dormant entities finally break their silence, it’s for selling-related purposes. As such, spikes in the CDD can be an indication that the HODLer whales have decided to do some selling. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the major spikes that the indicator observed during the last two months. It would appear that following the onset of such spikes, the asset’s price has generally gone on to witness some bearish action. The aforementioned spike from a few days ago, too, has proven to be bearish for the asset so far as it occurred when Bitcoin had recovered towards $67,000, and the price has since erased this recovery. It would appear that some of these diamond hands had looked at this surge as an exit opportunity. Related Reading: 85% Of Altcoins In “Opportunity Zone,” Santiment Reveals Last month, the CDD had seen two spikes even larger than this recent one. These spikes had occurred near what continues to be the top for the rally so far. Thus, the selling pressure from HODLers may have played a role in this top and the subsequent drawdown that followed. Given the relationship that this metric has appeared to have held with the Bitcoin price, it may be worth keeping an eye on it, as it may continue to indicate the onset of selling pressure in the near future as well. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its bearish trajectory during the past day as it has now slipped towards the $62,300 level.

According to a blog post written by the Eigen Foundation, the non-profit supporting the protocol, there will be a total supply of about 1.67 billion EIGEN tokens, and 45% of those will go toward the EigenLayer community. The 45% is divided into three subgroups, with stakedrops, future community initiatives and ecosystem development each receiving buckets of 15%.  ""The total supply of EIGEN at launch is 1,673,646,668.28466 tokens,"" the foundation revealed. ""This number is the result of encoding the phrase 'Open Innovation' onto a classic telephone keypad.""  EMBED: https://twitter.com/eigenfoundation/status/1785000100315504776  Crypto traders have been speculating for many months that EigenLayer would come out with its own token, and they had piled deposits into the protocol even before it went live a few weeks ago, on bets that they would receive rewards for early users. EigenLayer is at the core of a new trend known as ""restaking,"" where users’ ether (ETH) tokens that are deposited or ""staked"" as security on the Ethereum blockchain can be repurposed to secure additional networks or protocols.  The project is led by Sreeram Kannan, who founded it in 2021 when he was an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Washington.  EigenLayer went live earlier this month, but it is has not yet activated most of the core features that make the project notable – including its reward system and mission-critical ""slashing"" mechanism.  In Monday's post, Eigen Foundation wrote that the first ""season"" of the ""stakedrop,"" as the team described the planned token release, some 5% of the token supply will be distributed to users based on their staking activities on March 15, at Ethereum block No. 19437000. The claim for these EIGEN tokens opens on May 10, and will close after 120 days.  According to the foundation, investors will be allocated 29.5% of the token supply, and 25.5% will go towards early contributors. Both groups will have a three-year lock period, “with a full lock in year one, followed by a linear unlock of 4% of their total allocation each month over the next two years.”  In addition, at the launch of the EIGEN token, users will be able to secure EigenDA, Eigenlayer’s Actively Validated Service (AVS) for data availability, with their EIGEN tokens. Other AVSs are expected to follow, the foundation wrote.  That restaked ETH is used collectively to secure these auxiliary AVS networks on EigenLayer.  As part of the EIGEN drop, the protocol is bringing in a new technological design known as ""intersubjective forking,” a feature meant to support “intersubjective faults.”  “Intersubjective faults are instances of misbehavior that cannot be objectively identified on-chain, yet any two reasonable observers would agree that a penalty is deserved,” according to the blog post.  The system will empower the AVSs to make a ""much wider range of credible commitments than is possible today, significantly expanding the possibilities of what can be built on EigenLayer,"" the foundation said. ""Use cases include transaction ordering, databases, prediction markets, storage services, oracles, artificial intelligence, and more.""

26566461,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605576,1714410011,"Crypto Analyst Says Altcoins Are About To Enter A Parabolic Curve, Here’s Why","Expectations for the crypto industry are still high, and altcoins, in particular, are expected to do well. One crypto analyst known as El Crypto Prof on X (formerly Twitter), shares this sentiment, expecting the altcoin market to go on a parabolic rally. Altcoins Are Set To Explode In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst highlighted why the altcoins market was said to explode. The chart attached to the post showed previous bull cycles for the crypto market and why the current muted performance from the market was normal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Transactions Just Hit A New ATH – What’s Driving It? For example, back in 2016, the crypto market went into accumulation mode after the Bitcoin halving, where altcoins stalled for a while before picking up. The same was the case in 2020 as well following the Bitcoin halving, with accumulation dominating the market for a few months before bouncing. The same trend is repeating itself in 2024 after the Bitcoin halving was completed a week ago. Looking at the chart, the crypto analyst highlights this accumulation trend is happening once again. But this is not the only thing that is repeating itself. Following each period of accumulation has been the backtest, and a successful confirmation above this point has always begun the altcoin rally. The analyst points out that this backtest is already happening, and from here, altcoins could see a significant explosion. #Altcoins Anyone who is bearish here obviously hasn’t done their homework. Altcoins about to enter the parabolic curve, if we repeat 2016 and 2020. History doesn’t repeat itself, but It often rhymes. -Accumulation1⃣ -Backtest2⃣🎯 -Send it3⃣ Months of glory ahead imo. pic.twitter.com/uUrKj8qau1 — 𝕄𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕔ⓗ𝕖 🧲 (@el_crypto_prof) April 28, 2024 They further explain that if the trend continues like it did in 2016 and 2020, then the altcoins market could see “months of glory ahead.” This could easily see the total altcoin market cap double like it did in 2016 and 2020, and given the current market cap of around $1 trillion, the market cap is expected to cross $2 trillion. “Anyone who is bearish here obviously hasn’t done their homework,” the analyst warned. Crypto Market Still Bullish Despite the price declines that have rocked Bitcoin and altcoins over the month of April, the market remains bullish. One indicator of this is that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to trend in the greed territory, meaning investors are still willing to put money in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Raises Bull Flag, Formation Triggers Calls For $100,000 Rekt Capital, another crypto analyst, also backs up Crypto Prof’s analysis. The analyst also took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that the Bitcoin price is also in an accumulation phase, which he refers to as the “Re-Accumulation period.” However, the analyst believes that many will miss the subsequent breakout, saying, “Months from now, nobody will remember this Re-Accumulation period. But everybody will remember the Parabolic Phase that comes afterwards.” #BTC We are here (green circle) Months from now, nobody will remember this Re-Accumulation period But everybody will remember the Parabolic Phase that comes afterwards And they will remember and talk about it for years to come$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gO52E7ZnKX — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 28, 2024 Altcoins market cap at $1.016 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC on Tradingview.com Featured image from Cointribune, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-altcoins-parabolic-curve/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/26566461.jpeg

26564161,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605645,1714406410,Bitcoin Long-Term Outlook: Analyst Foresees Peak In Late 2025,"Following the fourth Bitcoin Halving, Rekt Capital, a popular cryptocurrency trader and expert, has offered a compelling narrative on the future trajectory of Bitcoin, predicting that the crypto asset could peak this bull cycle in the following year. Rekt Capital’s analysis emphasizes on the possibility that this current cycle could reiterate past Halving cycle trends, positioning BTC for significant gains in the coming months. Bitcoin Could Mirror Past Halving Cycle According to the analyst, Bitcoin reached its all-time high within 518 days following the Halving in the 2015–2017 cycle. Meanwhile, after the event in the 2019-2021 bull cycle, the digital asset topped out within 546 days. This suggests that the event has always catalyzed massive growth for the leading cryptocurrency asset. Related Reading: Legendary Trader Predicts When Bitcoin’s Bull Run Will End Should the past trend hold, the next bull market top might happen between 518 and 546 days following the recently concluded fourth Halving, particularly around the middle of September or middle of October in 2025, according to Rekt Capital. The analyst noted that in this cycle Bitcoin is accelerating by about 220 days currently. Thus, the longer time BTC consolidates after this Halving, it will be better for resynchronizing this current cycle with the previous events cycle. Rekt Capital also noted that Bitcoin has experienced further declines in the three weeks after the Halving, according to historical data from 2016. He has labeled the period as the Post-Halving “Danger Zone,” this is where there is a chance of downside volatility at the range low of the Re-accumulation Range. In 2016, approximately 21 days after the occurrence, Bitcoin saw a lengthy -11% decline before gaining momentum toward the upside. However, data for 2016 indicates that if there will be downside volatility in this cycle around the Re-Accumulation Range Low, it may happen during the following 15 days. Although the post-Halving danger zone ends in 15 days, the 2016 data indicates that there may be some negative volatility in the interim, possibly reaching the $60,600 Range Low. Parabolic Phase For BTC It is worth noting that Rekt Capital anticipates a parabolic phase after the re-accumulation phase is concluded. During this stage, Bitcoin usually sees massive growth leading all the way up to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move Revealed: Trading Guru Reveals This Cryptic Chart Pattern, Here’s What It Says In the previous Halvings, Bitcoin would historically consolidate in this Re-Accumulation Range for up to 150 days before ultimately entering a parabolic phase. Once BTC breaks out of this re-accumulation stage, Rekt Capital expects BTC to see a parabolic upside by September this year if it consolidates within the aforementioned timeframe. At the time of writing, BTC was down by over 5% in the past 7 days and was trading at $62,504. Presently, its market cap is down by 1.53%, while its trading volume has increased by over 22% in the last 24 hours.

42408320,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCn87,1714404290,The Changing Face of Risk in DeFi,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is experiencing renewed momentum. The activity in new ecosystems, and the high yields, resemble the famous 2021 DeFi Summer. The variety of innovative protocols makes it incredibly hard for investors to keep up, while at the same time, the impressive growth raises concerns about risks accumulating in the DeFi ecosystem.  You might have heard the doomsday analyses comparing the most successful protocols of this wave, like Ethena or Eigen Layer LRTs, with risk management disasters like Terra, without really providing any credible evidence of the parallels. Fact is, this new generation of fast-growing DeFi protocols is much more mature and a lot of thought has gone into risk management. However, there is still plenty of risk.  Jesus Rodriguez, the CEO of IntoTheBlock, is a speaker on the AI Stage at Consensus 2024, May 29-31.  The biggest risk in the current DeFi market is not based on mechanistic failures such as those that caused the collapse of Terra, but rather on three key factors: scale, complexity, and interconnectivity.  Protocols in this DeFi wave have grown quite large in a matter of months, they enable more complex financial primitives, and they are incredibly interconnected. That combination of complexity, size and interconnectivity has drastically outpaced the capabilities of the risk models in the current DeFi market. In simple terms, there are plenty of risk conditions in the current DeFi markets for which we don’t have credible risk models. And that gap seems to be increasing, not shrinking.  The Four Biggest Risks in Modern DeFi  Risk has been part of the DeFi narrative since the beginning, and it's very easy to discuss it in broad, generic terms. This new era of DeFi brings novel innovations and has grown significantly fast. As a result, risk is taking on a different connotation than before. Taking a first-principles approach to analyze risk in this era of DeFi highlights four fundamental factors: scale, speed, complexity and interconnectivity.  To illustrate these factors, consider the differences in quantifying risk for a basic AMM with a few hundred million in TVL versus an AMM that uses restaked assets with their corresponding point systems and introduces its own tokens and points. The former risk model can be solved with basic statistical or machine learning methods. The latter enters the domain of much more advanced branches of mathematics and economics such as complexity or chaos theory, which are nowhere near being applied in DeFi.  Let’s look at the different factors in more detail.  1) Scale  The principle of the relationship between risk and scale in DeFi is incredibly simple. In financial markets, modeling risk at a smaller scale, say a few hundred million, is very different than at a few hundred billion. At a larger scale, there are always risk conditions that surface that were not present at smaller scales. This principle certainly applies to DeFi as a parallel financial system with many interconnected primitives.  Ethena is one of the most innovative projects of the current wave of DeFi and has attracted billions in TVL in just a few months. The biggest challenge for Ethena in the current market is to adapt its risk and insurance models to that scale in the event of funding rates going negative for a long time.  2) Speed  The relationship between risk and speed is the traditional friction between growing too big too fast. As a risk condition, speed acts as an accelerator to scale. A protocol that goes from a few million to a few billion in TVL in just a few months might not have the time to adjust its risk models to the new scale before unforeseen risk conditions appear.  The rapid rise of EigenLayer triggered an entire movement of LRTs, several of which grew to several billions in TVL in just a few months while still lacking basic functionalities such as withdrawals. The combination of speed and scale can exacerbate simple depegging conditions into really impactful risk factors in some of these protocols.  3) Complexity  The entire field of complexity theory was born to study systems that escape the laws of predictive models. Economic risk has been at the center of complexity theory almost since its early days as world economies rapidly outgrew risk models post-World War II. Modeling risk in a simple economic system is, well, just simple.  In the new wave of DeFi, we have protocols such as Pendle or Gearbox, which abstract quite sophisticated primitives such as yield derivatives and leverage. The risk models for these protocols are fundamentally more difficult than those from the previous generation of DeFi protocols.  4) Interconnectivity  Widely interconnected economic systems can be a nightmare from the risk perspective as any condition can have numerous cascading effects. However, interconnectivity is a natural step in the evolution of economic systems.  The current DeFi ecosystem is much more interconnected than its predecessors. We have restaking derivatives in EigenLayer being tokenized and trading in pools in Pendle or being used with leverage in Gearbox. The result is that risk conditions in one protocol can rapidly permeate through different key building blocks of the DeFi ecosystem, which makes risk models incredibly challenging to build.  Transitioning from Technical to Economic Risk  Hacks and exploits have been the dominant risk theme in DeFi for the last few years, but that might be starting to change. The new generation of DeFi protocols is not only more innovative but also much more robust from the technical security standpoint. Auditing firms have gotten smarter, and protocols are taking security much more seriously.  As an evolving financial system, the risk in DeFi seems to be transitioning from technical to economic. The large scale, fast growth speed, increasing complexity, and deep interconnectivity are moving DeFi into unforeseen territories from the risk perspective. With only a handful of companies working on risk in DeFi, the challenge is now to catch up.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/29/the-changing-face-of-risk-in-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54cae3eadaf0212aa7ccf5c23ce363e107b04308-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Polygon In Peril: Will MATIC Bounce Back Or Stay Stuck In The Sub-$1 Doldrums? The report indicates that the average Ethereum transaction fee has plunged to a mere $1.12, marking the lowest daily average cost since October 18th, 2023. Ethereum Transaction Fees: A Window Into Market Sentiment This significant decrease in transaction fees has sparked discussions among crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike. Santiment’s analysis suggests a strong correlation between transaction fees and the overall sentiment within the cryptocurrency market.

By tracking these fees, they can glean valuable insights into investor confidence and underlying demand dynamics. Lower Fees: Cause For Concern Or Optimism? The current low transaction fees present something of a conundrum for investors. On the one hand, they could indicate a decline in network activity, potentially reflecting a bearish market sentiment. However, Santiment’s analysis offers a more optimistic perspective. The report proposes that the lower fees, coupled with the recent easing of network difficulty, could pave the way for a smoother recovery for Ethereum and other altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies). Ethereum is now trading at $3172. Chart: TradingView While the low fees might signal lower demand, they could also signify a welcome reduction in network congestion, analysts say. This, in turn, could potentially act as a catalyst for Ethereum’s price recovery, although it’s important to note that this might signal a faster turnaround than many anticipate. Investor Takeaway: Data Is King In The Cryptoverse The ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market can be daunting for even seasoned investors. Santiment’s data-driven approach, with its emphasis on transaction fees as a sentiment indicator, offers valuable insights for navigating this volatile space.

42408338,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnz1,1714400118,"Binance's CZ Will Spend Less Than a Year in Prison, Polymarket Traders Bet","This week in prediction markets:  Polymarket bettors think Binance ex-CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao will spend less time in prison than what the U.S. DOJ is asking for.  The CFTC weighs a ban on election derivatives.  How low will the Federal Reserve go?  Binance's founder and former CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, will be sentenced in a U.S. court in Seattle Tuesday. The Department of Justice said in a recent sentencing memo that he should spend three years in prison, citing the scale of his misconduct.  Polymarket bettors think he'll be out much sooner.  ""Yes"" shares for the ""less than six months"" contract on the crypto-based prediction market platform were trading at about 42 cents Monday, indicating a 42% chance CZ will be out in less than six months. (Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.)  Trading levels show a 17% chance he'll get 6-11 months, and a 19% chance that he'll get 12-17. All in all, the money says there's around a 96% chance that he'll be out in less than two years and a less than 2% chance he'll get sentenced for 30-35 months, which is around what the feds are asking.  The traders might be counting on letters of support to help convince the presiding judge to trim the sentence significantly from what the DOJ asked for.  Read more: Why the DOJ May Have Recommended a Three-Year Sentence for CZ  Among those who signed such letters included in a submission to the courts were Max S. Baucus, former U.S. Ambassador to China; professors from Columbia and CZ's alma mater McGill Universities; Morgan Stanley Managing Director Sean Yang; and members of the ruling family in the United Arab Emirates.  ""There is no excuse for my failure to establish the necessary compliance controls at Binance,” CZ wrote in his own letter, while giving an assurance that this would be his only “encounter with the criminal justice system.”  CFTC vs. political bets  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking to tighten the screws on prediction markets, Bloomberg reports.  The regulator is considering a ban on derivatives for betting on U.S. elections and may also restrict other event contracts, including those on sports and global health crises, the news service said. This comes as the CFTC faces a lawsuit from Kalshi, which doesn't offer direct election contracts, but bets on approval rating numbers or other political events like appointments, and is challenging the agency's decision not to approve its plans for election-related contracts.  Even though the Republican primary season was one of the shortest in history, as most contestants dropped out in weeks, unable to trump Donald Trump, interest in the general election is at an all-time high, going by the nearly $117 million – up from $100 million a few weeks ago – bet on a Polymarket contract about its outcome.  On paper, this $117 million would not have come from Americans, because part of a settlement with the CFTC requires Polymarket to block U.S.-based users.  Keep in mind that at a state level, betting on elections is widely illegal. Nevada spells it out clearly in Nevada Revised Statues § 293.830, which says ""Any person who makes, offers or accepts any bet or wager upon the result of any election, or upon the success or failure of any person or candidate, or upon the number of votes to be cast, either in the aggregate or for any particular candidate, or upon the vote to be cast by any person, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.""  New Jersey and Texas also have similar language on the books. In some other states, gambling on everything is illegal, unless specifically authorized otherwise or if it takes place on Native American tribal territory; this specific authorization is how online sports betting became legal state-by-state.  In other countries, election gambling is also illegal. In Taiwan, the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act specifically prohibits it, and a Polymarket contract about that nation's recent general election led to arrests and a complete national-level block of its domain.  PredictIt, a popular U.S. election betting site, is allowed to operate under a no-action letter from the CFTC which limits the number of bettors on each question to 5,000 and the size of each bet to $850. The regulator yanked the letter last year and ordered PredictIt to shut down but the platform sued and won the right to stay in business, for now.  Will U.S. interest rates drop below 5.25%?  There's renewed talk of the Federal Reserve cutting rates, as fears of stagflation grip the traditional finance and crypto markets.  On Kalshi – which unlike Polymarket is licensed by the CFTC, does business only in the U.S. and settles bets in dollars – the highest single probability (37%) is for zero cuts this year, although there's a combined 60% odds for 1-3 cuts.  When the cuts come, how low will they go?  Lower than 5.25%, the hive mind says, giving it a 62% chance, and a 36% chance of it being lower than 5%.  The central bank's benchmark rates is currently at 5.5%.  Of course, the last time the Fed seriously cut rates was during the Covid-19 pandemic, and before that, in 2019 as a way to hedge against the possible consequences of then-president Trump's trade wars with China.

26559449,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605574,1714399208,CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Signal That Shows Bitcoin Is Still Very Bullish,"The Bitcoin price movement in the past few days after the halving event has left many investors wanting. Particularly, price data shows the crypto failed to settle above $65,000 las week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,105, down by 2.96% and 6.14% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin’s Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is still looking bullish, which could be a faint signal of the crypto’s price reversing into bullish momentum. Current State Of Bitcoin As it stands, the price of Bitcoin might be on the way to registering a new monthly low with the risks of more downside below $62,000. A recent analysis during the weekend by Phi Deltalytics, an analyst at CryptoQuant, noted that Bitcoin’s price trajectory is showing indecisiveness in the short term. His analysis is based upon the SOPR ratio, one of the lesser-known but highly useful metrics for analyzing Bitcoin. Related Reading: Brace For Price Impact: Dogecoin Whales Move Massive 456 Million DOGE To Exchanges SOPR measures the profit ratio of spent outputs, which are groups of transactions representing the movement of coins. Phi’s analysis revealed an interesting indecisiveness with this metric. According to this metric, Bitcoin’s short-term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has entered into a zone of indecisiveness, correlating with the current market sentiment. However, the analyst also noted that the adjusted SOPR continues to move in a bullish direction, a confluence that warrants careful planning when entering the market. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? This discrepancy with the SOPR and its adjusted ratio means many short-term holders are now trading Bitcoin at a loss. Interestingly, another CryptoQuant analysis seems to support this idea. Specifically, the long-term SOPR to short-term SOPR ratio is moving in favor of long-term holders, suggesting that long-term holders are realizing greater profits in contrast to short-term holders. Hence, there is persistence of bullish momentum with the adjusted SOPR. A better interpretation of this SOPR ratio is that the price of Bitcoin has not been favorable for short-term holders at the current market conditions. Furthermore, it suggests that the stalling of the upward momentum can be attributed to some long-term holders cashing out their holdings. According to Phi Deltalytics, a reversal of the adjusted SOPR into a bearish signal would finally imply the possibility of a rapid downward shift in the price of Bitcoin. “The persistence of a bullish aSOPR amidst wavering short-term SOPR trends gives rise to the possibility of a rapid downward shift once the aSOPR trajectory reverses,” the analyst mentioned.

Bitcoin’s price has been ranging between $60,000 to $70,000 since it reached a new all-time high. The much-anticipated break above $74,000 now seems to be taking forever, and this lackluster action has prompted some analysts to believe that Bitcoin might have reached its peak in the current market cycle. However, time can only reveal the crypto’s price trajectory in the coming months, particularly with the recent conclusion of another halving event. If halving history repeats itself, Bitcoin could continue its price surge within the next nine months.

42408316,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCmyC,1714398718,We Must Protect Crypto-AI From Financial Nihilism,"Financial nihilism is a flawed philosophy.  It has been used to justify why memecoins and momentum trading are equivalent to projects with a working product and paying customers. Investors who focus on fundamentals have been ridiculed as fools or out of touch with the reality of Web3.  Everything is false, financial nihilism would say. The Federal Reserve is debasing the dollar, it is said, which is in itself a hallucination. All money is rooted in nothing but belief. Equities and public markets are “stonks,” tricking people into thinking they hold something real, while in fact they hold a right to a display-field in custodial software. Stories and narratives are the only things that matter.  Lex Sokolin is the managing partner and co-founder of Generative Ventures, a venture capital fund investing in the machine economy. He is a speaker on the AI Stage at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  There is an elegance in the memecoin. Unlike many ICOs, or various DeFi rugs, or vaporware L2 roll-ups, memecoins do not pretend to have anything other than the animal spirits of story and sentiment. They are an honest product, doing exactly as advertised. It is those other projects, the ones that promise the world but deliver failure, that are deceiving investors.  But there is also a profound misunderstanding in this point of view. The anarchist rebel thinks it is cool to say that nothing matters and all should be torn down. The builder understands that, once the rebellion has exposed the orthodoxy for its weakness, new systems of meaning and value have to be built to replace them. Nothingness is not a goal.  Crypto is intended to be a positive-sum game, not a dog-eat-dog nightmare. Just because some things are meaningless,does not mean that all things are meaningless. We are here to build the new things using profound tools unlocked for us by brilliant technologists. Those that see nothing but opportunism and financial games may become richer on paper. But they have made the entire space poorer as a result.  Raising money in itself should not be a sufficient goal for an entrepreneur  My concern these days is for the evolution of the crypto-AI sector. Generative AI will bring enormous economic growth to the world in a natively digital form. It exposes privacy, ownership, and financial issues that Web3 is uniquely positioned to solve. AI will test the economic infrastructure that blockchain has built over the last 15 years, and whether its promises of self-sovereignty actually hold true. As a result, AI gives us a path to pull Web3 away from the over-reliance on being a casino as its core value proposition -- a casino that often hasn’t been honest about being a casino.  But the usual failure mode is rearing its head. We see large AI-themed projects launching as bridges to nowhere, using the narrative of AI to create marketing that masks the underlying reality – which is rushed vaporware with tokenomics that induces investors to invest, stake or sell. Raising money in itself should not be a sufficient goal for an entrepreneur. Designing financial incentives that attract investors to an AI-themed casino is a disservice to the important role that Web3 has to play in the next century of economic activity.  Throw away the financial nihilism! We must not undermine one of the greatest opportunities by treating it as a costume to wear on fundraising day. Instead, look to the classic advice given to people starting businesses: Find real customers looking to buy products and services to solve actual problems, and design open protocols and networks to deliver those products and services better than the centralized technology firms.  We can use the power of the crowd, community marketing and engagement, and tokenized protocol ownership to outcompete walled gardens and software cathedrals. The Internet and Linux have done it before us, and we can do it again by building the techno-economic architecture for the AI age.

42408322,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnEj,1714398208,Stablecoin Legislation Must Respect the Dual-Banking System,"Long before Bitcoin, Ethereum, or DAOs, the U.S. banking industry had its own form of decentralized governance: the dual-banking system. Under this system, banks can be chartered and, with some important caveats, supervised at either the state or the federal level.  When U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced their stablecoin regulation bill on April 17, the legislators emphasized that the bill seeks to “preserve our dual banking system.” But while the senators deserve credit for pursuing this goal, the Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill falls short by subordinating state regulation to federal control.  Jack Solowey is a Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. Jennifer J. Schulp is the Director of Financial Regulation Studies at the CMFA.  To support the healthy competition among both financial institutions and regulators that the dual-banking system represents, stablecoin legislation must provide a bona fide state pathway free from arbitrary limits and federal gatekeeping.  To be sure, the dual-banking system itself at present is far from federalism perfected, and state and federal jurisdiction over banks does overlap in important ways; state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and/or the Federal Reserve System, for example, face additional federal supervision. But such federal bank supervision makes even less sense for stablecoin issuers, which ultimately provide a payment tool (tokens designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar), not banking services.  While the Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill technically allows for state-chartered stablecoin issuers, it weighs them down with too many restrictions. The most obvious one is a cap on non-depository state trust companies (non-bank entities) that issue stablecoins, limiting them to $10 billion worth of stablecoins outstanding.  State-chartered issuers that wish to be free of these caps would be required to register both as state or federal depository institutions (e.g., banks or credit unions) and national stablecoin issuers. National stablecoin issuers, in turn, need a majority vote of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (Fed Board) to operate.  But remaining state-chartered also wouldn’t exempt issuers from federal licensing and oversight.  Proposed limitations on state-chartered stablecoin issuers subject them to second-class treatment  State-chartered stablecoin issuers would face application requirements issued by the Fed Board and incorporating vague standards regarding the stablecoin’s “benefit to the public” and role in the “stability of the financial system of the United States.” While a federal floor for basic stablecoin operating requirements — e.g., disclosure and reserve obligations — is one thing, federal approval standards for otherwise state-chartered issuers are quite another, particularly where they involve nebulous concepts that give regulators broad discretion and create room for abuse. And, notably, the Fed Board would have the power to block these trust companies from issuing stablecoins with a two-thirds vote.  The result is that the Fed would have the power to decide which banks are allowed to issue stablecoins, as well as to exclude non-bank issuers from competing with those banks.  Such proposed limitations on state-chartered stablecoin issuers subject them to second-class treatment. For instance, while the bill’s $10 billion ceiling on a state trust’s outstanding stablecoins may sound like a wide enough berth, given the importance of user network size and token liquidity to a successful stablecoin such a cap would place state trust issuers at an inherent disadvantage.  Further, giving the Fed Board final veto power over what is, in essence, a license to operate a stablecoin business is fundamentally at odds with the role of state charters in the dual-banking system.  In the words of banking law scholar Arthur E. Wilmarth, Jr., the dual-banking system generally provides “a ‘safety valve,’” for the payment system “to escape from arbitrary, inflexible or outdated regulation.”  This safety valve involves both horizontal (state v. state) and vertical (state v. federal) competition among regulators. Diverse jurisdictions can play the roles of laboratories of innovation, improving frameworks to support new technologies and consumer benefits, vying to attract new businesses, and even residents.  Competition among regulators can also translate into more choices for consumers. For example, innovations arising out of the state banking system have included interstate electronic funds transfer via ATMs. Importantly, competition is a two-way street, and Wilmarth notes that federal developments have, in certain instances, helped to liberalize state banking laws.  It is particularly important for the stablecoin ecosystem to be free from a single regulatory gatekeeper. For one, federal lethargy in providing pathways for stablecoin issuers, as well as crypto-facing businesses more broadly, have led states — like New York and Wyoming — to pick up the slack. Such states would be relegated to a diminished role under the bill.  Avoiding a federal veto over stablecoin licensing is all the more important because the Federal Reserve is conflicted as a provider of payment tools itself. Giving the Fed Board ultimate authority to block its potential competitors unfairly stacks the deck against payment alternatives.  Efforts like the Lummis-Gillibrand stablecoin bill to break the logjam on crypto policy at the federal level are welcome. Nonetheless, for stablecoins to achieve their full potential when it comes to consumer choice in payments, stablecoin legislation must let state-chartered issuers compete on fair terms.  Now is not the time to whittle away at the benefits of the dual-banking system’s form of decentralized regulation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,"Jack Solowey, Jennifer J.

42408332,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnfB,1714397400,Why the DOJ May Have Recommended a Three-Year Sentence for CZ,"While Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s plea agreement said he couldn’t appeal any sentence under 18 months, there were no clauses preventing U.S. prosecutors from recommending a greater sentence.  Zhao is set to be sentenced on April 30, after his November 2023 guilty plea to violating the Bank Secrecy Act.  Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao now faces the genuine possibility of spending three years in U.S. federal prison – well above the possible 18 months laid out in his plea agreement.  Zhao’s sentencing hearing will take place on Tuesday, giving both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and his defense attorneys a chance to argue over how much prison time he should serve after pleading guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act last November. While a plea agreement, which was released in November, gave Zhao the ability to appeal any sentence longer than 18 months, the DOJ asked for 36 in a sentencing memo released last week. The defense asked for house arrest and probation, with no time in prison. The Probation Office recommended five months in its presentence report, according to last week’s defense filing.  By asking for a longer sentence, the DOJ seems to be sending a strong message, said Tama Kudman, a partner with Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner LLP. The DOJ has been trying to tamp down on money laundering via crypto, and Zhao was “pretty flagrant with anti-money laundering rules.”  Read more: Binance's CZ Will Spend Less Than a Year in Prison, Polymarket Traders Bet  “The government wants to make sure these low guidelines don’t give anyone comfort to equally feel free to violate our anti-money laundering initiatives,” she said.  And while the longer sentence may have initially taken the crypto industry by surprise, that doesn’t mean the DOJ is reneging on a firm agreement to only recommend up to 18 months, Kudman said.  “Generally, when we’re negotiating pleas, we’re negotiating things like loss amount and what arguments may be retained by the parties,” she said. “There’s nothing I see in this document that suggests they were limited to the 18 months.”  This cuts both ways: the DOJ kept the ability to argue for a longer sentence than the guidelines suggested, but this is also how the defense can argue for a much shorter sentence than the guidelines suggested, she said.  The DOJ pointed to the volume of funds that flew through Binance without appropriate know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks in place in its filing.  Zhao’s lawyers have argued – with support from family and friends – that he’s repentant, tried to rectify the situation and won’t be a recidivist, so he shouldn’t serve any prison time at all. Instead, they argued that house arrest and probation would meet the needs of justice.  Either way, the decision now rests with the judge, who has broad discretion. He could accept or reject either party’s arguments about the importance of deterrence and what sort of sentence would sufficiently deter potential future crimes by not just Zhao but other members of the crypto community.  Another attorney, who couldn’t comment publicly on the case, agreed that it’s not unusual for prosecutors to ask for a sentence that diverges from the guidelines calculation.  Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is an example of this – the guidelines calculation for his sentence was over 100 years, but prosecutors asked for 50 instead. A judge sentenced him to 25 years in prison.  “It also happens when the guidelines are viewed as not punitive. That’s often the case because the BSA guidelines are relatively low and don’t take into account the aggravating factors,” they said, adding they were not surprised that there was “a flavor of sanctions violation underneath what is formally a BSA charge.”  The biggest example of how Zhao’s hearing may go lies with former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes’ case. Like Zhao, Hayes was charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and pleaded guilty. Hayes received six months of house arrest and two years of probation from the judge overseeing his case.  Appealing the decision  While Zhao has the ability to appeal a longer sentence, it would be difficult for him to succeed, the second attorney said. Circuit courts rarely reverse a district court-imposed sentence, even if it’s excessive, they said.  “The parties wanted to be free to recommend whatever they wanted,” Kudman said. “Every negotiation in every case has its own different flavor with different concerns.”  Nor does she think the DOJ acted in bad faith here. If the DOJ hadn’t disclosed its position during plea negotiations, that would be a sign of bad faith.  But here, the DOJ had very little to lose by asking for a longer sentence, the second attorney said, though other attorneys who might be involved in future plea agreements will certainly be paying attention.  The DOJ’s suggestion that Zhao shouldn’t get credit for taking responsibility may come up.  “In some sense, the sophisticated white collar lawyers will track this plea agreement, and they’ll use it in future negotiations, and that’s why it’s [strange] to have such a low figure for a defendant who had a long history,” the attorney said. “That’ll get quoted back to the DOJ.”  Still, Zhao will earn goodwill from the system for coming in, the second attorney said. Part of that is in the plea agreement itself: “The fact he hasn’t pleaded guilty to sanctions violations is an enormous give to him.”  The DOJ-recommended sentence is also still shorter than if Zhao had gone to trial.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin and ether dipped during the Asian morning on Monday amid renewed fears of U.S. stagflation. Bitcoin was down around 2% at $62,345 at the time of writing, while ether was 4% lower at $3,170. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid digital assets, was also down around 4%.""The weaker than expected [U.S.] GDP print points to a more sluggish economy while the higher Core PCE warns of an inflation problem that continues to be a thorn in the Fed's side,"" QCP wrote in a note over the weekend. The stagflationary combination of slower growth rate and sticky inflation has further weakened the probability of the Fed rate cuts.  Slowdown in bitcoin ETF inflows is a short-term pause and not the beginning of a negative trend, broker Bernstein wrote in a research report on Monday. “There is a natural gestation time to bitcoin becoming an acceptable portfolio allocation recommendation and the platforms establishing the compliance framework to sell bitcoin ETF products,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote. The broker added that there is no clear momentum up or down in bitcoin, which has been largely range-bound since the halving. Bernstein's expectation is that BTC hits a cycle high of $150,000 by 2025, owing to ""unprecedented ETF demand inflows.""  The first spot bitcoin ETFs could be approved in Australia by the end of the year, Bloomberg reported. At least two entities - DigitalX andVanEck - have applied to list such funds with the Australian Securities Exchange and another one is working on it, according to the report. ASX accounts for 90% of the Australian enquiry market. Its smaller rival Cboe Australia received an application to list a spot BTC ETF earlier this month from Monochrome Asset Management. Momentum for bitcoin ETFs has been building in the Asia-Pacific region for some months, culminating in Hong Kong officially approving the first batch of funds last week.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily active NFT users on Solana and Bitcoin over the past four weeks.  Daily active users on Solana hit a record high of 59,300 on Apr. 23.  ""The increase in trader count is driven by wallets trading at <$10 daily on Magic Eden and Tensor,"" crypto analytics newsletter OurNetwork said.  Bitcoin daily active traders hit a historical high of 25,600 on Apr. 18.

42408329,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnYZ,1714395600,Crypto Banking Firm BCB Group Secures Digital Asset and Electronic Money License in France,"France will serve as BCB’s regulatory base in Europe.  The payments firm has been authorized as an Electronic Money Institution and Digital Assets Services Provider.  Jerome Prigent was appointed as MD of BCB Europe in December to drive the company’s expansion into the region.  BCB Group, a payments processor that links crypto firms to the banking system, plans to expand in Europe following regulatory approval in France, the company said in a press release on Monday.  BCB has been authorized by the ACPR and the AMF, the country’s two primary financial regulators, to act as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) and Digital Assets Services Provider (DASP), the firm said.  Companies wishing to issue, manage or provide electronic money in France have to apply to the ACPR for an electronic money institution license. EMI’s can also provide payment services. Similarly, firms providing digital asset services in the country, such as custody or the trading of cryptocurrencies, need a DASP license from the AMF.  BCB's EMI product is now available to clients, whilst the DASP offering is expected to launch asap subject to AMF confirmation.  The license wins follow the recent appointment of Jerome Prigent as managing director of BCB Europe in December. He was hired to drive the company’s expansion into the region.  BCB said France’s clear rules for responsible innovation in fintech and digital assets, and its dynamic banking and financial services ecosystem were behind the company’s decision to choose the country as its European regulatory base.  Authorization by the country’s regulators will allow BCB to grow its institutional product offering in Europe and further enable the company to collaborate with virtual asset service providers (VASPs), TradFi institutions and other market participants, the company said.  “This is a game changer for BCB Group, allowing us to expand our footprint into the EEA for the first time since Brexit,” Oliver Tonkin, CEO of BCB Group, said in the release. “We have been very impressed with our engagement with the French regulators, and we look forward to integrating ourselves into the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem in France,” he added.  This is not the company’s first foray into Europe. BCB abandoned its planned acquisition of Germany’s 100-year-old Sutor Bank last June, more than a year after it was first announced, citing regulatory delays and changing market conditions.  BCB’s former CEO, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, left the firm last November to pursue new opportunities. His departure came just five months after Deputy CEO Noah Sharp exited the business after the failed acquisition of Sutor Bank.

42408326,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCnBQ,1714395600,"CZ Sentencing Letters Paint Former Binance CEO as Devoted Family Man, Friend","Letters of support for Binance co-founder CZ have poured into a Washington court requesting leniency in his sentencing tomorrow.  Zhao's lawyers have requested their client be sentenced to probation only, but prosecutors are asking the judge to send him to prison for three years.  Violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which Zhao pleaded guilty to last November, is usually punished by probation-only sentences  More than 160 of Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s loved ones, friends and colleagues have written to a Washington judge ahead of the Binance founder and former CEO’s sentencing tomorrow, asking for leniency and painting a picture of Zhao as a devoted father and friend, and a “geeky” tech nerd who shuns luxury purchases despite his immense personal wealth.  Zhao, 47, pleaded guilty last November to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, agreeing that he failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance in the early days of the exchange.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) has asked the judge to impose a three year prison sentence – double the 18-month maximum established by the sentencing guidelines and harsher than comparable sentences, which often result in a sentence of probation or time served.  In their sentencing memo filed last week, Zhao’s lawyers pointed out several cases where a violation of the BSA resulted in probation-only sentences, including the 2014 case U.S. v. Miller, in which a CEO of a domestic financial institution was sentenced to probation for failing to implement an effective AML program or file suspicious activity reports (SARs).  Zhao’s lawyers have recommended that their client be sentenced to probation, not jail – a sentence which would closely mirror that of BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who pleaded guilty to the same crime in 2022 and was sentenced to six months of house arrest and two years of probation.  “This is a high-profile case, to be sure. But Mr. Zhao is not a symbol,” Zhao’s lawyers argued. “He is a devoted father, a philanthropist… He has already shown remorse for his offense and, more importantly, has remediated.”  The 161 letters filed with the court served to back up Zhao’s lawyers claims, but also provide an unprecedented glimpse into the private life and personal history of the notoriously private Binance founder.  Humble origins  Zhao, now worth over $40 billion according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, was once a first-generation immigrant to Canada who was the poorest in his high school friend group and worked part-time at McDonald’s “to support his family and to have spare allowance to spend,"" Ted Lin, a high school friend and later colleague at Binance, said in his letter.  His friends from high school recall Zhao as a top student and formidable athlete, who became captain of the school volleyball team after teaching himself how to play the sport by reading library books on the subject, Lin’s letter said  Family man  Letters to the court also revealed Zhao to be the father of five children – two adult children from his marriage to Weiqing “Winnie” Yang, who are both currently enrolled at U.S. universities, and three young children with Binance co-founder and current partner Yi He.  According to both Zhao’s current and former partners, he is a devoted father.  In her letter to the court, Zhao’s wife Yang said that, even when Binance was going through massive growth, he took the time to spend time with his adolescent children, flying to see them in Tokyo when they had issues in school and going camping in the Japanese countryside with his middle school-aged son during Boy Scout trips.  Yang also celebrated her estranged husband’s philanthropy – including donations to earthquake victims in Turkey and building schools in Africa, saying “he has done so many things that he may not even remember them.”  He, his current partner, said her children are “very close” to Zhao, and have suffered from his absence over the past five and a half months.  “Now they are always asking: Why isn’t Dad home? When can Dad come back?,” He wrote.  ‘Apathy toward hedonism’  He also told the court about Zhao’s disinterest in luxury goods – something that was also mentioned by many of the Binance co-founder’s other family members, friends and colleagues.  “He knows nothing about the jewelry, luxury goods, luxury cars, and art auctions that rich people are passionate about,” He wrote, adding that Zhao purchases his clothes on Amazon, rides a scooter to meetings and drives a Toyota minivan.  Another friend of Zhao’s recollected visiting him at home in 2021, when crypto trading volumes were hitting all-time highs, and being surprised to find him “living under his means” in a three-bedroom apartment in Singapore strewn with children's toys and operating Binance from his dining room table.  The description of Zhao’s purported “apathy toward hedonism,” as another friend described it, mirrors similar claims by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s family and friends ahead of his sentencing.  In their own letters to the judge, Bankman-Fried’s family attempted to paint the disgraced former FTX CEO as completely uninterested in wealth or luxury or the company of celebrities that were paid to endorse his company. The judge was apparently unconvinced, and sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for his crimes.  Whether or not the judge in Zhao’s case will feel differently will be determined tomorrow, though Zhao's case has other differences. Bankman-Fried did not accept responsibility or show remorse, according to the judge overseeing his case, while Zhao pleaded guilty last year.  The charges are also different; Zhao's exchange never filed for bankruptcy and is continuing to operate today, while Bankman-Fried's notably saw customers worldwide lose access to around $8 billion in funds.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/29/cz-sentencing-letters-paint-former-binance-ceo-as-devoted-family-man-friend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/107e0c87de0d1704425df5bb3d36d39e0fe6eeff-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26555864,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605556,1714393830,Legendary Trader Predicts When Bitcoin’s Bull Run Will End,"In a recent analysis, veteran trader Peter Brandt delved into the price behavior of Bitcoin, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might have reached its peak for the current cycle. According to Brandt, Bitcoin is exhibiting signs of “Exponential Decay,” indicating a weakening in the momentum of its bull market cycles over the years. “Does history make a case that Bitcoin has topped? It’s called Exponential Decay — and it describes Bitcoin,” Brandt wrote. He further explained, “The fact is that the bull market cycles in Bitcoin have lost a tremendous amount of thrust over the years… I don’t like the Exponential Decay occurring in Bitcoin — Bitcoin is one of my personal largest investment positions.” Brandt provided a historical breakdown of Bitcoin’s bull cycles, noting a consistent decrease in the magnitude of gains: The bull cycle from December 21, 2009, to June 6, 2011, demonstrated a staggering 3,191X advance. The subsequent cycle from November 14, 2011, to November 25, 2013, showed a reduced yet impressive 572X advance. The period from August 17, 2015, to December 18, 2017, recorded a further diminished 122X advance. More recently, the cycle from December 10, 2018, to November 8, 2021, saw just a 22X advance. Bitcoin Reached Its Cycle Peak With A Probability Of 25% Drawing on these historical patterns, Brandt extrapolated that the current cycle, which began on November 21, 2022, would likely see an approximate 4.5X gain from its low of $15,473, predicting a potential high near $72,723. Notably, this peak has already been nearly met with a price of $73,835 recorded on March 14, 2024. Brandt underscores this observation with a caution, “The magnitude of each bull cycle has been roughly 20% of its predecessor, indicating significant energy loss.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Activity Declining – Why A Turnaround Is Important In his analysis, Brandt does not shy away from addressing the implications of Bitcoin’s halving events, which have historically been catalysts for substantial price increases. Despite this, he emphasizes the undeniable presence of the decay pattern: “But for now, we need to deal with the fact of Exponential Decay. It has happened. It is real. You may not want to believe it, but I place a 25% chance that Bitcoin has already topped for this cycle.” In a communication on X, Brandt responded to a counter analysis by fellow analyst @Giovann35084111, who argued that Bitcoin follows a power law over time, suggesting the potential for ongoing growth despite the observed decay. Brandt acknowledged the validity. “Quite a thorough analysis,” Brand commented. Quite a thorough analysis https://t.co/hiSogUtEkt — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 29, 2024 Related Reading: Timing The Breakout: When Will Bitcoin Escape The Post-Halving Consolidation? @Giovann35084111’s analysis extends beyond cyclical trends by illustrating how deviations from the power law at specific intervals, particularly around halving events, provide a structured prediction model. This approach projects systematic patterns in Bitcoin’s price movements, reinforcing a bullish outlook. The analyst predicts a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price, estimating the next top at the end of 2025 to reach between $210,000 and $250,000. In a later post, Brandt emphasized that his main prediction is an ongoing bull market into September/October 2025. He explained, “I give more credence to a report I issued in February. Here is a chart from that analysis — projecting a bull market until Sep/Oct 2025,” indicating that his views are influenced by evolving market data and theoretical models.

FX volatility is on the rise, and it could impact the crypto market, one observer said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traded at a slight premium on Japanese markets on Monday as the sliding yen (JPY) suddenly switched gears and surged against the greenback, bearing all hallmarks of central bank intervention.  The bitcoin-japanese yen (BTC/JPY) pair on leading Japanese crypto exchange bitFlyer traded at roughly 0.2% premium to bitcoin’s dollar-denominated price on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), data from charting from TradingView show. CoinDesk reached out to bitFlyer for comments and awaited a response at press time.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has consistently drawn a premium in JPY terms in recent weeks. Early this month, the premium rose as high as 1.49%, the highest since March 2020, a sign of traders diversifying into alternative assets to bypass the yen volatility.  “Currently, the bitcoin premium on Japanese markets is hovering around 0.3%-0.4%, having declined from over 1% in mid-April and a yearly high of 1.7% reached in mid-March. However, this could change. Overall, FX volatility is rising due to increasingly divergent monetary policy expectations and geopolitical stress, and this could impact crypto,” Dessislava Aubert, an analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, told CoinDesk.  The yen swung wildly in a holiday-thinned Japanese trading session on Monday, initially sliding to 160 percentage in points (pips) per U.S. dollar, the lowest in 34 years, only to bounce back 500 pips to 155 pips per USD during the early European hours.  The recovery’s speed and magnitude spurred talks of BOJ intervening or selling dollars to put a floor under the yen. Local media neither confirmed nor denied the rumored BOJ action, saying the low liquidity conditions and caution about potential central bank action near 160 pips led to the sudden yen surge.  The yen has fallen out of investor favor as burgeoning public debt keeps the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from matching U.S. interest rates. In other words, Japan’s fiscal crisis has been playing out in the FX market.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) is scheduled to hold a policy meeting this week, during which it could stress the need to keep rates elevated at 5.25% for longer amid sticky inflation.  Last week, the BOJ kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0-0.1%, having lifted it above zero early this year. The central bank maintained an ultra-lose monetary policy through the 2022-23 Fed tightening cycle, motivating traders to sell the yen.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/29/bitcoin-trades-at-slight-premium-in-yen-terms-amid-suspected-boj-intervention,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eee79b02431591f316d5468cf3248a32dbc1b15-5911x3941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token price surged by 5%, briefly eclipsing the $0.74 mark. This uptick coincides with an improvement in the MVRV ratio, which suggests a rise in the number of profitable MATIC investors. Additionally, the bullish crossover on the MACD indicator hints at a potential increase in buying pressure. However, beneath the surface, some concerning trends remain. MATIC market cap currently at $6.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Despite the recent price uptick, data suggests substantial selling pressure on Polygon. The exchange inflow has increased significantly, indicating investors moving tokens onto exchanges, often a precursor to selling. This trend is further corroborated by a rise in MATIC’s supply on exchanges, while the supply held outside of exchanges has dwindled.

The company is expanding its mining capacity and securing low-cost electricity supply agreements, enhancing its efficiency. Despite the departure of its CEO, Bitfarms remains a strong investment opportunity with a target price of $7. This will be my third article on Bitfarms ( BITF ); the first , published in May 2023, discussed Bitfarms' strategy of placing its farms worldwide and its attempts to improve its balance sheet. I set a target of a 100% increase in share price, which was hit in September 2023. The second article , published in October 2023, considered the efficiency of Bitfarms mining operations, noting that it appeared to be the most efficient of all the miners. When the second article was published, the shares were valued at $1, and I set a price target of $3.50. That target was hit in December. The two trades made Bitfarms my most profitable company of 2023. Bitfarms shares are now back below $2, and I am ready to buy again with a target of $7. Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin mining has business similarities with gold and oil mining. A miner cannot develop brand loyalty with its customers; no one will pay a premium for a bitcoin mined by Bitfarms over one mined by Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) or any other miner. Miners cannot increase their prices; they can only improve their costs. Consequently, the efficiency of operations will be an area of competitive advantage. I believe that Bitfarms is the world's most efficient miner and, as a result, will eventually be the world's most profitable miner; it should command a share price premium over its peers. That premium is likely to appear as the market continues to mature. Mining Efficiency and Value for Money Every month, the miners release a production update; below are the figures from the March 2024 update of most of the miners I track. (I have excluded those with a market cap of less than $100 million and those not traded on a US exchange.) Operational Updates March (Author) If you would like to look at the performance updates for this and previous months, I have provided the relevant links in this table. Bitdeer Bit Digital Bitfarms CleanSpark Hive Blockchain Hut 8 IREN Marathon Digital Riot Blockchain TeraWulf Cipher Mining To compare the different miners' efficiency, I first examined how many Bitcoins each miner produced in the first quarter of 2024 relative to its total operating expenses, Capital Employed, Market Cap, and Exahash. In the following table, I have combined the operational updates for January, February, and March 2024 with each company's latest quarterly financial results filed at the SEC. They are not exact date matches in all cases, but it is the latest data we have. Efficiency Measure (Author) I calculated the Total Efficiency Score by awarding 11 points when a miner was top-rated, 10 when second, 9 when third, etc, and then totalling the scores. This score suggests that five miners are significantly more efficient than the rest: Bitfarms, CleanSpark ( CLSK ), HIVE Blockchain Technologies ( HIVE ), Iris Energy ( IREN ), and TeraWulf ( WULF ). A key efficiency measure is the BTC per Exahash, which I discussed in my second article. It shows how many Bitcoins a miner can get from each mining machine. It reflects the proprietary software they each use and the ability of their respective technical teams to keep the miners running at optimal performance. Bitfarms is the clear leader on this metric for Q1 2024 as it was for 2023 (see article 2). You cannot look at production efficiency without considering how much money has been spent to attain this figure. As a proxy for investment, I used the last five years of Market Cap. This is not the perfect figure, as companies will have been spending Capex on building non-mining facilities, and those moving into data centers and other areas will likely be penalized by this measure. Capex Figures (Author Database) Hash Rate/capex tells us how much hash rate has been developed per million dollars of capex spent, and as a result, low figures are best. Of the five miners identified as efficient, Bitfarms has spent less per exahash. Hive is next, followed by IREN, CLSK, and WULF. WULF is the second worst performer in this measure, just ahead of MARA. Next, I looked at the balance sheets; I am choosing a miner to invest in and want one with a solid balance sheet. Balance Sheet Line Items (Author Database) Of the five companies that seemed efficient on my first metric, one failed this test. WULF has a high debt load; indeed, its debt is more than twice its cash balance, and it has zero Bitcoins in its reserve. That leaves four companies to investigate further: BITF, CLSK, HIVE, and IREN. My final measure is hash cost, I define hash cost as the cost of electricity per kWh multiplied by mining efficiency (1/BTC per Exahash in the earlier table) Hash Cost (Author) The overall cost of electricity comes from the latest quarterly earnings call; the actual cost of electricity is very close in all cases, as might be expected. Bitfarms has the lowest hash cost, a feature of its electricity cost, and the most efficient mining operation per exahash. In my second article, I predicted that Bitfarms would become the lowest-cost producer soon, and these calculations suggest that Bitfarms is exactly that. Bitfarms The Future The first article I wrote on Bitfarms discussed their plan to place mining facilities in North and South America to take advantage of low-cost energy and friendly geo-political environments. This strategy continues at pace. In late 2023, Bitfarms announced its plan to increase capacity from 6.5 Th/s to 21. Recent news releases suggest this trebling in capacity will be complete by the end of 2024, making Bitfarms one of the largest miners in the world. On the 24th of January 2024, they announced they had purchased land in Paraguay near the third-largest hydropower dam in the world. On the 11 th of March, they announced the purchase of 51,908 new mining rigs that will take the EH/s to the targeted 21; all the rigs are due for delivery this year. This massive 223% growth has come at a cost to shareholders: in November 2023, a private placement with an institutional investor for CAD$60 million (CAD$1.35 for 1 share and half a warrant; the market price at the time was below this figure) was announced, and an ATM for $375 was announced in March this year. Dilution is often the cost of growth. The focus on electricity cost reduction has continued; in November, the Rio Cuarto site in Argentina negotiated its electricity price down to 2.1 cents from 3.2 cents per kWh, a 34% reduction. That made the electricity cost of a Bitcoin $7,700 in Argentina. (analyst day presentation) As Bitfarms grows, its geographical spread of operations changes as it allocates growth to lower-cost areas. Paraguay and the US are seeing growth at the expense of the Canadian operation. The Canadian operation was hit by a VAT charge of 15% on electricity; Bitfarms appealed this (CFO earnings call ); without the tax, the electricity cost would have been $0.037, but it is now $0.43, above the average. The VAT led to an electricity cost of $16,200 per bitcoin in Canada. Change in Geographical Spread (Bitfarms) Source Analyst Day presentation Sept 2023 slide 11 In the Q4 2023 earnings call, the CEO said that the new Paraguay facility will have an electricity cost of 3.9 cents per kWh, significantly below the 4.2 cents average. It is a fixed-cost deal and not subject to any inflation or other increases (despite the Paraguayan inflation rate being over 3%), nor is it subject to power curtailment requirements, which is almost unheard of and will lead to 100% uptime on renewable energy. Paraguay has low labor costs and construction prices, further enhancing efficiency. Finances As previously guided, Bitfarms paid its remaining debt in February and now has a flawless balance sheet. They have around $84 million in cash and over $30 million in Bitcoins with zero debt; during Q4 2023, they raised $42 million from selling Bitcoins and added 101 coins to the treasury. An operating loss of $13 million was reported, including a $22 million depreciation charge, and a Net Loss of $57 million, including net financial expenses of $45 million, mainly relating to re-evaluating warrant liabilities. (Q4 earnings) Bitfarms follow IFRS rules, meaning they do not use the unrealized gains and losses on their Bitcoin holdings in their income statement or EBITDA calculations. Bitfarms remains the only miner using a top 4 accountancy firm, and their EBITDA is a measure of cash profitability for Bitcoins mined in the quarter. In Q4 2023, profit was $11,200 on each of the 1,236 Bitcoins mined. Forecasting the future financial performance of Miners is very difficult; the fluctuating value of Bitcoin adds an inevitable degree of uncertainty. However, bearing in mind everything I have reported so far in terms of hash rate growth and the guidance given by the CFO in the latest earnings call, plus the previous performance of miners following a halving event, my current working assumption is: (I usually call this a mathematical model but for a miner the future is just too uncertain). Key Line Item Forecast (Author Model) Comparing my forecasts with those of Wall Street analysts shows a high degree of revenue agreement. I have 2026 at $696 million, and Wall Street has $657 million, a difference of only 6%; however, we differ significantly in earnings and cash generation. Wall Street has cash generation from operations at $249 million in 2026. Wall Street Forecast (Simplywall.st) I wonder if Bitfarms will ever seek to deliver positive cash flow. I think it is likely that they will only sell the Bitcoins they need to cover costs and continue to HODL as many as possible, assuming that they will continue to grow in value over the longer term. As a result, my model has much lower earnings and cash flow figures, making any discounted cash flow model of little value. It may be in the future, they begin to sell bitcoins in the treasury to pay a dividend. I have some sympathy for this strategy, as the economics of Bitcoin has changed in the last couple of years. After China banned miners, the playing field for miners became level; the Bitcoin ETF funds require 2,800 Bitcoins a day , and before the halving, only 900 were produced. This mismatch of demand and supply will drive prices higher over the longer term, and will likely intensify as the number of new bitcoins produced after the halving is much lower. It makes a new Bitcoin bubble quite likely as surging prices draw in more investors, fuelling the fire. A significant fall in the price of Bitcoin is always a possibility; however, prices have made a new high, confirming the upward trend of higher highs and higher lows. Investors in Bitcoin and its ecosystem are getting used to this volatility. I used to see it as an added risk factor, but the longer the asset keeps an upward trend in place and the more established it becomes, the less the volatility concerns me. BTC-USD price Chart (Author) The chart is a monthly one showing my EW theory prediction for Bitcoin. It looks oversold, and a short-term top may be in place, perhaps leading to a pullback to around $50K. After that, a wave V move higher could take Bitcoin prices towards or even past one million dollars. In my second article, I presented a price target of $254,000 by 2030. The target was based on applying a percentage likelihood of each Ark investment forecast (from the Big Ideas 2023 document) playing out. As time progresses, the Bitcoin market becomes increasingly mature; we now recognize ETF products, have demand greater than supply, and what is proving to be a secure ledger to maintain the fidelity of Bitcoin. As a result, I am changing the percentages likelihood and adding a 13% probability of Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million in the medium to long term. Updated BTC forecast (Author) $1.5 million is the current forecast from my EW chart, I have reduced the chance of a decline toward zero, but it is still a material possibility. My new Bitcoin forecast is $487,500, 92% higher than it was this time last year. Combining this new forecast for Bitcoin, the proven excellence of Bitfarms operations, its continued best-of-class efficiency, and the plan to treble its hash rate by the end of 2024 leads me to increase my Bitfarms target from $3.50 to $7 and confirm my Strong Buy recommendation. Risks Apart from the obvious ones of investing in the highly volatile Bitcoin ecosystem, there is one additional threat I am concerned about. On the 25th of March , Bitfarms announced that the CEO, Geoff Morphy, would be leaving the company . This is a significant loss; Mr Morphy has been the driving force behind everything I like about Bitfarms. He led the international expansion, the modernization of management and operations, and delivered the mining efficiencies that distinguish Bitfarms from the rest. It will be a huge loss; the company has begun a CEO search, and Mr Morphy will stay on until that is complete. I will watch future news releases and press conferences very closely for signs of the new CEO bringing a new strategy. I suspect I will close any trades if they talk about expanding into other areas (data centres, AI and the like). It is the corporate strategy that I like, with a focus on efficiency and cost reduction and a concentration on making the company the best Bitcoin miner in the world. Mr Morphy spread operations worldwide and seemed an excellent negotiator who could deliver outstanding energy supply deals. Deviation from the current focused path is not something I want to see. Mr Morphy has done an outstanding job and has had a material impact on my personal finances through my trading on BITF. He is a winner, and I like investing in winners. I will follow him and hope he joins another company where he can have a similar impact. I will follow this story with further articles on Bitfarms when the new CEO is in place and will likely begin coverage on any company Mr Morphy joins. Conclusion Bitfarms seems to be the most efficient miner of those I follow. In the long term, this should enable the company's share price to trade at a premium to its peers. The company has planned and is executing a significant expansion in 2024, trebling its hash rate. It has signed further low-cost electricity supply agreements, including a fixed-fee deal. Bitfarms is pivoting its capacity towards areas with lower costs, further enhancing its industry-leading efficiency. Bitfarms stock price has pulled back from a recent high and is an area where a turn higher might be expected. The stock appears to be oversold, adding to the sense that this could be a good point to buy; however, this forecast contradicts the Bitcoin chart presented earlier, so some short-term move lower would not be completely unexpected. BITF Weekly Price Chart (Author) I will watch the price action in the coming days and intend to buy with a price target of $7. My confidence in this particular story is higher than in the past, so my next trade will be more of a medium-term one rather than the two shorter-term trades of 2023. I expect to hold Bitfarms for the next 2-5 years and will update in the comments section when I take the trade and how it progresses.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4687177-bitfarms-efficiency-deserves-a-price-premium?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26552223.jpeg

The slowdown in bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows is a short-term pause before ETFs become more integrated with private bank platforms, wealth advisors and more brokerage platforms, and not the beginning of a worrying trend, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  The broker notes that the world’s largest cryptocurrency has been range-bound in terms of price, with no clear momentum on either side following the halving.  “There is a natural gestation time to bitcoin becoming an acceptable portfolio allocation recommendation and the platforms establishing the compliance framework to sell bitcoin ETF products,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  Bernstein says its expectation of a bitcoin cycle high by 2025 of $150,000 remains the same, as the “unprecedented ETF demand inflows have further reinforced our conviction.”  The bitcoin mining cycle remains healthy after the halving, with the leading players continuing to consolidate market shares, the report said.  Bitcoin network fees have normalized at a healthy 10% of miners revenues having spiked post the halving, the report added.

Recent weeks have been a tempestuous voyage for the digital asset, rocked by a confluence of challenges: regulatory scrutiny, dwindling investor confidence, and now, the ominous exodus of major whales. Related Reading: Render Revving Up: Analyst Predicts Potential Climb To $16 XRP Whale Exodus Sparks Fear These “whales,” the deep-pocketed investors holding vast quantities of XRP, have begun executing sizable sell orders, sending tremors through the market. On-chain data reveals a colossal transfer exceeding 24 million units, valued at slightly over $12 million, departing from the Bitvavo exchange and vanishing into an anonymous wallet. Such sizeable movements are often interpreted as a bearish signal, signifying a potential lack of faith among these influential investors and casting a dark cloud over XRP’s immediate future. Source: Whale Alert/X XRP Price Takes A Tumble The negative undercurrents permeating the market have manifested in a precipitous decline of XRP’s price. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at a meager $0.51, representing a staggering 16% devaluation over the past month alone. This price plunge underscores XRP’s struggle to regain its footing amidst a broader market correction that has gripped the cryptocurrency space since May 2023. Institutional Investors Lose Their Appetite For XRP Adding fuel to the fire of anxiety is a noticeable decline in institutional interest. Insights gleaned from Santiment’s data point towards a palpable disinterest among entities holding significant XRP reserves. XRP market cap currently at $27.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Investors with holdings ranging from 100,000 to 100 XRP, typically categorized as high-net-worth individuals or institutional players, are exhibiting signs of skepticism. This trend further diminishes XRP’s allure in the market, amplifying the prevailing bearish sentiment. On-Chain Metrics Signal Trouble On The Horizon Looking deeper into the murky waters of XRP’s on-chain metrics reveals a disturbing trend – a decline in both network growth and transaction velocity. The acquisition of new users on the XRP network appears to be stagnating, coupled with a decrease in the frequency of transactions. XRP 24-hour price action. Source: CoinMarketCap This suggests a potential loss of interest among investors and a reluctance to trade XRP. However, a solitary beacon of hope shines through the gloom – a surge in long-term holders. This uptick indicates that some investors remain confident in XRP’s long-term prospects, choosing to hold onto their assets despite the current turbulence. Related Reading: Is SUI Sinking? TVL Tanks As Crypto Price Fails To Keep Afloat Development Activity Dwindles, Raising Concerns About Innovation The realm of development also paints a concerning picture for XRP. Indicators such as code commits and the number of active developers working on XRP-related projects have displayed a downward trajectory. This dearth of development activity raises concerns about a potential lack of innovation or progress within the XRP ecosystem. A stagnant ecosystem can further erode investor confidence and exacerbate the bearish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency.

26544640,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605519,1714377037,Alarm Bells Ring For Dogecoin: Bearish Signal Points To 40% Crash,"Crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz is once again warning of a looming Dogecoin price crash. The analysis hinges on the Ichimoku Cloud, a comprehensive indicator that provides information on support/resistance levels, momentum, and trend direction. Olszewicz’s analysis points to two specific technical phenomena on the 1-day (1D) chart of DOGE against the US dollar (DOGE/USD). Via X, he remarked “1D DOGE: bearish TK cross + bearish Kumo breakout. Bearish Signals For Dogecoin The bearish TK cross refers to the bearish crossover between the Tenkan-Sen (conversion line) and the Kijun-Sen (baseline) within the Ichimoku Cloud system. The Tenkan-Sen, which is a faster-moving line typically calculated as the midpoint of the highest high and lowest low over the last nine periods, crossing below the Kijun-Sen, a slower line computed as the midpoint of the highest high and the lowest low over the past 26 periods, is considered a bearish signal. It suggests that short-term prices are falling below the base level of prices over the last month, indicating potential further downward movement. The Bearish Kumo breakout: The ‘Kumo’, which translates to ‘cloud’, is part of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator and is formed between two other lines: the Senkou Span A and the Senkou Span B. It represents a key area on the chart that can act as support or resistance. In the context of Olszewicz’s analysis, a ‘bearish Kumo breakout’ implies that the price has broken through the cloud downwards. This breakout is seen as a confirmation of a bearish trend. The fact that the price is below the Kumo suggests that the overall market sentiment for DOGE is negative, with the Kumo now likely acting as resistance to any upward price movement. The chart by Olszewicz shows DOGE trading at $0.15 with the cloud plotted behind the price action, appearing green above and red below the price lines. The cloud turning green represents a bullish future potential, but the price below both the cloud and the Tenkan-Sen/Kijun-Sen crossover indicates bearish current circumstances. A 40% Price Crash Looming? This gives weight to Olszewicz previous DOGE price analysis. As NewsBTC reported, the crypto analyst warned of a potential Head and Shoulders (H&S) formation on the DOGE/USD 12-hour chart which could be validated soon. The formation is characterized by two shoulders flanking a distinctive head, with the neckline at approximately $0.14 being pivotal. Should Dogecoin’s price break below this critical support, the prophecy of the H&S pattern would likely manifest, potentially triggering a sell-off towards the $0.10 to $0.09 region. This target area aligns with the 1.618 and 2.0 Fibonacci extension levels, suggesting a price crash of around 40% from the neckline. While the pattern has not yet been confirmed, with the price still above the crucial $0.14 support level, its presence serves as a cautionary signal to the market. The technical confluence of the bearish TK cross and the bearish Kumo breakout in Olszewicz’s recent analysis only reinforces the possible bearish scenario that lies ahead for Dogecoin. Market participants are recommended to keep a close watch on the $0.14 level, as a decisive break below could validate the bearish outlook and set the stage for the anticipated decline. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1413.

42408333,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCniU,1714375042,Chart Veteran Who Predicted Bitcoin’s 2018 Collapse Says the Bull Market May Be Over,"Bitcoin’s bull market may have ended at the recent record high of over $73,000, veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt said.  Brandt said that bitcoin's recent price high of near $74K has already topped according to historical data.  Peter Brandt, veteran chart analyst and CEO of Factor LLC, who was previously uber-bullish on bitcoin {{BTC}}, has switched sides.  In a report shared with CoinDesk, Brandt suggested that bitcoin’s upward trajectory may have reached its peak. This starkly contrasts his February prediction that the bullish cycle, starting from the bear market lows in November 2022, could extend out to September 2025, with prices reaching as high as $200,000.  The latest projection is based on a statistical concept called “exponential decay,” which describes the process of reducing an amount by a consistent percentage rate over a period.  “Bitcoin has historically traded within an approximately 4yr bull/bear cycle, often associated with the halving events. There have been three major bull market cycles since the initial bull cycle and each cycle has been 80% less powerful than its predecessor in terms of the price multiple gained,” Brandt said.  “If the statistical constant of the 80% decay holds true, the [record] high in bitcoin of $73,835 of March 14, 2024, has already reached a price consistent with the historical Exponential Decay,” Brandt added.  Brandt predicted bitcoin's 2018 collapse to under $4,000.  The table shows the magnitude or gain multiple of previous bitcoin bull runs and exponential decays.  The first rally saw prices rise from $0.01 to $31.91, marking a 3,391x increase in less than two years. Subsequent bull markets have been longer in duration but smaller in magnitude, consistently suffering a roughly 80% exponential decay.  Bitcoin’s rally to record highs above $73,000 in March marked a 79.1% upswing from the bear market low of $15,473 reached after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.  So, if exponential decay theory is a guide, the bull market may be over.  That said, past data does not guarantee future results, more so, as historically, Bitcoin blockchain’s quadrennial mining reward halvings have bolstered bullish trends. The fourth reward halving took place on April 20, reducing the pace of per-block supply emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.5 BTC.  As such, the consensus in the crypto community is that bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 would resolve in a bullish move.  ""The ‘Pre/Post Halving’ cycle construct would suggest that the current bull trend will reach a top in the $140,000 to $160,000 range sometime in late summer/early fall 2025,” Brandt said, adding that the thesis remains the primary driver of his bitcoin ownership status.  Brandt, however, added that the exponential theory remains on his radar until evidence emerges that “such decay will not influence the bull trend that began in November 2022.”  Bitcoin changed hands at $62,300 at press time, down 1.5% on a 24-hour basis.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/29/chart-veteran-who-predicted-bitcoins-2018-collapse-says-the-bull-market-may-be-over,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c17f49a6b1bc560d2b3823b8d75bf9b3c1a00732-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408355,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIIY1,1714374000,South Africa’s Election Won’t Interfere With Crypto Policy: Industry Watchers,"South Africa recently put in place a licensing regime for crypto with plans to hand out 60 licenses in the coming weeks.  Members of the crypto community don't think that politics will jeopardize the country's plans for the digital asset sector.  South Africa's upcoming election isn't expected to derail the country's agenda for digital assets, several members of the crypto community told CoinDesk.  The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) recently set up a licensing regime for crypto, making it one of the first African nations to do so. The regulator is poised to hand out 60 licenses to crypto firms under the regime in the coming weeks and has so far awarded licenses to crypto firms Luno, Zignaly and VALR. The country brought crypto providers into the scope of its Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act in 2022 so it could regulate digital assets as financial products.  ""This signals a forward-thinking approach to regulating the crypto space, aligning with global trends and acknowledging the growing significance of blockchain technology in modern finance,"" Maurice Crespi, a partner at South Africa-based law firm Schindlers Attorneys, said in a statement.  The country is set to choose its president on May 29. The current ruling party the African National Congress (ANC) has dominated for 30 years, but now its majority is being challenged. As a result, the ANC may have to form a coalition that could include its opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party.  However, Mpumelelo Ndamane, CEO of South Africa-based crypto wallet provider Nuud Money believes that politics won't interfere with the country's crypto policies.  ""We've been pretty stable over the past 30 years when it comes to ensuring the [South African Reserve Bank] and FSCA are independent of politics,"" Ndamane said in a statement. ""It won’t affect the crypto policy.""  South Africa's National Treasury recently indicated that the nation's Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group is going to look at use cases for stablecoins as well as consider a policy and regulatory response this year.  The group will also be looking at the impact tokenization has on domestic markets. It plans to publish a discussion paper that outlines the regulatory implications of tokenization and blockchain-based financial market infrastructure by December. Tokenization is the representation of real-world assets on a blockchain.  ""I think that in South Africa, in particular, the work that has been done on digital assets has been to address problems that in many respects are apolitical, and the approach they've taken has been apolitical as well,"" John McCarthy, general counsel for global regulatory affairs at Fireblocks, said in an interview with CoinDesk.

At least two entities have applied with the ASX, and another is working towards it, the report said.  The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which accounts for 90% of Australia’s equity market, is expected to approve the first spot-Bitcoin {BTC} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before the end of 2024, Bloomberg has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Local entity, DigitalX Ltd. applied in February, the report said. VanEck resubmitted an application in February, it announced last month. Sydney-based BetaShares told Bloomberg it is working toward launching a product on the ASX.  ASX said it could not add anything to its last email response to a CoinDesk request for comment in January. Back then, ASX told CoinDesk that it “does not comment on investment product applications” but that it “continues to engage with a number of issuers that are interested in admitting crypto-asset-based ETFs.”  Momentum for Bitcoin ETFs in and around Asia has picked up after U.S. approvals. Hong Kong officially approved the first batch of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs last week.  Earlier this month, Australia-based Monochrome Asset Management applied for a spot bitcoin ETF with the global listing exchange, Cboe Australia, CoinDesk reported. Cboe Australia is a smaller rival of ASX.

42408359,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIIlF,1714370400,Here’s How EU Nations Are Preparing to Enforce MiCA,"European Union member states are gearing up to enforce MiCA, the landmark crypto law that requires national regulators to license and supervise service providers.  MiCA is an EU-level regulation but nations can implement slightly different technical standards, which crypto firms should follow closely, policy watchers say.  The European Union’s 27 member states are getting ready to enforce its landmark crypto laws this year – and businesses looking to operate in the bloc should be watching what national authorities are doing, policy watchers say.  In a few months, the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation’s specialized rules for stablecoin issuers will take effect, followed by licensing and other requirements for crypto firms broadly in December.  MiCA was voted into law in 2023 after the European governments spent three years developing the regulatory framework. Once effective, crypto firms, such as issuers, exchanges and wallet providers, will be able to operate throughout the European Union if they secure licensing in any single member nation.  That means each jurisdiction must transpose the bloc-wide EU regulation into local law, select which of their regulators will oversee crypto and prepare to authorize token issuers and other service providers.  For some EU countries – such as Germany, France and others – that chose to regulate crypto internally through strict regimes, transitioning to the MiCA age may not be a big shift. For some other countries, the change may be significant and place new burdens on local authorities.  CoinDesk reached out to regulators and government ministries in all 27 nations on their thoughts and progress on MiCA, 20 of whom responded by press time. These countries are in various stages of preparation.  At least 10 countries are finalizing or have already finalized local legislation. Some others are not quite as far ahead yet, but experts say there is time to get things in order.  MiCA is an EU-wide regulation, which means it takes direct effect across the bloc on the agreed deadlines, said Sophie Lessar, partner at law firm DLA Piper, focusing on fintech and digital financial services.  “The rules will come into effect. There's nothing that any regulator will do to hold that up,” she said during an interview with CoinDesk.  However, there are some technical requirements that have to be implemented at a national level, Lessar added.  While national authorities decide how they want to implement some of the more flexible technical standards under MiCA – such as how long their grandfathering periods will last or what their supervision fee structure would look like – crypto businesses, too, should be preparing for compliance and be aware of nuances in implementation at the national level.  “The key thing is for people to navigate, what does that mean for my business? Where am I doing business? Are there any differences where there is the ability under MiCA for the national authorities to have slight differences in implementation?” Lessar said.  Picking watchdogs  European countries are in various stages of transposing MiCA into local law, which can involve deciding on the local regulators who will be at the helm of supervising crypto – referred to as National Competent Authorities (NCA) in the MiCA text – as well as deciding on whether to take advantage of a transitional period allowed under the regime.  With MiCA, there was an expectation that local supervision duties might be divvied up between a country’s markets regulator and its central bank (to handle stablecoins), according to Marina Markezic, co-founder of the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), which has been tracking the progression of national legislation.  France, for instance, has designated its financial regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and banking authority, the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, as its MiCA supervisors under France’s Article 9 of Law no. 2023-171 of March 9, 2023, the AMF told CoinDesk.  The AMF told CoinDesk that it’s now working to align requirements in its existing regulation for digital asset service providers with authorization requirements under MiCA.  Read more: France Steps Closer to Implementing MiCA for Crypto Firms  Croatia is aiming for a similar setup where, once the national legislation is adopted, MiCA duties will be split between the Croatian National Bank and financial regulator Hanfa, the latter told CoinDesk.  “Hanfa will license and supervise the operations of crypto-assets service providers… However, as per MICA requirements, Hanfa will not approve crypto asset white papers,” the regulator said in a statement.  Some countries, such as Slovakia and Hungary, don’t have two financial regulators so crypto supervision will fall solely to their central banks, Markezic said. Hungary’s central bank MNB confirmed to CoinDesk that it was designated as the country’s crypto regulator through its national MiCA legislation.  Although this is more of an organizational matter, there could be room for regulators to be overburdened with licensing requirements.  Rosvaldas Krušna, adviser to the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, said that the new need for crypto firms to be approved “will bring significant challenges” to the central bank, which will be handling licensing.  “Given the fact that we have around 580 [crypto asset service providers] in Lithuania, the Bank of Lithuania initiated preparations well in advance, and we believe we are rather well prepared,” Krušna said. “We have put a lot of resources into preparation, both in terms of additional staff and tools required for supervision.”  Some countries with smaller financial markets may not have the need or capacity to hire a large number of new employees to work in their regulatory bodies, according to Policy Expert Anja Blaj at EUCI. As there's not enough information about how many applications NCAs will receive individually, some states may find it hard to prepare ahead of time, she added.  “This also is kind of related to the overall, I would say, fragmentation in the way that European Union member states operate and the difference in the financial markets,” Blaj continued. “Because that is still something that is very member-state specific, even though we have many regulations, or much more regulations will be coming in this space, it's still very much specific to the member state.”  Blaj and the EUCI team, who have been speaking with industry representatives in member states, say that each country’s crypto industry has its own concerns about implementation, proposed laws and who their NCAs are going to be.  National legislation  Austria, Estonia, Denmark and Croatia are among the countries whose parliaments still need to approve draft national legislation to align with MiCA, according to what regulators told CoinDesk.  ”The Danish Parliament is currently in the process of adopting national legislation that will mandate the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) to become the national competent authority with regards to MiCA in Denmark. This is expected to be adopted during the spring,” said Tobias Thygesen, head of the DFSA's Fintech, Payment Services and Governance Division.  Croatia plans to adopt legislation implementing MiCA rules In the second half of 2024, the country’s financial regulator Hanfa told CoinDesk, while Portugal’s central bank said that the country has yet to designate a national competent authority.  Other nations such as Ireland, Slovenia, Poland and Lithuania have consulted publicly on draft legislation, CoinDesk was told by respective authorities in the country.  Regulators in Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Malta, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden did not respond by press time, while those in Italy and the Czech Republic declined to comment.  Read more:Italy Setting Up Crypto Environment That Meets EU's New Laws, Central Bank Governor Says  Grandfathering  One area where nations can diverge in the implementation of MiCA is with their grandfathering period, or the time crypto firms are allowed to continue operating under old rules while transitioning to the new regime, Lessar said.  Crypto firms would need to navigate carefully between diverging transitional periods when beginning operations in the EU, she added.  While MiCA allows nations an optional 18-month transitional period, the EU’s markets watchdog has since called for limiting that to 12 months.  Spain's financial regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), told CoinDesk that the country will apply a 12-month grandfathering period in which MiCA-authorized crypto firms and unauthorized ones will operate “at the same time.”  “This will be a relevant challenge for NCAs,” the CNMV said, adding that regulators will have to make a “big” effort to make the distinction clear to users. In preparation, the CNMV said it’s planning to hire 70 people to work on MiCA and the EU’s cybersecurity law known as DORA.  Finland hasn’t yet decided whether it will implement the transition period for crypto firms registered in the country because it is still preparing the national legislation, the country’s financial regulator FIN-FSA told CoinDesk.  “The legislative proposal must be passed by the Finnish parliament. The expectation is that the national legislation is adopted during [the first half of] 2024 still,” Elina Pesonen, market supervisor at FIN-FSA told CoinDesk in a statement.  Latvia’s central bank, Latvijas Banka, is planning to start the licensing process and accept applications on Jan. 1, 2025, after a six-month grandfathering period, Marine Krasovska, head of the bank’s financial technology supervision department, told CoinDesk. To make the process easier, it will pre-evaluate crypto firms interested in operating in the country, she added.  Dutch financial regulator AFM told CoinDesk that it has started accepting licensing applications from crypto firms starting April 22, 2024. If approved, the licenses will kick into effect when MiCA does on Dec. 30, 2024. The country’s central bank (DNB) will be handling stablecoin regulation, the AFM said.  From what Croatia’s Hanfa told CoinDesk, it might make use of the full 18 months of grandfathering.  “Based on the current draft law, all those listed in the Register (as at the end of 2024) will be able to use the MiCA transitional period for adjustment (up to June 2026) by the end of which they will have to align their operations and obtain a MiCA authorization from Hanfa to operate as crypto-asset service providers. Entities that did not provide crypto-asset services prior to the end of 2024, and want to start doing so after that date, will have to be licensed before they can provide such services,” Hanfa said.  Looking ahead  Regulators that are licensing crypto firms for the first time are expecting an increased workload, and just as Spain’s CNMV is planning to hire new personnel, other regulators are also beefing up their teams or getting them the training needed to handle what’s coming.  “National competent authorities are already working hard to accommodate their capabilities and workforces to it,” Spain’s CNMV said.  Denmark’s DFSA will be accepting applications from companies as soon as the country finalizes national legislation, and the regulator has set up a “dedicated MiCA team responsible for the implementation,” Thygesen said.  “With the objective to effectively tackle the challenges posed by MiCA, the MNB has adopted multiple organizational changes and established a dedicated directorate focusing on MiCA related matters,” Hungary’s crypto regulator said.  Under MiCA, countries have a say in setting fee structures for licensing and compliance, said the EUCI's Markezic, which would hopefully be more conducive to attracting and promoting businesses in the EU than deterring.  “Member states are pretty sovereign when it comes to their own financial markets. And they are their own markets, which means that they also, in a way, act in terms of like, 'okay, I want now to have as many projects as possible coming to my ecosystem, because I have the ecosystem that can support it. And this is how I'm also competitive, in a way, competing with other members,'” Markezic said.  Meanwhile, several regulators, including France’s AMF, told CoinDesk that they are also working with the EU’s markets regulator (ESMA) and banking authority (EBA) as they consult on technical standards under MiCA.  ESMA's Chair Verena Ross described to CoinDesk the regulator's role in implementing MiCA as bringing more detailed guidance to the market and bringing the regulators together.  It's looking at June as an initial deadline for regulatory technical standards and guidance for public comments, with the end of the year as a deadline for finalization.  Policymakers in the EU are already thinking of revisions to MiCA that could see its scope expanded and certain rules tightened.  “MiCA is an important first step towards the regulation of cryptoasset services and their providers,” German crypto regulator BaFin told CoinDesk in a written statement. “It also provides for the further development of regulatory requirements, for example with regard to pooling, lending and staking, i.e. loaning cryptoassets for a fee. BaFin will play an active role in this process.”  Enforcement-wise, things largely seem to be moving along as they should be.  “So far the delegated acts and implementing rules are on track. Also, bear in mind that it is only the ‘stablecoin’ provisions (titles 3 and 4) of MiCA that kick in end of June,” Peter Kerstens, adviser to the European Commission on financial sector digitalization and cybersecurity, said in a statement to CoinDesk.  The rest is “a full summer and a full autumn and even some of winter away,” he added.

ADA could gain bearish momentum and decline if it stays below the 100 SMA (H4). ADA price is slowly moving lower from the $0.520 zone. The price is trading below $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4740 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could attempt a fresh increase if the bulls remain active above the $0.4280 support. Cardano Price Faces Key Hurdles In the past few days, Cardano saw a steady decline from the $0.520 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA price declined below the $0.500 and $0.4950 levels to enter a bearish zone. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4000 swing low to the $0.5201 high. It even declined below $0.4650 and tested $0.450. The price is now trading below $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4740 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. The bulls seem to be active near the $0.450 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4000 swing low to the $0.5201 high. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.4740 zone, the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), and the trend line. The first resistance is near $0.4920. The next key resistance might be $0.500. If there is a close above the $0.50 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.5250 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.5650. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.4740 resistance level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.450 level. The next major support is near the $0.4280 level. A downside break below the $0.4280 level could open the doors for a test of $0.40.

42408351,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIIO6,1714365173,"Bitcoin, Ether Nurse Losses as U.S. Stagflation Fears Grip Market","Bitcoin and ether trade lower as Asia begins its business week.  There are mixed bullish and bearish market signals as the week begins.  Crypto markets are in the red amid renewed fears of U.S. stagflation, a worst-case scenario for risk assets.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $62,400 at press time, down 2.5% on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Ether {{ETH}} traded 3% lower at $3,200, and the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid digital assets, was down 2.6% at 2,197 points.  The market appears to be on a precipice right now as it debates which direction to take, with significant bullish and bearish narratives on the horizon.  As QCP wrote in a note over the weekend, the threat of stagflation – a period of high inflation and low growth – is very real.  ""The weaker than expected [U.S.] GDP print points to a more sluggish economy while the higher Core PCE warns of an inflation problem that continues to be a thorn in the Fed's side,"" QCP wrote.  Last week's U.S. GDP report showed the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of this year following the preceding quarter's 3.4% growth. Meanwhile, the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation metric, showed prices rose to a 3.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year from 1.8% in the final quarter of 2023.  The stagflationary combination of slower growth rate and sticky inflation has further weakened the probability of the Fed rate cuts.  Most traders on the prediction market platform Polymarket still see no rate cuts as the most likely scenario, with a 35% chance of this happening, but the chance of 1 rate cut is creeping up, now at 29% versus 26% a week ago and 14% at the start of the month.  QCP also wrote that Janet Yellen's fiscal strategy, leveraging the Treasury General Account (TGA)—holding close to USD 1 trillion in assets—and the Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP) with USD 400 billion, could inject up to $1.4 trillion in liquidity into the financial system pushing up all risk assets.  As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote last week, the key to a continuing bitcoin bull market is the U.S. Treasury's impending quarterly refunding announcement, which maintains or reduces the current TGA balance of $750 billion.  This $750 billion figure in the TGA is key because it serves as a significant signal to financial markets about the U.S. government's fiscal intentions, profoundly impacting economic stability and growth.  Meanwhile, the launch of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong on April 30 is also catching the eye of traders. However, news that mainland Chinese investors won't be able to trade the ETFs has dialed down the bullishness of the launch.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/29/bitcoin-ether-nurse-losses-as-us-stagflation-fears-grip-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/354507e73566e8de059e3d18971688ff7d0fea45-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
