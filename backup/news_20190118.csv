42381481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rzml,1547843435,How BlockEx Went from $24 Million ICO to Layoffs in Less Than a Year,"BlockEx's treasury couldn't stop taking hits in 2018 – and for the London-based startup, it has meant significant delays, scaled-back ambitions and layoffs.  CEO Adam Leonard confirmed to CoinDesk that ""staff reductions"" had taken place.  ""Some of it naturally as products finished and additionally to reduce burn,"" Leonard said via email, declining to offer specifics on how many were let go. ""We are not winding down the business and hope to have some good news next week.""  According to a year-end review penned by Leonard earlier this month, the company is working to finalize a new round of fundraising. So, how did BlockEx go from a reported $24 million ICO and equity raise to layoffs in roughly 12 months?  Fund management  BlockEx's treasury took a number of hits with cascading effects through 2018.  BlockEx first got attention as a platform for issuing tokens, but the company had aimed to offer a place to trade the tokens it issued as well, plus ways for existing trading shops to easily get into crypto trading. The company believed it could have been first to market with a securities token issuer that had the blessing of a European Union regulator, that is if it hadn't had various troubles with investor funds.  ""We would have been up by now,"" Leonard explained to CoinDesk in a phone call.  He wrote in the annual review about some of the company's issues in 2018, calling it ""a rollercoaster of a year,"" but he expanded on those observations in interview. ""You could say it's setting back the security token industry in Europe,"" Leonard said.  BlockEx ran its own token sale last year for the DAXT token, the chief utility of which was giving holders early access to tokens issued by BlockEx. The trouble, the company now believes, was that it insisted on strict adherence to KYC/AML practices. Prices on ETH dropped dramatically from the start of its sale at the end of December 2017 until it closed in early March 2018.  Further, the company chose not to finalize any sale until a buyer had received DAXT in exchange for their ETH. So, if the buyer saw ETH plummeting and wanted out of the position, they would let them go.  Still, many stayed in, but by the time BlockEx got its hands on funds after all the KYC/AML checks, it had lost considerable value.  Leonard wrote in his update: ""So, in reality, out of the £20 million raise, we were actually left with just £5.5 million of available funds for the business go-forward basis.""  Nevertheless, as Leonard pointed out, ""£5.5 million is a lot of money if the market had been marginally successful.""  The cascading effects set in from here. With ICOs freezing up, there weren't new offerings on the platform to make. This cut into revenue and the value of the DAXT token. ""Most of the ICOs we contracted with killed their ICO or pushed it back into 2019,"" he said.  On top of all this, BlockEx had expected an $8 million investment from one fund set up by a blockchain advisory that never came through. It had planned to buy both a large share of tokens and some equity in BlockEx. The fund never succeeded in closing, so it never delivered its promised investment.  Project graveyard  Due to these setbacks, BlockEx ended up not coming through on a number of initiatives for 2018.  Among its unfinished projects: its mobile app, functionality by which DAXT could be staked on the BlockEx exchange for discounted trading, supporting third-party market makers and additional quick-buy features.  BlockEx saw setbacks in its ability to quickly set up white-label brokerage services for equity shops. It also has had to delay an overall audit feature for the BlockEx exchange.  ""The plan for BlockEx always was for different auditing firms to run regular audits,"" Leonard said, so users and traders would never have any doubt the funds were there. ""We wanted to make it 100 percent transparent that the exchange had traders' money.""  The advantages to using BlockEx as an exchange included its banking rails (for easy exit and entrance from fiat), white labeling features, what should have been a larger liquidity pool and an exchange that should soon be regulated.  But without funds, it hasn't been able to run the marketing campaign to tell that story. Nevertheless, the company hasn't shut down and its products are coming out, if more slowly, Leonard says.  ""We are nicely in a position to generate revenue,"" he added.  Looking back, Leonard wondered if his strict adherence to the rules was more of a bug than a feature.  ""If we didn't follow rules so much, we could have taken in a lot more money,"" he told CoinDesk.  Ian Allison contributed reporting.

42381480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rziz,1547839810,Overstock's Patrick Byrne Says tZERO Will Launch Next Week,"Overstock.com’s long-awaited tZERO security token trading platform will go live by the end of next week, CEO Patrick Byrne said Friday.  Byrne told CoinDesk the company is ""ready to hit the button and go live today,"" but was waiting a few more days to process user signups.  ""But by the end of the next week we will be turning the trading system live,"" Byrne said, adding:  ""It's a big moment for us — four years in the making.""  The announcement means tZERO will meet the timetable given last month by Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures, Overstock’s venture fund and tZERO’s direct parent company. Speaking to CoinDesk in December, he said the company would go live in January.  The company has already notified investors in tZERO’s token sale – which concluded last August – that they can gain access to their tokens.  According to a letter to investors, the three-month lockup period for the tokens had ended, and investors could either create a brokerage account with broker-dealer and tZERO partner Dinosaur Financial Group or put the tokens in a personal wallet.  ""Some people said, 'Ok, they let people open wallets, but who knows when they turn the trading system on' — I wouldn't do that if I wasn't sure that the technology was ready to go live,"" Byrne said.  New leadership, new listings  tZERO will have Steven Hopkins, until recently the chief operating officer and general counsel at Medici, as its president. Hopkins will serve as tZERO’s president, and the startup is now looking to fill two other executive positions: head of issuance and head of an in-house broker-dealer that will serve tZERO’s retail clients.  The platform will allow trading of its native tZERO token at launch, but is also talking to about 60 different companies. Elio Motors, a company producing light three-wheeled cars, will probably issue the next token traded on the platform, Byrne told CoinDesk.  tZERO is a key asset in Medici Ventures' portfolio and an ambitious effort to disrupt established security trading practices on Wall Street that Byrne has been famously challenging for more than a decade, such as his fight against naked short selling.  Though tZERO will not go live for a few more days, the company has already been busy laying other groundwork for the nascent security token market.  In December, tZERO was hired by Hong Kong-based GSR Capital to create a token for trading cobalt, with GSR also buying $30 million in tZERO security tokens from Overstock. However, the partnership was delayed after GSR asked for additional time to on-board a third partner and close the deal. The deal has yet to be completed, Byrne said Friday.  Also in December, tZERO acquired another company in Medici's portfolio, crypto wallet startup Bitsy.  Byrne first revealed his plans for a security token trading system in 2014, but technological and compliance efforts took some time.  Overstock’s initial Alternative Trading System (ATS), a sort of precursor to tZERO, has been open for two years. But it has listed only tokens representing preferred shares in Overstock, and saw little activity (all of 10 trades over a 15-month period) due to technical hurdles, a public filing by Overstock said last spring.

42430125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRRzh,1547824254,Ethereum Devs Propose Activating Constantinople Hard Fork in Late February,"UPDATE (Jan. 18, 2019, 15:40 UTC): Constantinople hard fork activation has been set for block number 7,280,000, scheduled to hit on February 27th, according to developer Péter Szilágyi.    ----------    Ethereum core developers have proposed activating Constantinople – a planned system-wide upgrade that was called off earlier this week – in late February.  Also called a hard fork, Constantinople is now estimated by developers to go live some time between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28, with a block number to be determined at a future date.  The proposal was made during a core developer phone call on Friday morning, and participants on the call included ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and other developers, including Hudson Jameson, Lane Rettig, Afri Schoedon, Péter Szilágyi, Martin Holste Swende, Danny Ryan and Alexey Akhunov, among others.  The decision comes after smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity flagged on Tuesday a security vulnerability in one of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) set for inclusion in Constantinople relating to data storage costs on the blockchain.  As a result of the vulnerability, Constantinople, now set for activation next month, will not feature inclusion of the buggy EIP, which will be tested and refashioned for inclusion in a subsequent hard fork.  Instead, Constantinople will be issued in two parts simultaneously on the main network. The first upgrade will include all five original EIPs and a second upgrade will specifically remove EIP 1283.  This strategy – first suggested by Szilágyi during today’s call – is meant to ensure that test networks and private networks that have already implemented the full Constantinople upgrade can easily implement a fix without rolling back any blocks.  “My suggestions is to define two hard forks, Constantinople as it is currently and the Constantinople fix up which just disables this feature...By having two forks everyone who actually upgraded can have a second fork to actually downgrade so to speak,” explained Szilágyi.  The decision comes after smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity flagged on Tuesday a security vulnerability in one of five EIPs set for inclusion in Constantinople relating to data storage costs on the blockchain.  Speaking to CoinDesk on Tuesday, Matthias Egli – COO of ChainSecurity – highlighted that the issue was likely not picked up by core developers when running tests on the software given that the impact is rooted in smart contract development, not necessarily “[ethereum virtual machine] core” development.  A prompt decision to reactivate Constantinople sooner rather than later was needed in part due to prolonged activation of ethereum's difficulty bomb – a piece of code embedded into the blockchain making block times increasingly longer over time.  Meant to encourage transition to a new consensus algorithm known as proof-of-stake (PoS), a delay of the bomb was suggested in EIP 1234 due to insufficient research at present for a transition to PoS.  Once activated on mainnet, Constantinople will include EIP 1234 and delay the difficulty bomb for a period of 12 months.  Editor's Note: The article has been updated with additional information.

The report, published Tuesday by the international economic organization, provides a broad overview of ICOs and different token distribution methods, including airdrops, and examines how tokens built on top of distributed ledgers (DLT) may be used to raise funding for these smaller companies.  The report notes that it does not explore token taxonomy or regulatory efforts, given that such efforts are ongoing. Further, the authors say the report ""is based on the theoretical discourse of token offering and is not intended as a practical ICO guide.""  While ICOs may be helpful in raising funds, the general immaturity of the space means it may be difficult to properly assess the value of tokens for companies, it goes on. This in turn could impact how much funding firms would be able to raise.  The report adds:  ""Although ICOs are being hailed as the solution to SME financing gaps, ICOs are, by nature, not the right solution for every project and a differentiation should be made between blockchain-enabled projects or products/services, and business or products/services not built on DLTs, as the former has a higher potential of benefiting from an ICO.""  Further, the OECD argues that ongoing regulatory uncertainties mean companies may not want to trust the use of tokens in fundraising.  Even beyond a lack of clarity on how regulators in different jurisdiction might treat cryptocurrencies and tokens, the fact that ICOs represent ""early stage"" financing means that there is an added risk to investors, particularly those who may not understand what exactly they would be purchasing in a token sale.  As a result, the report says, any potential for ICOs to act as ""a mainstream financing option"" is limited,  ""It therefore seems inappropriate to consider ICOs as a potential 'mainstream' financing mechanism for SMEs whose projects are not enabled by DLTs and which would not benefit from network effects,"" it notes.

42430127,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRS7h,1547820022,"Who's Left, Joined and Almost Joined Coinbase Since Its $300 Million Raise","Crypto exchange startup Coinbase is a hot place to work – and undoubtedly a coveted resume destination for technologists looking to advance their careers in Silicon Valley.  One of the cryptocurrency industry's few unicorns – or companies with a valuation over $1 billion (Coinbase was valued at $8 billion in its last $300 million funding round in October 2018) – the San Francisco-based exchange has nearly 800 staff members and is adding ""dozens of employees each week,"" spokesperson Rachael Horwitz told CoinDesk.  This aggressive expansion has included opening an office in New York with plans to hire 100 there, bidding for talent with a new egg-freezing benefit, and launching an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk in November.  Recently, however, the company saw some exits, too, as at least nine senior or mid-level employees left in the last three months to join firms both inside and outside the crypto space.  Some of them cited the exciting opportunities at their new employers when explaining their moves, while others expressed frustration with changes in direction at a fast-growing company in a rapidly evolving space.  What follows is a roundup of notable departures and hirings at Coinbase — plus one recruitment that didn't work out in the end.  Who left  The departures during this period included some of the early members of the team.  In October, vice president and general manager of Coinbase Institutional Adam White, the fifth-ever employee of the crypto unicorn, left his job. He soon became the chief operating officer at Bakkt, the crypto derivatives exchange founded by the Intercontinental Exchange (parent of the New York Stock Exchange), which is awaiting regulatory approval before launching.  Hunter Merghart  , the head of trading at Coinbase, resigned at the end of October, after just six months on the job. Merghart, who was hired by White, was reportedly frustrated with a lack of resources and clarity on the roadmap to building an institutional business.  In November, chief policy officer Mike Lempres left for the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of Coinbase's investors. “As chief legal and risk officer during a time of tremendous growth for Coinbase, Mike was instrumental in building the company’s legal and compliance functions and driving our vision of trust through compliance. We wish him the best,” Coinbase told Bloomberg.  Then in December, Jeremy Henrickson, the chief product officer, left Coinbase after more than two years at the company. The exchange called Henrickson's contribution to the company ""invaluable,"" adding: ""He helped to build our scrappy startup team into a high-functioning product and engineering organization — overseeing a 5x+ growth of the team.""  That same month, one of the earliest employees who joined Coinbase back in 2013, risk operations manager Rees Atlas, left the exchange for marketing communications startup Twilio.  Most recently, at least four managers left Coinbase this month, including Vaishali Mehta, a senior compliance manager who became the head of compliance at TrustToken, the startup behind the TrueUSD stablecoin.  “I really related to TrustToken’s vision to foster a new financial future which is resilient to fraud, failure and greed,” Mehta told CoinDesk through a spokesperson.  Previously unreported, Coinbase's director of information technologies, Warren Tagle, left this month for Sonder, a startup providing travel housing search. Also, two members of the Coinbase investigative team monitoring suspicious activities on the exchange – Brooke Contreras and Colin Mason – departed in different directions. Contreras joined American Express and Mason went to the blockchain money transfer startup Wyre.  “We're incredibly proud of our strong alumni network and encourage employees to start their crypto career at Coinbase, as many of them go on to continue making meaningful contributions to the broader crypto ecosystem,” a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Who joined  But make no mistake, Coinbase also successfully attracted top Wall Street minds during the fall of 2018 to gear up for bringing institutional investors to the exchange.  In September, Fannie Mae executive Brian Brooks joined Coinbase as its chief legal officer, replacing Mike Lempres. ""His arrival is part of our effort to expand our legal, compliance and government affairs capabilities as we head into this next chapter for the company and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,"" CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a blog post.  The following month, former Charles Schwab executive Chris Dodds joined Coinbase's board of directors. ""His extensive expertise will be an asset to the Coinbase leadership team as we focus on scaling our business,"" Armstrong wrote in a separate blog post. ""His addition to the Coinbase board is part of our effort to expand our financial services capabilities as we head into this next chapter for the company and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.”  Another Wall Street veteran, former JPMorgan executive director Oputa Ezediaro, who has been leading the bank's fixed-income securities and emerging markets departments, joined the Institutional Coverage Group at Coinbase in October.  Earlier in 2018, two other execs joined Coinbase to lead institutional sales. Eric Scro, former head of finance at the New York Stock Exchange, became Coinbase's vice president of finance in March. ""As the VP of Finance, Eric will be focused on helping serve institutional clients and deal with the increasingly complex financial and regulatory requirements of the business... Eric will also help guide the New York office’s growth across multiple business functions and assist in the development of new product offerings like Coinbase Custody,"" Armstrong wrote.  Following Scro, Barclays' former head of equity electronic sales Christine Sandler joined the exchange in April as a director of institutional sales.  In addition to finance professionals, a number of people moved to Coinbase from other tech startups during the year, including Facebook, AirBnB, LinkedIn and Uber.  For example, the senior data analyst Emily Loh came to Coinbase from Uber in December, and the vice president of data Michael Li, who joined in September, left LinkedIn for the crypto exchange. Also in December, Amy Ke joined as business operations and strategy manager after nearly three years at Deloitte. Coinbase confirmed these hirings, declining to provide any specifics.  Who almost joined  Finally, the anticipated on-boarding of Jonathan Kellner, a Wall Street veteran and former CEO of the brokerage firm Instinet, is no longer on the agenda.  The initial plan was that Kellner would lead institutional sales and support at Coinbase and integrate into the exchange's business the brokerage company Keystone Capital, an acquisition announced in June 2018.  But now Kellner is no longer joining Coinbase, The Block reported last week. The exchange no longer is focused on traditional institutions like banks, but rather on crypto hedge funds, Dan Romero, Coinbase's vice president, explained in the article.  A spokesperson for Coinbase confirmed to CoinDesk that Kellner is no longer joining the team. Kellner did not respond to requests for comment.

According to a report from Bangkok Post on Thursday, the SET is planning to apply for a license from the country’s Ministry of Finance to operate the platform.  The move comes as the exchange looks to capture the growing investor demand for cryptos, Pattera Dilokrungthirapop, vice-chairwoman of the SET board of governors, said in the report.  The stock exchange will work to have a sound technical system in place for the offering, as well as a digital wallet for token storage, with the aim being to launch this year.  Pattera, who is also chairwoman of the Association of Securities Companies, added that securities company members of the SET already plan to apply to become brokers and dealers to trade on the new exchange.  In May of last year, the SET launched a crowdfunding marketplace built on blockchain technology. The service, dubbed LiVE, uses blockchain to enable peer-to-peer trading in an effort to help startups access new capital from investors, including those drawn from the venture capital and institutional investor worlds.  Last week, the finance ministry granted digital asset business licenses to four firms: Bitcoin Exchange, Bitkub Online, Satang Corporation (Satang Pro), and Coins TH Co. Two other firms, Cash2coin and Southeast Asia Digital Exchange (SEADEX), were denied the license, while a third application from Coin Asset is still under consideration.

42430123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRS3h,1547812800,This Malware Has a Worrying Trick to Mine Monero on Cloud Servers,"A recently observed form of malware uses a concerning new trick to avoid detection and mine cryptocurrency on cloud servers.  Two researchers, Xingyu Jin and Claud Xiao, from cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, published a report on Thursday, saying that a nasty bit of software from bad actors dubbed the Rocke group is targeting public cloud infrastructure. Once downloaded, it takes administrative control to first uninstall cloud security products and then inject code that mines the monero cryptocurrency.  The researchers found that the Rocke malware injected code to uninstall five different cloud security products from infected Linux servers – including offerings from top Chinese cloud providers, Alibaba and Tencent. Adding insult to injury, the malware follows the uninstall steps set out in the products' user manuals.  To do its malicious work, the Rocke group exploits vulnerabilities in Apache Struts 2, Oracle WebLogic, and Adobe ColdFusion applications, and then downloads a shell script named “a7.” This knocks our rival crypto miners and conceals signs of its presence, as well as disabling the security programs.  The researchers add:  “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first malware family that developed the unique capability to target and remove cloud security products.""  The Rocke group malware was first discovered by IT giant Cisco’s Talos Intelligence Group back in August. At the time Talos researcher David Liebenberg said that Rocke will “continue to leverage Git repositories to download and execute illicit mining onto victim machines.”  Back in November, research from Israel-based cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies showed that a monero mining malware, dubbed KingMiner, is evolving through time to avoid detection.  Monero remains by far the most popular cryptocurrency among hackers. Last week, a study by college researchers showed that hackers have mined at least 4.32 percent of the total monero in circulation.  A study from McAfee, published in December, showed that instances of crypto-mining malware grew by over 4,000 percent last year.

42430142,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSXh,1547809209,Bitcoin Price Consolidation May Have Weakened Bear Case,"Bitcoin's eight-day stretch of consolidation looks to have weakened the prospects of a drop back to December lows near $3,100.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has been restricted to a narrow range of $3,500 to $3,700 since Jan. 11.  That range play is somewhat surprising, as BTC had set the stage for a quick slide toward December lows near $3,100 with a 9 percent drop on Jan. 10 – the biggest single-day decline since Nov. 24. Notably, prices fell to $3,500 that day, erasing the hard-fought gains of the preceding two weeks.  Despite the sharp bearish reversal, a convincing break below the psychological support of $3,500 has remained elusive for eight days.  That could be considered a sign of sellers unwilling to offer the cryptocurrency so low in the bear market. Put simply, the probability of a drop to December lows has diminished, courtesy of the range bound activity.  As a result, range breakout and a re-test of $4,000 could be in the offing. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $3,620 on Bitstamp.  Daily chart  Still, the psychological support at $3,500 has held ground.  Hourly chart  The descending triangle breakout on the hourly chart could be considered evidence of bear failure at $3,500 resulting in positive price action.  More importantly, the triangle breakout has opened the doors to $3,724 – the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.  A move above $3,724 would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change on the hourly chart and allow a stronger rally to $4,000 (target as per the measured move method).  View  BTC's range play likely represents bearish exhaustion.  An inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  Acceptance below $3,500 would reinforce the primary bearish trend (downward sloping 10-week MA) and boost the probability of a drop to $3,122, although this scenario now looks less likely.

42430136,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSNh,1547803848,Chip Maker TSMC Reports 'Big Drop' in Crypto Mining Revenue,"Chip-making giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reported a slump in its crypto mining business revenue for last year.  The firm announcedhttps://www.tsmc.com/uploadfile/pr/newspdf/THHKISTHTH/NEWS_FILE_EN.pdf its Q4 2018 financial results and also published an earnings call transcripthttps://www.tsmc.com/uploadfile/ir/quarterly/2018/4oHp0/E/TSMC%204Q18%20transcript.pdf on Thursday, providing revenue details across business segments.  In the transcript, TSMC’s CEO and vice chairman C. C. Wei said that the firm’s HPC (high-performance computing) segment was down in 2018 on a year-on-year basis, when its cryptocurrency mining business was included.  Wei said:  “Cryptocurrency is a big drop from 2018 to 2019. So if we put the cryptocurrency together in the HPC, it's a big drop. It's almost a double-digit.”  When excluding mining, the HPC segment grew “slightly,” he added.  TSMC did not provide specific figures for its crypto mining business in the transcript, because “it belongs to one of the big customers,” possibly a reference to crypto mining giant Bitmain as it remains the firm’s primary customer.  Nearly 60 percent of Bitmain’s total chip supply came from TSMC in 2017 and the first half of 2018, according to its initial public offering application filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange back in September.  TSMC also witnessed slower demand for crypto miners in Q4 2018, which resulted in inventory build-up.  “You can imagine that cryptocurrencies mining, they dropped quite a lot,” Wei said, adding: “I will say it's more due to the sudden drop in the demand rather than there's some hidden inventory that we cannot see.”  On the outlook for its crypto mining business in 2019, Wei said that the firm can't provide a percentage forecast because the sector is “volatile.""  Overall, on a consolidated basis, TSMC posted revenues of $9.40 billion in Q4 of 2018, showing a growth of 10.7 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis and 2 percent on a year-on-year basis.  TSMC’s SVP and chief financial officer Lora Ho said: “Our fourth quarter business benefited from the strong demand for our 7 nanometer technology covering both mobile and high performance computing applications.""  For this quarter, TSMC has cut its revenue estimation to $7.3 billion–$7.4 billion, as the firm expects its business will be ""dampened by the overall weakening of the macroeconomic outlook, mobile product seasonality, and high levels of inventory in the semiconductor supply chain,” according to Ho.
