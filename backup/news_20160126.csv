42378583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifSL,1453851523,Europol: No Confirmed Evidence Linking Islamic State to Bitcoin,"A report drafted by EU law enforcement agency Europol has found that there is no evidence to back up reports linking the Islamic State (IS) to the use of bitcoin or other digital currencies.  Released on 18th January, the report is the product of a review held by EU member states and Europol in the wake of the 13th November Paris attacks. Included was the finding that there have been no recent changes in how IS has been seeking to finance its operations.  The report reads:  ""There is no evidence however of IS-financing networks in existence. Despite third party reporting suggesting the use of anonymous currencies like bitcoin by terrorists to finance their activities, this has not been confirmed by law enforcement.""  Notably, bitcoin was the only payment method to be mentioned in Europol’s section on terrorist financing.  The publication follows a 17th November report that the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, was seeking to hold a meeting to examine whether terrorists were abusing new payments technologies to fuel operations.  The resulting news, coupled with the coverage received by a group claiming to have identified an IS-controlled bitcoin wallet, brought forth a flurry of media coverage on the subject late last year.  The news stories came even as members from US regulatory agencies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) sought to debunk the claims.

The comments, issued on 20th January, find Goldman Sachs co-head of technology and managing director Don Duet opening up about his views on blockchain and distributed ledger tech at a time when competitors Cit, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are moving to invest in or partner with industry startups or consortiums.  Goldman Sachs has so far advanced on both fronts, investing in bitcoin services firm Circle in April and joining R3’s 42-member bank consortium in September.  During the 30-minute podcast, Duet discussed topics including the impact of open source and big data on the industry. By contrast, his statements on blockchain were more introductory, as questions sought to compel Duet to describe the big opportunities the emerging technology could potentially unleash.  Duet said:  ""You could ask the question, 'Why couldn’t this have been designed before?' And that’s a very valid question. What I find personally very exciting about this is just the awareness that is happening within the financial community that there is a technological answer that can drive change and improve our system.""  Overall, Duet’s comments were broad and positive, with remarks aimed at illuminating for his audience what Goldman Sachs saw as its biggest opportunities.  To this, Duet answered that it was the blockchain’s ability to provide a ""single truth"" to the many institutions that need to share information on asset transfers.  ""Because of the structure and the technological capabilities as it was being designed and created over the last several decades, you have this situation where you have multiple versions of the truth, which means that everyone needs to reconcile,"" he explained.  Elsewhere, Duet spoke on how blockchain-based systems are more secure and efficient than today’s centralized ledger systems.

42378561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibnt,1453842055,Is Digital Asset's $50 Million Funding a Blow to Bitcoin? VCs Weigh In,"Founded in 2014 and led by CEO and ex-JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters, Digital Asset Holdings had long been the subject of speculation that suggested that, despite its high-profile leadership, the startup was having difficulties raising an initial funding round.  All that uncertainty was laid to rest last week, however, when Digital Asset silenced rumors by raising upwards of $50m (some reports say $52m was the total) from 13 major financial institutions, among them traditional financial giants such as Citi, CME Ventures and Santander InnoVentures.  The $50m round is the largest to date for a startup seeking to use private or permissioned blockchain technology, which unlike the open-source bitcoin network, is purposed for use by a selected number of trusted institutions for use cases including syndicated loans, US Treasury repo, foreign exchange, securities settlement and derivatives.  Further, the news comes amid a decline in funding for bitcoin-focused startups in the sector. Data from the forthcoming CoinDesk State of Bitcoin 2015 Report, for example, reveals that, when revised historically, ""blockchain startups"" have collected 34% of the estimated $1bn in publicly reported industry funding.  For many observers, the Digital Asset round confirms what they believe is a trend that suggests venture capitalists are increasingly interested in blockchain startups, and that bitcoin-focused companies are experiencing more difficulties.  However, some of bitcoin’s most high-profile supporters in the venture capital community believe that the attention the Digital Asset round brings to blockchain technology is good for ecosystem as a whole, even for startups focused on the public bitcoin blockchain.  Tally Capital founding partner Matt Roszak told CoinDesk:  ""At a high level, it’s a positive signal that people are putting money into this space. The public vs private blockchain debate is a different dynamic, but it's important for financial services companies, and Wall Street, to invest in this space.""  Bart Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, an industry-focused fund whose investments include Abra, BitFury and Ripple, voiced his firm’s opinion that the ""blockchain not bitcoin"" trend is a ""false dichotomy"".  ""Bitcoin and the bitcoin Blockchain are inextricably linked, but not limited,"" he said. ""Certain use cases of blockchain technology might not include the bitcoin blockchain.""  Still, Stephens sought to stoke the flames of competition, adding:  “May the best chain win.”  'Sink or swim'  While positive for the ecosystem, investors surveyed also indicated their view that the pressure is on Masters and her team to deliver a product or products worthy of the brand’s big entrance.  Virtual Capital Ventures partner William Mougayar echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk that, in his view, it is now on Digital Asset to ""showcase actual implementations and deployed use cases"".  ""I would expect [Digital Asset] to clarify further their product roadmap, given that there is a degree of mashup of technology acquisitions inside their offerings. That said, I'm sure that each one of their investors will also keep them busy with projects, since they are all potential recipients of blockchain technology,"" Mougayar said.  Less optimistic was Trace Mayer, an angel investor in bitcoin firms such as Kraken and Armory, who said he believes Masters may be fighting an uphill battle against a superior version of blockchain technology.  Mayer further voiced concerns about the backgrounds of Digital Asset's new investors, telling CoinDesk:  ""When you look at the list of everyone who’s investing there, it looks like they’re keeping it in the club, and that’s part of the problem. If they would have invented new technology, they would have invented new technology, and yet they’re going back to themselves to try and do this innovation? What do I think is going to happen? I think they’re going to lose a lot of money.""  Mayer suggested that Digital Asset would now have to prove the quality of their code, or else face potentially hard consequences.  ""Blythe is sink or swim now,"" he added.  Notably, Digital Asset has already begun the process of opening up about code produced by its team, recently detailing the specifications of its Hyperledger platform, which is being transferred to the Linux Foundation's Open Ledger Project for further development.  Hiring crunch  Among those who contributed comment, Mayer was more critical about Digital Asset's outlook. As noted by Roszak, the bitcoin industry is currently undergoing a period of acquisitions, but the two were mixed on what were likely to be the results.  In particular, Mayer put forth the criticism that Digital Asset was likely to experience challenges hiring developers who could help it fulfill its technology goals.  ""[This is] a seven-year-old industry,"" Mayer said. ""[Masters] comes from an industry with millions and millions of years of [combined] experience. When you need a senior analyst, it’s pretty easy to go find one. But if you want to find a senior blockchain specialist, where are you going to go find one?""  Mayer was also skeptical of the acquisitions Digital Asset has so far made, which have included blockchain startups such as Blockstack.io, Bits of Proof and Hyperledger.  Roszak, in turn, spoke more broadly about this climate, suggesting that developers who have been or will be acquired will now have the chance to contribute to further innovation.  ""This is good because those innovators and entrepreneurs are going to continue that innovation track with other companies,"" he said.  Impact on startups  Cross Pacific Capital Partners’ Marc van der Chijs, an investor in BEX.io and frequent panelist at industry conferences, noted his belief the early-stage startup ecosystem could be most impacted by the deal.  “With this round, Digital Asset is suddenly the leading player in the blockchain field, so it will be harder for emerging startups to compete,” van der Chijs said.  Less concerned was Adam Draper, CEO of the San Mateo-based startup accelerator Boost VC, who called the news ""great for the market"".  Draper said:  “Bitcoin and blockchain are so intertwined, I think that it brings enthusiasm for both when something good happens.""  The statements suggest that Draper believes the deal is unlikely to affect dealflow among Boost’s early-stage applicants, which have included bitcoin startups Blockcypher and Wealthcoin, as well as blockchain startups like Epiphyte and Align Commerce.  Ni'coel Stark, a former investor at Block26, said she didn't believe the funding would impact the early-stage space, given that other use cases are so abundant.  ""Our fund won't be looking to the DAH team for any cues as we do not share the same focus. We are interested much more in consumer applications like media and content distribution, Internet of Things and mobile data security,"" Stark said.  Preference for permissioned  Still, observers were not in agreement that the Digital Asset round would be a boon for bitcoin and other public blockchains.  Alex Tapscott, CEO of North West Passage Ventures, an advisory firm for early-stage companies in the blockchain sector viewed the funding as a strong signal that market interest has shifted.  ""[The funding round] demonstrated, once again, banks' strong preference for permissioned distributed ledger systems over open blockchains, such as bitcoin and Ethereum,"" he said.  Tapscott further lauded Masters as a ""pioneer"" that has successfully shifted conversation to blockchain technology among industry incumbents.  Van der Chijs added that the announcement confirms ""private blockchains are in fashion"" and that ""public blockchains are dead"" in the eyes of institutions and the public.  Now, he said, it's up to the bitcoin ecosystem to respond and innovate, first by ending the block size debate and then proving public ledgers like bitcoin are more secure than private alternatives.  He concluded:  ""I think [there could be a] change again.""

42378552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibgL,1453826806,Coin Center Releases Bitcoin Report for Securities Regulators,"Coin Center, a US-based non-profit research and advocacy centre for cryptocurrencies, released a paper today offering a guide framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies as securities.  Authored by Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center's director of research, the paperpresentsa framework based on the Howey test for an investment contract, as well as the underlying policy goals of securities regulation.  Coin Center's work, says Van Valkenburgh, found that several ""key variables"" within the software underlying a cryptocurrency, and in the community that runs and maintains that software, are indicative of investor or user risk.  The paper examines these variables, and explains them in depth. Further it maps them to the ""four prongs"" of the Howey test to determine when a cryptocurrency resembles a security and might therefore be regulated as such.  Larger, more decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, pegged cryptocurrencies such as sidechains, as well as distributed computing platforms like Ethereum, do not easily fit the definition of a security and also do not present the sort of consumer risk that is best addressed through securities regulation, the paper argues.  Van Valkenburgh added:  ""We do find, however, that some smaller, questionably marketed or designed cryptocurrencies may indeed fit that definition.""  The goal of the report is to help securities regulators separate ""the scams from the true innovations"", it states.  Comprehensive overview  Packed with notes and references, the paper provides a thorough overview of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, a breakdown of their functions, strengths and weaknesses, as well as presenting guidance for regulators with each section.  Also covered are variables that can affect user and investor risk, such as software and community variables, including transparency, decentralisation and developer profit.

42378560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibk7,1453820147,"You Don't Need to Understand Bitcoin to Use it, Study Finds","A new study has revealed misconceptions held by both bitcoin users and non-users regarding the digital currency's usability, functionality and anonymity.  The research  , carried out by Rutgers University, found that, while the technology's new users were put off by its perceived complexity, more experienced users generally displayed poor understanding of how bitcoin works and overestimated how much privacy it offers.  The researchers, headed by Janne Lindqvist, the university's assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, set out to understand why more people have yet to adopt bitcoin as a payment method given its potential to advance how individuals manage their finances. Further, it sought to inform bitcoin developers on how they can improve the technology's user experience.  The team conducted interviews with 10 users and 10 non-users – aged 18 and over and living in the US – to discover their opinions and understanding of the digital currency. Bitcoin users were recruited from online sources such as Reddit, while non-users were found locally.  The Rutgers team further probed people with experience of using bitcoin, asking questions regarding its more technical aspects and their user experience. In addition, they queried the participants on other factors, such as privacy and security, investment activity, regulation and familiarity with other payment systems.  Knowledge deficits  The questions revealed that, of the 10 non-users, four had never heard about bitcoin while the remaining six were aware of it based only on information gleaned from the media or social networks.  Perhaps as a result, many of the non-users perceived the digital currency as being technically complicated and ""foreign"".  The user participants demonstrated a low level of understanding about the mechanics of the bitcoin protocol, often revealing limited knowledge when asked about topics ranging from defining components and terms of the bitcoin system to the mining process.  ""Many of the users’ descriptions of the bitcoin protocol did not match how the protocol actually works, and yet this did not prevent them from being able to buy, sell and trade bitcoins for goods and services at various online outlets,"" the paper states.  Additionally, some users mistakenly believed that bitcoin has faster transaction speeds than other electronic payment methods, the team said, citing credit cards as having greater bandwidth.  Regarding privacy, many of the experienced users said this is inherently provided with bitcoin ""since personal information is not leaked during transactions"".  However, the paper says, it has been demonstrated through some ""highly rigorous deanonymization work"" that the opposite is actually true, and that the ""base implementation of the protocol is, at best, weakly pseudonymous"".  Key findings  Based on responses from all the participants, the team came to a number of conclusions:  Non-users often claimed that they cannot use bitcoin because of a lack of technical knowledge. The researchers found, though, that the users did not need this knowledge to make transactions.  People who actively use bitcoin were not well acquainted with its mechanics. Only one of the 10 user participants responded in a way that demonstrated deeper understanding of the technology.  Experienced users thought bitcoin had good security and privacy controls despite evidence to the contrary.  Experienced users expressed a desire for government insurance of bitcoin deposits, despite being largely anti-government and anti-regulation.  There was a correlation between participants' perceptions of what constitutes an ideal payment system and aspects of bitcoin across both groups.  Based on the survey results, the paper provides suggestions for the design of bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies to facilitate further adoption.  The researchers say:  ""Some clear guidelines and classifications about what is needed to know for someone who only wants to use it, someone who wants to do mining, and someone who wants to help develop would be very useful. Positive reinforcement about bitcoin through news articles or tutorials can help the general populace correctly interpret bitcoin.""  The peer-reviewed study will be formally published at the annual Association for Computing Machinery’s Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May 2016, in San Jose, California.

42378572,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ic1j,1453804091,Bitcoin Social Network DATT Reaches Proof-of-Concept Stage,"A decentralized social network founded by Reddit’s former cryptocurrency engineer has moved forward to the proof-of-concept stage.  Launched in August 2015, DATT (Decentralize All The Things) is the product of Ryan X Charles, a veteran of bitcoin startup BitPay, as well as Reddit’s short-lived cryptocurrency program. Now, as a continuation of his efforts, Charles is seeking to launch DATT, which he says is about six months away from completion.  The product received widespread attention from major publications such as Wired, Fortune and the Business Insider at a time when public furor over censorship on Reddit was high.  Moving forward, Charles is seeking to find a technical co-founder who understands blockchain and web technologies. However, he says the basic technology is already up and running for more tech-savvy users.  Charles told CoinDesk:  “It lets you post comments that are distributed peer to peer, and also pay to view a piece of content. If you want to run it, you have to follow the step-by-step instructions, but it’s very fragile as it’s only basically a proof of concept.”  The current version, Charles says, will be improved before the final launch, with updates to its peer-to-peer protocol, database and user interface.  However, Charles maintains that despite other commitments to Blockchain University, where he teaches on blockchain subjects, and IDEO Futures, where he is an entrepreneur in residence, DATT remains a full-time endeavor.  Charles concluded:  ""I am trying to create a real company. It’s not a side project.""

42378569,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibxx,1453771458,Offline Commerce App Wins $10k at Bitcoin Miami Hackathon,"A bitcoin rewards concept took home $10,000 in bitcoin at the second annual Miami Bitcoin Hackathon held this weekend at The Lab Miami.  Called BitMine, the Foursquare-like app won the event by using bitcoin bounties as a way to incentivize consumers to patronize physical stores. In turn, the service provides merchants with data on new customers in search of the rewards.  ""The problem we’re trying to address is that it’s not easy for people to have access to bitcoin, but if we can make it so people can walk in and collect it, we can break barriers,"" the BitMine team said in its winning pitch.  BitMine team members included Jesus Najera, Balin Sinnott, John Gabos, Oscar Lafarga and Boris Polania.  Rounding out the top three projects were micropayments billing service WYNCOIN and bitcoin invoicing startup TXR.io, which won $3,000 in bitcoin and $1,500 in bitcoin, respectively.  While the these startups focused on billing, this wasn't the only trend that yields insight into how the developers and entrepreneurs at the hackathon believe the open-source payment network can be used to solve business problems.  For example, there was a focus on commerce and how bitcoin could be better integrated into the shopping experience as a way to more broadly promote adoption of digital currency.  Anthony Fernandez, business development manager for Latin America and Caribbean at PayPal, spoke to this trend, telling CoinDesk:  ""The offline shopping experience continues to be a challenge. How do you get people back in the stores? Numerous presentations were focused on the offline shopping experience, and I think that’s an interesting space.""  Sponsors for the event included industry non-profit Blockchain Beach, bitcoin ATM provider Bitstop, bitcoin hardware and security specialist Ledger and bitcoin wallet provider Breadwallet, all of whom were represented at the judge’s table.  Speaking to the quality of the event, Breadwallet CMO and event judge Aaron Lasher said that, in his opinion, the hackathon was a success.  “I hear the number of teams was about half, but the quality was about double,” he said.  Best of the rest  Like most bitcoin gatherings, the event as not without familiar faces.  Notable community members including Jason King, founder of the Florida-based charity Sean’s Outpost, and Kyle Kemper, business development specialist at Kraken and a bitcoin startup veteran, presented interesting projects called Bounti and Socialwallet.  Notably about Bounti was that it was aimed at what King termed ""the causal economy"". The iOS app allows users to post bounties aimed at incentivizing other users to perform small tasks, such as taking out their trash, clearing their driveway or donating to a charity.  However, King argued that bitcoin enables the platform to have unique attributes.  ""You could pay a homeless guy to feed another homeless guy. It's similar to TaskRabbit, but you don’t have to have a lot of trust,"" he said.  Bounti placed fourth in the voting, winning $750 in bitcoin, among other prizes.  Other projects were aimed at incentivizing new users to the ecosystem or otherwise making bitcoin easier to use.  The Super Coupon team presented a concept for a bitcoin deal aggregator, while the Lucky Duck team created a bitcoin-enabled version of a prize pool. Elsewhere, BitChange proposed a system that would allow merchants to convert physical change into bitcoin at the point-of-sale.
