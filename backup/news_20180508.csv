42401499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztNZ,1525810618,Security or Currency? Jury to Decide In ICO Fraud Case,"A jury will decide whether tokens issued through two allegedly fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) count as securities, a U.S. district court judge said Tuesday.  Businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy is accused of violating anti-fraud and registration provisions of federal securities laws after launching two token sales that officials say defrauded investors.  He pled not guilty in early December to the charges, before moving to dismiss the cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice, arguing that the token sales did not constitute securities offerings. He further argued that he did not know he was in violation of the law.  In response, the DOJ and SEC claimed that Zaslavskiy knew his actions were unlawful, if for no other reason than because the SEC contacted him prior to the DRCW token sale. Furthermore, the agencies claimed that both the REcoin and DRCW tokens passed the Howey Test, meaning they fit the legal definition of securities offerings.  Zaslavskiy's trial is potentially precedent-setting, considering that it hinges on a key question: whether his issuance of tokens across two ICOs constituted illegal securities offerings.  But the answer to that question, Tuesday's hearing made clear, could take months to develop. Judge Raymond Dearie didn't rule directly on the question of whether the tokens involved are securities, kicking that question to the trial, which is tentatively set to begin as early as January 2019.  Jury members will decide ""whether this is a currency or a security,"" Dearie remarked.  Vagueness argument continued  Yet Zaslavskiy's legal team is continuing to push the argument that the rules, as they exist today, are too vague.  In remarks during the hearing, Zaslavskiy's legal team accused the U.S. government of sending mixed signals on how ICO tokens are to be classified, with one attorney stating that ""the government has ruled that virtual currencies are commodities and now the government is saying they're securities ... the SEC wants to regulate something.""  ""The fact that on the same floor, in the same court in Brooklyn, New York, the government is saying different things based on which agency is bringing the charge, that brings vagueness,"" the attorney added.  For its part, the government put forward the idea that the two tokens in question can't be considered currencies as they never actually existed. They were only promised to would-be investors.  ""This wasn't a currency at this point, in time maybe. Maybe at some point down the road, in 10 years, but at this time it is not a currency,"" one prosecutor said. And as the argument was later framed: ""Defense is trying to group all cryptocurrencies into one big ball of wax [but] you can't group all cryptocurrencies together.""  While the SEC has not issued formal guidance on ICOs, chairman Jay Clayton has repeatedly stated in public appearances his belief that every ICO token he's seen is a security.  In a now somewhat-famous statement during an event at Princeton University in April, Clayton used an analogy to explain how he viewed token sales.  ""If I have a laundry token for washing my clothes, that's not a security,"" he remarked. ""But if I have a set of 10 laundry tokens and the laundromats are to be developed and those are offered to me as something I can use for the future and I'm buying them because I can sell them to next year's incoming class, that's a security.""

42401491,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztGg,1525807812,The First Version of Ethereum's Casper Upgrade Has Been Published,"A new version of the code behind Casper, a planned change to the way the ethereum network reaches consensus, has been published for wider scrutiny by auditors and client developers.  Danny Ryan, the developer behind Casper FFG, posted a version 0.1.0 ""first release"" of the code to GitHub Tuesday, noting, ""v0.1.0 marks us more clearly tagging releases to help clients and external auditors more easily track the contract and changes.""  (Short for ""Friendly Finality Gadget,"" FFG is the first iteration of Casper, and will possibly be followed by others.)  Ryan followed up with a reply to a Reddit post on the update, in which he wrote:  ""More than just the research team is using the contract now -- auditors, client devs, etc -- so we wanted to start issuing clearer versioning and changelogs to help everyone stay organized.""  The move signals that momentum is building behind the protocol change, as ethereum software clients can begin scripting the software into their individual coding languages and testing the software.  Vitalik Buterin, who created ethereum, addressed the Casper upgrade at a conference in Toronto last week, calling it ""hopefully one of the more joyous experiences in ethereum in a fairly short time.""  Once implemented, Casper FFG will alter ethereum's software so that updating the blockchain involves a combination of proof-of-work – the electricity-intensive ""mining"" familiar from bitcoin – and proof-of-stake. The latter employs validators to update the ledger through a voting system within which users, sometimes called stakers, put down deposits of ether, which they risk losing if they attempt to cheat.  In its initial stages, Casper will retain ethereum's current proof-of-work protocol to do most of the heavy lifting, using proof of stake to validate ""checkpoints"" periodically. Because the network can only handle so many validating nodes, the minimum deposit will start off at 1,500 ether, or $1.1 million at the current exchange rate.  The plan is eventually to move to a fully proof-of-stake system and to lower the minimum stake, but there is no definite timeline for that transition at present.  For now, this first stage of Casper has to be audited, and the network cannot implement it until more code has been written for ethereum clients, the programs users download to run the cryptocurrency's protocol. Since Casper will not be compatible with earlier versions of ethereum, the network will need to hard fork.  Ryan told a meeting of developers last month:  ""As these pieces of the puzzle are getting closer to being completed, I'll signal that it's time to start talking about fork block numbers.

42401497,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztLb,1525804242,DHS Official Tells Congress Blockchain Uses Are 'Almost Limitless',"""I think the applications are almost limitless.""  So said Douglas Maughan – who serves as the Science and Technology Directorate's cybersecurity division director, a group within the Department of Homeland Security – before two Congressional subcommittees on Tuesday. Maughan's remarks came during a wider discussion on the application of blockchain to supply chains, joining a panel of witnesses that included Maersk head of global trade digitization Michael White, UPS vice president of global customs brokerage staff Chris Rubio and Nuby Law IPR counsel Robert Chiaviello.  Announced last week, the “Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Improve Supply Chain Management and Combat Counterfeit Goods” hearing is the second such event hosted by the House Science, Space and Technology Committee’s Oversight and Research and Technology subcommittees this year.  As expected  , the session was largely educational in nature. But even still, as articulated by Maughn, such discussions can have a significant impact on the work being done by U.S. agencies on the blockchain front.  According to Maughn, the Science and Technology Directorate ""must aggressively work with its research, development, test and evaluation partners throughout government and industry so Homeland Security applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology are effective and trusted.""  Indeed, in his ""limitless"" remark, Maughan suggested that the scale of work was spread throughout the U.S. government.  “I think the applications are almost limitless and it’s up to the departments or agencies as to how to address that,"" he told the subcommittees, later noting that not every potential use case requires a blockchain.  'There must be a better way'  White, appearing on behalf of shipping giant Maersk, framed the firm's move toward applications of blockchain as a way to break up the iceberg-like state of shipping today.  He began by describing how the shipping industry works at present, noting in particular that “the industry operates much as it does or has since the introduction of shipping containers in the 1950s.”  Transactions are filed through fax machines and documents about shipments are sent by way of carrier mail – and can sometimes arrive too late, he said, adding:  “Container shipments can also be delayed because essential paperwork has not caught up with the goods they are carrying. Everyone agrees that there must be a better way but no single participant can effect change … in 2016 Maersk and IBM began a collaboration with the goal of digitizing supply chain.”  That collaboration utilized a blockchain to create an immutable, but efficient record, he said.  UPS’s Rubio expanded on this concept, noting that “by having the ability to track any product from the beginning of its journey through the supply chain, blockchain may provide a solution to unknown or unverified product origins.”  “In fact, we are already seeing this tech used to track origins of various products,” he went on to say.  When asked how exactly blockchain can help the shipping industry, White remarked that “blockchain is especially suitable for that because you can enable the parties which have a right to see and have access to information and see that information has not been tampered with or modified in any way, shape or form.”  ""By posting information in real time to the supply chain data can be shared and that can streamline the flow of goods. The benefit to the consumer is they can receive their product sooner,"" Rubio asserted.  What the members said  Though the session largely saw the witnesses sharing their views and input on blockchain, the hearing did present some opportunities for subcommittee members to offer a window into their thinking on the technology.  At the outset, Rep. Ralph Abraham – who chaired the hearing – positioned the event as one that would look at both private and public-sector use.  ""We recognize [blockchain] technologies can benefit both the public and private sectors, and seek to understand just how,"" he told attendees.  As might be expected, the subject of cryptocurrencies crept into the hearing, with one lawmaker suggesting that those present ought to look into ""the technology beneath it.""  “If we can overlook the stigma of cryptocurrency and look at the technology beneath it I think we can see [useful applications],"" Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia remarked at one point.  Rep. Don Bayer of Virginia declared that, in his view, the U.S. ought to play a major role in advancing the tech more broadly.  ""I believe America should take the lead in blockchain research,"" he said.

As well as not being licensed by the agency to deal in securities, the TSSB alleges that the company has been involved with what it calls ""a classic fraud,"" according to Joseph Rotunda, director of the regulator's Enforcement Division.  The order further alleges that Forex EA & Bitcoin touted various bitcoin investment programs that promised potential investors a 10-times profit within 21 days.  Meanwhile, the regulator accuses the firm of wrongdoing by intentionally failing to disclose critical information about the background of the company and the inherent risk of bitcoin investment.

CoinDesk asked the Attorney General's Office if the crypto exchange inquiry would continue in light of Schneiderman's exit. In an email, press secretary Amy Spitalnick wrote: ""Our office's work continues.""  Last month, the New York Attorney General's Office launched a fact-finding inquiry into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchanges were sent detailed questionnaires, which included questions about their business models, operations, funding, trading protocols, leadership and business relationships.  Schneiderman's abrupt resignation, effective at the close of business Tuesday, came hours after the publication of an article in the New Yorker.  In the report, four women alleged that Schneiderman had ""repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent.""

CoinDesk contacted several of these exchanges after the inquiry was first announced, the majority of which welcomed the inquiry and praised Schneiderman's efforts to increase transparency in the industry.  Coinbase, one of the affected exchanges, published a version of its reply to the questionnaire, though the full response has not been released due to the confidential information it contains.

42401495,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcztIe,1525788062,A Chain of Its Own: Mobile App Kik to Fork Stellar for Fee-Free Blockchain,"The cryptocurrency that will soon help power the popular Kik messaging app is making a big technology shift — again.  Kik's crypto token, kin, currently exists as an ethereum-based ERC-20 token, yet CoinDesk recently reported that'd the company would be moving to a two-chain system whereby its tokens were supported on both the ethereum blockchain and the stellar blockchain. But today, the Kin Foundation, the non-profit organization managing the development of kin, has announced another move, deciding instead to fork stellar to create its own blockchain.  While Kik had first envisioned the two-chain system because it worried about transaction fees on ethereum – a blockchain that pushed up against its scale when the crypto-collectable cat game, CryptoKitties, went viral – Kik has decided that even stellar's minimal fees were too much for what the company hopes to accomplish.  For its kin token, the problem with stellar is that it costs a tiny amount to make a transaction on that blockchain, and that has to be paid in lumens, stellar's native cryptocurrency.  Whereas on Kik's own blockchain, transactions won't cost anything.  This is especially important given Kik's goal for its cryptocurrency – to facilitate micropayments, as small as a penny or even less, across the internet more efficiently. The theory is that, if these seamless transactions are possible, entrepreneurs will start creating new digital services that encourage transactions between users for things like inexpensive private chats, digital gifts (like stickers or gifs), personalized photos and more.  Speaking to CoinDesk about the decision, Kik CEO Ted Livingston told CoinDesk:  ""I think what makes Kin unique is it's one of the very few projects where product is driving the technology and not vice versa.""  To encourage entrepreneurs to create these services on the Kik app, the Kin Foundation has a giant pool of kin in reserve that it will use to automatically pay entrepreneurs for fostering economic activity, called the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE). The KRE will pay out a share of kin every day, rewarding each app based on how much economic activity it generated that day.  According to the announcement Tuesday, all that activity will now take place on kin's blockchain.  Yet, ethereum will still be involved. When a founder has earned enough kin that they want to hold, the idea is they could use a technique called atomic swaps to move their kin over to ethereum. In short, every kin token will exist on two ledgers: one on the ethereum blockchain and one on the kin blockchain.  When its kin half is in a user's wallet, the ethereum half is locked up in a smart contract, and vice versa.  But while this is the roadmap today, Livingston won't hazard a guess about when this system will officially go live. Although, the company is currently moving forward with building its own open-source codebase, cloned from the stellar protocol and, as Livingston put it, ""taking destiny into our own hands.""  Federated nodes, zero fees  While Livingston remains bullish on stellar, having evaluated other blockchains as he looked for workable solutions, stellar still wasn't exactly the right fit for Kik.  ""It wasn't that the fees were too high, it's that they cost something and that created an incentive for spammers,"" he said.  While originally, the team had thought it could just subsidize the transaction fees, they soon realized that it would have to put lumens in people's wallets to do that. As such, they theorized that bad actors could then just create a bunch of wallets and scrape up the lumens, in an effort to secure enough money to make an impact on the network.  As such, Kik has created a fee-less proprietary blockchain, and have done so with the use of established, permissioned nodes.  ""When you look at the Stellar network and compare it with Kin's fork of Stellar, the two networks are identical, with one exception: the people running the federation nodes,"" Livingston said.  For instance, the Kin Foundation will run the first node, but Livingston said, that as the company brings on more partners, those partners will be expected to run trusted nodes, too. As such, even though the Kin Foundation will initially control the blockchain, because all nodes will be treated equal, eventually the foundation's voting power over the network will diminish.  Unlike nodes in the stellar federation, these partners won't earn anything for validating transactions (if they did, there would need to be a transaction fee). But Livingston believes future kin nodes will be run by the large services driving the kin economy, the ones that earn a lot of income through the KRE, so have a strong interest in seeing the value of kin grow steadily and as such, will volunteer as nodes.  ""As more digital services come on board, and as the Kin ecosystem gets bigger and the consumer base gets bigger, there's more incentive for more people to run these federated nodes,"" Livingston said.  This move, while trading off some decentralization for high throughput, aligns with what some industry analysts, including Blockchain Capital's Spencer Bogart, have predicted as a forthcoming trend. Bogart worries that these systems will become not innovative blockchain systems but ones that resemble the current centralized systems we have today.  But Livingston argues that difference is trustlessness.  ""If this is going to be a common currency between billions of consumers across thousands of digital communities, we need it to be trustless,"" he said, adding that consumers can rest assured that it isn't possible for any one entity on the network to take their cryptocurrency from them.  But censorship resistance?  Yet, what could suffer in this federated node model is cryptocurrency's first raison d'etre – censorship resistance.  For instance, if the kin token ran on stellar, validation would be separate from use cases. Validators would earn income from securing the network, and companies building services to use kin would have paid those validators in fees for use of the network. But under Kin's new vision, the larger companies driving the public facing use cases will also provide back-end validation.  And those will be companies who could collectively decide, for example, to ban a service viewed as offensive or malicious from using the network (in other words, to censor it).  Think of it like this: imagine that the internet today were built in a similar way to the kin blockchain. The big nodes – services probably like Ebay, Etsy, Vimeo and others that successfully encourage people to spend money with each other – could get together and decide to block a site's transactions that they or their users think is offensive.  Would the stellar nodes made up of largely unknown back-end internet services companies cave to collective social pressure before a bunch of companies with widespread name recognition and a large base of consumer users decide to act as dictator?  Knowing that the latter is probably more likely, this is what many crypto enthusiasts want to guard against through the use of decentralized cryptocurrency protocols.  It's a question Livingston has grappled with, but contends it's an exception that maybe isn't as bad as it sounds.  ""The question is less about the terrible stuff of the world. That's stuff we're all going to have to grapple with as a global society,"" he said, adding, ""The question is more about centralized powerCould Kin become a centralized authority in the kin ecosystem? And we want the answer to that to be no.""  Governance, Livingston continued, is one of the most interesting topics in cryptocurrency right now, and the team behind kin is thinking about all these problems actively.  He concluded:  ""I think the really exciting thing from an engineering point of view is kin is at the bleeding edge of solving these blockchain challenges and leading the industry there.""

An article from The New York Times published Tuesday suggests that Intercontinental Exchange (or ICE) has been developing an online bitcoin trading platform for major investors who want access to bitcoin.  The newspaper cited emails and documents it obtained as well as conversations with four people with knowledge of the still-confidential project.  While details of the trading platform have not been set in stone and it may not still go see launch due to concerns over bitcoin's negative reputation in traditional finance, the report indicates, the move by the established financial firm would be notable if it does go ahead.  The Times said an ICE spokesman would not comment when asked about the trading platform.  The report also suggests that the company has had discussions with other financial institutions about a different effort that could make ICE-backed bitcoin swap contracts available to banks, though the exchange has made no announcements on either project.  Notably, the news comes shortly after recent reports that other Wall Street giants are becoming more open to offering services around the cryptocurrency.  For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs, according to reports in early May, has a plan to use its own money to trade bitcoin futures on behalf of its clients. And Nasdaq's CEO of Nasdaq suggested last month that the company could open a cryptocurrency exchange in the future.

42429034,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrMzh,1525782659,The Economics of Ethereum’s Coming Consensus Change Are Taking Shape,"1,500 ether.  That's how much cryptocurrency users will need to participate in testing ethereum's upcoming consensus protocol, Casper, at least according to the blockchain's creator Vitalik Buterin. During the final day of an ethereum conference in Toronto last week, Buterin took the stage to discuss his version of the software designed to change the way those running the software reach agreement.  Called Casper FFG, the algorithm has recently seen notable progress (with the first specification arriving last month), and Buterin said at the event he expects the pace of experimentation to quicken (though no timeline for the change has been given).  Heralded as a more egalitarian form of keeping the global software in sync, proof-of-stake enables users to set aside funds whereby they act as virtual mining machines. As such, Buterin spent his time on stage outlining the protocol and how the change will alter participation in the network.  Whereas today users must buy specialized hardware, Buterin explained that participating in Casper will first require submitting a minimum of 1,500 ETH (or just over $1 million) into a smart contract. While 1,500 ETH might seem like a large sum of money, Buterin emphasized that nodes with less ether can participate in a pool, or a group of nodes that work together and split the profits.  ""[Casper] will hopefully be one of the more joyous experiences in ethereum in a fairly short time,"" Buterin said.  The high price is due in part to ethereum's current scaling challenges (the consensus protocol simply cannot support more than a certain number of nodes). However, once sharding, a scaling solution that works by splitting up the blockchain into smaller chunks, is implemented, Buterin estimates this figure will be lowered to around 32 ETH ($25,856).  Still, even users with less available crypto will be able to experiment with staking on the Casper testnet, which is currently only running on a handful of nodes ""soon.""  The developer said:  “You will also soon be able to stake – ‘soon’ with a trademark. So, that’s more than two weeks.”  A how-to  Elsewhere in his speech, Buterin gave a breakdown of the various steps involved in setting up a Casper validator, or a node that will participate in the ethereum proof-of-stake protocol.  For developers, Buterin explained, the Casper FFG code offers a lot of customization freedom. In the first stage of the setup, for instance, nodes have the option to introduce features like multiple keys and additional security.  For non-developers, the process of configuring Casper code may seem complicated, but Buterin said that for most users, the setup phase will be as simple as clicking a button.  He told the audience:  “The good news is ... that in practice, you personally as a user probably don’t need to worry about which validation code you’re using. You as a user basically just click a button that says deposit.”  After that setup, users will then need to pick a wallet for which to receive returns, but again, Buterin said, ""Your client will do all this magic for you.""  Once users have submitted the 1,500 ETH minimum, the money will be locked up into a deposit, and by running the software, rewards will be dolled out in proportion to the amount of ether at stake. Nodes will automatically vote on potential blocks, and the average user doesn't need to worry about how this works, but just needs to keep the node online to see returns start to come in.  ""From your point of view, as a regular user you just need to keep your node online, keep your node running, and your node will just do all this voting automatically,"" Buterin said.  Money maker  With that node online, Buterin then detailed what returns a node could expect from staking in the network (although he stressed that the exact numbers were not final yet).  Assuming a deposit of 10 million ETH – if validators are constantly online – they will earn somewhere between 0 percent and 5 percent returns annually, Buterin said, adding, “Probably closer to five than to zero.""  But if a user's node goes offline for the majority of the time, they'll actually start losing some of their deposit, because the protocol begins to penalize inactive nodes. Yet, Buterin said, even if validators are only online between two-thirds and one-half of the time, they'll still see returns.  “So, yes, it is safe to validate if you just have a laptop. Unless you’re like me and you travel 24/7 and can’t even count on your laptop being connected to the internet,"" he joked.  Yet, these returns are contingent on users being good actors in the system.  With Casper's internal ""slasher"" concept – that is, not simply rewarding those who perform well, but punishing those who perform badly – the protocol disincentives certain behaviors, such as the formation of large staking pools and double voting on which transaction history is correct.  If a user is caught doing these things, they can lose between 1 percent and 100 percent of their deposit, Buterin said.  Yet, this would jeopardize a significant amount of money, which to Buterin and many ethereum developers will deter bad behavior.  “Who here wants to successfully attack Casper FFG?” Buterin asked, adding:  “You can do this at the low, low price of 1.67 million ether, which I believe is somewhere north of $1 billion dollars.”  Vitalik Buterin image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/08/the-economics-of-ethereums-coming-consensus-change-are-taking-shape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e1c61b36b4ae8ec62654e5d3a665bbc782f917d-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNVh,1525773641,Startup Raises $3 Million to Build 'Proof-of-Space-Time' Blockchains,"A cryptocurrency startup just raised $3 million in seed funding to revamp how blockchains reach consensus.  The Israel-based firm, called Spacemesh, aims to build ""a blockmesh operating system,"" seeking to improve upon more standard blockchains by using a new consensus protocol called ""proof-of-space-time"" (PoST) to replace proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS).  Perhaps the most interesting feature of PoST is the assertion that it can run on any desktop computer, and is aimed to be resistant to powerful and costly mining chips called application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), according to statements. Further, the protocol won't even need to rely on mining by graphics processing units (GPUs), which are similarly on the expensive side.  Tomer Afek, one of the team's members, said the protocol offers frequent rewards to incentivize miners not to join mining pools as has happened with existing major protocols. The ultimate goal is to create a peer-to-peer, fully decentralized cryptocurrency, he told CoinDesk.  To that end, ""we’re not planning any ICO, we’re trying to recreate the original vision of bitcoin. If you want coins you’ll have to mint them. There will be no public sale of the tokens,"" he said, adding:  ""I think both ethereum and bitcoin, with all the best intentions, ended up unavailable to the home miner and centralized on the other end. So our intention was to create something that would always be open to the home miner. While going about it we also realized we we can also support a very scalable blockchain which can handle thousands of transactions per second.""  According to Afek, the problem with current consensus protocols is they ensure miners are profit-driven, which means they may sometimes choose to act in their own self-interests over the interest of the blockchain. PoST is supposed to solve this by making it so miners cannot harm the network and further have no interests in doing so.  ""All [these] problems that you see on [PoS], we don't have it because we have none of those mechanisms,"" he said. ""We don't need to punish you for bad behavior because there is very little harm you can do.""

Yesterday's downwards move meant the cryptocurrency closed below the 10-day moving average (MA) – signaling short-term bullish invalidation – having failed to beat the key inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance over the weekend.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,357 on Bitfinex – largely unchanged on the day, but down 6.3 percent from the recent high of $9,990. Worryingly for the bulls, the price chart analysis indicates the losses could be extended further over the next 24 hours.  1-hour chart  The inverted flag (also known as a bear flag) breakdown suggests the sell-off from the high of $9,990 has resumed and BTC could drop to $8,865 (target as per the measured height method – pole height subtracted from breakdown price).  The momentum studies also favor the bears, with both the 50-hour moving average (MA) and 100-hour MA showing a bearish bias (sloping downwards). Further, the 50-hour MA looks set to cut the 200-hour MA from above (bearish crossover).  Daily chart  As noted earlier, BTC closed below the 10-day MA yesterday, signaling that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has made a temporary top at $9,990.  Further, BTC's attempt to retake the 10-day MA failed earlier today and the 5-day MA has adopted a bearish bias.  As a result, the cryptocurrency looks likely to find acceptance below the ascending trendline (drawn from the April 18 low and May 1 low) and possibly drop below the $9,000 mark in the next 24 hours or so.  View  BTC could drop to $8,865 (bear flag target).  A daily close (as per UTC) below the 100-day MA located at $8,897 would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and could yield a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,990).  On the higher side, a move above $9,678 would put $10,000 back on the map. That said, only a daily close above $10,000 would revive the bullish outlook.

42429046,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNLh,1525766406,EOS Revisited: Investors Take Another Look at the Longest-Running ICO,"Another blockchain for smart contracts?  As surprising as it might sound, there's a respect for incumbency even in the world of cryptocurrencies. As such, when the upstart EOS protocol launched last year with the ambition of improving on innovations like ethereum (themselves just a few years old), incredulity was in ample supply.  Intervening months haven't exactly helped this perception. But despite the skeptical experts, not to mention the very public derision of talk show host John Oliver, the EOS project has raised more than $2 billion in ether from the sale of EOS tokens, which will power its forthcoming network.  It's a notable success given the ICO was done differently than most other issuers, starting in summer 2017 and staying open through a series of auction periods through June 1 of this year.  Still, less than a month away from the sale's conclusion (and the platform's long-awaited launch), EOS is finding itself back again in the conversation. The price of the crypto token is steadily rising, something that has the interests of investors piqued, especially so given that gains haven't exactly been easy to find.  The crypto token's latest pump, though, notably coincided with a bullish report from crypto fund Multicoin Capital, which took a deep dive into the promise of what's being billed as a next-generation platform for smart contracts.  It's quite the promise, too – Block.one touts its platform as a faster, cheaper way to execute smart contracts than rivals ethereum and NEO. Additionally, it claims user experience upgrades, such as mechanisms for account recovery and human readable addresses, built in at the protocol level (as opposed to top layers).  Looking at the platform, Multicoin Capital wrote:  ""EOS takes a unique approach to creating a highly scalable platform for smart contracts. EOS prioritizes scalability and end-user experience rather than maximal censorship resistance.""  And with that, Multicoin effectively re-opened the debate among crypto community leaders about whether EOS will actually solve blockchain's scalability problems or is anything more than vaporware. And some, including Ryan Selkis, the founder of Messari Capital, are leaning more towards the later.  Following Multicoin's blog post, Selkis focused in on the project's epic valuation, in his on-again, off-again newsletter, The Daily Bit.  Selkis wrote:  ""We’re still talking about EOS like it’s a utility token/commodity. I don’t understand why it needs to be held in reserve at an $11 billion valuation pre-launch. Call me old-fashioned.""  Community is key  Part of the reason Selkis and others are skeptical is that the project hasn't even launched yet.  EOS tokens currently exist as tokens on the ethereum blockchain – and investors have been getting those tokens on a rolling basis – but eventually those tokens will need to be converted into something designed more specifically on EOS and its technology.  But it's not only that there's no ""utility"" for the tokens yet, it's the individuals engaged in the project that have still captured most of the conversation. For instance, most of the attention on EOS over the last year has stemmed from the involvement of controversial investor Brock Pierce, although he and Block.one officially parted ways in March.  Pierce aside, project founder and CTO Dan Larimer has also taken his fair share of criticism, with many alleging EOS will end up like former projects such as BitShares and Steem, which haven't quite replicated early successes after he removed his involvement.  Block.one did not reply to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  In this way, some worry about the community that will gather around EOS. Since it's an open-source project, it's strength will depend on developers willingness to continue developing it once it is released into the world. But currently a large portion of the tokens are being turned over to large hedge funds to manage and make large investments in the building of the ecosystem, which some believe won't see the money allocated to the correct things.  Selkis points this out in his post, contending that ethereum growing from developers investing their money and elbow grease makes it a more stable project than EOS, which he argues was born at the height of the unrestrained ICO-mania.  Selkis wrote:  ""My bet is that culture and community matters if you want to bootstrap a currency or something valued like it.""  Strength in censorship  That said, Multicoin takes the opposite stance.  As outlined in its work, it believes the community developing around EOS might actually offer an interesting counterpoint to those that gathered around earlier networks, arguing that its community could be more willing to make trade-offs deemed too unorthodox for other platforms.  For instance, MultiCoin wrote a follow-up blog post arguing that EOS may be stronger than it seems by sacrificing on decentralization, contrasting it with protocols like bitcoin and ethereum, which have tended to argue censorship-resistance is a key feature, and thus have effectively employed large networks of individuals who run the computers necessary to process transactions.  In contrast, EOS will only use 21 validators with a slew of backup validators ready to take over if one of those validators fails or misbehaves, though the project's creators believe these disadvantages are more than made up for by faster throughput.  In this way, it could be argued that neither bitcoin nor ethereum have put a limit on the number of miners that can take part in validating the networks. (Most people agree that it's too many for even the largest state to roll back the records and censor activities on either blockchain.)  Still, it's in some ways a minority view.  Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, wrote a Medium post about decentralization and why there's really no censorship-resistance that counts if it isn't maximum resistance.  He state:  ""Either these platforms will offer strong assurances ('permissionless-ness'), in which case they will attract 'sovereign-grade' attackers (and 'platform-grade' censorship resistance will be insufficient) OR they will embrace censorship and permission-ing, in which case they will end up as less efficient varieties of today’s centralized platforms. Regardless, neither path appears sustainable.""  Existential questions  That said, EOS may in some ways be part of a larger trend that finds newer investors perhaps more willing to pursue novel design choices.  For example, Bogart told CoinDesk that his post wasn't meant as a specific response to MultiCoin's report, but to a larger trend he sees in the space, of protocols that trade some level of decentralization for scalability, of which EOS is a good example (but so is Ripple and Stellar).  Bogart's point isn't that EOS is worse than ethereum, but that in the end comparing it to ethereum is the wrong comparison.  ""People are painting it as the competition is between EOS and ethereum, and I have a feeling that's totally the wrong way,"" Bogart told CoinDesk. ""Its competitors are AWS and Azure [the giant cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft, respectively].""  Blockchain Capital invested in Block.One, the builder of EOS, and Bogart said he appreciates every effort on the spectrum, but he sees what may be a glut of projects far from either pole.  Still, even with that more nuanced conclusion, he seems unsure of what to make of trend exactly. ""I see a lot of people rushing into this middle ground, but what if that middle ground is no man's land?"" he asked.  Looking ahead, however, the market may ultimately play the role of decider.  Major exchange Binance, for example, has announced full support for EOS token conversion, marking an early and notable nod of support from that community. Though, it's possible that this says more about the risk appetite for investors eager to see multiple large blockchains available for different use cases,  As Multicoin wrote:  ""Multicoin Capital doesn’t believe that we will see convergence around a single smart contract platform, at least in the near-to-medium term. Rather, we believe that a handful of dominant platforms will emerge, each offering a different set of features and tradeoffs.""

42429035,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrN1h,1525759257,BMW Test Drives Blockchain for Car Mileage Tracking,"Global auto giant BMW is piloting a blockchain platform to track mileage in leased vehicles through its startup innovation program.  The effort is being carried out in partnership with blockchain startup DOVU – one of five startups to work with BMW Group UK as part of the company's Innovation Lab, first unveiled back in February. Specifically, DOVU developed a system with Alphabet, BMW's fleet manager, to incentivize drivers to log mileage in leased or borrowed vehicles.  The idea is that the system helps BMW understand how much activity its vehicles are seeing and the impact on them, DOVU's head of product, Alex Morris, explained.  Morris told CoinDesk that drivers who participate receive tokens in exchange for their data, adding:  ""What we’re doing is we’re essentially trying to build out this circular economy on the DOVU platform. [Drivers] can earn tokens, but down the line they’ll also be able to spend tokens on services - for example, they might be able to get replacement tires or something like that using the Dovu ecosystem. The partner, in this case BMW, defined the categorization of the reward and that’s defined in a smart contract. As long as the parameters are met for the smart contract, they’ll receive tokens.""  BMW chose to define the parameters for token rewards through mileage – the current automatic mileage tracking systems are unreliable, Morris said, and do not provide the information that the company might actually use.  As a result, the pilot program requires drivers of leased or borrowed vehicles to log their mileage weekly, which gets stored on DOVU's blockchain.  ""Right now mileage is the most important factor for the resale value of their vehicles,"" he said. ""The problem is quite an important one for them to solve, so when we suggested tokens to incentivize them to do that they were very excited.""  The first part of the partnership – the proof-of-concept – has been completed already, said Max Lomuscio, who serves as DOVU's community manager. Now the startup is moving into the second phase, which is the actual trial with drivers. This portion should take another 6-8 weeks, he explained.  Ultimately, however, ""the plan is to become this kind of ubiquitous rewards system that can work across vehicles, make some kind of unified wallet for token rewards that you can use on your BMW, but maybe jump into your second car and earn more tokens and then spend those throughout the ecosystem,"" according to Morris.  Beyond that, the startup wants to work with smart city environments, he said, and has already begun discussions with a few cities to determine how the earning and spending use cases can be incorporated into public transit and other aspects of a metropolitan area.  The project comes months after DOVU – previously backed by Jaguar's venture arm – completed a $6 million initial coin offering.

42429045,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNJh,1525751755,Why the SEC Should Give Amnesty to Illegal ICOs,"Daniel S. Alter is a shareholder at Murphy & McGonigle, P.C. and a former general counsel for the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS).      With an estimated $4 billion or more raised in investment capital, 2017 was a boom year for initial coin offerings (ICOs). But it was accompanied by another kind of boom: the sound of a crashing regulatory framework.  By one count, more than 50 companies per month were using token sales to raise funds – and mostly all of them proceeded without regard to U.S. securities laws.  Then, in July 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued The DAO Report, which, by employing the U.S. Supreme Court’s long-established Howey test, concluded that certain digital tokens sold to investors were “investment contracts” under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore subject to SEC registration.  Slightly more than four months later, the SEC reiterated and enforced that determination in the Munchee case, a proceeding in which the agency administratively halted an ICO as an impermissible sale of unregistered securities.  These developments were followed in early 2018 by a cascade of SEC subpoenas and enforcement actions targeting similar token offerings – many of which smacked of fraud.  Putting aside the waning debate as to what may constitute a “utility” token that does not satisfy the Howey test (and thus is not an investment contract), it is now clear what the SEC thinks: the vast majority of ICOs conducted so far in the United States have violated federal law, and the ongoing trade in those tokens involves the illegal purchase and sale of unregistered securities.  This taint on crypto assets has had serious and adverse consequences for market participants.  For many security tokens, liquidity has dried up and prices have dropped. Moreover, the regulatory (and possibly criminal) vulnerability of ICO promoters, the resulting market instability for existing security tokens, and the flight of American capital overseas where token sales remain unrestricted, make the whole situation a royal, Humpty Dumpty-scale mess.  It’s time to clean it up.  A model amnesty program  Without recriminations of government diffidence and regulatory defiance, the SEC and ICO participants must work together to find a reasonable market fix. Any solution should have two essential components:  (1) a vehicle for integrating a new asset class into the established supervisory structure; and  (2) a mechanism for protecting, to the extent possible, the value of substantial yet legally flawed investments.  Apparently, a dialogue among stakeholders has already begun. Reports indicate that major cryptocurrency backers, along with their lawyers and lobbyists, recently met with Commission officials to request “a broad exemption from federal oversight” that would nevertheless permit the SEC to intervene in ICOs “if a token issuer committed fraud.”  Although a “broad” regulatory exemption for unregistered security tokens is not likely in the offing, the SEC has designed and implemented an amnesty program for a different class of securities law violators that could also serve as a blueprint for unscrambling problematic ICOs.  This past February, the Commission’s Enforcement Division announced the “Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative” (SCSD Initiative). The SCSD Initiative is an agency effort to resolve widespread and lingering violations of disclosure rules by investment advisors.  Many advisors have been selling certain classes of mutual fund shares to clients without telling them that they receive an advisor fee in connection with those shares and that other less expensive shares, that do not involve advisor fees, are available to purchase. This scenario plainly involves a material conflict of interest for investment advisors with fiduciary obligations.  Under the SCSD Initiative, investment advisors who self-report their violations are eligible to settle with the SEC according to standardized terms: (1) the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and censure on consent, in which an advisor neither admits nor denies the SEC’s findings; (2) the disgorgement of an advisor’s ill-gotten gains and the payment of interest on those revenues; and (3) the acceptance by an advisor of specified undertakings intended to correct the sale procedures that resulted in the disclosure violations.  Finally, in return for those commitments, the SEC Enforcement Division will recommend that the Commission impose no penalties on the self-reporting advisor.  The problem of unregistered security tokens warrants a similar approach.  How it would work  As some have already suggested, we basically need a regulatory do-over for the first wave of ICOs. An amnesty program like the SCSD Initiative could be one way of accomplishing that goal.  If engineered correctly, it would assimilate rogue security tokens into the fold of regulated instruments without rewarding prior violations of securities law. It could also provide issuers of unregistered security tokens with an ordered and more affordable way of resolving potentially ruinous civil liability under section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 (establishing a cause of action for rescission or damages in connection with the sale of unregistered securities).  An ICO amnesty plan would need at least two core elements to meet those objectives.  To start, issuers of unregistered security tokens (let’s call them “old tokens”) would have to complete a formal SEC registration process for what are essentially replacement tokens (“new tokens”). Upon the approval of such a registration, issuers would have to swap old tokens for new tokens for all willing takers – a digital tender offer of sorts.  As an incentive to exchange old tokens for new ones, issuers would probably need to offer some additional consideration – possibly paid in new tokens rather than cash in order to preserve the company’s operating capital.  Furthermore, to avoid the statutory bars against investors waiving compliance with the securities laws, this second leg of the required amnesty transaction should be structured as a settlement and release of any Section 12 Claims against issuers of old tokens. As explained in the 2017 U.S. Appeals Court decision in Pasternack v. Schrader:  “as a general principle, whenever a party offers consideration to another in order to remedy an alleged violation of the securities laws, acceptance of that offer in exchange for a release of . . . claims is tantamount to establishing ‘compliance’ with the securities laws.”  Holdout investors that chose not to redeem their old tokens would, of course, retain their Section 12 Claims. But presumably the issuer would know the approximate number of holdouts in advance of self-reporting, and – in terms of liability – that number would have to be economically manageable for the company. Otherwise, there would be no point for the issuer to seek amnesty in the first place.  Indeed, an ICO amnesty process that included these elements could help to separate the good eggs from the bad. In evaluating the swap provision, investors would have to determine whether there is greater value in reaffirming their stake in the company or pursuing their rescission rights. That sober second look should promote efficient investor decisions that reflect the health and prospects of the underlying business enterprise.  Moreover, issuers of blatantly fraudulent ICOs have little chance of successfully registering their new tokens with the SEC, and therefore have little motivation to even try. That act of self-selection should significantly assist the SEC in identifying some of the most appropriate subjects for enforcement activity.  This proposed strategy to address widespread securities violations in the crypto-asset market is not intended as a comprehensive regulatory plan. To the contrary, it is presented merely as a conversation starter. Other legal considerations and possibly technological constraints will further shape the parameters of any final program, for sure.  It is urgent, however, that serious talks get underway. While regulators, entrepreneurs, and investors all walk on eggshells, innovation slows. Sometimes you just have to break a few eggs to move forward.

42429037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrN3h,1525745109,'Cryptojacking' Software Attack Hits Hundreds of Websites,"Hackers have injected hundreds of websites running the Drupal content management system with malicious software used to mine the cryptocurrency monero.  This latest incident was uncovered by Troy Mursch, the security researcher behind the website Bad Packets Report. He wrote Saturday that more than 300 sites had been compromised by hackers who installed the browser mining software Coinhive, which mines the cryptocurrency monero, by exploiting a vulnerability in an outdated version of the Drupal content management system (CMS).  ""Cryptojacking,"" as similar attacks are called, has become a common problem in recent months. Whereas hackers used to favor ransom attacks – in which they would scramble victims' data and demand ransoms in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in order to decrypt it – they now increasingly infect websites with software that harnesses visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency on the attackers' behalf.  Mursch told CoinDesk that while cryptojacking is not as overt as ransomware, it ""continues to be a problem - especially for website operators.""  He explained:  ""This is because Coinhive and other cryptojacking services (malware) are simply done with JavaScript. Every modern browser and device can run JavaScript, so as such, everybody can mine cryptocurrency and unfortunately Coinhive has been used and abused time and time again. [In] this particular case, Drupal users need to update [as soon as possible].""  Affected sites include the San Diego Zoo, the National Labor Relations Board, the City of Marion, Ohio, the University of Aleppo, the Ringling College of Art and Design and the government of Chihuahua, Mexico. A full list of affected sites is available on this spreadsheet.  Visitors to affected websites may not even notice that their computers are running the cryptographic functions used to generate monero for hackers. The attacks slow users computers down, however, and can cause wear and tear on computers' processors.  Not all Coinhive users are malicious, however. Salon, a news outlet, and UNICEF use the software to raise funds, but only run it with visitors' permission.
