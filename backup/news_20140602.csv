42375632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Nqj,1401745860,North America's Bitcoin Roadshow Offers Free Car as Grand Prize,"The North American Bitcoin Car Giveaway Tour 2014, a digital currency-themed roadshow aimed at promoting the use of bitcoin among everyday consumers, is set to hit the highways of North America in July.  The tour is being co-run by Kryptoz Inc., a bitcoin business media company, and BitPages.co, a bitcoin advertising platform, and will make stops throughout Canada and the US starting the first week of July at the West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta.  The marquee event of the tour is the Las Vegas Money 20/20 conference, where a drawing will be held for the grand prize: a special edition 2014 KIA Soul that will serve as the heart and soul of the roadshow.  CoinDesk spoke with Kryptoz Inc. co-founder and CEO Robbie Davidson, who said that the tour is tapping into the nascent interest in bitcoin among consumers, with the overarching goal of bringing more information to people who might otherwise remain uninformed about the nature of digital currencies.  Davidson said:  ""The big initiative is raising awareness for bitcoin. It’s so exciting — there’s so many people who don’t know about it [but] they’re interested in it. And, even if they’re not interested, you give away some and they start to get interested.""  Big prizes at stake  The vehicle up for grabs is the same one that will be driven around the continent during the tour. According to Davidson, the contest is designed to be the ""big draw"" for people.  After that, he hopes they’ll have a chance to learn more about digital currencies. He added that he expects there to be an even mix of seasoned cryptocurrency enthusiasts and people who have only heard about bitcoin in the news.  ""I’m expecting a really hardcore bitcoin community, but I expect a lot of people who are simply intrigued.""  Notably, winners have the option of choosing the KIA Soul or $10,000 worth of bitcoins. Davidson suggested that because of the continental nature of the contest, some might not want to go through the expense of shipping a vehicle across state and national boundaries.  The tour is offering attendees a number of ways to enter the contest. In addition to signing up on-site, Davidson said that people can take pictures of the event and share them online which will enable them to receive additional entries.  Additionally, participants will receive bitcoin gift cards and other types of promotional swag. Davidson said that in some locations, bitcoin ATMs and other hardware will be on display for those who want to check them out.  Future tours in the works  Davidson envisions the tour as a yearly event, with a new car giveaway headlining the roadshow during its pan-continental trek.  He added:  “Everything is moving ahead. We’re ready, but we’re definitely planning on making this a yearly thing. And each year, the big mystery is: what car are they going to give away this year?”  Ultimately, he said, the success of this year’s tour will determine the nature of future events. Yet given the growing interest in bitcoin in general, he foresees more than a few people wanting to come out, learn about digital currencies and take their chance at winning a free car.

42425734,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjNh,1401742261,Apple Policy Update May Open Door for Bitcoin Transactions,"Cupertino, California-based computing giant Apple has released an update to its App Store Review Guidelines that potentially opens the doors for a change in its long-restrictive policies against bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The release follows Worldwide Developer’s Conference (WWDC 2014), an annual meetup of Apple developers that was expected to bring notable announcements for the company's customers and wider business community.  The update, made under the document's 'purchasing and currencies' section, reads:  ""Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.""  Anti-bitcoin policies  Apple had garnered the ire of the wider bitcoin community as early as 2012 when it removed wallet apps Blockchain Wallet and BitPak. While Blockchain's app was later reinstated, Apple returned late last year to abruptly pull major bitcoin wallet apps — such as Coinbase and the newer Blockchain — from its app store.  Encrypted instant message app Gliph once allowed bitcoins to be attached to messages, but developers were told by Apple it could only remain available if that feature was removed.  BitPak developer Rob Sama said an Apple representative had given the reason: ""Because that bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale"". When he questioned what laws anywhere made bitcoin illegal, the rep responded ""that is up to you to figure out"".  Although iOS users who installed the apps before the ban are still able to use them, no ability to update means they're often stuck with only basic functionality compared to their Android-using brethren. And should they lose or damage their device somehow, the app is gone for good.  Damage to bitcoin  The resulting embargo of any apps that allow for the transmission of bitcoins has been widely acknowledged by the bitcoin community as having a negative impact on adoption. Despite rivals' gains in recent years, Apple's iOS still accounts for 65% of mobile web traffic in the lucrative North American market.  Blockchain's app had been downloaded 120,000 times before Apple's action. Earlier this year, that company and Gliph responded with blog posts critical of Apple's lack of clarity on the issue.  Anti-Apple backlash perhaps hit a tipping point this February, when bitcoin's fervent reddit community began publicly destroying Apple devices in a video campaign designed to bring awareness to the Apple's actions.  Creative solutions  Of course, in recent months bitcoin entrepreneurs and developers have simply become more covert in their use of Apple's own policies in order to bring bitcoin-based services to the platform.  Bity  and Cycle of Goodness (CoG) both launched wallets in the wake of Apple's Blockchain ban to wide enthusiasm in the community, while browser-based alternatives have provided alternative relief.  Developers at Avalonic also produced a beta version of an entire unofficial bitcoin app store called 'Bit Store', saying their use of Apple's enterprise protocols was legally sound.  Most recently, Pheeva was about to offer its bitcoin wallet to iOS users by registering as a cooperative, meaning prospective users must first enroll in the company's community online before download.  Uncertainty lingers  While the cause of much enthusiasm from the community, ultimately more guidance may be required to determine whether or not bitcoin itself is an ""approved"" digital currency.  In addition, Section 22.1 of Apple's Review Guidelines has always contained this clause, under 'Legal Requirements':  “Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer’s obligation to understand and conform to all local laws.”  As a company, Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about future development, and may have an as-yet-unrevealed product which applies to the policy change.

42425728,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjFh,1401740445,$5 Billion Insurance Company Offers Bitcoin Coverage to Businesses,"Organisations looking to minimize the risks associated with bitcoin can now obtain virtual currency insurance coverage courtesy of Great American Insurance Group.  The company's crime policies currently do not cover what it calls ""virtual peer-to-peer mediums of exchange"". As such, a new form of protective coverage has been made available through its Fidelity/Crime Division to both commercial and government policyholders.  Great American explained its decision, stating:  ""Standard crime insurance policies, including Great American’s crime policy, currently do not automatically provide coverage for virtual peer-to-peer mediums of exchange. Crime insurance coverage for bitcoins can now be granted by endorsement to an existing crime policy.""  Great American says the coverage is now available in most US states.  Protection against theft  The Windsor, Connecticut-based company says it is the first in the insurance industry to commercially cover bitcoin.  The company has $50m in underwriting capacity, and is part of American Financial Group Inc., a publicly traded company on the New York Stock exchange that earns roughly $5bn in annual revenue.  Great American's extension of virtual currency coverage only applies to crime, and thus, has its limitations. According to the company's Fidelity/Crime Division, the coverage includes employee dishonesty, money and securities, forgery and computer fraud.  Risky business  Lending to its relatively unregulated nature, there are a number of risks associated with dealing in BTC. Many companies, for example, are wary of bitcoin after the failure of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox.  The ability for companies and governments to insure virtual currency-related activities against criminal loss is a positive one, though there is still regulatory and price risk.  With the advent of newer virtual currency security features from companies like BitGo and insurance coverage capabilities, this is a sign the industry continues to mature and move forward.

42425724,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjDh,1401738700,Bitcoin Australia Launches Preemptive Strike Against Restrictive Taxes,"Australian bitcoin advocacy association Bitcoin Australia (BA) has published a paper detailing its recommendations for how bitcoin taxation should be managed by domestic authorities.  By producing the paper, BA is preempting the Australian Tax Office (ATO), which is expected to release its own official guidelines sometime in the next few weeks.  BA's recommendations are designed to fit within the framework of existing Australian federal tax legislation, factoring for income, capital gains and a goods-and-services tax (GST). At the proposal's heart, however, is the legal definition of digital currency as 'money', which it describes as ""any generally accepted medium of exchange for goods and services and for the payment of debts"".  The 12-page paper, crowdsourced by local experts with the help of Australian legal firms Adroit and McCullough Robertson, all of whom worked pro bono, recommends the tax office take ""the practical approach"" to defining bitcoin, stating:  ""If the approach taken by ATO were to counteract the efficiency and simplicity of the bitcoin process, these innovative businesses would not be viable. This will push both the innovators and the investors offshore and it will see alternative jurisdictions benefiting from Australian innovation and capital.""  Bitcoin is money  Bitcoin's lack of a central authority, and ability to be used and accepted universally by anyone, differentiates it from other non-cash payments such loyalty points and frequent flyer miles.  BA believes bitcoin can exist within Australian tax law's broad definition of 'money' as-is, without changing the fundamental operation of systems like the GST. Indeed, outside of its function as money, bitcoin has little reason to exist regardless of how it is defined legally.  The paper points out that bitcoin can also be considered 'property' under GST and thus an 'asset' under capital gains tax, also under existing legal precedents and definitions.  Keeping BTC prices low  The GST, which is Australia's sales tax, taxes anything that fits its broad definition of a 'supply' (ie: goods and services). This typically does not include money to prevent the tax from being inappropriately applied twice during a single transaction. Instead, money is defined as a 'consideration', or payment, for the supply.  The potential for extra taxation of bitcoin due to a non-money definition has been an issue in other countries that have already set guidelines, namely the US and Singapore.  BA says treating a medium of exchange like bitcoin as 'supply' would drive prices up by 10% and cause Australian consumers to make their purchases overseas, rather than locally.  It has a point: a high-valued local currency and 10% GST on local purchases have already seen shoppers turn to online retailers overseas, leaving Australia-based retailers fuming.  Taxation is inevitable  The ATO in February made clear its intention to tax bitcoin transactions somehow, saying it would release official guidelines in time for the end of the current financial year on 30th June.  Providing some extra details in a privately addressed letter to a business owner, an ATO official said the department would tax bitcoin under income, capital gains and GST laws.  So far, however, it has not said what legal status bitcoin should have under those guidelines, leaving businesses to speculate.  Australia open for business  Local bitcoin advocates see the tax treatment of bitcoin in much grander terms, choosing to focus on the potential economic effects Australia could face, should it eschew appropriate taxation.  Bitcoin Australia  president and co-founder of bitcoin payment gateway BitPOS, Jason Williams, said the government should be doing whatever it can to encourage economic and investment activity:  ""Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not going away – the genie is out of the bottle. It's really up to the Australian government to embrace the change that is happening right now, and position Australia as a center of excellence.""  Williams continued, implying the decision could have far-reaching economic impacts:  ""By seeing bitcoin in the same light as traditional Australian dollars, the government positions Australia as a place that will attract investment and usage, bolstering the Australian economy by bringing in overseas investment. Australia will become known around the world as a place that is not afraid to welcome change.""  BA's paper also describes the growth of Australia's bitcoin economy, saying it grew by 480% in the first four months of 2014, with an estimated 192 businesses and 7% of the world's investment focusing on bitcoin ventures.  The group said it is available to help and assist any government department or agency understand bitcoin further, and would welcome the opportunity.

42425731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjBh,1401735090,Citi: Bitcoin a Threat to Debit and Credit Card Issuers,"A recent report published by Citi suggests that bitcoin could challenge or even supplant some traditional payment services if adoption widens in future years.  According to Citi GPS, a corporate publication owned by the financial institution, the technology underlying digital currencies has the potential to disrupt current-day payments structures. It cites debit/credit card systems and remittance services in particular, saying:  ""The essential innovation in bitcoin is that it can eliminate the need for a ‘trusted intermediary’ when the principals in a transaction do not trust each other. There are many such transactions but money transfer/ credit/ debit card transactions stand out.""  However, the report goes on to state that security risks and price volatility may prevent bitcoin from ever becoming more than a ""wannabe means of transactions"".  Bitcoin could shift payments paradigm  The report compares the roughly $6.2bn bitcoin market capitalization with that of the combined global payment companies, which amounts to approximately $300bn.  As many as $15.5tn debit and credit card transactions took place in 2013, and it is this large market that digital currencies are poised to disrupt in the years to come, the report continued.  Citi directly cited the potential cost savings of using digital currencies like bitcoin as a payment vehicle. Notably, the report said greater use of bitcoin for this purpose is possible even when accounting for transaction costs collected to boost security in the bitcoin network.  Citi explained:  ""Bitcoin transactions have potential cost advantages over conventional payments and reduce the need for intermediation. The gap between conventional transactions cost and any bitcoin fees for convenience and increased security will allow bitcoin to make incursions into this market.""  The financial institution also suggested that other digital currencies, such as litecoin, dogecoin and blackcoin, in particular, could also gain more market share, calling transactions in those altcoins ""significant"".  Digital currencies threaten credit, debit cards  Notably, the report suggested that companies that offer credit and debit card services may face increased competition from digital currencies that could disrupt their existing business models.  The report stated:  ""If fraud/chargebacks can be reduced or eliminated by digital currencies there is plenty of room for margins to be eroded. Retail transactions across borders could also become very inexpensive, if the charges involved in going from one currency to another were substantively reduced.""  The impact on foreign exchange (FX) markets is less certain, said Citi, given the low margin that already exists.  However, the report said that companies which charge higher fees to transact between currencies, including global remittance firms, ""may find their franchise eroded if generic bitcoin technology lowers the cost if these transactions"".

42425740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjPh,1401732052,Study: Silk Road May Have Reduced Drug Violence,"A new study argues that online black marketplaces, such as the infamous Silk Road, can actually reduce the number of drug related-violent crimes.  The researchers' argument is simple: online drug traffickers act more like wholesalers, and since online markets limit the scope of direct interaction between the traffickers — blurring or removing territorial boundaries, there is less of a chance for violent confrontation.  The research was conducted by University of Lausanne criminologist David Décary-Hétu and University of Manchester law professor Judith Aldridge.  Entitled “Not an 'Ebay for Drugs': The Cryptomarket 'Silk Road' as a Paradigm Shifting Criminal Innovation,"" the paper argues that a substantial proportion of transactions on the original Silk Road could be characterised as ‘business-to-business’ deals, made at substantial prices typical of those paid by drug dealers sourcing stock.  In other words, a lot of Silk Road purchases were not made by end users, but rather by resellers. The result is that researchers concluded the platform was a potentially transformative for the illegal market:  ""With the key Silk Road customers actually drug dealers sourcing stock for local street operations, we were witnessing a new breed of retail drug dealer, equipped with a technological subcultural capital skill set for sourcing stock.""  Trade without frontiers  Décary-Hétu and Aldridge point out that the number of wholesaler deals on Silk Road must have reduced violence, intimidation and territorialism. In effect, violence was rendered obsolete, as the web cannot not be used to go after the competition, protect one’s turf or take over another trafficker's market.  Other ‘skills’ came to the forefront. On illicit cryptomarkets, good customer service and writing skills were more important than muscles, the paper found.  The added layer of anonymity offered drug traffickers and their clients more security, not just from law enforcement, but from each other, the paper asserts.  Lifestyle factors  However, due to the nature of Silk Road, the paper’s conclusions are not substantiated by hard numerical data.  The researchers focused on scale instead, arguing that the volume and size of individual transactions carried out on Silk Road proves that many drug dealers used it to stock up, avoiding direct contact with traditional suppliers.  Between mid-2012 and mid-2013, sales on Silk Road increased from $14.4m to $89.7m, so the researchers make the assumption that these transactions involved zero violence, and that selling $89.7 million worth of drugs the old-fashioned way would have resulted in some level of violence.  Researchers also found that most Silk Road traffickers sold less addictive and less harmful drugs than their street counterparts, pointing out that heroin, crack and methamphetamine accounted for a very small share of marketplace traffic.  Drop in the ocean  However, even Décary-Hétu and Aldridge admit that the effect of Silk Road on the general drugs market was negligible. The United Nations estimates the global market for illicit drugs at more than $300bn, making Silk Road a drop in the ocean.  In spite of this, the pair believe criminologists should examine Silk Road records for vital information on the potential uses of cryptographic technologies in the illicit drug trade.  However, there are other avenues as well. The original Silk Road may now be out of business, but a new version is already thriving and its relative success has spawned a number of copycat operations.

42425733,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjLh,1401728770,CryptoLocker Crimewave Halted as Global Authorities Disable Network,"CryptoLocker, the notorious online malware estimated to have stolen $27m, has been temporarily disabled, according to international law enforcement agencies including the UK National Crime Agency (NCA), the FBI and Europol.  First surfacing in late 2013, CrypoLocker's ransom malware hijacked more than 234,000 computers through phishing emails, then offered users the ability to pay to decrypt their device for $300 in USD, EUR or BTC.  Symantec researchers report that law enforcement agencies have now effectively disabled key nodes of the GOZeuS network (also known as P2PZeuS and Gameover ZeuS). A separate form of malware, GOZeuS had provided the delivery method for the ransomware, though it was designed to steal users' online banking login details.  According to law enforcement agencies, Internet users now have a two-week window to take the necessary precautions protect themselves from the malware.  Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said:  ""By making use of this two-week window, huge numbers of people in the UK can stop that from happening to them.""  He added: ""Whether you find online security complicated or confusing, or simply haven’t thought about keeping your personal or office computers safe for a while, now is the time to take action.""  Suspects named  Law enforcement officials say they have effectively sinkholed GOZeuS' peer-to-peer network, thereby cutting off criminal control of the affected computers. However, given the distributed nature of the network, the measure is unlikely to shut down the threat permanently.  The suspected ringleader of the illegal operation has also reportedly been identified. According to the UK NCA report, US authorities now allege that 30-year-old Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev is the leader of the criminal enterprise behind GOZeuS.  Other arrests are ""in progress"", according to international officials.  Protective action  The announcement will no doubt be greeted with enthusiasm by bitcoin users, as affected users were forced to pay a 2 BTC ransom. Further, though it debuted six months ago, CryptoLocker was still a threat to many Internet users, making headlines in November for updates that made its attacks more sophisticated.  Though authorities were optimistic about the results, they also acknowledged that similar threats are likely to continue to arise.  Archibald used his statements to reiterate the importance of Internet best practices, concluding:  ""Our message is simple: update your operating system and make this a regular occurrence, update your security software and use it and, think twice before clicking on links or attachments in unsolicited emails.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/02/cryptolocker-crimewave-halted-as-global-authorities-disable-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9804d34e90f6007c6ab62b0abec9711ecce450db-1003x699.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjfh,1401721635,How Purse.io Can Shave 25% Off Bitcoin Buyers' Amazon Bills,"A good startup, they say, should find a problem and solve it elegantly. Well, California-based company Purse.io solves two problems and ties the solutions together in one neat package.  The company is marketing its service at people who would like to purchase items at Amazon using bitcoin, which the retail giant doesn't yet accept. But integral to its solution are those who want to obtain bitcoin using a credit card, perhaps in areas where exchanges are not available.  By matching these two markets, Purse.io is able to able to offer bitcoin purchases on Amazon, powered by a kind of bitcoin exchange that uses a buyers' discount to incentivise bitcoin owners to 'sell' their digital currency.  This process is similar to a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace, where Purse.io acts as an intermediary, offering users the platform, bitcoin wallet and escrow for transactions.  Andrew Lee, co-founder of Purse.io, told CoinDesk:  ""I think people that try it and realize they just saved 25% on Amazon are excited about that possibility. For the first time, they’ve been able to do something useful with bitcoin [rather than just buy and hold].""  How it works  Firstly, when someone – Alice, say – wants to use bitcoin to purchase items for a discount from Amazon, she deposits bitcoin in her Purse.io account. Then, using a 'share' URL, she imports her Amazon 'wish list' into Purse.io and indicates what level of discount she would like for the items.  When complete, the listing is posted on the Purse.io marketplace.  Next, someone looking to obtain bitcoin for a similar amount, we'll call them Bob, accepts the transaction and purchases the items on Alice's wish list using a credit card. Soon after, the items are shipped to Alice.  Once the items have been received, Alice notifies Purse.io, at which point her bitcoin is released from escrow and is sent to Bob (see the company's explanatory video below).  ""It’s kind of like an exchange, but with that Amazon layer,"" explained Kent Liu, the second founder of the company.  It is worth noting that while there is a recommended 25% 'maximum' discount, in fact, the user sets the amount and transactions have been accepted with discounts as high as 45%.  However, Liu explained that there is a 'sweet spot' for item price compared to percentage discount that is likely to make the transaction quickly accepted:  ""Anything below 15% at $500 [total price], [...] will get taken.""  All about incentive  Liu said that he came up with the idea for Purse.io about a year ago, when bitcoin's price had risen to a level not previously seen before, and as a result there were a number of new BTC-related services appearing.  ""People were excited to spend bitcoin,"" he said.  The problem, at least from Liu's perspective, is that every service charged fees. Why not give people an incentive to unload bitcoin, allowing others improved access to the cryptocurrency?  ""It is difficult to buy bitcoin. It is really, really hard,"" said Liu. ""Our market is people who cannot overcome that difficulty. [And] the difficulty is not going to decrease that easily anytime soon.""  Instead of charging bitcoin buyers on Purse.io, the company levies a 1% fee on those selling the bitcoin and getting an Amazon discount.  Easing bitcoin's on-ramp  Globally, it is still not easy to buy bitcoin. While, in the US, users that have a checking account can easily convert dollars into bitcoin using exchanges like Coinbase, in many countries, there is no way to convert the local fiat currency into digital currency without jumping through a lot of hoops.  Doing so might mean exchanging one fiat currency into USD, then wiring it to a company such as Bitstamp, which will exchange it into bitcoin. At every step of the way a fee is charged.  However, someone with an international credit card can purchase items on Amazon from pretty much anywhere.  Spending credits  So, essentially, anyone living in a country that does not have a viable bitcoin exchange could be a potential customer for Purse.io.  It's a better value proposition to for many, and furthermore, the fact that affiliates of Amazon receive a certain amount of credits that must be spent on the website may boost take-up of the service.  Someone in India, for example, may want to convert those credits into bitcoin rather than Amazon items, or even rupees.  Relying on Amazon  So what would Purse.io do if Amazon shut them down? The founders have thought about that, but believe that for the time being they are providing a service that is in demand.  ""We think we’re helping [Amazon],"" said Lee. ""They don’t want to take bitcoin now. They’re not ready for it.""  In April, an Amazon executive said that the company decided against accepting bitcoin due to weak customer demand. Furthermore, there is added complexity for the company compared with other retailers that currently accept the digital currency.  According to Purse.io, Amazon's marketplace strategy is problematic: having so many third-party sellers, a good portion of products on the retailer's website are not sourced from Amazon itself, creating complexity that the likes of TigerDirect and Overstock don't have to deal with.  ""I don’t think we’ve seen a real big retailer accept bitcoin that has a marketplace,"" Lee explained.  Trustless escrow  Although Purse.io provides a wallet for users to store the bitcoin they have acquired, Liu said the company would prefer to not store substantial customer funds:  ""Right now, we are holding people’s money. But we don’t want to do that.""  However, by holding funds until the Amazon items are delivered, Purse.io has positioned itself in the digital currency escrow business, which could be a promising strategy.  A recent FinCEN ruling indicated digital currency escrow is not a money transmission business, which is likely to mean less regulatory scrutiny for the company as more authorities issue guidance.  In the future, the company plans to offer multi-signature transactions that have three keys: one for the buyer, one for the seller and one for Purse.io, creating a trustless form of escrow.  ""None of us hold enough keys [in this model],"" said Liu. ""Nobody has control over [the funds], unless two people agree.""  Building a footprint  For several months, Purse.io has been working on its product at the Plug and Play Technology Center in Sunnyvale, California, since being accepted as one of several bitcoin startups in its accelerator scheme.  At a recent bitcoin meetup at the centre, which provides assistance to new tech startups, the company talked to Patrick Murck, General Counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation.  ""He told us we're pretty good from a regulatory standpoint,"" Liu said.  Lee and Liu have now brought in some extra hands as far as development goes and they hope to raise more funding, in addition to the seeding that Plug and Play provided.  The plan is to focus on product and building out the multi-signature escrow, with the possibility of adding further retailers and building Purse.io's own marketplace with the userbase it is developing.  Amazon will likely, at some point, accept bitcoin.

42425729,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjJh,1401712940,Meet the Bots That Let You Trade Bitcoin in Your Sleep,"With all the allegations of Mt. Gox’s automated trading bot, which has been dubbed ""Willy"", algorithmic trading is getting a bad rap. However, using bots to trade on the financial markets is a long-established and legitimate activity – and it’s easier than anywhere in the cryptocurrency markets.  So, how do these bots work, and can they really make you money?  Trading bots are software programs that talk directly to financial exchanges, and place buy and sell orders on your behalf. They make those decisions by watching the market’s price movements, and reacting according to a set of predefined rules.  Joseph Lee is living proof that they can make money. Lee, who founded derivatives exchange BTC.sx, based its trading engine on algorithmic trading bots that he wrote himself, and used between 2011 and 2013.  He claims to have turned a simple $100 buy order into $200,000 in profits using his private software army. While that seems astonishing, the devil is in the detail, of course: a lot of that price increase stems from the massive price increase in bitcoin late last year.  In fact, the real profits are far more marginal, he has said, so don't expect to install a plug-in and write your own rags-to-riches story.  Lee, who claims that his bots shifted 10% of the market’s entire volume in the early days, started using his methods when the price sat at $2-$4 per bitcoin.  Market maker  Lee's first trading bot used inter-exchange arbitrage, noticing differences in prices between orders on different exchanges, and buying on some exchanges while selling on others.  “I was essentially taking liquidity from a market where there was some and injecting it into a market where there wasn’t,” he explained. Back then, Mt. Gox dominated the market, and other exchanges had poor pricing because their supply of bitcoins was limited.  “So, I bought for cheap on Mt. Gox and sold them to other markets. I bought a lot of bitcoin into tertiary markets.”  In short, he acted as a market maker on less-established exchanges.  Established practice  Lee may have written his own bots, but today, the bitcoin trading bot market is far more established, with several available off the shelf.  Examples include Butter Bot, which offers an online trading bot accessed via a Google Chrome plug-in, and Haas Online, which sells a Windows-based personal trading server. CryptoTrader offers a trading bot marketplace, which allows people to develop bots using different trading strategies, and then rent them to others.  Trading by algorithm isn’t new in the financial world: companies in the conventional financial markets have been using the method for years. Lee said, however, that the bitcoin exchange community is one of the first where exchanges grant customers’ computers direct market access (DMA).  This enables individual traders to have their computer access the exchange’s electronic order books directly. That’s a service normally only available to brokers and investment houses in the conventional markets.  “In the past, it was the people who had the means to pay for a $10,000-plus a year Bloomberg terminal with an API connection who could try their hand at bot trading,” Lee explained.  So, why isn’t everyone doing it?  Pablo Lema, founder of Butter Bot, says that bots aren’t a ‘fire and forget’ technology that enable dilettantes to make money without trying:  “Trading bots require users to have at least a basic understanding of the market, need to be modified and tweaked by the user according to the predominant market conditions, and also according to their own risk profile.”  Trading bot strategy  Lee started off capitalising in a highly inefficient market, where exchanges with sufficient liquidity could be counted on one hand.  The situation – while still needing improvement – is at least a little better now. Opportunities for inter-exchange arbitrage still exist, but he recommends using technical analysis bots.  But trading isn't necessarily based on technical analysis alone. It’s difficult to program a computer to react to fundamental market conditions such as, say, rumours about the Chinese government taking a new stance on bitcoin, or the latest bitcoin-based black market trading site shutting down.  Many bots will use an exponential moving average (EMA) as a starting point. These averages track market prices over a set time span, and bots can be programmed to react to what that price does – such as moving beyond certain thresholds.  “If you have a conservative appetite, choose to trade on a slower basis,” Lee advised. “If you picked daily rather than hourly periods, it’s generally seen as a safe bet to get involved in the basics of trading, let alone bot trading.”  Others suggest tweaks to the EMA approach.  “If you look to the biggest downside of an EMA then you see it’s almost always to late. And this is the part that can be improved,” said Stephan de Haas, founder of the Haas Online trading bot company, adding.  “This improvement could be done by using a DEMA [double exponential moving average] or TEMA [triple exponential moving average] instead. Those have the ability to respond faster then the EMA and their calculation is EMA-related, so it looks the same while it gives off better momentum.”  There are still other methods, he pointed out, such as relative strength indicators and regression analysis.  “This type of analysis works perfectly for processes (in this case a price market) that are unstable,” he says, in a description which seems to sum up the roller-coaster world of bitcoin.  “Using that data, it can make good sense of what’s to be expected in the [...] future.”  Secret strategies  However, technical analysis is a discipline, and these things are indicators, not strategies. You’re still going to have to come up with your own set of trading rules, if you’re going to tell a bot how to make decisions.  “The really good strategies are kept secret and closed source,” says Lema. “That’s done by everyone: the mid [and] high level [traders] and clearing houses. It’s hard for a trader who’s new to understand the market.”  BTC or Bust, the creator of the Crackin’ Kraken bot found on Cryptotrader, points to a set of algorithms in a library of technical analysis algorithms known as TA-Lib, along with custom indicators developed by the bot author. These are typically combined to find buy and sell signals in the market, BTC or Bust told CoinDesk.  Bots can be programmed to be predictive or reactive, or a combination of both, using these combined algorithms, it said, explaining:  “For example, let's say the bitcoin price is crashing. A predictive algorithm might start buying as it expects the price will quickly rebound, while a reactive algorithm might start selling as it sees the price is dropping. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages – the challenge is to have the bot employ the correct strategy at the correct time.”  The ability to set these strategies is one of things that will stop bots from unbalancing the market. Even if lots of people use them, the theory goes that the different strategies they employ would stop them all moving the market in one direction and creating an artificial bubble – or worse, a 'flash crash'.  Not for everyone  Is bot trading for you? Possibly. They offer a variety of advantages, not least of which is the ability to diligently trade on your behalf, 24/7, and the ability to remove all of the emotion from trading (assuming you don’t barge in and terminate them when you’re feeling irrationally antsy).  On the other hand, if you don’t have the financial smarts to put together a trading strategy, then bots could simply end up automating a set of poor market trading decisions.  For many, then, who believe in bitcoin's long-term potential, the most basic trading strategy could be buy-and-hold.  Whether or not you decide to automate your trades, the basic rules apply: don’t trade more than you can afford to lose, and don’t go into any investment without at least a basic understanding of what you’re doing.

42425745,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfjdh,1401706637,Can Chinese Exchange OKCoin Rescue Mt. Gox Creditors?,"One name that crops up whenever recovery plans for Mt. Gox are mentioned is one of China's largest bitcoin exchanges, OKCoin.  That's probably for a good reason. On an as-yet-unofficial basis, the company is known to be interested in backing its own team in Japan to put Gox back on its feet and take some steps towards making creditors whole.  OKCoin CEO Star Xu told CoinDesk during a recent interview in Beijing that the idea had been suggested to him by some Japan-based friends, and that he personally thought resurrecting the once-dominant exchange and attempting to return its customers' funds was important to the entire bitcoin community.  He also added it would be a lengthy process that could take years to realise.  OKCoin  says it is not considering a direct takeover of Mt. Gox, but rather it wants to leverage its experience by licencing exchange and security technology under a new team that would possibly feature some OKCoin personnel.  Also involved is another Chinese company, BitOcean, which is already partnering with OKCoin to produce the first home-grown bitcoin ATMs for both the domestic and international markets.  Mt. Gox proposal  OKCoin/BitOcean's new plan would feature an immediate audit of Mt. Gox's bitcoin and fiat currency reserves, a debt-equity swap in a new business entity for all creditors and the ability for users to begin withdrawing funds from day one.  The plan, according to people involved, was designed from the beginning to favour redress for Mt. Gox's customers – some of whom saw up to six- and seven-figure fiat-value balances simply vanish when Gox suddenly ceased all operations in February.  CEO Mark Karpeles has claimed Mt. Gox lost the majority of its bitcoins in hacks related to the 'transaction malleability' issue in bitcoin's protocol, although bitcoin core developers and other researchers have claimed this is not credible. It also does not explain what happened to the millions in dollar, euro and Japanese yen balances also stored at the exchange.  Lack of reliable and independent information regarding Mt. Gox's exact financial history and current situation is hampering attempts to find a solution attractive to creditors, as well as debate over whether such a solution is even possible.  The only funds known to exist at this stage are the 200,000 bitcoins the exchange said were found ""in an old format wallet"" in March.  Rescue vs liquidation  Rival rescue group Sunlot Holdings, which runs the SaveGox.com website, is trying to prevent the planned liquidation that would see Mt. Gox shut down completely and its assets sold.  Even that process could take years, with any remaining bitcoins treated as assets and sold at market rates before eventually being returned to former customers at some stage in the future.  At this stage any decision regarding liquidation or rescue plans rests with the bankruptcy trustee appointed by the Tokyo District Court, Nobuaki Kobayashi. Kobayashi has not yet indicated whether he favours a resurrection of Mt. Gox at all.  He posted an updated notice about bankruptcy proceedings on the exchange's homepage on 21st May, stating that a creditors' meeting ""for reporting on the status of the assets"" would take place in Tokyo on 23rd July. The deadline for filing bankruptcy claims is 28th November, and a final decision will be made on 25th February 2015.  Court rejects CoinLab's block  CoinLab, a former Mt. Gox business partner still engaged in active lawsuits with the company, last week attempted to use US bankruptcy courts to block or delay Sunlot's plan.  It said the bid headed by Wall Street trading veteran John Betts and backed by new Bitcoin Foundation Board member Brock Pierce lacked the experience necessary to perform its proposed investigation.  A Seattle court rejected CoinLab's submission, however, saying Sunlot's proposal did not have special status and there may indeed be other groups with their own plans.  Fiery online meeting  A Google hangout streamed live to YouTube on 27th April tried to clear the air by allowing the various interests to state their case. The meeting at times became heated as various parties questioned whether others had creditors' best interests at heart.  US Attorney Daniel Kelman, who divides his time these days between Taiwan and Tokyo, has been exploring creditor-friendly solutions to the Mt. Gox problem for some time and strongly favours a debt-equity swap solution.  Kelman is not representing OKCoin in an official capacity, but spoke on behalf of its plan during the hangout, after speaking to associated people both in China and Japan.  He did reveal some basic details of the OKCoin group's plan, though, which would probably involve at least a $1m injection of capital and the selling of shares in the new entity to raise more capital.  Chinese interest  He mentioned that OKCoin's interest in forming a recovery plan came from Chinese expats living in Tokyo and CEO Xu, all of whom had lost substantial amounts of bitcoin when Gox collapsed.  The company had not known a rehabilitation was even possible before Sunlot's original plan was revealed, he added. Xu then realized his expertise at operating a stable bitcoin exchange, plus OKCoin's existing technology and security standards, could be beneficial to an alternative campaign.  Some participants in the hangout were enthusiastic about the thought of a 'Chinese-Western' joint venture for the good of bitcoin, saying the Mandarin and English-speaking economies (mainly the US) have been bitcoin's prime movers so far.  ""I agree completely. Bitcoin is a worldwide phenomenon, and very much a phenomenon of the English speaking and Chinese speaking worlds [...] And it would be great to see an exchange that could merge those two. I think that would make it very successful also,"" said Kelman.  Creditor caution  Sunlot came under fire on bitcoin-related Internet forums like bitcointalk and reddit for various reasons, but raised eyebrows over an initial plan that appeared to use existing Gox funds to conduct its investigation and pay management fees.  The funds belonged to creditors and should not be touched by outsiders before a rescue plan succeeded, former customers complained.  Sunlot then revised its plan to include a greater injection of its own investors' equity and offered creditors a 16.5% equity stake in a revived entity.  Other objections  Sunlot has been criticised both for being an 'outsider', a company with no previous bitcoin exchange experience, but also for having 'insider' connections, due to the involvement of two of its investors in prior Mt. Gox acquisition and joint venture attempts, one of which was over a year ago.  The company's CEO, John Betts, took the opportunity in the meeting to defend his team's credibility and warn critics against making claims without evidence, saying:  ""Making libellous claims about intentions about people through misinformation and leaked information, rumors and hearsay is not constructive to this.""  He said his team's offer of 1 BTC to buy Mt. Gox was twofold: it evoked the disgrace of previous finance industry collapses such as rogue trader Nick Leeson's Barings Bank (sold to ING for £1), and prevented significant sums of money from flowing to Mark Karpeles, the owner.  The small sum should not be taken as a lack of Sunlot's commitment, he explained.  SaveGox/Sunlot also stated on its extensive FAQ page that it has reached out to OKCoin's team to express an interest in co-operation, though the tone of discussion on the hangout suggests they still have some issues to iron out.  The team claims to have the backing of at least 66% of Mt. Gox creditors after US class action lawyer Jay Edelson (representing the creditors) agreed to its revised plan as part of his clients' settlement.  Seeking justice  Olivier Janssens, the entrepreneur and bitcoin early adopter who lost $5m worth of bitcoins in the Gox collapse, set up the site mtgoxrecovery.com. Initially set up to seek potential recovery plans, it now invites visitors to build a database of customers who lost money and asks if they would be interested in joining any formal legal action.  Janssens admits his campaign is not actually a plan, but instead seeks justice for customers and Mt. Gox management, by supporting whoever is best equipped to deliver that result.  That justice, he indicated, would involve not only a reasonable chance of Mt. Gox's existing bitcoins being returned to customers as bitcoins, but also Mark Karpeles facing criminal or civil action for his part in the whole affair.  Online chat logs reveal Janssens is furious at Karpeles over his actions in the weeks surrounding Mt. Gox's collapse.  He said he would favour liquidation if it would return some funds to investors, rather than entrusting Mt. Gox's fate to a new and unknown company. Sceptical of Sunlot's plan and the motives behind it, Janssens said Sunlot had operated behind everyone's back, only revealing its plans after they were leaked.  Bitcoiners bitten before  Janssens explained that trust levels in the bitcoin community were extremely low after numerous thefts and scams at exchanges, and that users were naturally suspicious of any newcomers unless they could prove their level of commitment and be prepared to back it up with legally binding contracts.  He added that, although it was not his intention to do so, he would be prepared to contribute the $5m he lost in the Mt. Gox closure simply to find out what happened.

42425719,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfj3h,1401697990,BTC-e MetaTrader Now Offers Multi-Currency Accounts,"Popular exchange BTC-e announced improvements to its advanced trading rules yesterday, launching 'Multi-Currency MetaTrader accounts' via the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) terminal.  The change allows users to hold multiple MT4 trading accounts denominated in bitcoin, litecoin, and namecoin, plus the exchange's most popular fiat currencies: EUR (euro), GBP (pounds sterling), RUR (Russian ruble) and CNH (Chinese yuan).  All MT4 account holders will now have the same benefits as those denominated in USD, as long as they define one of the seven currencies above as the account's 'base asset' to show balance, profit and other parameters.  No conversion fees  Previously, users had to convert amounts in those currencies (or others traded on BTC-e) into USD before transferring to MT4, incurring conversion fees.  They may now also deposit, trade and withdraw in those base asset currencies with only ""minimal desposit/withdrawal commissions"".  Users can now use their preferred fiat or digital currency as the base asset. The unlimited account rule, however, means there is no need to commit to just one.  BTC-e says  users can setup MT4 accounts by clicking on the 'MetaTrader' tab on their BTC-e personal profile pages, and selecting a currency.  MetaTrader 4  MetaTrader 4  , developed by MetaQuotes Software, is one of the world's most popular trading platforms for online forex trading. Users install the client software locally, while the server backend is provided by the broker, in this case BTC-e.  Targeted at expert traders, MT4 gives users better access to live streaming charts, plus advanced analytical tools. It further features nine timeframes for each financial instrument, providing detailed analysis of quote dynamics.  Multiple built-in indicators help simplify the analysis, allowing traders to determine trends, define shapes, and set entry and exit points. It also enables one object to be applied over another for comparative analysis, and can also print charts of any instruments for those who prefer paper.  BTC-e introduced MetaTrader 4 to its users in November last year. The platform also provides versions for mobile devices running iOS and Android.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/02/btc-e-metatrader-now-offers-multi-currency-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8dd40226138880ac79be6b49148bd6046873fe6-1000x742.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
