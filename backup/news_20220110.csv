13221424,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=480759,1641859163,Is The Bitcoin Hashrate Recovering From Kazakhstan’s Crisis? Fear Abides,"As the government of Kazakhstan claims the country&apos;s power services are stabilizing, thus the Bitcoin hashrate could be on its way to recovery. However, is the situation stable enough for Bitcoin mining yet? Will it ever be? A Recap Just a few days after the Bitcoin hashrate reached an All-Time High, thus recovering from the China ban on crypto mining, another authoritarian crisis hit the bitcoin mining industry in Kazakhstan, taking the hash to drop 15% in 10 days. The country has been the second-largest bitcoin mining spot (after the U.S.) with 18% of the global BTC hashrate ever since China&apos;s miners were forced to find new locations with cheap energy costs. Parallel to the crypto market down movement, on Friday 7th the price of BTC dropped to $41,000 while the coin&apos;s mining in Kazakhstan went dark as the government forced a power and internet shutdown to gain control over raising protests, which had turned violent. The protestors were reportedly voicing their anger toward new high fuel costs. The news has been reported everywhere without complete certainty of what&apos;s happening. Borders, the internet, and other means of communication were blocked, so the information doesn&apos;t reach the world so easily. The latest reports had shown that the uprising has been tamed as Russia&apos;s President Putin stood proudly as the military ally who sent paratroopers last week.

42375540,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8hdx,1641857436,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Below $40K Before Regaining Ground; Altcoins Fall,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin fell below $40,000 briefly as U.S. stocks continued to drop thanks to a newly hawkish Federal Reserve.  Technician’s take: BTC buyers could respond to short-term oversold signals, although upside appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,797 -0.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,077 -2.6%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,670 -0.1%  DJIA: $36,068 -0.4%  Nasdaq: $14,942 +0.05%  Gold: $1,801 +0.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin fell again on Monday during U.S. trading hours after a small recovery over the weekend. The bearish price move came after U.S. stock market losses deepened as investors brace for actions from a more hawkish Federal Reserve.  The most valued cryptocurrency fell below $40,000 briefly in early hours before it moved back above $41,000. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at over $41,500, down about 1% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Last week, prices of the oldest cryptocurrency fell for six straight days after Fed minutes revealed policymakers had discussed aggressive interest rate hikes alongside a faster pace to normalize its balance sheet.  “The tightening of financial conditions is expected to negatively impact risk assets such as equities and crypto as they become less attractive than safe-haven bonds,” crypto trading data firm Kaiko wrote in its weekly newsletter on Monday.  According to Kaiko, the impact of the Fed’s December meeting has sent the correlation between bitcoin and traditional assets to the highest in more than a year.  “The Federal Reserve’s December meeting had a strong impact on global financial markets, with traders reacting swiftly to the prospect of monetary tightening,” Kaiko wrote. “During the volatility, bitcoin behaved strongly like a risk asset.”  Following bitcoin, most of the major cryptocurrencies were also in the red on Monday. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, plummeted below $3,000 at one point before it returned above $3,000.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Stabilized Above $40K Support; Resistance Near $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) selling pressure is starting to wane after last week’s price dip. The cryptocurrency is holding short-term support at around $40,000, although upside appears to be limited near $43,000-$45,000.  BTC was down about 2% over the past 24 hours, although the price action has been fairly muted over the past few days.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is rising from oversold levels, which typically precedes a brief price bounce. On the daily chart, the RSI is the most oversold since Dec. 10.  Upside momentum has weakened given BTC’s two-month long downtrend. This means sellers could remain active around resistance levels.

13221425,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=480717,1641855601,Bitcoin Discount? Peter Brandt On Why You Shouldn’t Buy The Dip,"Bitcoin has been dropping consistently for the past week and the crypto market has lost over $500 billion following this dip. Like with any crash, there have been the expected calls of &apos;buy the dip&apos; from investors who believe that the dips are only temporary and that the digital asset will soon recover all of its lost value. While this advice is sometimes sound, there is no doubt that there are some drawbacks with it, which could range from adding to a losing position that ends up losing more, to sinking more money in projects that may already be doomed to fail. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has addressed these calls of &apos;buy the dip&apos;, explaining why investors should not follow it. Related Reading | Melania Trump Congratulates Bitcoin On 13th Anniversary Of Bitcoin Genesis Block You Could Lose More Money Famed trader Peter Brandt responded to a tweet from CEO of Vailshire Capital, Jeff Ross, saying that the price dips that are being experienced by bitcoin presented an opportunity for long-term traders to increase their holdings. Brandt&apos;s tweet was vehemently against this school of thought, proposing instead &apos;a sacred trading rule&apos; for investors during times like these. The veteran trader compared the current movement of bitcoin to the Silver $SI_F of 1980, which had grown to its $50 top after a massive run.

42411579,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsyG,1641850490,How DAOs Will Transform the Customer Experience,"Customers don’t always behave they way companies expect them to, especially when they take their user behavior to extremes.  Promising unlimited data for your phone will help you sell a lot of phone contracts, but what happens when if you use 64GB of roaming data in Brazil? The answer, I learned, is that you get disconnected.  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have the potential to change how organizations and marketplaces work by requiring market participants to take a financial stake in the ecosystem as a whole, and put that asset at risk for bad behavior. When you’re both the customer and the owner, your behavior is likely to be different.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  A good example of this is the business of selling customer data. DAOs should be able to do this as well, but in these cases with a much more transparent process for approving a privacy policy and where the benefits of those data sales flows back to stakeholders, who are also the customers who provided the data in the first place. Most business models prioritize returning the benefits of data monetization to shareholders, and that’s by design. In a DAO, the alignment between customers and stakeholders can be much higher.  In reality, DAOs are likely to suffer from some of the same principal-agent problems that exist in the traditional world. In theory, customers can buy stock in a company and participate in the benefits that come from making use of their data as well. They can also vote out the management team. In practice, this rarely happens.  Read more: Paul Brody - Choosing Who We Trust  And, if we’re not careful, DAOs could end up like this, too. But we’re early enough in the era of DAO development that we have the opportunity to experiment with the technology.  I see three big opportunities with DAOs to avoid simply re-creating the corporate model.  The first involves sustaining much more of an open contributor model with a relatively smaller entrenched management team. Because most DAOs operate as digital organizations built on open-source code, improvements are often based on code and they can be suggested by anyone and voted on widely. The results will also then be visible in the performance of the ecosystem.  The second opportunity comes from implementing privacy in voting while limiting that process to verified stakeholders. Thanks to tools like zero-knowledge proofs, we can now build voting models for DAOs that do not have a risk of becoming a popularity contest. The first DAOs to make use of this technology are being developed now.  Lastly, we can use smart contracts to enable delegated voting rights. This is going to be enormously important because it will allow stakeholders to be efficient in their operations. Most shareholders and fund managers don’t vote on many corporate initiatives because they can’t keep track of them.  I have many of my personal assets in S&P 500 index funds. That’s 500 companies to track, which is impossible even for a full-time financial analyst. Smart contracts could allow me to delegate my voting rights to industry professionals who track particular sectors or topics, like data privacy.  Read more: Alyssa Hertig - What Is a DAO?  Andreessen Horowitz, a top venture capital firm that has invested heavily in Web 3, recently delegated many voting rights across a range of entities with which it is involved including non-profits, universities, startups that use these ecosystems and other crypto community leaders.  These entities don’t have any obligation to prioritize returns to the venture capitalists, but they are expected to constructively contribute to the success of the ecosystem as a whole. In this model, design points that prioritize the health of the ecosystem as a whole – rather than the returns to a particular group of powerful stakeholders – are likely to be successful.  The simplest business models are the easiest to run, but ecosystems are the future of the technology business. They are also complicated and delicate and, as we keep seeing, large companies, with their focus on shareholder returns above all else, find that balancing act difficult to sustain. Simpler is always easier, but if we’re going to have complexity, perhaps it will work out better as a DAO.

42411571,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsl2,1641850086,Is Moxie Marlinspike Right About Web 3?,"“Web 3″ isn’t all that easy to critique, since it tends to mean different things to different people.  Critiques abound, each with slightly different operating definitions of the term, but it’s rare to encounter one with the kind of technical depth you might expect from a crypto developer – someone who’s played around with the code and gotten a feel for how these systems really work.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Late last week, the cryptographer and privacy expert Moxie Marlinspike, who is best known for creating the encrypted messaging service Signal, released a longish essay on the current state of “Web 3″ and the ways in which utopian rhetoric around cryptocurrencies tends to obscure the technical realities of the blockchain-backed internet as it exists today.  For Marlinspike, “Web 3″ is a decentralized internet backed by blockchains and cryptocurrencies. If “Web 2″ is the internet as we know it today, where companies like Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft provide the back-end tools for users to make their own websites (i.e. cloud computing structures and rentable servers), then “Web 3″ should be an internet built on public blockchains, without centralized corporate mediators.  But as Marlinspike points out, that’s not how the crypto ecosystem is developing in practice.  Because most personal computers aren’t running a node, and therefore don’t maintain a whole copy of the blockchain locally, they need another way of accessing the data on the ledger. Enter application programming interfaces (APIs): code libraries that offer handy shortcuts for pulling data from a given blockchain.  Infura, a product of the blockchain software giant ConsenSys, and Alchemy, a startup recently valued at $3.5 billion, are the two main purveyors of these APIs, as Marlinspike points out. So-called “decentralized applications,” or “dapps,” like Mirror, OpenSea and Zora rely on those systems to retrieve data from public blockchains – sort of like middlemen.  That is true for most sites that ask you to log in with a “connect wallet” button as opposed to a username and password, and for online wallets like MetaMask, which exist as both dedicated websites and add-on extensions for internet browsers. They live on the centralized internet we’re already used to.  Here’s what Marlinspike has to say about MetaMask’s reliance on APIs from private companies:  “A wallet like MetaMask needs to do basic things like display your balance, your recent transactions and your non-fungible tokens, as well as more complex things like constructing transactions, interacting with smart contracts, etc. In short, MetaMask needs to interact with the blockchain, but the blockchain has been built such that clients like MetaMask can’t interact with it. MetaMask accomplishes this by making API calls to three companies that have consolidated in this space.”  Those three companies are Etherscan, now the leading explorer service for perusing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain; Infura, which offers a shortcut for accessing a wallet’s balance; and OpenSea, which provides a list of the wallet’s NFTs. (Though Etherscan is considered a “public good” in the crypto sphere, it’s a Malaysian company that happens to be backed by Digital Currency Group, which also funds CoinDesk.)  Here’s that command in MetaMask’s source code, which Marlinspike reproduces in his piece:  GET https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=account&address=[PASTE YOUR ETH ADDRESS HERE]&offset=40&order=desc&action=txlist&tag=latest&page=1 HTTP/2.0  Whatever Etherscan coughs up is then plugged into MetaMask. That isn’t a problem as long as Etherscan – a centralized service from a private company – is behaving correctly. It’s another step in the process, one without which MetaMask wouldn’t function.  The same goes for OpenSea. To prove his point, Marlinspike minted an NFT that displays a different image depending on the server you view it from. For some reason – Marlinspike said he never learned why – OpenSea took it down.  OpenSea, a multibillion dollar private company, is within its rights to take down images, and does so fairly often. The issue is that MetaMask, purportedly a non-custodial, censorship-resistant wallet controlled by its users, stopped displaying the NFT, too. The token was still on the blockchain, but MetaMask was scanning data only from OpenSea, as opposed to the blockchain itself. And because it’s built to operate without a working node, MetaMask can’t pull the data directly from Ethereum.  This is all a very technical way of looking at a larger-scale issue with the state of crypto infrastructure in 2022. What does it mean for an application to be truly decentralized? Maybe the benefits of crypto are such that mainstream users won’t care whether a few large companies end up playing this crucial role in the data pipeline. But the reality is that the market is already somewhat consolidated, just like “Web 2.”  Vitalik Buterin, one of the inventors of Ethereum, responded to Marlinspike on Reddit, essentially conceding many of these points. “Moxie’s critiques in the second half of the post strike me as having a correct criticism of the current state of the ecosystem… but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going,” he wrote.  Marlinspike anticipated that response.  “Even if this is just the beginning (and it very well might be!),” reads Marlinspike’s blog post, “I’m not sure we should consider that any consolation. I think the opposite might be true; it seems like we should take notice that from the very beginning, these technologies immediately tended towards centralization through platforms in order for them to be realized, that this has ~zero negatively felt effect on the velocity of the ecosystem, and that most participants don’t even know or care it’s happening.”  See also: What Jack Dorsey’s Beef With ‘Web 3′ Is Really About | Opinion  On Twitter, Jake Brukhman, the founder of a crypto investment firm called CoinFund, made the bold claim that “Web 3 is in its early stages, it is not built or adopted yet.” Which is to say, the real promise of Web 3 is in the idea that you can run your own node. Even if consumers don’t want to, or don’t even know what a node is, argues Brukhman, it’s the potential that matters.  That’s the thing with crypto: It’s always arriving. Although the total market was worth some $3 trillion as recently as November, we’re still working out what it’s good for, what problems it actually solves for a mainstream audience.  There’s enough money and development going into these systems that it’s not unreasonable to expect certain aspects of the space could become more decentralized over time, as Buterin and Brukhman predict. But there’s also a huge amount of money to be gained by staking a centralized claim in the new internet, selling the vision of trustless computing from a venture capital-backed private company.  If Buterin is right, Web 3 could offer something genuinely new. Otherwise, it risks enshrining the very power dynamics it’s always tried to escape.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/10/is-moxie-marlinspike-right-about-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dcf4cfdec1bc7c18f8cd629b1b3f32584d3c8ea-3640x2760.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8haB,1641849158,Market Wrap: Traders Brace for Higher Volatility; Altcoins Underperform,"Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Monday, although selling pressure appears to be slowing compared to last week. Bitcoin was down about 2% over the past 24 hours, compared to a 3% decline in ether and a 6% drop in Solana’s SOL token.  The underperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on Monday suggests traders are still being cautious. Altcoins tend to decline more than bitcoin during market downturns due to their higher risk profile.  The latest price declines resulted in losses for some leveraged traders. For example, more than 109,000 traders were hit with liquidations over the past 24 hours as bitcoin dipped below $40,000 on Monday for the first time since September.  “The volatility markets do not seem to be reflecting “extreme fear,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement on Monday. “In fact, over Friday and the weekend, our volatility desk saw large call buying interest especially in both BTC and ETH,” QCP wrote.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,714, -1.77%  Ether (ETH): $3,082, -3.60%  S&P 500: $4,670, -0.14%  Gold: $1,800, +0.18%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.77%  Record crypto fund outflows  As crypto prices fall, fund investors remain bearish. Record weekly outflows from digital asset investment products totaled $207 million in the seven days through Jan. 7.  The spate of redemptions adds to pressure on the market that began in mid-December, bringing the four-week outflow total to $465 million, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported.  Investment funds focused on bitcoin saw outflows of $107 million, while ether-focused funds saw outflows of $39 million last week, bringing the last four-week run of outflows to $180 million.  Altcoin roundup  Avalanche, polygon limited price bounce: Avalanche (AVAX) and polygon (MATIC) initially rose about 4% during the Asia trading session, but ended up lower over the past 24 hours. Generally, most altcoins underperformed bitcoin on Monday, indicating a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.

Liquidations in the crypto market happen when a trader has insufficient funds to fund a margin call – or a call for extra collateral demanded by the exchange to keep the trading position funded. They’re especially common in high-risk trading due to the high volatility of assets. It occurs in both margins and futures trading.  On Monday, bitcoin fell to a three-month low, hitting $39,692.03 after the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw a steady decline, possibly caused by speculation that the Federal Reserve could move quickly to tighten monetary conditions in the face of fast-rising inflation.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Helene Braun, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/10/crypto-traders-see-343m-of-liquidations-as-bitcoin-dips-below-40k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10f17b5086afeaf2d312db8ee8a1c6b6b4f4dc8a-1500x945.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This could mean that a short squeeze may be coming soon. Bitcoin Open Interest Rises Despite Decline In Price As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has shown uptrend over the past month, despite the price of the crypto moving down. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are currently open in the market. When the value of the metric moves up, it means more investors are opening long or short contracts on derivative exchanges. This may mean that leverage is going up in the market, and thus such a trend can lead to higher volatility in the price of the crypto. On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests holders have started to close their positions. A plunge in the indicator happens when Bitcoin makes a strong price swing, forcing mass liquidations of the contracts. Such liquidations cascade together and amplify the price move. This event is called a long or short squeeze, depending on which contracts make up the majority.

Now add National Football League (NFL) star Dez Bryant and his stats to the mix.  The former all-pro wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys is tapping oracle platform Chainlink to bring “dynamic” NFTs to Personal Corner, a platform Bryant founded to help athletes build virtual brands after a video game epiphany in 2016.  “I was sitting back playing [NBA 2K], thinking, ‘Man, you can buy your player their own digital clothes, shoes, everything,” Bryant told CoinDesk in an interview. “I thought, what if athletes could offer something like this to their fans for them to own. We’ve been on a mission ever since.”  Dynamic NFTs use Chainlink data feeds to change their appearance, in this case according to player performance. So if a player reached a milestone for touchdowns or receiving yards, for example, the NFT could adapt to reflect the progress.  This isn’t the first time a high-profile athlete has turned to the technology to add some flair to tokens – National Basketball Association phenom LaMelo Ball tapped Chainlink in June for his debut NFT collection released before his Rookie of the Year nod.

Bitcoin’s outflows were a “direct response” to the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting published last week that revealed concerns over rising inflation – and the resulting fear among investors that the central bank might move quickly to tighten monetary conditions.  Many investors and analysts say bitcoin has benefited from the ultra-loose monetary policies in place since the coronavirus hit in March 2020.  CoinShares noted that over the last four weeks, crypto investment products have represented up to 25% of total bitcoin trading turnover, highlighting greater investor activity than usual.

Miller, who gained fame for beating the S&P 500 index for a record-breaking 15 years in a row from 1991-2005 as a fund manager at Legg Mason, has previously invested heavily in bitcoin in funds that he managed, but his revelation about his personal portfolio was new.  Miller said he personally started buying bitcoin at around $200 in 2014 after hearing a talk by Wences Casares, known as the “Patient Zero” of bitcoin for introducing it to Silicon Valley circles, at the annual Sun Valley media and tech conference.  He bought some more bitcoin over time, but then didn’t buy it for years, until last year when the price hit new highs and then started to fall sharply, and he thought it was a good time to buy the dip. Miller started buying again at $30,000, down from its high of just under $69,000, reasoning that there were a lot more people using it, not to mention that venture capitalists and others were investing in it.  Miller noted that a part of his personal bitcoin investments was in companies tied closely to its price, such as bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital (SDIG) and software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet.  Miller said he thinks bitcoin is best thought of as “digital gold” with a strictly limited supply and that he’s only recently allowed himself to be called a “bitcoin bull” rather than just a “bitcoin observer” because he feels that it’s now developed into a game-changing technology.  Despite his own heavily concentrated position, Miller’s advice for average investors is to put 1% of their net worth in bitcoin, reasoning that “if you put 1% of your portfolio in it for diversification, even if it goes to zero, which I think is highly improbable, but of course possible, you can always afford to lose 1%.”  His main rationale for that advice is that bitcoin represents a unique investment.  “I think the average investor should ask himself or herself, what do you have in your portfolio that has that kind of track record – number one, is very, very under-penetrated; can provide a service of insurance against financial catastrophe that no one else can provide and can go up 10 times or 50 times? The answer is: nothing.”  Meanwhile, despite how well Miller's personal investments have performed (he said the other 50% of his portfolio is in Amazon stock), his funds have not done anywhere near as well. Miller Opportunity Trust, the $2.2 billion fund that he's the co-manager of, fell about 3% in 2021 compared to a roughly 27% gain for the S&P 500.

42387566,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOGCAA,1641837633,Polygon Stakes Claim to Fastest Zero-Knowledge Layer 2 With ‘Plonky2’ Launch,"In a blog post Monday, Polygon made some audacious claims about having set new speed and scalability milestones with its “Plonky2″ technology in what may be a possible breakthrough for Ethereum throughput.  “Plonky2 is a recursive SNARK that is 100x faster than existing alternatives and natively compatible with Ethereum,” the Polygon team wrote in the blog. “It combines PLONK and FRI for the best of STARKs, with fast proofs and no trusted setup, and the best of SNARKs, with support for recursion and low verification cost on Ethereum.”  SNARK refers to “succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,” a type of cryptographic proof that proves the veracity of data without revealing the contents of that data. STARK refers “scalable transparent arguments of knowledge,” another type of so-called ZK, or “zero knowledge,” cryptographic technology.  The announcement comes on the heels of a series of acquisitions from Polygon in recent months. In December, the project announced it had bought the blockchain scaling development team Mir Protocol for $400 million, and the Mir team has since been rebranded to Polygon Zero.  Read more: Polygon Acquires Ethereum Scaling Startup Mir for $400M  In an interview with CoinDesk, Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic said that an early demonstration of Plonky2 was among the reasons the project made the deal.  Bjelic described ZK-proof layer 2s as a key method for adding transaction volume capacity to blockchains.  “In layer 2, you have batches of transactions, and the whole point is adding throughput. You process the transactions in layer 2, and create a proof that those transactions were executed correctly and post that proof on Ethereum,” he said.  Current ZK options include Loopring, Starkware and Matter Labs’ zkSync, among others, but Bjelic claims that one of Polygon Zero’s major breakthroughs is that it can verify complex transactions, such as Ethereum smart contract interactions.  “We’ve had ZK-proofs for some time, but what we haven’t had is a way to prove Ethereum transactions, which are complex. It wasn’t possible to build a layer 2 that supports these transactions, which might have a flash loan, an arbitrage trade, a swap, all in one transaction.

When bitcoin’s price continues to drop, smaller miners with higher electricity costs often reduce their operations, which will probably help publicly listed North American miners pick up “meaningful” market share, analyst Jonathan Petersen said in a note.  “A slower growth trajectory for BTC price should encourage fewer new entrants to the network than if BTC’s price were to rise rapidly (i.e. 3Q21), allowing existing mining operators to grow their market share more quickly as they deploy additional ASICs,” Petersen wrote, referring to high performance mining computers.  Bitcoin’s price has fallen about 39% since reaching its all-time high in November, while the network’s hashrate has continued its increase, reaching a record above 200 exahash per second (EH/s) on Jan. 1.

Hive’s monthly bitcoin production rose about 12% for December from November to 245 as it expanded its hashing power, even as network difficulty rose by as much as 10%, the company said.  Meanwhile, the miner said its ether output fell by about 7% from November to 2,178, with the network difficulty for ether rising about 2% in December.  Hive’s stock was down more than 5% in early U.S. trading on Monday. Most of its peers were also down as bitcoin and ether prices dropped on Monday.  On Jan. 3, Bitcoin miner Bitfarms and Marathon Digital said they both mined more than 3,000 bitcoins in 2021 and held onto almost all of the mined coins.

42411573,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsux,1641825684,Why We’re Shutting Our Successful Fundraising Platform,"Neufund was a security token company that wanted anyone in the world to invest in any businesses they want.  For decades, investing has been exclusive, inaccessible and unequal. This has contributed to the growing wealth disparity in Europe and the U.S. We wanted to change that.  Today we’re closing Neufund, despite it being successful.  Zoe Adamovicz has co-founded multiple startups. Her most recent venture, Neufund, was a fintech firm for securities tokenization that aimed to democratize access to global innovation capital.  Over the course of Neufund’s life, we transacted about €20 million ($22.6 million) through our equity platform, facilitated entirely through the public Ethereum blockchain. We registered 11,000 investors from 123 countries – an international and diverse crowd with tickets starting from as low as €100 ($113).  Our concept-proving case – Greyp Bikes – made the full cycle, from issuing tokenized shares for retail investors, through corporate governance on blockchain, to the exit to Porsche and proceeds distribution via ERC20 tokens. Effectively, there were never any compliance issues, technical problems or security breaches. An European tech company fundraised through the issuance of securities using a decentralized technology. And more than 1,000 investors from dozens of countries participated. How cool.  Yet, we are closing the Neufund business.  Why? Because today, more than two years after Greyp fundraised, we still are unsure whether regulation allows us to repeat the Greyp fundraising model with other similar companies. Despite engaging with regulators for years, we didn’t manage to get out of the limbo of legal uncertainty.  And, I dare say, no DeFi (decentralized finance) company, aiming for regular investors on a bigger scale, has ever made it so far.  From the inception, we have played it by the book – hiring lawyers, getting licenses, spending bazillions on legal opinions. We were engaging with regulators and governments, in numerous jurisdictions. Yet, all this turned out to be a mistake. Looking for legal approval was a mistake, as was looking for a transparent discussion of merits. The reality was presented to us quite clearly: If you play it according to Hoyle, you’ve lost before you even started.  Here’s what we learned from the experience.  “Blockchain licenses” are useless  Let’s start with “blockchain licenses” issued by reformed, innovative jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Estonia, Gibraltar and so on. They all welcome entrepreneurs with open arms.  So, yes, you can get a Swiss Security Token License, Liechtenstein Token Technology Service Provider License or Malta Virtual Financial Asset License. But the hack is that, despite Europe theoretically having one common market, those licenses are not recognized in other European jurisdictions.  For example, if investors from Germany aim to use your business operating in Liechtenstein under such TTSP license, BaFIN (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Germany’s financial regulator) will claim you’re acting illegally, and will toot warnings of fraud in no time.  This is probably why in Liechtenstein only seven businesses received such licenses over the last two years, out of which two were granted to already licensed, conventional banks (Bank Frick and VP Bank).  Recently, some states became more straightforward about the flaws of their innovative laws. Liechtenstein states on its website: “Registration under the TVTG is effective exclusively in Liechtenstein; passporting according to the model of European financial market laws is therefore not possible.”  Some, like Estonia, simply cancel previously issued licenses – 70% out of 2,000 Estonia virtual asset service provider licenses were revoked in June 2020, and so far no new “blockchain license” has been offered.  Still, all those countries remain very vigorous in promoting themselves as blockchain-friendly. As a result, many entrepreneurs flock to those jurisdictions, while in fact the licenses issued there are useless, and nearly zero business actually gets done.  Legal workarounds, like .org, are ticking bombs  Following the example of Ethereum, many protocol companies registered themselves in Zug, Switzerland as charities. This mask of nonprofit organizations is the reason why we see many blockchain businesses marketing under .org domain, instead of .com. The concept of utility tokens flourished, and initial coin offerings boomed, thereby legally structuring token purchases as donations to the common good of the development of a protocol. It was all possible due to a single hack: Unlike many other countries, Switzerland does not limit the definition of charitable activity to specific domains.  Yet, when it became obvious that the purpose of those projects was commercial rather than philanthropic, the initially lenient Swiss regulator, FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority), cracked down on ICOs and the .org structure. You may ask why Ethereum was barely affected by it. Well, by the time the hunt started, the network was already just too big to scrap.  NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are the new hot carve out, but the next in line for regulatory scrutiny. We can comfortably assume the watchdogs will not qualify as “unique” what issuers deem “unique.” They will rather classify NTF’ed avatars and soccer stars as commodities – and boom! securities law applies. We’ve seen the movie before.  Classical financial licenses are a dead end  Neufund’s experience in Liechtenstein is indicative of how it works when DeFi meets traditional banking laws. Initially, the Financial Market Authority gave us a written confirmation – sometimes called a “nonaction letter” – that the business model of Neufund did not need a financial license. We were told it was not even eligible for such a license. Based on this, we conducted the Greyp fundraise.  After the offering closed, we received a harsh warning from FMA that we were possibly breaking laws and that penalties, including potential criminal offense (yap, that means jail) could apply. We got accused of operating without the necessary financial license.  Confused, we appealed, and soon received a formal apology from some of the country’s highest figures. We also came to a negotiated solution with the FMA and agreed to apply for a traditional “asset manager” license. We all knew it made little sense since the company never managed any assets, yet we somehow had to fit the box.  Money and time went into this, until we received another call from the FMA – after a revision, the regulator concluded again that the Neufund business model is not eligible for a financial license (face palm emoticon here). So the process was halted.  Ever since, we have tried to get clarity as to whether we are legal or illegal, and nobody is able to tell us. The whole dialogue was futile. It fed Liechtenstein’s “progressive state” narrative, with zero business output.  Evading discussion of merits through discrediting blockchain companies, is regulators’ common posterior protection tactics  Did you know that most regulators, in particular Germany’s BaFIN, maintain a policy not to issue greenlights on crypto and other fintech startups? They only issue red lights, and then only after you have already started the business activity.  Those red lights are direct injunctions, or, in their mildest, yet popular version, known as public warnings. They are semiofficial – a form of a watchdog’s “blog,” an arena for publicly tooting regulator’s suspicions of whatever business, and where no supporting evidence is neither published nor required.  Often those warnings read like this: “BaFIN has sufficient grounds to suspect that CompanyX offers product Y without required licenses.”  Frequently, the alleged offender learns about receiving such a warning only from the internet, left without any means to discuss or dispute. Their effect is that they label the project as a possible fraudulent activity, which has the potential to ruin the business’ reputation or damage its financing round. And there is barely any process to appeal or make them disappear from the internet.  The whole system is designed to make any attempt at a discussion of substance extremely difficult, while at the same time shielding the regulator from any responsibility, in case a fraud actually happens.  So, how do we build legal DeFi businesses?  Well, you can’t. There is no European law to refer to, and no regulator to take a stand. Instead, there is a system of policies built of red lights and glass walls, in which a good-willed founder has no means to get clarity as to what he or she is actually allowed to do.  For DeFi founders who want to stay in the game, the only chance is to fly below regulators’ radar, until the business becomes too entrenched to do away with. Don’t waste money on legal opinions, which regulators don’t have any obligation to respect, and often just ignore. Don’t participate in any debates, regulation innovation councils or government advisory groups.  Be uncharismatic and unattractive. And while appearing colorless, build your customers outside of places frequented by the finance folk.  And if you do it right and for long enough, like Ethereum or Binance, you might become too deep-rooted to dispose of. In the current regulatory environment, it is the best chance for blockchain companies to succeed. We did it differently. We tried to do it “right.” And therefore, now, we have to close.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Zoe Adamovicz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/10/why-were-shutting-our-successful-fundraising-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd13e5ac4d6826046e03a2a6b5d03780a5d7cb49-6240x4160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FIA’s Cyber Crime unit sent a notice to Binance Holdings Ltd. in the Cayman Islands and Binance.US and issued an order of attendance to Humza Khan, the general manager/growth analyst at Binance Pakistan, “to explain his position on the linkage of fraudulent online investment mobile applications with Binance,” the unit’s head, Imran Riaz, tweeted on Jan 7.  The suspected scam involved 11 mobile applications, 26 wallets and several thousand investors. On Dec. 20, 2021, “people from all over Pakistan” contacted the agency that the apps had “stopped working over a period of time,” defrauding “Pakistani people of billions of rupees,” according to a statement posted by Riaz.  “We are working with the Federal Investigation Agency to resolve these issues,” Binance said in tweet.  Investors had been asked to register on Binance and then transfer money from their accounts to the mobile applications. At the same time, a Telegram group was set up where “so-called expert betting signals, on the rise and fall of Bitcoin, were given by the anonymous owner of the application and admins of the Telegram group. Once considerable capital was created the apps crashed and thousands lost their money.”  The reported range of investment was $100 to $80,000, with an estimated average of $2,000 per person, taking the total amount of the suspected scam to nearly $100 million. The apps were identified as MCX, HFC, HTFOX, FXCOPY, OKIMINI, BB001, AVG86C, BX66, UG, TASKTOK and 91fp.

Bitcoin (BTC) held on to its $41,000 support level after last week’s sell-off, which was spurred by the release of the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s December 2021 meeting. The minutes of the meeting suggested the Fed will end its record asset-purchase program and will likely hike interest rates at a faster pace.  Avalanche (AVAX) and polygon (MATIC) rose 4% in the past 24 hours to post the largest gains among major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 0.4% and ethereum (ETH) rose 0.5% in the same period.  AVAX reached as high as $92 in early Asian hours on Monday before traders took profits to bring to it $88 at the time of writing. AVAX was trading near its major support level of $85, with a drop to $80 should that level not hold.  Other major cryptocurrencies also saw nominal losses. In the past 24 hours, Binance coin (BNB) declined 0.5%, Polkadot and Solana lost 0.6%, Cardano was down 0.8%, and XRP fell 1.2%, leading the losses among major cryptos.  Meanwhile, compound ether (cETH) emerged as the biggest gainer among all cryptocurrencies valued over $1 billion by market capitalization, data from CoinGecko showed, rising over 8.2% in the past 24 hours.  cETH represents a stake in Ethereum-based lending tool Compound Finance, allowing users to lend ETH and accrue interest on the protocol. However, Compound’s COMP governance token – which allows users to take part in platform decisions – lost 4.3% of its value in the past 24 hours.

Between Jan. 5 and 6, the hashrate of top mining pools fell by 11% as Kazakhstan’s internet went dark. Today, the loss had narrowed to around 2.2%, according to data from mining pool BTC.com analyzed by CoinDesk.  Kazakhstan is the world’s second-largest bitcoin miner. It accounts for about one-fifth of the global total and is surpassed only by the U.S. The country has been rocked by civil unrest in the past week, set off by a spike in energy prices. The protests left 164 people dead and nearly 8,000 detained. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called the protests an act of “terrorist aggression.”  The situation is “almost resolved” and crypto mining data centers are back, Alan Dordjiev, head of the Kazakh National Association of Blockchain and Data Center Industry, told CoinDesk on Monday.  Internet connectivity is largely restored throughout the country, Dordjiev said. Interruptions are still taking place in Almaty, the country’s largest city and former capital, where protests raged over the last week, but crypto mining regions are “totally fine,” he said.  Internet watchdog NetBlocks said last week that the fact that multiple providers lost connectivity simultaneously “indicates a centralized kill-switch.”  It’s hard to know how long the internet will continue to operate. The country’s internet has been restored several times over the past few days, but these moments are “brief and unpredictable, affecting different providers and regions at different times,” NetBlocks founder Alp Toker told CoinDesk. Beyond implications for human rights, the intermittent network “can’t reliably support cryptocurrency mining,” Toker said.  Kazakhstan-based miners have been facing electricity restrictions since September as the country’s national grid struggled to keep up with increased demand. Some miners have been looking overseas to expand their capacity.

42387547,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOGC0y,1641812941,Cardano Reaches Goal of Planting 1M Trees,"A restoration effort using the Cardano blockchain reached its first goal of planting over 1 million trees, the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit that oversees developments on the Cardano network, said over the weekend.  “The Cardano Forest is 100% funded, we’ve reached the 1 million trees milestone. All trees planted will be recorded on the Cardano blockchain for enhanced transparency and serve as public proof of land restoration activities,” Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard said in a tweet thread.  The foundation has partnered with crypto startup Veritree for the planting effort. Veritree uses blockchain technology to record the supply chain of tree plantations for its users, allowing for a verifiable tracking of such activities.  Veritree plants a tree each time Cardano’s ADA currency is exchanged for a TREE token. TREE, in turn, can be redeemed for digital trees and non-fungible tokens (NFT) during certain “redemption days,” with the rarity of the issued NFTs based on the initial amount of ADA exchanged.  NFTs are digital assets that can represent ownership of unique tangible and intangible items on a blockchain.  Transactional data shows large amounts of ADA were bestowed towards the effort. One wallet exchanged 100,000 ADA for 100,000 TREE tokens – worth over $118,000 at the time of writing – to become the biggest donor for the cause. Other large donors exchanged amounts ranging from 5,000 ADA (≈$5,900 at press time) to 87,500 ADA (≈$103,900 at press time).  Why plant trees?  The Cardano Forest activity is part of a broader effort by Cardano to become a climate-positive blockchain.  Blockchain technology has been the subject of massive criticism in recent years about the blockchain’s environmental impact. Blockchains run on a global network of users or organizations that use their computing resources – by either staking crypto or running mining rigs – to validate data and process transactions on that network.  Mining, in particular, consists of specialized computing systems that solve millions of calculations each second to “win” blocks, using huge amounts of electricity to keep running. Such usage of computing resources is deemed unnecessary by critics, who say the large electricity requirements damage the environment.  Newer blockchains like Cosmos, Terra and Cardano run on a proof-of-stake concept that relies on network “stakers” who lock up their tokens on public nodes to maintain the blockchain. This is said to be more environmentally friendly than mining.  Planting trees is a step in an environmentally friendly direction. The ethos is simple: The creation of more trees can, in theory, offset the damage done by human activity in other parts of the world.  Cardano Foundation and Veritree did not return requests for comment at press time.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/10/cardano-reaches-goal-of-planting-1m-trees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1e6cc1739b975e3be1a213b9e50171b350f8371-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 sidechain for Ethereum, backed by Binance and Coinbase. The goal of the project is to encourage widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies through solving the issue of scaling on a wide range of blockchains. Polygon is a combination of the Plasma Framework with the proof of stake blockchain. The Plasma framework utilized in the network was developed by the founder and co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. It allows for the quick execution of scalable and self-contained smart contracts. Let us move ahead to read about MATIC technical analysis. Past Performance of MATIC The MATIC coin price shows a sudden increase in buying pressure as it approaches the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. The coin price increased more than 10% in the last 48 hours. However, the fall of 15% in the intraday trading volume shows a lack of bullish commitment.

However, the bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart does increase the chances of an upside breakout.

According to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, CZ&apos;s net worth stands at $96 billion, surpassing even that of Asia&apos;s richest person, Mr. Mukesh Ambani. Bloomberg estimated Zhao&apos;s wealth based on his stake in Binance which he owns upto 90 percent of the company&apos;s shares. While much is not known about the finances of Binance as the company doesn&apos;t disclose its financial results, the trading platform processes as much as $170 billion of crypto tradings per day. In 2021 alone, the company generated a revenue of $20 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis of its trading volume and fees. That is almost triple what a Wall Street analysts estimated for rival crypto exchange Coinbase will generate for 2021. However, Zhao&apos;s personal fortune could be even bigger than that, since his wealth estimate does not take into account his cryptocurrency holdings which include Bitcoin, and Binance&apos;s BNB cryptocurrency which soared to roughly 1,300 percent last year. In fact, he told the Associated Press last November that his personal holdings make up the &apos;majority&apos; of his net worth. Before accounting for his crypto holdings, Zhao&apos;s $96 billion net worth makes him the world&apos;s 11th richest person, according to Bloomberg.

The downfall has seen a reduction in price of 55% from the pattern inception on 16th August 2021. Currently, the coin price rests close to the horizontal level at $200. The breakout of this level will lead to the downfall to the support trendline.

Cryptocurrencies gained importance when the economy worsened and uncertainty increased. Long-term crypto holders viewed staking as a way to earn rewards instead of merely keeping their coins in their wallets. Staking is an intriguing method to contribute to the security and efficiency of blockchain initiatives while simultaneously earning passive revenue. Consequently, the blockchain is more secure and can handle more transactions. Let&apos;s check out five staking tokens worth investing in this year. Terra (LUNA) According to industry statistics, Terra (LUNA) reached a new high of $20.05 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its 13 product lines. Terra&apos;s TVL was $11.9 billion on Dec. 1, up 68% in less than a month. The platform&apos;s users are staking significant amounts of money into the system. LUNA is presently trading at $90, a 12,000% rise from its January 2021 price of $0.7. LUNA has an annual staking payout of roughly 12.10 percent. PancakeSwap (CAKE) PancakeSwap is a popular staking tool that allows users to stake CAKE currencies. When investors stake CAKE coins, they may earn more CAKE or other currencies. Transaction costs on Binance Smart Chain are much cheaper than on Ethereum. They may either claim or reinvest their PancakeSwap rewards.

42387571,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOGC9Y,1641801508,Bitcoin Dips Below $40K as ‘Death Cross’ Looms on Price Charts,"They call it bitcoin’s “death cross” – a bearish indicator that appears when the 50-day moving average (MA) dips below the 200-day MA.  The ominously named chart pattern looks set to be confirmed this week amid mounting concerns of faster liquidity withdrawal by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), a bearish development for bitcoin and asset prices in general.  Puedes leer este artículo en español.  On Monday, the bitcoin (BTC) price dipped briefly below $40,000 for the first time since September. As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was changing hands at $40,834, based on CoinDesk pricing, down 12% so far in 2022, one of bitcoin’s worst-ever starts to a year.  Goldman Sachs foresees the Fed raising borrowing costs at least four times by the end of 2022, versus its previous prediction of three rate hikes, according to Bloomberg. The investment banking giant also expects the central bank to downsize its balance sheet from July.  Friday’s U.S. labor market report, which showed that unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, has strengthened the case for the Fed to hike rates concurrently with the end of asset purchases in March. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, investors were pricing a 73% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in March, up from 61% last week.  Fears of a hawkish Fed gripped the bitcoin market toward the end of last quarter after the central bank shifted its focus to inflation control from maximum employment. In December, the Fed announced at least three rate hikes by the end of 2022 and an end of the asset purchase program by March.  Bitcoin peaked near $69,000 on Nov. 10 and has declined by nearly 40% since. The cryptocurrency slipped over 12% in the last seven days to Jan. 9, registering its biggest weekly drop since early December. The impending death cross, coupled with the souring macro outlook, may bolster overall bearish sentiment.  That said, the technical indicator’s past record as a predictor of bear markets is mixed. According to research by Kraken, many of bitcoin’s previous death crosses, including those seen in 2014 and 2018, coincided with “either a sell-off in the days that followed or a continued macro downtrend that confirmed a bear market.”  However, death crosses witnessed last June, late March 2020 and October 2019 were bear traps, or false signals that marked major price bottoms. The consolidation seen after the mid-June death cross resolved in a fresh bull run, as seen in the featured image.  Moving average crossovers are unreliable as standalone indicators, given they are based on backward-looking data and tend to lag prices. The market is often oversold and due for a bounce by the time the crossover is confirmed, as was the case in June last year and late March 2020.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/10/bitcoin-approaches-death-cross-as-goldman-foresees-4-fed-rate-hikes-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/137ed993997a7bc523ef3b8fce5ca112aa3713a5-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Disney already employs augmented reality (AR) technology at its theme parks, such as using projection mapping to bring its cast of characters to life on real-world structures.

The firm, which facilitates transactions between investment banks, hedge funds and other large financial institutions, has been trading in Europe for clients such as Goldman Sachs, Flow Traders and Jane Street, TP ICAP digital assets’ co-heads Simon Forster and Duncan Trenholme told CoinDesk in an interview.  Trading an equity-linked product on an exchange is probably the easiest way for clients to get comfortable with digital assets, Forster said, adding that the firm had been active in trading ETPs such as ETC Group’s physical bitcoin product, BTCE.  The broker is responding to increased demand for digital assets from institutional clients, and it’s not alone. UBS, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are all clearing and settling cryptocurrency ETPs for hedge-fund clients in Europe, as reported by CoinDesk.  ETPs allow firms to gain exposure to parts of the crypto universe without investing directly. Instead the investment is through a security that tracks the performance of various digital assets.  The liquidity in some of these ETP products is “relatively modest” at present, Forster said. He expects that as more institutional money moves into the space, the number of products will grow and the overall market will expand.
