42399142,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVSB,1468881976,JPMorgan: Blockchain Tech is an ‘Opportunity’ for Asset Managers,"A new report from JPMorgan Chase and consultancy firm Oliver Wyman argues that blockchain technology presents an opportunity for asset managers.  The report  , released on 13th July, seeks to position the emerging technology as a means for asset managers to offer more sophisticated services to clients. It offers a broad overview, ultimately arguing the industry sector needs to ""get off the sidelines"" and begin investigating how they can adopt the technology.  The report states:  ""Revenue opportunities will grow out of the improved data sources, greater liquidity and lower frictional costs fostered by blockchain. Asset managers will be able to serve clients in new ways, for example, with real-time reporting or alternate trading strategies.""  The report is the latest to shed light on JPMorgan's examination of the technology, after the firm publicly disclosed its testing of blockchain applications earlier this year.  Further, the publication comes amid a notable silence on the technology from members of the asset management community.  To date, major market-leading firms including BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard have been quiet on industry developments, with only Fidelity publicly exploring the technology through its in-house innovation department.  Waves of adoption  The report envisions adoption for asset managers taking place in three development waves, the first of which will take shape between now and 2019. The last wave, during which the report sees the development of ""critical infrastructure"" around the technology, is forecast to play out between 2020 and 2030.  According to JPMorgan and Oliver Wyman, the current wave of adoption will see the development of ""simple applications"" focused on data communication between network parties, while the second will give rise to systems used to store ""core transaction data"".  However, the report says this is incumbent on the success of early trials and the winding down of services that today provide the same functions.  From there, the report says the third wave will see ""major pieces of capital markets infrastructure"" being augmented or outright replaced by blockchain applications.  ""Once assets are held as tokens on the blockchain, the clearing and settlement of trades across multiple asset classes can move to distributed ledger-based infrastructure, as opposed to the hybrid or dual systems that we project through the first two waves,"" the report reads, adding:  ""This will drastically cut processing cycles and unlock liquidity.""  The last wave, which the report leaves relatively ambiguous, could see the broad adoption of the technology, though whether this will be driven by incumbents or new startups remains to be seen.

42399150,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVY5,1468872072,"Central Bank Digital Currencies Could Boost GDP, Bank of England Says","The Bank of England has released new research suggesting that a central bank-issued digital currency could lead to an increase in gross domestic product.  The conclusions were drawn from a working paper published today that examined how a central bank-backed digital currency (referred to as a CBDC in the paper) could yield macroeconomic benefits, while providing banking regulators a clearer picture of the financial system.  The authors wrote:  ""First, it leads to an increase in the steady-state level of GDP of almost 3%, due to reductions in real interest rates, in distortionary tax rates and in monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates. Second, a CBDC regime can contribute to the stabilization of the business cycle, by giving policymakers access to a second policy instrument that controls either the quantity or the price of CBDC in a countercyclical fashion.”  That said, the authors state that there are potential issues inherent in the concept and that ""there remains a clear concern"" about the risks in transitioning to a ""different monetary and financial regime"".  These concepts were explored several months ago in a speech by Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England’s deputy governor for monetary policy, who said in March that while such a system could provide greater visibility for regulators, UK banks could see an outflow of deposits.  Broadbent is one of several witnesses set to appear tomorrow before a committee of the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the UK parliament.

42399160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVgw,1468868609,The Hard Fork: What's About to Happen to Ethereum and The DAO,"Last month, an unknown attacker drained tens of millions of dollars worth of the digital currency ether from The DAO, an ethereum-based smart contract aimed at functioning as a funding vehicle for projects in the ecosystem. The incident sparked an effort to effectively roll back the clock and undo much of the damage, a process that comes to a head this week as network-wide changes are set to be rolled out.  For weeks, the impact has been largely confined to the pages of social media and, for developers, within the workspaces and private chats of those most closely involved with the so-called ‘hard fork’ effort. Now, however, with code for the changes completed and merged with major wallet implementations, that’s about to change.  Major exchanges that offer trading services for ether have announced their plans to support the fork in the past few days. Generally speaking, the plan is to support the strongest blockchain, which will be determined by how much hashing power it draws from ethereum’s distributed network of miners.  So far, digital currency exchanges Poloniex and Kraken (which comprise more than 50% of ether trading volumes) have both said they plan to briefly suspend deposits and withdrawals prior to the fork activation.  Miners, signs indicate, have largely moved to adopt the hard fork measures, with major pool operators looking to their members to assess support for the plan, even if reluctantly.  The stakes on the outcome of the vote are high. If the hard fork fails to be implemented, many early adopters of ethereum who purchased DAO tokens meant to give them voting rights in the new organization will be out $60m worth of the cryptocurrency, increasing concerns about potential regulatory involvement.  On the other hand, if the hard fork is implemented, the ethereum blockchain, which is supposed to be an unchangeable record of all transactions, will no longer be seen as immutable. In sense, code may no longer be law.  How we got here  For those who may be unfamiliar with The DAO, here’s a quick recap of the story so far.  Launched in April, The DAO was designed as a series of contracts that would raise funds for ethereum-based projects and disperse them based on the votes of members. An initial token offering was conducted, exchanging ethers for ""DAO tokens"" that would allow stakeholders to vote on proposals, including ones to grant funding to a particular project.  That token offering raised more than $150m worth of ether at then-current prices, distributing over 1bn DAO tokens.  Just over a month ago, however, news broke that a flaw in The DAO’s smart contract had been exploited, allowing the removal of more than 3m ethers.  Subsequent exploitations allowed for more funds to be removed, which ultimately triggered a ‘white hat’ effort by token-holders to secure the remaining funds. That, in turn, triggered reprisals from others seeking to exploit the same flaw.  An effort to blacklist certain addresses tied to The DAO attackers was also stymied mid-rollout after researchers identified a security vulnerability, thus forcing the hard fork option.  How the fork works  Much has been said about the ethereum hardfork and the idea that it constitutes a ""rollback"" of the network. While not necessarily false, the specifics of the hard fork proposal on the table are a bit more complicated – here’s how.  The proposal doesn’t exactly unwind the network’s transaction history. Rather, it relocates the funds tied to The DAO to a new smart contract with the single purpose of letting the original owners withdrawal them.  According to a recent blog post explaining the move, DAO token holders will be able to withdraw ETH at a rate of 1 ETH to 100 DAO.  The extra balance and any ether that remains as a result of the re-entrancy exploit and the splitting mechanism will be withdrawn and distributed by the DAO curators, or individuals selected prior to the collapse of The DAO to provide ""failsafe protection"" for the organization.  As part of an effort to help ensure the hard fork doesn't also include new vulnerabilities, ethereum co-founder Jeff Wilcke also announced a bounty program for those who test the hard fork code. Coders earned rewards based on vulnerabilities they discovered in the code.  Miners make their pitch  By Friday, major mining pools in the ethereum network had begun to open up voluntary voting to gauge their contributors' interests on how to handle the hard fork. Pools measured sentiment by way of hashrate, rather than individual miner accounts.  Though support by the miners does seem to swing toward the hard fork, low turnout has opened the door to criticism that the vote wasn’t representative of the entire network. At least one large mining pool said it would only begrudgingly honor the fork.  Pools like Dwarfpool, which possesses about a quarter of the network’s total hashing power, held a vote in which a majority of participants indicated their support. However, less than 7% of Dwarfpool’s hashrate was accounted for in the vote.  Fourteen percent of Ethermine’s hashrate voted in a similar poll, with a clear majority of those taking part voicing support. 23% of Ethpool’s mining power voted, with a slim majority moving against the hard fork.  Other miners, including F2Pool, which operates a major bitcoin mining pool, suggested a degree of apprehension about the hard fork plan but indicated that it would likely support it.  The pool said in a statement:  ""We are as a matter of principle against unduly rushed or controversial hard forks irrespective of the team proposing and we will not run such code on production systems nor mine any block from that hard-fork. I believe this is universal and it could be applied to ethereum, too. I fail to see why we must take such a controversial and risky hard fork. We are not willing to deploy this hard fork unless we have to.""  Exchanges make their own plans  The fork is scheduled to kick in at block 1,920,000, estimated to take place sometime around 21st July, which will limit the amount of time ether exchanges like Poloniex, Bitfinex and Kraken have to implement their plans.  In a blog post, Poloniex said it will temporarily disable deposits and withdrawals for an unspecified length of time leading up to the migration process.  ""Once the network is stable and the migration is complete, we will enable deposits and withdrawals,"" the post said.  In an email Friday, Kraken said it intends to disable withdrawals on 19th July, approximately one hour before the hard fork activates. Trading will function as normal during the fork and all ether on Kraken after the fork will be tokens of the chain with the most number of miners working on it.  Earlier reports that withdrawals will also be closed for one hour after the hard fork are untrue, according to a representative of Kraken speaking to CoinDesk.  From the email:  ""ETH deposits and withdrawals will be enabled again once the winning chain has become clearly evident. We expect the hard fork process to be smooth and quick, but there is no certainty of this.""  In its statement, Bitfinex largely echoed Poloniex and Kraken, declaring its intention to support the strongest change.  The exchange said in a blog post:  ""We will re-enable deposits and withdrawals when we are confident that the longest valid chain has been clearly decided. During this time exchange trading, margin trading, and margin funding will all continue to operate as usual.""

42426945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy51h,1468864690,'No Scaling Agreements' Planned for July Bitcoin Miner-Developer Event,"A late July gathering to feature members of bitcoin's development and mining communities, and organized by contributors to Bitcoin Core, will not focus specifically on the issue of scaling, according to materials provided to CoinDesk.  Originally reported as a more formal event that would see the digital currency's global community attempting to break ground on how best to scale the network’s transaction capacity, it is now being labeled by organizers as an invite-only social function focused on improving relationships.  Of focus, organizers said, will be reducing the ""language and cultural gap"" dividing attendees on larger issues through activities such as sightseeing, community meals and informal discussions.  Organizers said that while the conversation will include ""discussions about technologies that may help bitcoin scale"", these will be a byproduct of the conversation, rather than the specific mandate or goal of the event.  The meetup guidelines, sent to all attendees for signature, read:  ""Participants recognize that because bitcoin consensus rules are decided by the users based on the software they choose to run, so proposed changes must be discussed in public with input from the whole bitcoin community. For these reasons, there will be no agreements or roundtable consensus coming out of this event.""  Bitcoin Core developer BTC Drak said that organizers are looking to the event as a way to ease what he described as the sometimes ""tense"" relations between miners and developers.  In recent weeks, these have flared as mainstream media attention was again drawn to the block size debate and its cultural nuances.  ""I have a positive expectation. We all contribute to the bitcoin ecosystem, and if there is constant negativity and sparring, it doesn't help anyone,"" he said.  Not another Hong Kong  Notable is that the meetup follows a meeting between miners and contributors to Bitcoin Core that took place this winter in Hong Kong, and that organizers suggest contributed to misconceptions about the role of miners and developers in the bitcoin ecosystem.  During that meeting, a number of Core contributors present agreed to propose an increase in the size of the limit on bitcoin’s transaction blocks within three months of the code for Segregated Witness being delivered. However, it was perhaps more widely viewed as a formal agreement between two industry sectors.  Here again, organizers stressed that none of the involved parties wants the event to create the impression that their decisions are able to alter the decentralized network.  ""Given what has gone on in the past, everyone is afraid of being vilified or worse, and that the narrative people takeaway from the event will be wrong,"" BTC Drak continued.  The meeting also comes ahead of the next installment of Scaling Bitcoin in October, a technical event that aims to bring together the digital currency’s global development community, and that was started in the wake of the scaling debate.  Organizers described this forum as more suitable for larger scaling discussions, given the community consensus that is needed.  Public details  As for how the community may be able to follow the event, organizers said that some materials will be made available to the public in an effort to increase transparency.  Organizers said that transcripts of the event without attribution will be available following the event.  ""You are free to take your own written notes and use and the information received but you must not record the identity of any speaker and give no attribution to any ideas or concepts,"" the materials said.

42426954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJy5Lh,1468848611,ISITC Europe Proposes 10 Blockchain Standards Benchmarks,"The European branch of the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC) has proposed 10 blockchain benchmarks it believes will help standardize the increasingly diverse set of blockchain tools currently available on the market.  Created by the ISITC's Blockchain DLT Working Group at a meeting earlier this month, the benchmarks are the latest step in a series of global efforts aimed at ensuring blockchain can enable a new wave of efficient, decentralized data sharing without recreating today's siloed centralized database infrastructure.  But creating reliable standards across industries and borders is about more than just helping ensure interoperability, according to co-chair of the ISITC Blockchain DLT Working Group, Gary Wright. Rather, the creation of blockchain standards is a key step towards improving the bottom line for companies that use distributed ledger technology.  Wright, who also sits on the European executive board of ISITC and co-founded London-based Block Asset Technologies, told CoinDesk:  ""We won’t be able to sell anything unless people understand what we're selling and what they want to buy. It’s in our interest to standardize so people will invest.""  The benchmarks introduced at the blockchain working group meeting deal with blockchain resilience, scalability, latency, data structure, auditability, governance, legal jurisdiction, regulation and software version control.  Governance and tech  Going further, Wright breaks the benchmarks into two categories.  The ""wholistic"" benchmarks take a high level look at how blockchain and distributed ledger tech integrate with the rest of the world. These benchmarks are governance, legal and regulation. The remaining seven benchmarks apply to more technological standards.  The standards were developed by Wright’s fellow ISITC blockchain working group members, Scott Riley, the director of Block Asset Technologies and Hermann Rapp, a data standards researcher at the Lord Ashcroft International Business School in Cambridge.  ISITC Europe has invited participants across industries, including both from the academic and professional sectors, to participate in the development of the benchmarks.  If they are successful, Wright and Rapp say the next step will be to take the benchmarks to the International Organization for Standardization, a global standards organization based in Geneva.  However, this goal could be a long way off.  Going global  A similar drive toward standardization is also in its earliest stages at global Internet standards organization, the W3C. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994, that group was designed to prevent competitive interests from fracturing the World Wide Web during its early days, but is currently seeking member support to potential expand that mission to distributed ledgers  Blockchain industry leaders attended a standards event last month in Cambridge, Massachusetts, hosted by W3C, and while many of the attendees were excited about the business applications of blockchain standards, others expressed concern over potential limitations on early-stage experiments with the technology.  Though W3C hasn’t formally committed to helping create international blockchain standards, event organizer Doug Schepers told CoinDesk that creating standards is bigger than any single standards body.  If the ISITC does end up taking their benchmarks to the ISO, it could take years of working in a collaborative back and forth before they are finally accepted.  ""Usually when you go to ISO, you’re trying to say that governments should pay attention,"" Schepers said, adding:  ""ISO is usually used as a way for industry to signal to governments and other compliance organizations that something is stable and serious.""  Forming partnerships  For his part, Wright agrees that the work to create blockchain standards requires more input and support.  Eric Benz the COO of UK-based blockchain platform provider Credits has offered to host the ISITC blockchain working group in a wider meeting about standards at the startup's Level 39 offices in London.  As for what’s next with ISITC’s working group, Rapp said they intend to present their work on the blockchain benchmarks at the ISITC general meeting in October where it will be considered for further support by the standards organization at large.  If all goes well for the working group, which currently includes about 100 members, Rapp said the next logical step might be a more formal arrangement.  Rapp concluded:  ""A working group is more an open network and a consortium has a fixed agenda. But it might develop into a consortium.""
