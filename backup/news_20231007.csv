Indeed, the amount raised by crypto-focused firms in Q3 fell to just under $2.1B across 297 deals, down 36% in both categories from Q2 and the lowest since Q4 2020, the report said. Fundraising hit a peak of almost $17.5B across more than 900 deals in Q1 2022, but an industry-wide downturn created by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem emerged shortly thereafter. In terms of the overall funding amounts and deal counts, returns last year fell sharply in the Q2-Q3 period, when the demise of stablecoin TerraUSD ( UST-USD ) and sister token Luna ( LUNA-USD ) wiped out tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization within a week and contributed to the collapse of several other key players like Sam Bankman-Fried’s multibillion-dollar empire. While up handsomely on the year, prices of major digital tokens posted losses for Q3 2023, as investors came to the understanding that interest rates likely will stay higher for longer with inflation still too high for the Federal Reserve’s liking. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the two largest cryptos by market value, retreated 8.6% and 10.6% , respectively, during the quarter. The S&P 500, by comparison, logged a 3.8% loss. Messari noted the bulk of deals in Q3 were concentrated in early-stage rounds, with seed funding accounting for the largest stage total with $488M raised over 98 rounds. “Trends in deal counts show a significant shift away from later stage projects and into early stage projects over the last three years,” it said. Scanning across sectors, chain infrastructure saw the largest share of funding at 18%, while decentralized finance (DeFi) dominated in terms of the number of deals funded with 67. Gaming also scored another robust quarter, attracting nearly $250M. Interestingly, Binance Labs, the venture capital division of embattled crypto exchange Binance, was by far the most active investor during the quarter, Messari said . Its 23 deals, focused on projects relating to DeFi and gaming sectors, were more than double the next biggest investor, Robot Ventures. The dominance in venture funding comes as Changpeng Zhao-led Binance is embroiled by regulatory woes, with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission both alleging the platform failed to register with U.S. regulators and sold illegal securities.

According to the report, Binance’s XRP holdings, in particular, have increased in the past month. This is evident, as there have been reports of investors depositing XRP into exchanges in the past month. Binance Releases Proof Of Reserves Showing Massive XRP Holdings According to Binance’s Proof of Reserves report, the exchange holds a staggering amount of XRP to cover 104.15% of customer balances. Related Reading: When Are AMMs Coming To XRP Ledger? Ripple CTO Gives Clear Answer Binance currently has over 2.738 billion XRP tokens worth more than $1.35 billion against customer deposits of 2.629 billion XRP tokens. This marks a rise of almost 50 million XRP in its reserve as compared to the previous month’s total of 2,686,407,725 XRP. As one of the first major exchanges to list XRP in 2017, Binance has been known to be one of the major places for XRP trading. Data from Coingecko shows a trading volume of $84 million of Binance’s XRP/USDT trading pair in the past 24 hours, representing over 16.9% of the total XRP trading volume. This massive XRP stash cements Binance as one of the top holders of XRP and the amount of XRP trading on the exchange. Cryptocurrency market cap currently at $1.07 trillion.

The Proof of Reserves report is part of Binance’s push for more transparency. By disclosing its reserves, it aims to assure users that client funds are backed 1:1. While some have backed the reserve data to be consistent with on-chain data, regulators have expressed concerns about the legitimacy of Binance’s reserve audit.

18484892,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554500,1696690802,Here’s How Sam Bankman-Fried Allegedly Used Customer Funds On Alameda Research,"On day four of the criminal trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, who co-founded the now-bankrupt crypto exchange and served as its former chief technology officer (CTO), testified. During his testimony, the former FTX executive revealed details about the connection between the cryptocurrency exchange and Alameda Research. FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Allegedly Gave Alameda Research ‘Special Privileges’ According to various reports, on Friday, October 6, Wang appeared again in court and testified that Alameda Research’s account on FTX was allowed to trade more funds than it had available. The former FTX CTO reportedly said that Sam Bankman-Fried authorized the integration of a “allow negative” feature, which afforded Alameda “special privileges” on FTX. Wang reportedly revealed that the “allow negative” feature enabled Alameda to hold a negative balance more than FTX’s revenue at some point in 2020 ($200 million against $150 million). According to reports, Wang claimed that he increased Alameda’s line of credit several times and up to $65 billion under Bankman-Fried’s instructions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Will Bearish Momentum Push Meme Coin Below $0.06? When the government’s prosecutors questioned where the money came from, Wang reportedly affirmed that it came from FTX’s customers’ funds. Based on the co-founder’s testimony, Bankman-Fried claimed that the “allow negative” feature was all about FTT, a native cryptocurrency “created to act as equity in FTX.” Wang reportedly acknowledged that the customers never authorized their funds to be used by Alameda Research. “The customers did not give us permission to use their accounts like this,” the former FTX chief technology officer allegedly said. Did SBF Repeatedly Lie About Connections With Alameda? During his testimony, Wang was asked whether he remembered Bankman-Fried making public statements about Alameda’s unusual connections with the FTX exchange. “Yes, he (SBF) said they (Alameda Research) were treated equally and didn’t use FTX funds,” the FTX cofounder allegedly affirmed. Furthermore, the prosecutors showed Wang – and the court – a 2019 tweet from SBF claiming that Alameda was not using funds from FTX. Interestingly, Wang affirmed that Bankman-Fried ordered the addition of “allow negative” in the exchange’s codebase on the same day the tweet was made. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? It appears that is not the only time Bankman-Fried lied about Alameda’s activities on the FTX exchange. The former FTX CTO testified that Bankman-Fried subsequently claimed on Twitter (now X) and on phone calls that customer funds were kept safe. On Thursday, October 5, Gary Wang reportedly admitted to committing fraud-related crimes while at the FTX exchange alongside Sam Bankman-Fried, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and former engineering director Nishad Singh. With the trial expected to continue till November, it remains to be seen whether or when the other former top FTX and Alameda executives will take the stand.

This sudden price increase has piqued the interest of investors and enthusiasts alike, sparking discussions about its underlying causes. One prominent question on people’s minds is whether this uptick in SOL’s value is directly correlated with Bitcoin’s performance during the same period or if there are distinct factors driving SOL’s price rise independently of Bitcoin’s movements. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Will Bearish Momentum Push Meme Coin Below $0.06? Before this increase, SOL had a tough time because a U.S. court allowed the sale of $1.3 billion worth of SOL from the bankrupt exchange FTX. So, there’s curiosity about whether SOL’s recent price jump is connected to Bitcoin or if there are other factors behind it. Solana: Challenges And Market Allure The Solana (SOL) blockchain network has seen recent difficulties, however it has garnered significant attention and demand in the market. Despite the lackluster price performance of its native token, the proof-of-stake (PoS) network has utilised the bear market to improve its technological capabilities and forge important alliances with prominent entities in the realm of traditional banking. Source: Coingecko The bankruptcy court has implemented mechanisms to mitigate the potential adverse impact of FTX asset liquidation on the cryptocurrency market. These measures involve mandating the sale of assets through a financial advisor in weekly installments, adhering to predetermined regulations. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.43, down a measly 0.3% in the last 24 hours, but gained sustained an 18% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.

18482579,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554478,1696683656,"Avalanche-Based Stars Arena Falls Victim To A $3 Million Exploit, TVL Tanks By 100%","Stars Arena, a decentralized social media platform built on the Avalanche network, has suffered a major security breach, resulting in the loss of a significant amount of cryptocurrency. This comes barely a day after the decentralized application (dApp) reportedly fixed a loophole in its smart contract. On Thursday, October 5, the Stars Arena team said – via a post on X (formerly Twitter) – that it has averted a security exploit, which could have led to the loss of over $1 million worth of funds. Stars Arena Loses $2.9 Million To Attack, PeckShield Reveals On Saturday, October 7, a pseudonymous X user raised the alarm about the suspicious movement of Avalanche (AVAX) tokens from the Stars Arena contract. A few minutes after this, the protocol’s team confirmed – via a post on X – that there has been a “major security breach with its smart contract.” Related Reading: Celsius Commits To Massive Crypto Repayment: $2 Billion To Creditors By 2023’s End This exploit has also been flagged by blockchain security firm PeckShield, who disclosed that around $2.9 million in AVAX has been drained from the decentralized social media application. An initial breakdown by the security company identified a reentrancy issue on the Stars Arena Shares contract. “The reentrancy is abused to update the weight when the share/ticket is issued so that 1 share can be sold at a much higher price of approximately 274,000 AVAX,” PeckShield said. As earlier noted, Stars Arena has been gaining some popularity in the past few days. In fact, the recent activity uptick on the Avalanche network has been attributed to the rise of the decentralized social application. However, this latest hack represents a significant deterrent to Stars Arena’s growth. According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol’s total value locked has plummeted from $1.26 million to $0.47 in the past day, reflecting a 100% decline. Stars Arena went live on Avalanche C-Chain – the blockchain component specifically designed for running smart contracts on Avalanche – in late September. Although the Friend.tech-like platform experienced some traction after launch, recent security concerns seem to be stirring skepticism around its growth. $900 Million Lost To Bad Actors In 2023 Q3 This latest exploit will serve as an unfriendly reminder of the growing security concerns in the crypto space. Particularly, the cryptocurrency industry saw a significant surge in exploits and security breaches in the third quarter of 2023. According to a quarterly report by blockchain security firm Beosin, the losses incurred only in Q3 2023 were larger than the total for the year’s first half. A total of $889.26 million was lost to various attacks in the last quarter, compared to the $663 million lost in 2023’s first six months.

18480452,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554466,1696678808,"Inside Job Suspected As Huobi Wallet Falls Victim To $263,000 Exploit","According to multiple reports, iToken, formerly known as Huobi Wallet, fell victim to a crypto heist in the last week, leading to the loss of $263,000 worth of users’ assets. The incident draws much attention following recent police investigations into some of Huobi’s former staff. Related Reading: TRON’s Justin Sun Reassures Crypto Community That Huobi Exchange Is Solvent $263,000 Drained From Huobi Wallet – Could There Be An Internal Involvement? Providing more insight on this latest exploit, prominent security firm Peckshield reported that this event occurred on October 3, with the drainer stealing a total of $263,000 USDT and 92 TRX minted on the Tron network. Thereafter, the bad actor proceeded to swap these stolen funds for approximately 2.9 million TRX, of which 1.4 million TRX was transferred to the ChangeNOW exchange, and 1.5 million TRX was moved to Binance. Currently, there are speculations that this heist was orchestrated by the internal staff of Huobi as such development would be unprecedented. In September, the Chinese Police were reported to have arrested a former Huobi team member for implanting a Trojan horse virus that resulted in the exposure of the private keys and mnemonic phrases of some iToken users. Launched in 2018, iToken functions as a professional DeFi wallet, which enables the storage of various digital assets across multiple networks. It was initially known as the Huobi wallet, as earlier stated, but was rebranded iToken in 2022, following a $200 million investment from the Huobi Group. Related Reading: Tron’s Justin Sun Mulls Over Making A Move On FTX’s Crypto Stash, Here’s Why Growing Controversy Around Huobi? In addition to speculations of insider involvement in this recent heist, Huobi, now rebranded as HTX, has been in the news recently and not for positive reasons. On September 25, the exchange fell victim to a hack that drained 5,000 ETH worth $7.9 million. However, the exchange’s advisor and Tron founder, Justin Sun, soon came out to assure users of total asset recovery and security of the exchange’s operation. However, this week, crypto expert Dylan LeClair wrote a thread on X accusing the Tron Visioneer of creating a “web of deception.” This marks the second time in recent weeks Justin Sun has been accused of malicious dealings involving users’ assets on Huobi. According to LeClair, ever since Sun acquired a controlling stake in Huobi in late 2022, the amount of USDT held on the exchange has been gradually replaced by stUSDT, a receipt token for staking USDT. The stUSDT token is controlled by Justin Sun and is supposedly designed to invest in real-world assets such as US government bonds. However, LeClair stated that on-chain analysis and transactions show no such investment. The crypto analyst also drew attention to “worrying” transactions by Justin Sun involving JustLend, a Tron-based DeFi lending platform, and other stablecoins, including USDT and USDC, before concluding that the Tron Founder is maliciously moving USD liquidity out of the crypto space. At the time of writing, HTX’s native token, HT, hovers around $2.36 with a 0.74% gain in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Some $3 million worth of Avalanche’s AVAX tokens were drained, leaving Stars Arena with just under $1 in funds after the attacker. X, formerly Twitter, user @0xLawliette seemed to first warn of the exploit in the early Asian hours on Saturday, but another user, @0xlilitch yesterday warned of potential security issues.  Stars Arena developers confirmed the attack in a tweet on Saturday morning.  Stars Arena launched just over a week ago and quickly gained a cult following among Avalanche community members, some of whom earned as much as 1,000 AVAX in trading fees from the platform. It also helped bump prices of AVAX tokens by as much as 6% at one point during the week.  It was highly considered as a clone of Friend.Tech, a social app based on Ethereum grew to 100,000 users within weeks of its August release. Both apps let users purchase “keys” or “shares” of popular X users in turn for access to a closed chatroom, which may offer various privileges to those holders.  The values of these shares are very volatile, leading to some users treating the price gyrations similar to tokens and making a profit.  The exploit came even as some Ava Labs employees spoke in favor of the developments, which may have buoyed user trust. Some Ava Labs employees, including founder Emin Gün Sirer, seemed to hype the app over several X posts as well.  Sirer however, seemed to downplay concerns of the potential security exploit on Friday when it was first pointed out by @0xlilitch, even stating a potential breach had “already been fixed.”  Crypto markets remain a hotbed of generally poor security practices and criminal activity, with exploits and hacks accounting for some $1.3 billion in value lost in 2023 alone, as per estimates.",NEGATIVE,AVAX,AVAX | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/07/avalanche-social-app-stars-arena-drained-of-3m-in-avax-after-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6706b9b5e2d90eda477c46d9b58442435abbd8a-3348x1883.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ripple CTO Gives Clear Answer,"Following the announcement that the AMM functionality would be proposed as an amendment under the latest rippled version, many in the XRP community have continued to wonder how soon it could be implemented if passed. As a result, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has provided some answers to the community to quench speculations. How Soon The AMM Implementation Could Happen In response to a tweet asking how soon the AMM will go live on the ledger after voting, Schwartz stated that it should be enabled on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) “in about two weeks” if most validators vote yes to the proposal. The voting process kickstarted on September 7 following the announcement by Ripple’s developers. However, it seems that validators haven’t looked through the proposal yet or taken action. To the best of his knowledge, Schwartz mentioned that no validator has voted yes to the proposal yet, and 80% of validators need to vote yes for the amendment to be passed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Will Bearish Momentum Push Meme Coin Below $0.06? He further gave his opinion on how the process should go, as he believes “validators shouldn’t vote yes individually.” Rather, the decision should lie with the community, with the validators voting in favor of the amendment if they “believe” the community supports it. Contrary to what many may think, the amendment process isn’t “supposed to be a governance mechanism,” according to Schwartz. Instead, the aim of the voting process is to “coordinate activation and prevent activation if a problem is discovered.” He emphasized that validators should be guided by the community’s decision, not what “they think is best.” Bitcoin approaching the $28K level on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Schwartz’s Role In Ensuring Amendment Is Passed In a subsequent tweet, the Ripple CTO mentioned that he was going to review the performance testing results in the next few days and run a “few code checks” using feedback that he had gotten from several people. If everything works out fine and no “new objections surface,” Schwartz mentioned that he will “start asking people to consider voting yes.” 1/ Extensive performance testing of the XLS-30 #AMM has now been completed. XLS-30 is a proposed amendment as part of the rippled 1.12.0 upgrade. If adopted, it will bring automated swap, trading, and liquidity provisioning capabilities to the #XRPLedger.https://t.co/Cz1w76uc8c — RippleX (@RippleXDev) October 6, 2023 Meanwhile, Ripple’s developers confirmed in a tweet that they have completed the extensive performance testing of the AMM feature. If adopted, this AMM functionality will bring “automated swap, trading, and liquidity provisioning capabilities to the ledger.” Community members also have a chance to earn passive income by acting as liquidity providers (LPs) to the ecosystem.

Despite Schwartz defending the feature, many in the community argue that it undermines the essence of blockchain technology and decentralization.

Keiser Says Bitcoin Price To $220,000 In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Keiser stated that the Bitcoin price will experience an explosive rise to $220,000 in the short term. However, he didn’t specify how soon the crypto token would see such a rally. He made this assertion in response to a CNBC article about the current decline in the financial market amid economic and inflation concerns. Related Reading: 39-Month Cycle Says XRP Price Is Poised For Breakout To $1,000, Here’s When In a subsequent tweet, Keiser once again reiterated that Bitcoin would rise to $220,000 as he claims that “Central banks will print a wall of money visible from outer space.” His belief seems to stem from the fact that many will be looking to use Bitcoin as a hedge against rising inflation. He even alluded to the fact that the US dollar was losing its purchasing power “at a very rapid pace.” He gave an instance of how paying $100 for hamburgers years ago looked like a joke, but he had just spent “$84 for a very ordinary hamburger.” For the longest time, Keiser has been bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency. In 2011, he called Bitcoin the “currency of the resistance” and the “biggest story of the decade.” Additionally, he always touted a financial collapse as what would spark a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. Then, he stated that Bitcoin’s adoption and price will increase as banks collapse. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, also shares similar sentiments with Keiser. He recently stated that the government would likely resort to money printing to save the bond market, which could lead to a meteoric rise in Bitcoin’s price and other cryptocurrencies. BTC bulls struggle to maintain control | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Is Inflation Good Or Bad For Crypto? There seem to be divergent views on how rising inflation could affect Bitcoin and the crypto market by extension. While people like Keiser and Hayes see rising inflation as bullish for Bitcoin, others like Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten believe that inflation could spell more trouble for Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC: Crypto CEO Predicts SEC Will Drop Charges Against Executives According to Merten, the Federal Reserve needs to keep hiking interest rates to bring down the inflation rate as there is excess money in the system due to the “excess printing of money.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warned that the rising interest rates could cause a further decline in the Bitcoin price. There also seems to be a correlation between the stock and crypto markets. As such, it doesn’t seem like Bitcoin and the crypto market exist in isolation, as any financial crisis could significantly impact it.
