Late last month, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) – an organization composed of local, state and regionally based markets watchdogs in Canada, Mexico and the United States – published its Enforcement Report for 2017. While primarily an overview of the kinds of enforcement actions taken in the past year and the issues facing securities regulators, it notably contains a section on the blockchain use case.  After noting that NASAA members believe that trading around cryptocurrencies in general ""is likely to pose a significant risk to investors,"" it makes note of the growing interest in ICOs, which can be used to bootstrap and fund new blockchain networks but have also served as vehicles for alleged fraud in the past.  The report states:  ""Cryptocurrencies purport to store value in a distributed digital ledger, and are currently very popular as a means of raising capital for very early stage startups (usually referred to as an “Initial Coin Offering” or ICO). NASAA members are closely watching this emerging market.""  That statement came amid a growing number of pronouncements from securities regulators worldwide, a trend that gathered steam after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared that, in some cases, cryptographic tokens distributed through an ICO may be considered securities under federal law.  Some regulators have taken a more restrictive approach, including those in China and South Korea. In the case of China, market watchdogs declared that the ICO funding model is an illegal form of financing, triggering a wave of platform closures and refunds for projects that were in the middle of soliciting funds.

An as-yet-undecided ""vendor"" will contribute, and the selection process is already under way, according to statements.  Project Jasper has been framed by Bank of Canada as a way to explore various uses of distributed ledger tech, and to date has focused primary on settling payments. The new phase will focus on the creation of an ""integrated securities and payment platform."" The proof-of-concept will focus on both the clearing and settlement of securities transactions.  Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Canadian central bank, said of the new phase:  ""Our involvement in this effort to explore potential ways to modernize the securities settlement process is a good example of how the Bank of Canada promotes the efficiency and stability of the financial system. A better settlement process would not only reduce the cost of securities transactions, but also support financial system resiliency, especially in periods of stress, through faster settlement times and reduced settlement risk.""

42379990,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXbT,1508349658,Australian Senate Panel Throws Support Behind Crypto Exchange Bill,"The Australian Senate has begun deliberating a bill that would apply the country's anti-money laundering (AML) statutes to domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.  The bill was first unveiled in August – introduced in the House of Representatives, one of two chambers in Australia's Parliament – revealing that lawmakers are considering approaches such as criminal penalties for unlawful exchange operators. The bill also called for the creation of a so-called ""Digital Currency Exchange Register,"" which if created would be managed by the Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the Australia's financial intelligence agency.  New public documents  indicate that the Australian Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has taken up the measure, signifying that the new rules are now being considered in both of the Parliament's chambers. A 35-page report, published earlier this month, details the various elements of the bill, which focuses on beefing up the rules around AML and know-your-customer regulations.  Notably, the report suggests that the committee is in support of the measure, stating in its conclusion that it ""recommends that the bill be passed.""  Back in August, the government said in statements at the time that the measure is intended to ""close the gap"" between new technologies like cryptocurrency and a set of rules in need of an update.  ""The bill will ... close a regulatory gap by bringing digital currency exchange providers under the remit of AUSTRAC,"" officials said at the time.  It's unclear at this time whether other committees within the Australian Senate will take up the bill.

42379993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXj1,1508345707,In 'Search' of a Swell? XRP Prices Rise and Fall Amid Ripple Event,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is on the decline at press time.  And though it's a drop that's largely in line with bitcoin and the broader crypto asset class, there are conditions that perhaps make XRP worthy of exploration at present.  For one, XRP has steadily gained altitude from its Sept. 15 low of $0.14, an uptrend that seems most likely to coincide with anticipation for big announcements at Swell, the conference the company launched on Oct. 16 to compete with rival Swift.  A new (possibly annual) event designed to draw attention to its product suite, the conference spotlighted how Ripple is seeking to provide distributed ledger technology that could one day replace Swift, the organizer of the Sibos conference.  The result? Speculators who expected a boost from the visibility were likely not disappointed, though long-term holders might be. While during the conference, prices clocked a 7-week high of $0.30, the ripple-US dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is now trading at $0.22.  At time of publication, the cryptocurrency has lost over 11 percent in the last 24 hours.  Big search boost  Stepping back, a look at the historical data adds evidence to the idea the Swell conference may have contributed to the boost.  Google search results, for instance, show a strong correlation between search volumes and XRP price activity.  Interestingly, search volumes for the term ""ripple price"" bottomed out in mid-September (around the time of its recent lows) and spiked ahead of the Swell event.  The numbers point to close correlation between search volumes and ripple price activity.  The chart shows:  Search volumes jumped during April-June period when XRP rallied from $0.007 to a record high of $0.458  XRP's rally in mid-August to a high of $0.3127 was accompanied by a jump in search volumes.  The pattern was repeated in the run-up to Swell event.  Daily chart  Looking at the daily charts, the broader outlook remains constructive as suggested by the rounding bottom formation and repeated rebound from $0.15 levels.  The chart shows:  The rising trend line has been breached to the downside.  The RSI has turned bearish (sloping downwards).  XRP is flirting with the 50-day moving average level of $0.2162.  View  A convincing break below the 50-day moving average level of $0.2162 would open doors for $0.1628 (Sep. 22 low).  Only multiple day-end closes below $0.15 would signal long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

As previously reported, HPE worked with distributed ledger startup R3 to develop new solutions for its client base, and by August had already begun testing with some of its customers.  Markus Ogurek, HYPE's global financial services industry lead, said in a statement:  ""Joining the EEA is a significant step for Hewlett Packard Enterprise in making blockchain enterprise-ready and accelerating our customers' journey to production.""  First revealed  in January, the EEA formally debuted in late February with the backing of major firms like JPMorgan Chase, British Petroleum (BP), Microsoft and a number of other established companies and blockchain startups.  Since then, it's attracted new members like Japanese teleccom KDDI, the government of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and Sberbank, Russia's largest banking firm.

When a child is born, they are slowly immersed into a world in which economic dynamics rule. Some of these children learn faster than others; there are also those who gain a deeper understanding of these dynamics than most, but the time every individual must put into the endeavor is quite extensive. Nowadays, children are being born into a world that has shifted economically towards new frontiers. Blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and eSports are 3 of the pillars of this new frontier. The Millennial at the New Frontier Unlike new-borns who will learn these dynamics as they grow, Millennials had to adapt their knowledge to the changing reality. Some are succeeding in understanding the shift and subsequently in taking advantage of it. Others have been adapting at a slower pace, and some haven’t adjusted yet. Nevertheless, it seems that this generation might be better suited to learn about blockchain technology and the emerging industry of eSports as a cohort than previous generations. Millennials have challenged the workforce and the economy altogether, often clashing with their seniors, precisely because adapting to the new frontier has changed the way they think. In the process they have grown into the opportunities that new technology affords them. Therefore, it is not at all strange for a Millennial to understand that someone can play games for a living, or trade the value on one distributed ledger for the value on another to make a profit. eSports and Blockchain: The New Frontier This degree of adaptability as a cohort and the new set of paradigms that Millennials are creating, will also help to streamline the economy into a more open, dynamic ecosystem. Therefore, eSports and blockchain technology are not just the new frontier; they can easily become the cornerstones of the Millennial economy. This could create a myriad of new marketplaces for future generations to learn about as they make their own mark on the world and shift the economy further, into the next sphere. The Future is Bright! As more and more Millennials adapt to these new realities, they will also find innovative ways to integrate different technologies and industries. That will create more change to adapt to, which might be harder for previous generations to digest as a cohort, while opening even more possible iterations of future economic scenarios for which the children today will already be adapted. This doesn’t mean that the world belongs to the Millennials alone. In spite of the bigger challenge they face as a cohort, Baby Boomers and Gen Xers will keep on providing brilliant individuals with more experience, who cannot only adapt to the new realities, but can also help Millennials steward the ship.

42379992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXhl,1508333453,"Healthy Pullback? Bitcoin Price Dips Back Below $5,300","Bitcoin may be witnessing a healthy pullback.  After having rallied more than 90 percent from a September low of $2,980, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is trading at $5,240 today, a figure that, at press time, marks a new daily low. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has shed 7.37 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, BTC is up 9.9 percent, while month-on-month it is flashing 29 percent gains.  Still, with prices having jumped above $5,000 (the previous all-time high) on Oct. 12, what we are witnessing today might be best considered a healthy correction, courtesy of overbought technical indicators.  For example, demand for bitcoin jumped last week, reportedly on speculation that the hard fork in November may benefit buyers with the creation of new cryptocurrency (as in August when investors were allotted newly created bitcoin cash).  Dip demand during this period, if observed, would add credence to the record rally and indicate that the base in bitcoin has shifted higher to $5,000.  So, will the cryptocurrency hold above $5,000 mark?  The price action analysis suggests bitcoin needs to regain the bid tone quickly, else the odds of a break below $5,000 would rise.  Daily chart  As noted in the previous updates, a combination of an overbought relative strength index and stochastic indicators has yielded a technical correction.  In the previous four occasions (marked by red circles), bitcoin prices dropped well below the 10-day moving average. Currently, the 10-day moving average is seen at $5,354 levels. As of now, prices are trading below the 10-day moving average and may extend losses to $5,000 levels.  So long as prices remain above the $5,000 mark, the broader outlook remains constructive.

42379984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXXh,1508331543,Upgrade Complete? Ethereum's New Software Isn't Quite Stable Yet,"Ethereum's fork may have executed earlier this week, but that doesn't mean developers are ready to call the software transition complete.  One of the biggest-ever changes to the world's second-largest blockchain, ethereum's hard fork was a risky and complex process. To transition successfully, all nodes (the computers that run the software) were required to universally install upgrades – a transition that was expected and encouraged to occur simultaneously across the global platform.  However, in the case of the Byzantium fork, that's not exactly what happened.  As the upgrades were released mere days before the hard fork, a sizeable portion of the network has yet to make the shift. In fact, at press time, only 25.1 percent of Parityhttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/parity and 58.4 percent of Gethhttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/geth, the most popular ethereum clients, have upgraded, meaning roughly 45 percent of the network is running the new software.  The short testing runway also had other impacts: namely, previous iterations of the software were retracted due to critical faults that could have exposed the network to denial-of-service attacks, or created incompatibility between nodes, leading to a split of the network.  As a result, some may be wondering whether ethereum is safe to use, and given the state of affairs, this remains an open question. For one, there are a few types of faulty software clients out there, and several contain a ""consensus bug"" which could lead to the inadvertent creation of multiple ethereum blockchains.  For this reason, ethereum core developer Gavin Wood told CoinDesk he would ""urge caution"" to any major players taking on large-scale projects until the upgrade is deemed to be fully stable.  Risks remain  Aside from the faulty nodes that have yet to upgrade, there's also a chance of security bugs in the current Byzantium software.  The most severe and frequent of these is the consensus bug (as mentioned above), which occurs when nodes cannot communicate and the blockchain splits into incompatible chains. Developers are now said to be running tests to try and locate these risks, hoping to catch any before they active.  According to Wood, if the network does contain this bug, it will take time to show itself. ""I don't think anyone believed the network was going to self-combust on block 4,370,000,"" Wood said.  Rather, if there is a problem, it will come to light over the following days.  And if this does happen, Wood is confident the developer team will release debugged software variations quickly, to avoid any excessive damage to the platform.  Regarding the faulty software that is already out there, lead security developer for ethereum Martin Holst Swende said this isn't a cause for concern.  If consensus splits happen as a result of running the old software, he assured: ""They'll simply be dropped off the chain, [then] look into it and update their client.""  Of course, ethereum is no longer monitoring these nodes, so if a bug does show up, it won't be visible on any of the blockchain explorers. Further, should the bug be exploited on the older software, we're unlikely to hear about it, beyond the ""noise on Reddit,"" according to Holst Swende.  Lessons learned  However, speaking on an online forum, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wrote that one or two months of further testing will be required before Byzantium can be deemed fully secure.  This might seem like a long time for a software that has been under such heavy development, but that's not to say there wasn't extensive security tests prior to release. Speaking on Reddit, ethereum developer Afri Schoedon said that Byzantium code had been available for several weeks before the hard fork, and was consistently passing all security checks before the bugs were discovered.  Ethereum relies on a number of security screening processes, but the one that probably didn't get sufficient airtime prior to release is what's known as a ""fuzzer"" – an automated testing process that can draw out the most subtle of code weaknesses.  This is a new security check for ethereum, and as core developer Peter Szilagyi explained, ""It takes polish and effort to really make it part of the workflows.""  He continued: ""Rest assured that the fuzzer will be a much more organic part of the next fork preparation.""  The fuzzer is now running to ensure the safety of Byzantium, and, so far, no bugs have been discovered since the hard fork. And while the whole experience has led some developers to vouch for more careful updating in the future, the ethereum team doesn't seem keen on dialing back its more aggressive approach to blockchain upgrades.  As Schoedon said:  ""Lesson learned for future hard forks. Probably we will only decide on a block number after all client implementations are prepared.""

First filed in February, the patent describes a data transfer and logging system, with a blockchain used to track trades and clearing positions. The patent application was originally published in August and names Sweden-based Johan Toll and Fredrik Sjöblom as the inventors.  According to the text of the patent, transactions within the system occur through a two-step process. Each transaction gets logged in two blocks: one that records the transaction as it comes from the source to the intermediary, and a second as it passes through that intermediary to its destination.  The benefit of the system, the patent's authors state, is that blockchain could serve as a way to boost efficiency in clearing house processes.  ""It would thus be desirable to improve the speed and efficiency by which clearing and settlement, or both clearing and settlement processes may be performed in a computerized environment. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that new and improved techniques, systems, and processes in this area of technology are continually sought after,"" they write.

At the event, the council will brief members of the EU parliament and representatives from the European Commission on the challenges and solutions offered by blockchain technology.  Launched in January at the annual World Economic Forum meetings, the group serves as a forum for educating government and business leaders on blockchain – a mission emphasized by Kaili in statements accompanying the unveiling.  Kaili said:  ""Forums like this pave the way for comprehensive collaboration between the private sector and regulators that will enable innovative platforms and smart solutions to be developed – maximizing the potential that blockchain technologies can offer.""  In context, the conference is also the latest sign that EU governing bodies have taken an interest in the technology, holding hearings, commissioning research and exploring blockchain use cases.  The common market's open approach to the technology will have important tailwinds for blockchain's development and acceptance, noted Jamie Smith, chief executive officer of the advocacy group.  ""The EU is the world's largest economic bloc and among the most important regulatory and rule setting bodies in the world, and its position on blockchain technology will have deep implications across all 28 EU member states,"" she said.

42379972,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXMN,1508313624,What Comes After the Crypto Bubble?,"JoePindar is the director of strategy in the office of the chief technology officer at security firm Gemalto.  In this opinion piece, Pindar argues that the recent token craze is a blip, and that blockchain technology remains more important in the long term than any currency.      If you attend investment conferences or talk to long-time industry analysts, it's clear that that the general cryptocurrency market bubble is unsustainable.  There were 30 initial coin offerings (ICOs) in July, each launching new cryptocurrencies. Then, in August, there were more than 50, with marketing and investors ranging from Floyd Mayweather to Paris Hilton.  Now, part of this mania is based on speculation. But it's also clear that we’re departing from the fundamental assumption of what a cryptocurrency originally is – a scarce digital commodity where the value derives from that scarcity.  Select winners  Simply put, if more than 100 new sources of this digital commodity have been launched since the summer, then the entire concept of scarcity, and therefore value, begins to erode. In fact, many of these new cryptocurrencies will need to fail in order to maintain the viability of the best-known currencies, bitcoin and ether.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been around for two years, so it's a relatively known quantity. Most of the recent ICOs are based on the ERC-20 ethereum token, and the primary purchasing mechanism for new cryptocurrencies has been ether, the currency of the ethereum network.  Therefore, an investor often needs to buy ether in order to buy into any of the new ICOs.  But the crypto bubble of lesser-known currencies will pop at some point, leaving some people in a bad spot. Even so, the core technology behind it, blockchain, will provide value as a hidden infrastructure underlying future applications.  A small number of currencies – likely bitcoin and ethereum – and utility tokens where genuine value is created, will remain viable over the long term – although not necessarily at the current prices.  The fundamental premise of cryptocurrency, if it's not a scarce digital commodity, is that it is a token that allows access to a utility service. One of the few valid tokens that have been launched recently is IOTA, which is targeted at the Internet of Things market.  However, it's hard to justify building an IoT application using IOTA when surging token prices mean the cost of doing blockchain transactions doubles in seven days or increases by 500 percent over the course of a month, as it has recently done.  While IOTA has a strong long-term future, the ability to use it for IoT applications depends upon removal of the speculation-driven volatility. This shows the disconnect between the value proposition of utility tokens and the trading prices.  Tokenless blockchains  This is also a reminder that it's essential to separate blockchain technology from cryptocurrencies.  It is entirely possible to run a blockchain without a cryptocurrency, as demonstrated by Metrognomo, which predates and takes a similar approach to IOTA, but uses a subscription payment for nodes publishing to the network.  Another example is Quorum, JPMorgan Chase's permissioned, minimally-forked ethereum network, designed to promote private transactions for the enterprise.  So, even though a blockchain can be very useful for securing distributed systems and businesses, it does not justify the fundamentals of any cryptocurrency.  Blockchain's future is bright, just maybe a little less glamorous without the get-rich-quick investment aspect.

After signing up more than 100 businesses to build enterprise distributed ledger technology compatible with the ethereum blockchain, the group has added Sberbank, the nation's largest bank, to its growing list.  Revealed in interview with CoinDesk, Sberbank framed its addition to the alliance as a new way to capitalize on international markets.  Evgeniy Kravchenko, head of trade finance and correspondent banking at Sberbank, told CoinDesk:  ""The next step for our blockchain team will be operations with foreign-based financial institutions and other banks, to do some international transactions, to see how we can increase the transparency and improve the trust between banks and corporate clients.""  Already, Sberbank reported that it has completed at least two blockchain proofs-of-concept – one for a ""smart"" letter of credit and another for a letter of guarantee – working in cooperation with regulators, the minister of the economy, other banks and Russia's International Chamber of Commerce.  Kravchenko, however, said that its entrance into the EEA is part of a bid to go beyond the initial use cases its already tested.  ""We'll be working with other banks on projects in other business areas, apart from trade finance: payments, lending, retail, everything that's possible,"" he added.  Critical mass  But Kravchenko was keen not to suggest that he's limiting the scope of Sberbank's work just alliance members.  Instead, he says the bank is interested in continuing to work with Russian banks who aren't members of the EEA on new and existing projects.  ""The more players on the network, the better the network will be,"" said Kravchenko.  But Kravchenko is no blockchain maximalist. In fact, Kravchenko himself imagines a world where blockchain might not be exactly as necessary as some supporters think.  Using the Sibos conference as an example, he said it remains unknown if the technology could, say, replace or replicate the services offered by Swift, the interbank messaging service that also serves as conference host.  He concluded:  ""I think blockchain may influence all the parties who are represented here, because all the banks are here, Swift is here. But the main message from my side is we need to do it together and jointly with other players.""
