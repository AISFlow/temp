17691261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551561,1694818806,"Ethereum Surges Ahead Of Bitcoin In Active Addresses, What Does This Mean?","Since its inception, Ethereum has continuously been compared to Bitcoin with the former being hailed as a better option to the latter in some cases. As the years have flown by, the competition has gotten even fiercer, especially with ETH growing rapidly. Eventually, Ethereum seems to be catching up with Bitcoin, especially in terms of active addresses. Ethereum Active Addresses Surpass Bitcoin On Thursday, September 14, on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed a surprising update on the fierce rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the X post, the tracker revealed that the number of unique addresses that were transaction on the network had reached its second-highest daily figure of all time. Related Reading: Litecoin Eliminates Pre-Halving Gains As Volume Drops, Is A Fall To $50 Coming? While this is significant on the part of the blockchain alone, it is also significant in terms of the competition between the two largest assets in the space. To put this in perspective, the 1,089,893 figure reported by Santiment puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin in terms of this metric alone. The last time that the daily unique active addresses on the network hit its new all-time high was back in December 2022. So it has been almost a year since the metric was this high, suggesting a unique driving factor behind it. This report is also in line with the report from Artemis Terminal that shows that Ethereum was right in front of Bitcoin in terms of daily active addresses. ETH active addresses surpass BTC on Wednesday | Source: Artemis Terminal Artemis reports that on September 13, Ethereum saw a total of 1.03 million daily addresses compared to Bitcoin’s 743,800 addresses in the same time period. However, this figure has since retracted and Bitcoin has pulled in front of Ethereum once more as of September 14. What Does This Mean? While Ethereum’s surge on Wednesday was impressive, it does not mean much since the network has been unable to sustain the growth. Also, the surge could be easily explained by the rise in the popularity of the Friend.Tech decentralized finance social media platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wallet Activity Touches 5-Month High, Will BTC Price Follow? Friend.Tech had seemingly come back from the death to reach a new all-time high in its number of daily users. Since an ETH address is required to participate in the platform, it is no surprise there was an uptick in the number of ETH addresses active on the network. The spike in the number of daily active addresses also seems to have had little impact on the price of the cryptocurrency itself. ETH’s price is still struggling to hold above $1,600, with small gains of 0.35% in the last day and losses of 1.15% in the last week.

17689582,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551562,1694815207,Bye Bye Birdie: Binance Begins Process Of Axing BUSD Stablecoin,"Binance crypto exchange announced in late August that it is moving to end support for its beloved BUSD stablecoin. This move comes amid the stablecoin’s run-in with regulators, leading to a halt in its production. And now, the exchange has started moving to begin the end of support for the stablecoin. Binance Starts Burning Tokens Binance took to its official X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday, September 14, to announce that it would begin burning a number of Binance-pegged tokens. Among the five tokens listed to be burned, four were BUSD tokens across different blockchains. Related Reading: Analyst’s Ultra Bullish Prediction Puts XRP Price At $10,000, But When? According to the announcement, the Binance-pegged tokens would be burned on the listed blockchains, and then the exchange would release the equivalent amount of tokens that were initially used as collateral on their native networks. Later today, #Binance will burn a number of idle Binance-pegged tokens. The equivalent amount of tokens on their native networks, which were used as collateral, will then be released. Tokens: 🔸TUSDOLD (BSC) 🔸BUSD (MATIC) 🔸BUSD (BSC) 🔸BUSD (BNB) 🔸BUSD (TRX) — Binance (@binance) September 14, 2023 The BUSD tokens listed across four networks include BUSD on the Polygon (MATIC) network, BUSD on the Tron (TRX) network, BUSD on BSC, and BUSD (BNB). In addition to these, the exchange also revealed that the TUSDOLD on BSC would be burned as well, making it the only token on this list that is not BUSD. The collateral in this case will be the equivalent of the Binance-pegged tokens that are burned. So if 1,000 BUSD on the MATIC network is burned, then the equivalent on the native blockchain will be released by the exchange. Fire In The BUSD Camp The BUSD stablecoin first came under fire in early 2023 when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to issuer Paxos alleging that the stablecoin was an unregistered security. The regulator, through this, made its intention to pursue legal action known. Following the move by the SEC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) asked the issuer to stop printing new tokens. The NYDFS’s concern mainly bordered on Paxos’ relationship with Binance, and eventually, the BUSD issuer decided to cut ties with the crypto exchange. Since the initial move by regulators, the stablecoin has suffered in terms of usage and market cap. The stablecoin which was once a top 10 crypto by market cap has since seen its market cap decline to $2.5 billion, making it the 26-largest cryptocurrency as of the time of this writing. Related Reading: New Reports Shows How Much Capital Was Pulled Out Of Crypto In August Binance has also announced plans to stop offering support for the stablecoin completely by 2024. Paxos also revealed that it will cease all BUSD redemptions in February 2024, and Binance’s complete withdrawal is expected to come shortly after this. Nevertheless, the stablecoin continues to maintain its dollar peg quite well. It is still trading at a 1:1 parity with the United States dollar and has rarely dipped below $1 amid the regulatory storm.

These insights were shared in a video uploaded on the analyst’s YouTube channel. Signs Of A Potential Bull Run According to the recent revelations by Crypto Michael, Bitcoin might be on the brink of a new bull run. In his video, which has garnered over 2,000 views on YouTube, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency shows considerable resilience and potential for a surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Begins Rally As Franklin Templeton Joins Race For BTC Spot ETF This optimism stems from various indicators and patterns observed in Bitcoin’s price action. It’s not just Bitcoin’s impending rise that Crypto Michael has highlighted. The analyst also mentions that the altcoin market is warming up for a possible upward trend. The expert believes the significance of this parallel bullish movement for altcoins cannot be underestimated. It is worth noting that a comprehensive bull market, including both Bitcoin and its altcoin counterparts, could mean significant gains for diversified crypto portfolios. $45,000 Ahead Of The Bitcoin Halving? Diving deeper into his analysis, Crypto Michael predicts a potential Bitcoin price of $45,000 before the much-anticipated halving event next year. A halving is crucial in the Bitcoin network, where miners’ rewards for adding new blocks to the blockchain are cut in half. This event typically decreases supply and can significantly influence Bitcoin’s price. Historically, the crypto market has experienced bullish trends before and after halvings. This cyclical behavior has been observed in the past two halvings, with price surges leading up to and following the event. However, the current market dynamics have left investors in a speculative state, pondering if history will repeat itself. Particularly, Bitcoin has shown a bearish trend over the past month, down by nearly 10%. The asset plunged from its high of $30,000 in late July to as low as trading just above $25,000 on Monday. However, Bitcoin’s price can be seen to show signs of recovery in the past few weeks. The asset trades above $26,000 at the time of writing, with a price of $26,338 and a market cap of $513 billion today. Notably, Bitcoin’s market cap is currently up by more than $10 billion compared to its recent market cap value of below $500 billion, seen earlier this month.

It is worth noting that while its market cap and price have surged over the past two weeks, the asset’s trading has trended in the opposite direction. Particularly, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has plunged from the $18 billion seen earlier this month to as low as $10 billion, in the last 24 hours.

17685968,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551588,1694808044,Holesky Testnet Takes Flight On Merge Anniversary Amidst Ethereum 30-Day Slump,"One year has passed since the Ethereum (ETH) Merge, which marked the integration of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain with the Ethereum Mainnet. This significant milestone facilitated the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from the legacy proof-of-work (PoW) system to a PoS model, giving rise to Ethereum 2.0. The completion of the Merge on September 15, 2022, brought about a major shift in Ethereum’s energy consumption, with an expected reduction of 99.95%. Additionally, this transition opened up new possibilities for scaling the Ethereum ecosystem. The merge involved migrating the entire blockchain to new PoS validator nodes, which require participants to stake or lock up 32 Ether (ETH) to participate in the network. Importantly, this transition did not impact Ether tokens held by investors, and the operations of Ethereum-based applications remained unchanged. As Ethereum celebrated the first anniversary of The Merge, it introduced its latest testnet called Holesky. Related Reading: Artist Stages Crypto Protest In Front Of US SEC With “Rug Pull” Exhibit The Future Of Ethereum Development And Testing? Initially known as Holli, the Holesky testnet is designed to enhance the testing environment on Ethereum. Drawing inspiration from a vibrant neighborhood in Prague, Czech Republic, this new testnet offers various improvements over its predecessor, Goerli. According to a blog post from the software development firm Tatum, Holesky is set to replace Goerli as the primary testnet for staking, infrastructure, and protocol development. For testing decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-related functions, the Sepolia testnet remains the preferred choice. Holesky, on the other hand, serves as Ethereum’s merged-from-genesis public testnet, mirroring mainnet functionalities and enabling precise evaluations through thorough staking trials, infrastructure assessments, and direct protocol developer testing. To ensure rigorous testing, Holesky aims to have twice as many active validators as the main Ethereum network. The network starts with a solid foundation of 1 million validators, encouraging teams to run a substantial number of validators, with each team handling around 100,000 validators. These measures contribute to the comprehensive evaluation of the testnet and intended functionality. According to Tatum’s blog post, by introducing Holesky and refining inflation mechanisms based on the Sepolia testnet, Ethereum continues to evolve and improve its protocols. One Year After The Merge In a recent post on X (Formerly Twitter), the self-proclaimed Ethereum Educator, who goes by the pseudonym “Sassal.eth,” highlighted some notable statistics on the first anniversary of The Merge. One significant achievement for Ethereum since the Merge is burning 980,000 ETH tokens, resulting in a permanent reduction of Ethereum’s total supply. Burning ETH involves removing tokens from circulation, contributing to potential scarcity and value. Additionally, the Ethereum 2.0 network has seen a significant 11.6 million ETH being staked, which involves locking up ETH as collateral to participate in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Moreover, according to Sassal, adding 362,000 new validators has strengthened the Ethereum network. Validators are crucial in proposing and validating new blocks, ensuring the network’s security and overall robustness. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 & Beyond On the other hand, Ethereum’s native token, ETH, has experienced a tumultuous journey in terms of its price performance since the beginning of the year. Despite reaching an annual high of $2,144 on April 16, ETH has been impacted by the overall market trend, resulting in significant losses across various time frames. Currently, ETH is trading at $1,619, representing a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Similarly, over the past seven days, the token has recorded a decrease of 0.9%. Looking at the fourteen and 30-day time frames, ETH has experienced declines of 1% and 11.3%, respectively, underscoring the prevailing downward trend for the token’s value. However, it is worth noting that since the occurrence of The Merge, ETH has witnessed a moderate rise of 7.6% year to date, according to Coingecko data.

42409676,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNOzG,1694807558,DOJ Slams Sam Bankman-Fried’s ‘Intrusive’ Proposed Jury Questions,"The U.S. Department of Justice thinks FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s proposed jury questions are “unnecessarily intrusive” and may be intended to support his defense.  Bankman-Fried and the DOJ both proposed voir dire questions earlier this week, ranging from standard queries about whether potential jurors were familiar with the case to more specific questions about whether they knew people with ADHD. These questions will help the prosecutor and defense determine a fair and impartial jury.  Several of Bankman-Fried’s proposed questions are “intrusive”, prosecutors wrote in the letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the Southern District of New York. They called out questions that probed potential jurors’ opinions toward FTX, the allegedly fraudulent crypto exchange that collapsed in spectacular fashion last November.  “The defense requests numerous open-ended questions about what opinions potential jurors have formed about the case, the defendant, and the defendant’s companies, and asks whether potential jurors can ‘completely ignore’ what they have previously seen,” the letter said. “This is unnecessarily intrusive, and goes beyond the purpose of voir dire.”  Questions about whether effective altruism – Sam Bankman-Fried’s claimed philosophical base – are not just unnecessary, but “are a thinly veiled attempt to advance a defense narrative that the defendant was simply ‘amassing wealth’ in order to ‘improve the world,’” the letter said.  Similarly, questions about ADHD, which Bankman-Fried takes medication for, are “irrelevant and prejudicial,” the filing said.  “The defense is foreclosed from raising a mental disease, defect, or condition defense – no notice of such a defense … was provided by the Court-imposed deadline,” the filing said. “Telling the jury that the defendant has ADHD would serve only to improperly cast the defendant at the outset of the trial in a sympathetic light.”  Trial prep  Prosecutors also have the trial’s tech infrastructure on their minds: They’ve requested a high-speed ethernet connection as well as a printer for the government’s use, plus headphones for the jury. “This will greatly facilitate the effective and efficient presentation of evidence,” they wrote in a letter to Judge Kaplan.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE,"Nikhilesh De, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/15/doj-slams-sam-bankman-frieds-intrusive-proposed-jury-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/550882cd1c9405cbe0c4bfae04412895bdfcb8a6-1937x1089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Even with the price drop over the last year, the meme coin still features as an investor favorite, surpassing the likes of Cardano and Dogecoin in countries with a large crypto investor presence. Shiba Inu Search Surpass Dogecoin And Cardano Google Trends has shown that interest in Shiba Inu has surged ahead of that of Dogecoin in Canada and the United States, as well as Cardano. The data which shows the movements over the past 12 months shows points in time where the search for Dogecoin had spiked significantly, leading to a remarkable lead by Dogecoin compared to Shiba Inu and Cardano. Related Reading: Analyst’s Ultra Bullish Prediction Puts XRP Price At $10,000, But When? However, as time has passed and periods of brief spikes have been left behind, the trends have indicated that Shiba Inu remains the asset of the three gaining investors’ attention. Since April 2023, SHIB has appeared ahead of both Cardano and Dogecoin with no end in sight for this trend. In September alone, the interest in Shiba Inu has come out more than double those of Cardano and Dogecoin. Even toward the end of August when the crypto market crashed and interest waned, Shiba Inu went in the opposite direction. SHIB trends higher than ADA and DOGE | Source: Google Trends This spike in interest shown in the chart above coincides with the launch of the Shibarium blockchain. The Layer 2 network built atop the Ethereum blockchain was in the works for a long time and when it eventually launched in August, it triggered renewed interest in the SHIB token which currently serves as its official governance token. SHIB Falls Behind Dogecoin In Profitability While Shiba Inu is leading in terms of interest, it has not translated to profitability for the meme coin’s holders. The percentage of SHIB holders currently seeing any kind of profit is at only 9% compared to 41% for DOGE holders, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Related Reading: New Reports Shows How Much Capital Was Pulled Out Of Crypto In August However, SHIB is still doing well compared to Cardano in this regard whose holder base is almost completely submerged in losses. Data shows that ADA holders in profit are sitting at a sad 4%. When put in contrast with SHIB’s numbers which is still disappointing, the meme coin is seeing twice as many holders in profit. In terms of price performance, all three have performed similarly when comparing their current prices to their all-time prices. SHIB is down 91.49% from its ATH, while Dogecoin and Cardano are down 91.59% and 91.89%, respectively, data from Messari shows.

42409692,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPjY,1694803457,"Bitcoin at $26.4K Set for Weekly Gain, but Rallies Might Continue to be Sold","The price of bitcoin (BTC) is modestly lower during U.S. trading hours on Friday, but at its current $26,300 is ahead about 2% from week-ago levels.  The crypto began the week with sizable losses, dipping below $25,000 for the first time since mid-June over worry bankrupt crypto exchange FTX was soon to begin unloading all of its digital assets, which included more than $500 million worth of bitcoin.  While FTX did receive court permission to begin selling, the sales will be at a measured pace and unlikely to cause any quick tumbles in crypto markets.  Bitcoin (BTC) price crash averted, but rallies continue to be sold  The overarching theme in bitcoin and crypto in general for nearly four months now is the speed with which even modest moves higher get reversed.  As the FTX news this week demonstrates, while at the moment there don't appear to be any entities interested in a full-scale dumping of digital assets on the market, there remain numerous sellers looking to take advantage of rallies.  In addition to FTX, consider other impaired trading firms, lenders, and exchanges, as well as bitcoin miners – many of whom one year ago were confirmed hodlers, but now must sell at least part of their bitcoin stash each month to help fund their operating expenses.  Despite the selling pressure, this week's positive news about asset management giant Franklin Templeton joining the race to list a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) and global lender Deutsche Bank delving deeper into digital asset custody and tokenization might backstopped prices, rendering Monday's breakdown a false signal, according to crypto service provider Matrixport.  ""The Franklin Templeton-news was released as prices neared $25,100, coinciding with when the market became aware of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF filing in June,"" Matrixport noted in a market update on Telegram. ""Hence, this $25,000 level is of the utmost importance now, and appears to be fortified by news affecting prices.""  Bitcoin reclaiming the previous trading range and consolidating at these levels was a ""promising sign,"" according to Rachel Lin, CEO of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures.  ""BTC is currently in the process of converting the $26,000 level from resistance to support,"" Lin said in an emailed note. ""Until Wednesday, every attempt at breaking above this level resulted in heavy selling. If BTC stays above $26,000 by the end of the week, it could be a positive sign, at least in the short term.""  Altcoins signal weakness  Unfortunately, the broader crypto market is not as strong as BTC.  While bitcoin consolidated, the rest of the market showed signs of weakness. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the performance of a broad basket of digital assets, only gained 0.8% over the past seven days, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) outperformed and was up 1.7%.  Among CoinDesk's sectorial indices, the Culture and Entertainment sector (CNE) performed the worst with 3.2% loss in a week, followed by the DeFi sector (DCF) declining 1.6%.  ""Unfortunately, the broader crypto market is not as strong as BTC,"" Lin said. ""Their fall on Monday was bigger than BTC, and their bounce back was weaker. This led to the previous week's support level of 515-520 billion [market capitalization] turning into resistance.""  Apecoin (APE) was one of the week's biggest loser, dropping near 18% in a week ahead of its major token unlock due this Sunday. The event will release $43 million worth of tokens, giving early investors a chance for selling.

And, somehow, his biggest regret still seems wrapped up in his fallen public persona, as if the weekly court hearings and ongoing bankruptcy process are a detour from his life as a magnanimous, beloved statesman he was destined to live.  “I’m broke and wearing an ankle monitor and one of the most hated people in the world,” Bankman-Fried reportedly wrote. “There will probably never be anything I can do to make my lifetime impact net positive.”  To be fair, the NYT gave no indication of the real context of why or when Bankman-Fried wrote this down, and it is essentially a personal diary that was leaked to the press. But: What. The. Hell. How unbelievably self-involved does a person have to be to write that they feel broke after losing so much money for so many people.  It’s true Bankman-Fried’s lifestyle came crashing down along with his company — he had a taste for luxury real estate, private jets and on-demand delivery. It’s all just another example of how his reputation as a Corolla-driving billionaire schlub was a front.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Cosplayed as a Genius | Opinoin  Worse, he reportedly wrote: “And the truth is that I did what I thought was right.” Taken together with the line above, this is exactly the same “ends justify the means” mentality that got Bankman-Fried in trouble in the first place.  A lot has been written about SBF’s breed of “effective altruism” and why people who pursue profit at all cost because they think they’d be more impactful choosing how to give away their wealth is ultimately … ineffective. But a recent Bloomberg Businessweek article about SBF’s parents, the Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried shows again how certain philosophies have a family resemblance.  Bankman and Fried were supportive of SBF on his rise to fame, and remain so in his infamy – despite the fact that he’s thrown their multi-million dollar property in limbo by breaking bail. Bankman, in particular, was reportedly a familiar face at FTX where he regularly attended the closest things to board meetings the grossly mismanaged business had, and gave tax advice. Bloomberg reported that he was treated as a kindly old man, responsible for translating his sometimes hot-headed son’s comments and acting as a sounding board as SBF tried to determine the “right” move.  If SBF got his “business sense,” whatever that’s worth, from his dad, he seems to have inherited his mom’s entire system of ethics. SBF has a reputation as a leading consequentialist philosopher, the people who think seriously about the Trolley Problem – or abstract scenarios hypothesizing on whether it’s better to let a train run over one person or turn a lever that would kill many.  See also: The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  And so it was a family of would-be do-gooders, along with Gabe Bankman-Fried, Sam’s younger brother, who ran a charitable organization funded almost entirely by FTX dollars (and who spent his time daydreaming of buying a private island on which to do bleeding edge lifetime extension research without interference). But, like, aren’t consequentialists supposed to actually think about the consequences of their actions? Or were the Bahamian vacation properties always the end goal?  Although Bankman-Fried seems unwilling or unable to confront his own choices, in his private writing he seems to dote on the mistakes of those around him. Most regrettably, Bankman-Fried has seemingly constructed a narrative that his ex-girlfriend and ex-employee Caroline Ellison is really at fault. At one point, he literally writes that Ellison oversaw one bad trade that led to bankruptcies at FTX and Alameda. It was her who failed to hedge the hedge fund.  And while he was vaguely aware of the “Fiat@” account used to pilfer customer funds, SBF had nothing to do with it. Instead, dastardly lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm overseeing FTX’s bankruptcy, constructed the narrative that he misappropriated user funds.  It’s just odd, before he was caught up in a world of trouble, that Bankman-Fried was unconcerned with consequences and now that the ends he wanted are totally unreachable he remains unconcerned. It’s just a shame, considering that in a document titled “Truth” he said: “It’s something that I believe fairly strongly in.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/15/sam-bankman-fried-blames-everyone-but-himself-for-ftxs-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f901c2d2e024a35f30f4bb5e879fb7d2dc42fca1-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409672,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNOm2,1694801053,What Crypto Can Learn From AI About Getting Its Way in Washington,"This past week, executives from leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies met with a bipartisan group of senior U.S. Senators. It was only the latest indication that Washington has turned its full attention to AI technology. The technology has been the subject of a presidential address and even a voluntary agreement between government and companies to mitigate potential risks. The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, among the most active U.S. regulators, has also begun to examine the implications of AI.  John Rizzo is Senior Vice President for Public Affairs at Clyde Group. Rizzo most recently served as the Senior Spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury where he led public affairs strategy on digital assets, among other issues.  Like life, political, legal, and regulatory scrutiny can come at you fast. As the AI industry looks into the future, it needs only to look at the recent past to the federal government’s approach to crypto assets to see what’s ahead.  Crypto and AI folk might blanch at being tossed into the same bucket because there are fundamental, substantive differences between the two. AI’s applications are much broader than tokens that might serve as a store of value or means of exchange. And AI’s use cases are tangible, whereas crypto proponents and opponents debate the necessity behind private sources of money. Culturally, AI is buttoned up, whereas crypto might as well have no buttons at all.  Still, suppose the AI industry wants to know how Washington will approach its emerging technology. In that case, it needs only to look at how it approached crypto’s emerging technology to understand several core lessons and strategies for the way forward.  The U.S.’s technology politics have changed since the rise of the internet. Populist impulses on both sides of the aisle leave the AI industry facing a highly skeptical Congress that questions the industry’s core outputs and motives. While AI will not have to justify its existence to lawmakers as crypto assets supporters have been forced to do, there will be no presumption of innocence. Key lawmakers in both parties will assume AI is up to no good unless it shows them otherwise.  Read more: John Rizzo - How PayPal Upended the Crypto Debate in Washington D.C.  Media gatekeepers are weaker than ever, leaving the public, which is already distrustful of large corporations and institutions, vulnerable to rumor and disinformation. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Americans relied heavily on traditional media sources. Today, more Americans get their news from their favored social media app, which likely prioritizes content that engages (sensationalizes) rather than educates. And when constituents are whipped up by trending topics and viral posts, lawmakers have less political freedom to craft middle-of-the-road policies. Just as crypto market participants have suffered from the public’s focus on a small number of bad actors, the AI industry will be held politically liable when machine learning produces sub-optimal outcomes, even if machine learning outcomes are more often statistically superior than processes managed by humans.  While the AI industry may be able to see the ghosts of Christmas future in crypto’s challenges in D.C., a critical difference will make the AI industry’s effort to find success in the city both more achievable and complicated.  Crypto market participants have sought to penetrate America’s most highly regulated sector, financial services, which can be immune to the move fast and break things ethos that helped companies like Uber and Lyft outflank entrenched transportation policies in the early 2010s. Crypto market participants have yet to turn the popularity of their assets into a ramrod that can move Washington in line with their favored regulatory framework.  The AI industry seeks to penetrate multiple sectors, some with less established regulation than others. This will allow AI market participants to outflank policymakers in certain areas. However, AI will face substantial financial policy challenges that dwarf what the crypto industry has faced. Just this week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler raised the question of whether using artificial intelligence in the financial system could heighten systemic risk in the financial system. It’s not hard to conceive of. Suppose prominent market participants use machine learning to trigger certain financial transactions during a crisis. While an individual firm may benefit from reducing its exposure to a troubled sector of the economy, the collective effect of multiple firms engaging in the same practice could create the kind of cascading margin calls that lead to systemic risk in the financial system.  As the AI industry examines D.C.’s approach to crypto and glimpses into its future political risks and policy fights, how can it avoid ending up in the same regulatory logjam that crypto finds itself in?  The AI industry must recognize its two crucial, yet interrelated, advantages over its opponents and press them quickly. While D.C. policymakers have raised concerns about the implications of broader AI adoption, neither party has concluded how it would like the industry to be regulated. This harkens back to a time before Democrats concluded that crypto assets were securities, and Republicans concluded they were most certainly not. Once AI policy becomes balkanized, as crypto has become, achieving a workable regulatory framework will be much more challenging.  The lack of hardened policy positions in either party creates an opportunity for the AI industry to press another advantage, namely the massive amounts of capital it has. The industry needs to use that capital to run a considerable public affairs campaign that folds AI technology into the broader American story, highlighting the technology’s benefits to everyday Americans and making the case for keeping the next generation of innovation in America. Crypto waited too long to make the case to the American public. While the crypto industry can still galvanize the public to its side, the task is more complicated and more resource-intensive.  Suppose the AI industry chooses to take advantage of the unsettled policy conversation among lawmakers and launch a campaign to win the American people’s favor. In that case, it must do so differently than how the crypto industry has approached the task. Whereas crypto initially tried to influence lawmakers in D.C., the AI industry should understand that lawmakers’ favor is won at home through campaigns in vital congressional districts and states that make an affirmative case for the technology, its impact, and its potential. Activity in D.C. is how movements finish a job with lawmakers that began in their constituencies.  As key AI industry executives return from D.C., they will have confronted a city at a crossroads on artificial intelligence. They can follow the same path that crypto market participants have trodden or embark on a new road. One that will perhaps make all the difference.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/15/what-crypto-can-learn-from-ai-about-getting-its-way-in-washington,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be82eff8c62140cd635d179854cb37a8158c8ba6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Earlier this week, Genesis and its parent company, Digital Currency Group, said more than 230,000 retail creditors who used Gemini’s Earn program stand to be made “nearly whole” under a proposed remuneration deal to be voted on later this year. Earn was offered to customers of the Gemini crypto exchange, but Genesis supplied the financial infrastructure that ran the program. (Genesis, like CoinDesk, is owned by DCG.)  Read more: Beleaguered Gemini Earn Customers Will Be Made ‘Nearly Whole,’ DCG and Genesis Say About Remuneration Plan  But Gemini said Friday that Gemini Earn users will not recover “anything close [to the] real value” of the money they’re owed under the proposal.  “DCG touts proposed recovery rates that are a total mirage – misleading at best and deceptive at worst,” Gemini’s lawyers said in the filing. “Make no mistake: Gemini Lenders will not actually receive anything close in real value terms to the proposed recovery rates under the current ‘agreement in principle.’”  DCG owes more than $1.65 billion to the beleaguered crypto lender Genesis, which, in turn, owes some $1.2 billion to Gemini. Genesis owes over $3 billion to its top 50 creditors overall.  That money, under DCG’s proposed repayment plan, would be paid across two tranches and seven years, and would eventually make Gemini Earn users ""nearly whole,"" according to DCG's lawyers.  Gemini’s lawyers, however, challenged that assertion, alleging DCG’s proposal would allow the firm to pay “par” recoveries through “inadequate” below-market loans.  “Receiving a fractional share of interest and principal payments over seven years from an incredibly risky counterparty … is not even remotely equivalent to receiving the actual cash and digital assets owed today by Genesis to the Gemini Lenders,” Gemini’s lawyers said in the filing.  They added: “DCG’s [proposal] is markedly parallel to … an attempt to satisfy its significant obligations through the issuance of ‘I.O.U.s’ instead of paying any real cash and digital assets.”  In addition, the lawyers complained more broadly about DCG’s efforts to ""wear … down"" Genesis' creditors ""in the hopes that they [would] become desperate enough to take a significant haircut just to move on.""  Gemini and DCG have feuded for months over Genesis' debts to Gemini.

Related Reading: New Reports Shows How Much Capital Was Pulled Out Of Crypto In August Crypto Art Exhibition Takes Jab At Scams According to a release shared with NewsBTC, a crypto art installation was placed in front of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This time, Nelson Saiers portrayed a street vendor offering “rug pulls.” In this latest protest exhibition, Saiers highlighted the crypto-based scam where the team behind a project disappears, leaving their community behind and “holding the bag” for an initial investment. The exhibit aimed to showcase the “ease” of these illegal activities. Moreover, by setting the crypto art exhibit in front of the SEC, the artist potentially tried to send a message to the regulator: “rug pulls” happened right in front of the institution, seemingly without consequence. In an exclusive statement shared with NewsBTC, the artist believes the SEC’s shortcomings extended beyond failing to safeguard retail customers. While he acknowledges they have a “very difficult job”, Saiers believes that the regulator was “too lax” in some ways but also “too aggressive in others.” The artist feels that the SEC’s rejection of certain investments may have, “unfortunately,” led some investors into more fraudulent products. This is the latest, but far from the only art exhibition where Saiers takes a hit on the US SEC and other financial regulators. As mentioned, the artist set an inflatable Bitcoin rat at the Fed’s building in 2020 and 2018. A few months later, as the crypto market was experiencing a bull run that took the price of Bitcoin into uncharted territory, Saiers called cheap on the Fed with his “Cheap Money is Out-of-Order.” During this exhibition, which saw the sculpture of the Wall Street Bull interfered with a Saiers-made sculpture, the artist criticized the inflationary measures adopted by the financial institution. Based in New York, Saiers completed a Ph.D. in mathematics at 23 in one year and is a former trading group manager for Deutsche Bank AG and Chief Investment Officer for Saiers Capital. In art, Saiers is known as the “Warhol of Wall Street.” As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,200 with sideways movement across the board. The cryptocurrency has been unable to break above or below its current trading range and will likely continue this trajectory until late September.

17679529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551447,1694794987,"Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 & Beyond","Dogecoin has been one of the most surprising and discussed cryptocurrencies since its launch in 2013. Its meme-inspired origins and 2021 hype led to spectacular price rises. This Dogecoin price prediction article analyzes factors impacting the coin’s value and predicts its future trajectory. What is Dogecoin? Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke based on the popular Doge meme in 2013. Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created it satirizing the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies. But what began as a parody became one of the largest cryptocurrencies. DOGE runs on its own blockchain with miners validating transactions. Key features include: Meme-inspired The Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme is its mascot. This makes it more approachable for mainstream investors, as does its low price compared to other assets. Large supply Over 140 billion DOGE have been mined so far compared to Bitcoin’s limit of 21 million. Low price per coin Due to the high circulation supply, DOGE trades at a fraction of a dollar making it attractive for first-time investors. Faster transactions DOGE offers faster payments than Bitcoin with 1 minute block times. Tipping currency The DOGE community utilizes it extensively for tipping and donations, especially on Reddit and Twitter. While DOGE lacks the sophistication of platforms like Ethereum, its brand awareness makes it appealing as a payment option. Major companies like AMC Theatres and the Dallas Mavericks basketball team accept DOGE payments. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond Factors Impacting Dogecoin Price Several key factors influence DOGE’s notably volatile prices: Celebrities and Billionaires Public figures like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban endorsing DOGE carry outsized influence, drawing in retail investors and moving its price. Media Hype Attention from mainstream media outlets drives up interest and prices rapidly as seen in early 2021. But it works both ways, with DOGE falling out of favor just as fast. Meme Power As a meme-based asset, DOGE trends on social media significantly impact its price as hype spreads or fades. The community plays a central role. Development Activity While work has slowed, some upgrades like lower fees have the potential to improve DOGE adoption if development regains momentum. Broader Crypto Market Like most altcoins, DOGE price depends heavily on Bitcoin’s price action. When Bitcoin crashes, memecoins like DOGE usually crash harder. Competitors An endless stream of new memecoins like Shiba Inu and Pepe compete for investors’ attention and dollars, which impacts DOGE market share. Historical Dogecoin Price Timeline Looking at major developments in DOGE’s history sheds light on patterns governing its volatile price. 2013 – The Joke Begins Dogecoin was created as a “joke currency” by programmers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in December 2013. The price remained extremely low, trading for a tiny fraction of a penny during the first year. 2014-2016 – Gaining Attention In 2014, DOGE gained more mainstream attention during the Doge meme’s resurgence, with its market cap reaching over $60 million by end of 2014. Dogecoin was used extensively for charitable fundraisers and tipping on Reddit/Twitter. But the price remained under one cent between 2014-2016. 2017 – Bull Run Ride When crypto markets boomed in 2017, DOGE saw massive gains fuelled by speculation, rising from $0.0002 and peaking at $0.018 in January 2018 – a 9,000 percent rise in 2 months! But it crashed soon after, dropping 90% in just over a month following the broader crypto downturn. Still, DOGE had proven it couldn’t be ignored. 2018-2020 – Slump Despite Growing Adoption During the 2018-2020 bear market, DOGE struggled to gain traction again. Its price declined gradually losing over 90% of its value and falling below $0.002 in early 2019. However, real-world payment adoption grew with providers like CoinPayments, LivingRoomOfSatoshi, and Bitpay supporting DOGE payments on e-commerce sites. 2021 – Rocketing to Fame The 2021 bull run, especially Elon Musk’s repeated endorsements of DOGE, sent it rocketing from under one cent in January 2021 to an astonishing high of $0.7 in May 2021 – a truly unbelievable 40,000% return in four months! Other key drivers included: Mainstream media coverage during the price surge. DOGE graced the covers of Newsweek and Time Magazine. Increased crypto adoption, especially among retail investors using platforms like Robinhood Major brands like Snickers and Slim Jim referenced DOGE on social media, amplifying the hype. Mark Cuban’s Dallas Mavericks began accepting DOGE as payment. Exchange listings like eToro adding DOGE stoked investor interest. Like past cycles, such parabolic rises proved unsustainable. DOGE dropped steadily after the frenzied peak, closing the year at around $0.15. Still an impressive overall return for 2021. 2022 – Price Crash Despite Celebrity Involvement The 2022 crypto bear market hit DOGE hard, causing it to shed over 90% of its value, dropping below $0.05 by June 2022. Attempts were made to revive interest, including Elon Musk’s announcement that SpaceX would accept DOGE payments for merchandise purchases. Mark Cuban’s basketball team continued accepting DOGE as payment. But macroeconomic headwinds have kept prices depressed close to all-time lows, highlighting the weakness of memecoins during downturns. Recent Dogecoin Price Action 2023 hasn’t been much friendlier to Dogecoin, with the cryptocurrency unable to make it above the $0.10 level and is back trading at $0.06 and is at risk of new lows. Short-Term Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2023 DOGE outlook remains ambiguous for 2023 as the crypto markets struggle to regain footing after the FTX fallout. The meme coin remains locked in a downtrend, with the next level of support back down at under a penny. While this might feel impossible, Bitcoin retested its former 2017 all-time high, which is at the same precise point as the 1.618 Fibonacci extension target. If Dogecoin can hold the current lows, it could retarget the 0.618 or 0.382 retracement level. Medium-Term Dogecoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2025 If Dogecoin can break out of its downtrend and prevent further collapse, the next logical target is the 1.618 upside Fibonacci extension. If you notice, DOGE touched this target in the previous two bull markets. In 2021, DOGE extended even further to the 2.414 Fibonacci. The 1.618 Fib extension would put Dogecoin above $3.60. Long-Term Dogecoin Price Forecast 2030 Predicting the future of a meme cryptocurrency is challenging. However, using a linear mean trajectory drawn through each cycle, we can estimate that Dogecoin could be anywhere between $1.50 and $5 by the time 2030 rolls around. This model assumes no catastrophic failure of the blockchain. Dogecoin Price Predictions – Conclusion Despite gaining immense popularity and value during the 2021 hype, Dogecoin lacks the real-world utility and institutional investment of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Unless Dogecoin evolves beyond its meme-based appeal through protocol development and real use cases, it appears set to remain as a highly speculative asset prone to boom and bust cycles based on hype. While another frenzy-driven price surge cannot be ruled out, Dogecoin’s sustainability as a long-term store of value remains doubtful according to most analysts. Traders and investors should tread cautiously with appropriate risk management. Dogecoin Price Prediction FAQs Here are some frequently asked questions about DOGE price prediction targets: What was Dogecoin’s lowest price? During its initial days in 2013-2014, DOGE hit lows of $0.0001-0.0002 on crypto exchanges. Its recent low was $0.044 in June 2022. What was Dogecoin’s highest price? DOGE hit an all-time high of $0.7376 during the 2021 frenzy phase in early May, rising astronomically from $0.005 in January 2021. How high can DOGE realistically go? Considering its past performance driven heavily by hype and celebrity endorsements, DOGE may potentially reach up to $1 temporarily during frenzied market conditions, but has poor fundamentals for sustaining high valuations long-term. Can DOGE crash to zero? While unlikely due to its enduring popularity as a memecoin and brand recognition, Dogecoin crashing to near-zero cannot be completely ruled out without renewed development and adoption efforts. Why is DOGE so volatile? Extreme volatility is built into Dogecoin’s DNA as a meme asset heavily dependent on social media hype and investor speculation rather than fundamental utility value. When will Dogecoin’s price stabilize? DOGE price is likely to remain volatile until (and if) it can mature beyond its “joke coin” origins and develop greater real-world utility and stable demand.

42409677,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNOvx,1694793629,"Coinbase’s Base Blockchain Hits Record High for Daily Transactions, Eclipsing Rivals","Coinbase’s layer 2 blockchain, Base, which launched in early August, has seen its daily transactions hit an all-time high, according to data from IntoTheBlock.  Base saw 1.88 million transactions on Thursday, higher than layer 2 rivals Arbitrum and Optimism combined, which saw 780,000 and 370,000, respectively.  “Interestingly, it is not decentralized finance (DeFi) applications nor non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces driving the surge in Base's activity. Instead, a significant portion of usage can be attributed to a new social application, FriendTech,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.  Decentralized social network platform Friend.tech is built on Base and calls itself “the marketplace for your friends.” The platform saw increased usage over the last week, with its daily transactions also reaching an all-time high. Friend.tech’s transactions reached 529,000, according to data from IntoTheBlock. The increase was partly driven by users aiming to get points that will later be used for an airdrop, according to IntoTheBlock.  In early August, when Friend.tech launched, Base also witnessed a surge in activity as its launch drove daily active users to a record high. Base also averaged a record high of 15.88 transactions per second, surpassing Ethereum and other rival layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum and Optimism in August. Much of the increased activity was attributed to Friends.Tech.  Notably, transactions on Friend.tech saw a significant decline following its initial surge, declining from its 525,000 peak in early August to 51,000 at the end of August. Base’s daily transactions also witnessed a lull over the same time period.  IntoTheBlock attributes the recent uptick in activity on Base to Ethereum’s layer 2 ecosystems evolving with players becoming “more specialized in their own niche.” “Base has quickly become the L2 with the most unique addresses and transactions, fueled by Coinbase’s wide reach, making it a strong candidate for social applications like FriendTech to thrive,” said IntoTheBlock.  Friend.tech also didn't drive up congestion and fees on Ethereum the way frenzies have in the past – which some analysts pointed to being possibly a sign that the blockchain's efforts to scale by fostering supplemental “layer-2” networks, like Coinbase's new Base, are bearing fruit.

17678864,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551549,1694793620,The Great Exodus: Why Are Japanese Investors Choosing XRP Over Bitcoin?,"A recent study has revealed that Japanese investors are choosing to invest in Ripple’s XRP over the world’s flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. XRP Over Bitcoin And Ethereum In contrast to the treatment Ripple and the XRP token are receiving in the US, Japan seems more welcoming to the crypto asset, according to a research paper by the Department of Economics and Finance at the City University of Hong Kong. Related Reading: Analyst’s Ultra Bullish Prediction Puts XRP Price At $10,000, But When? According to the report, XRP is preferred over the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum. It referenced a survey conducted by the Japanese crypto exchange BITMAX, with 25% of the 1,498 respondents who took the survey choosing XRP as their favorite cryptocurrency, while 26% and 9% chose Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. While this survey may be considered insufficient to prove Japanese investors’ preference for the XRP token, it suggests that the token has quite the following in the country. Interestingly, XRP enjoyed the highest spot trading volume in February last year, with “nearly 1.36 billion units” traded during that period. The report attributed Japan’s fondness for the token to the country’s customs and “the confidence that Japan’s largest venture capital fund has in Ripple.” The venture capital firm in question is SBI Holdings, with the company being one of Ripple’s early partners. SBI allegedly invested close to $300 million in Ripple in 2017. SBI Holdings A “Primary Driver Of Ripple’s Success” The report labels SBI holdings as the “primary driver of Ripple’s success” in Japan. This assertion may not be far-fetched, especially considering SBI’s role in helping Ripple break into the Japanese market. In 2016, the financial services company partnered with Ripple to create SBI Ripple Asia with the goal of providing cross-border payment services to banks in the Asian region. Using Ripple’s distributed ledger technology (DLT), these banks can process cross-border transactions in “40 currencies and more than 70 countries.” SBI Ripple was to service banks in countries like Japan, China, South Korea, and other Southeast Asian countries. This move undoubtedly paved the way for Ripple and its XRP token to penetrate the Asian market (Japan in particular) early enough, especially when non-cash payments were on the rise in those countries. Related Reading: The Real Reason Behind That Bitcoin Transaction With A $500,000 Fee Has Been Revealed Ripple and XRP’s adoption in the Asian region is also expected to grow further as SBI Remit (a subsidiary company under SBI Holdings) recently expanded the SBI Ripple Asia partnership with the introduction of an XRP-based international remittance service for banks in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. This move aligns with Ripple’s goal to disrupt the global financial system as the crypto asset will be used as a bridge currency for foreigners who want to send money to their families back home. Impressively, Ripple’s Ledger can process these transactions faster and more affordably than the traditional financial system.

As part of the development, global reinsurance company Munich Re has crafted an insurance product dedicated to reducing risks of slashing, the companies announced in a press release Tuesday. Slashing stands for penalizing validators in a proof-of-stake blockchain for violating network rules or malicious activity with suspended or lost staked tokens.  This is the latest example of well-established financial institutions building out their crypto chops as the digital asset industry matures and increasingly intertwines with traditional investment services.  Earlier this week, it was reported that Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, was working with Taurus on digital asset custody and tokenization, and HSBC, another global banking leader, was partnering with crypto custody firm Fireblocks. In the U.S., asset management giant Franklin Templeton joined the race for listing the first spot bitcoin ETF.  Boerse Stuttgart Digital is part of the Boerse Stuttgart Group, which says it's Europe’s sixth-largest stock exchange group. The company earlier this year obtained a license to custody digital assets from German finance watchdog BaFin via its subsidiary Blocknox GmbH.  Expanding its custody service with staking allows Boerse Stuttgart Digital and its clients to earn rewards on the assets stored with the firm.  “We have noticed an increasing interest from institutional investors in the staking sector, eagerly anticipating the chance to participate, provided they have complete confidence in the security of the environment,” Dr. Oliver Vins, managing director of Boerse Stuttgart Digital, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/15/german-finance-heavyweights-develop-fully-insured-crypto-staking-offering-plan-2024-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28790cf7fd1659d4d8c35bb7e4acef9d9748ba07-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17677146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551540,1694790055,"Bitcoin Profit-Taking At 2-Month High, Pullback Incoming?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin profit-taking has risen to a two-month high, which could provide resistance to the BTC surge. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Volume Has Shot Up With The Price Rise According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, investors have started to take profits following the latest cryptocurrency price increase. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” as its name already implies, it tells us how the profit-taking volume in the market currently compares against the loss-taking one. The indicator separates these two volumes by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold/transferred on the network to see what price it was previously moved at. If this last selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price, the sale of that particular coin contributes to the profit-taking volume. Similarly, their transactions would count under the loss-taking volume for the opposite type of coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Turns Highly Positive, Bullish Sign? When the indicator has a value greater than zero, the profit-taking volume is currently overwhelming the loss-taking volume. On the other hand, values under this mark suggest that loss-taking is currently the dominant behavior among investors. Now, here is a chart that shows how the value of this Bitcoin indicator has changed over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has surged to a high value in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the indicator’s value has risen as Bitcoin’s rebound from the $25,000 level occurred during the past few days. This suggests that the investors have started increasing their profit-taking volume. During the past day or so, the metric has seen exceptionally high values, as the difference between the profit-taking and loss-taking volumes is at a two-month high now. Usually, profit-taking is a normal sign during price rallies. Still, considering that this latest increase in BTC’s value isn’t too extraordinary, the level of the profit selling may be a cause for concern. Perhaps some of the holders selling here have lost hope for the asset after it has been stuck in consolidation for some time now. These investors might be jumping on this relatively minor exit opportunity because they don’t think a better one will emerge shortly. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another metric: the active addresses. This indicator keeps track of the total number of addresses taking part in some transfer activity on the blockchain daily. It’s visible that this metric has been at notably high values in the past few days, suggesting that many traders have been paying attention to the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean? While sellers may be present in the market, the high activity could also suggest the presence of buyers. It remains to be seen whether the profit-takers would pull the asset back down, or if the buyers are strong enough to hold them off.

The launch of Holesky was selected to mark the first anniversary of Ethereum completing the ""Merge,"" its historic transition to a ""proof-of-stake"" blockchain, from the original and more energy-hungry ""proof-of-work"" model that Bitcoin uses.  Testnets are copies of a blockchain – in this case Ethereum – used specifically for testing new applications and smart contracts in a low-stakes environment.  Ethereum developers expect Holesky to eventually replace the Goerli testnet, targeted for sunset in early 2024.  Biggest testnet for Ethereum  Ethereum core developer Parithosh Jayanthi told CoinDesk that Holesky is expected to become the biggest testnet for Ethereum, and should have 1.4 million validators to help address scalability problems with mainnet. That's double the 700,000 on Ethereum.  Goerli and Sepolia, another Ethereum testnet, are operated by a smaller subset of “validators” than the main Ethereum chain, and some developers think these smaller validator sets pose a problem.  By making Holesky bigger, developers will theoretically be able to test infrastructure and upgrades under more rigorous conditions, meaning tests that go smoothly on Holesky should be less likely to face unforeseen issues on mainnet.  “We don't want to hit a scaling issue that could happen first on mainnet,” Jayanthi told CoinDesk prior to Holesky's debut. “We want to catch [scaling issues] on testnet, which means we have to have a testnet that's bigger” than the main Ethereum chain.

17675481,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551532,1694786436,Bitcoin Forecast: Analyst Who Predicted 2022 Bottom Unveils New Long Positions For BTC,"In a recent YouTube interview with TechnicalRoundup, crypto Analyst DonAlt revealed he had purchased Bitcoin after the asset fell below the $25,000 level. According to the analyst also predicted the crypto market bottom in 2022, he had two choices before opening the new BTC position DonAlt Shares Insights On Bitcoin’s Next Price Moves Explaining the reasoning behind his decision to purchase Bitcoin, DonAlt told TechnicalRoundup: We’re at the point where you could make an argument for buying here [around $26,000]. And if you’re wrong, you get stopped out, and you get to buy at $19,000. The problem with kind of not doing anything, and the reason why I took a trade – I bought like a little bit, not too much, but a little bit of Bitcoin – is, basically, because I’m just guessing that I will not get an entry otherwise. Furthermore, DonAlt stated that if his prediction is correct, he will exit the trade after attaining a profit level of double-digit percentage points. According to him, his profit target is $30,000, but with a neutral sentiment on the trade. “I’m not too bullish. I’m not too bearish. The reason why I kind of think this is an interesting trade in general is, basically, because I think if this fails… if you break down here [below $24,900]. I think we’re going to start capitulating. And then we’re going to start capitulating proper. And we’re going to go to $20,000. So, you basically have an invalidation around $25,000 right now,” he added. Meanwhile, bitcoin trades at $26,638 today, September 15, above the $24,900 capitulation zone. And according to another crypto analyst, Ali Charts, the TD sequential indicator has displayed a buy signal for BTC on the weekly chart. However, he believes that for this sentiment to be confirmed, BTC must close this week above $25,600. If this happens, BTC could rally to $28,350 or up to $31,800. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, with over 44,000 Twitter followers, also chimed in on the asset, saying that past performance does not guarantee future results. However, he believes comparing the present price action to previous ones is important. He said that if BTC follows its past price action and there is no negative event before its halving, it can attain $37,500 before a pullback. Will Bitcoin Hit The $30,000 Mark? Bitcoin has entered an accumulation phase after breaking above the 38.2% Fibonacci Level ($26,406). The buyers control the market, as evidenced by the four consecutive green candles on the daily chart. However, it faces resistance at the 50% Fib level ($26,738). If the buyers continue to mount pressure, BTC will rise to the 61.8% Fib level ($27,069). Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator displays a value of 52.11 and is rising from the neutral zone into the buy zone as more traders enter long positions. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal liner and displays a strong buy signal. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – Key Reasons Why Bulls Could Aim Rally To $0.60 The green Histogram bars confirm that BTC is in a positive price trend. BTC will likely continue its rally in the coming weeks if the buyers sustain their pressure and break above the $26,738 resistance level. Although if traders begin to take profit, then a brief retracement will likely occur before a continuation of the uptrend.

42409689,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPcw,1694783993,"Coinbase Earned $1M Amid Hack, but Hasn't Reimbursed Victims","The $73 million Curve exploit in July briefly pushed prices on the DeFi platform out of whack, and a trading bot paid 570 ETH to ensure it could take advantage of that once-in-a-lifetime arbitrage opportunity.  The Ethereum validator that received that payment was apparently run by Coinbase, making it an unwitting beneficiary of the incident.  Exploit victim Alchemix reached out to Coinbase to seek a refund for victims, but the crypto exchange has evidently not turned over the money.  An exploiter’s July attack on decentralized finance giant Curve Finance roiled the entire DeFi market. Much of the stolen money has been returned, but not everyone has been made whole.  One titan of crypto, though – Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange – is sitting on a roughly $1 million profit tied to the incident, according to market participants and observers. It hasn’t surrendered this inadvertent windfall to victims. And, to be clear, it’s currently not obligated to.  The bizarre situation stems from a quirky feature of the DeFi economy’s infrastructure.  When $73 million worth of assets were stolen from Curve, the platform’s asset-pricing system was briefly thrown out of whack. A trading bot noticed this once-in-a-lifetime arbitrage opportunity and pounced, paying 570 ETH (worth $1.06 million at the time) to make sure an Ethereum blockchain validator processed its trade as quickly as possible. It was the second-biggest payment ever tied to the practice known as MEV.  Validators run the Ethereum network, and there are many of them. In this case, Coinbase was the validator that received the payment, according to Alchemix, which lost money during the Curve exploit, and data from Nansen that shows Coinbase was the recipient of the money.  While the bulk of the $73 million in assets lost in the Curve hack has been recouped, the Alchemix protocol – which saw $22 million of its Curve-based tokens looted by the hacker – said that Coinbase has turned down requests to send back the money it earned as a result of the heist.  “Coinbase has shown no willingness to return the funds, despite knowingly benefitting directly from the exploit,” Alchemix told CoinDesk in a statement.  Alchemix, which argues Coinbase is keeping stolen money, says Coinbase representatives have told it there’s no legal requirement for it to reimburse anyone.  A Coinbase spokesperson said the company has “nothing additional to share at this time” and declined a request to comment.  The controversy underscores the tension between the free-wheeling, “code is law” ideals of blockchain-based finance and the frustrating lack of recourse for victims of crypto theft.  Some $735 million worth of digital assets have been stolen in hacks this year, according to DefiLlama; The ubiquity of crypto exploits – and the difficulty of recovering funds after they occur – is frequently cited as a key deterrent for would-be users of the technology.  The Coinbase-Curve saga provides a unique window into the messy process of asset-recovery that follows most crypto hacks. The convoluted world of crypto trading algorithms and spur-of-the-moment arbitrage opportunities can make it hard to trace where funds end up after they’re stolen from a crypto protocol. Frequently, the biggest beneficiaries of a crypto heist end up in that position by accident – earning surprise fees in exchange for running certain kinds of blockchain infrastructure.  This is the situation that Coinbase finds itself in. Whether or not the company should reimburse Curve victims with funds it earned as a result of the heist – or whether those funds are even “dirty money” in the first place – is largely a matter of interpretation.  How Coinbase gained from the Curve hack  The July 30 attack on Curve exploited a bug in the code for certain liquidity pools – baskets of cryptocurrency loaned out by users of the platform to help facilitate “decentralized” token swaps. A total of $73 million of assets were lost, and the event roiled the broader cryptocurrency markets due to Curve’s position as a cornerstone of Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.  One of the pools drained in the attack contained ether (ETH) and alETH, an ether derivative issued by Alchemix, a DeFi lending platform. Before the attack, the pool held 7,259 ETH and 4,822 alETH, Alchemix said. Then, the exploiter drained the majority of the tokens, leaving only 1 ETH and 3,856 alETH.  Traders use liquidity pools to swap between tokens, and the exchange rate between any two tokens in a pool is set by the ratio of assets in that pool.  Following the Curve exploit, the massive imbalance between ETH and alETH tokens in the ETH/alETH pool created an arbitrage opportunity – opening up the ability for savvy traders to purchase alETH at a steep discount. A trading robot noticed the opportunity and bought up the remaining alETH in the pool for a pittance – quickly selling them off for frxETH (another ETH derivative), which it then swapped for ETH, blockchain data shows.  The trading bot only netted 43 ETH from the transactions. Most of the profits from the trade went to the validator – in this case, Coinbase’s – that wrote the transaction into Ethereum’s ledger. The unusually large fee of 570 ETH, according to blockchain data, served as an incentive to persuade the validator to automatically prioritize the bot’s transaction ahead of others looking to make the same trade.  This controversial practice of strategically ordering blockchain transactions to profit off of spur-of-the-moment trading opportunities is called maximal extractable value (MEV). The alETH arbitrage fee marked the second-highest MEV payout for a single transaction in the Ethereum blockchain’s history, according to a report from Flashbots, a leading MEV firm.

I’ve tried negotiating with them and spoken on the phone, but they won't return the funds even after admitting it’s stolen.”  Following a public bounty and an ultimatum, the Curve exploiter returned all $22 million worth of stolen ETH and alETH to Alchemix. White hats – good-faith actors that front-ran the hacker and drained the funds themselves before they could be stolen – also sent back $13 million worth of assets, CoinDesk reported.  Though they were not obligated to, a trading bot operator known as c0ffeebabe.eth returned 2,879 ETH – worth nearly $5.5 million – to Curve.  The arbitrage trading bot that profited from the alETH imbalance – the transaction Coinbase earned $1 million from – gave back its 43-ETH profit after the Alchemix team asked for it.  But Alchemix says Coinbase has not done likewise.  “It’s crazy,” pseudonymous blockchain sleuth Ogle, founder of Ogle Security Group that specializes in asset recovery from crypto thefts including the Curve exploit, said in a Telegram message. “I’ve tried negotiating with them and spoken on the phone, but they won’t return the funds even after admitting it’s stolen.”  “They are citing neutrality and decentralization and quoted some slippery slope arguments like saying they can’t be expected to prevent all crime on the blockchain, highways aren’t responsible for people that commit crimes on them, etc.,” said Ov3rkoalafied, an Alchemix contributor who also attended a call with Coinbase.  “It’s a bad analogy because they are not a public good, and they directly profit from these operations,” he added. “If someone uses your product for crime and you are unaware, you cannot be held responsible. But if you receive a report of a specific crime being committed and knowingly profit off it, you are expected to return those funds.”  UPDATE (Sept. 15, 2023, 16:45 UTC): Adds Nansen data in the fifth paragraph.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/15/coinbase-inadvertently-earned-1m-due-to-hack-but-hasnt-reimbursed-victims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c973755cd7d24898a2cb53e1ef1b0ec16819aad-1056x594.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since the beginning of the year, there has been a noticeable and consistent outflow of cash from the cryptocurrency market, which is unsurprising. According to Bitfinex’s latest report, this capital drain was evident in August, as the crypto market saw an exit of about $55 billion in capital from major cryptocurrencies. $55 Billion Drained In The Past Month Bitfinex’s analysis, which measured the aggregate realized value metric of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and major stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, USD Coin (USDC), BUSD, Dai, and TrueUSD (TUSD), indicates that about $55 billion in capital exited the market in August. Related Reading: The Real Reason Behind That Bitcoin Transaction With A $500,000 Fee Has Been Revealed Although the market struggled for most of the first half of the year, things became different in July as Bitcoin spearheaded inflows. During this period, Bitcoin crossed $30,000 for a while as over $100 billion has entered the market. However, the momentum changed in early August, as profit-taking and continued mixed signals from the US economy triggered outflows. “A deep dive into the data reveals a prevailing trend: by early August, the industry had begun to experience capital outflows,” said the report. Interest from institutional investors during this period, especially, started to wane as digital asset investment funds registered outflows after four weeks of heavy inflows. The trend has continued to the time of writing, as the run of outflows now totals $294 million. What Caused The Crypto Capital Drain? The report from Bitfinex shows that August’s capital drain was the biggest this year, especially for Bitcoin. Most of this drain came from two isolated events, resulting in immense price movement in a relatively short period. In particular, the August 17 flash crash saw Bitcoin’s price drop by 11.4% in a few hours. “August was the largest red monthly candle for BTC since the bear market bottom was formed in November 2022 at –11.29 percent as per Bitfinex Data.” The crypto derivative market has also had a similar trajectory. Ether (ETH) futures and options markets have slowed considerably in 2023. The average daily trading volume is down almost 50% from the two-year average to $14.3 billion daily.

These changes are supposed to boost the value of MIOTA tokens and improve network security.  IOTA was one of the most-hyped and popular blockchains in the 2017 bull run, and developers plan to get it back on top.  A formerly major crypto project is eyeing the big leagues again with a series of decisions that benefit network development and token prices – years after fading out of popular circles.  IOTA, which was one of the most hyped and fastest-growing tokens in the 2017 bull market, has lost market share to newer blockchains in the past years. However, IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener told CoinDesk that the network is planning to release an IOTA 2.0 network and increase the utility of it's MIOTA tokens in the coming months.  The key upcoming improvements are the introduction of an upgraded network, which will introduce smart contracts, a focus on layer 2 blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, the introduction of a new ecosystem fund, and an increase in the utility of iota tokens.  The new IOTA ecosystem fund will be backed by the vested release of new MIOTA tokens. The Stardust hard fork is planned for an Oct.4 release and will lay the technical bedrock for IOTA 2.0, which is planned to go live in Q4 of this year.  A hard fork is a change to a blockchain protocol that renders older versions invalid.  The IOTA smart contracts will be introduced through a general-purpose virtual machine (VM), or a piece of software that executes smart contracts. Applications built on IOTA through later smart contracts will generate significantly more demand for Mana, a reputation system for nodes within the IOTA network, which in turn will increase the demand for MIOTA.  “This self-sustaining economic system is key to increase the security of the IOTA network and in turn, to generate more demand for applications and layer 2 networks to build on IOTA,” an IOTA representative told CoinDesk.  With Mana, the reputation would be gained by contributing to the network, such as providing value in the form of development. Developers say an increase in the monetary value of the MIOTA also directly increases the security of the entire network, which in turn creates more demand for block space – creating a financial flywheel.  Ecosystem Fund to Seed Projects  Schiener told CoinDesk that an ecosystem fund will be set up to incentivize developers and teams building on the network, especially as several other blockchains have floated their own funds to jumpstart activity.  “Unless we have more funding, we will not be able to catch up and IOTA will just slowly continue to lose market share and market cap. To break out of this downward spiral, we need to start making significant changes to increase adoption and growth,” Schiener said.  “We want IOTA to have a fighting chance to succeed in this market,” he added.  Following the hard fork, there will be a temporary bi-weekly token release that will last for 4 years, after which the total supply has been reached. This token release over a 4-year period will equate to an average year inflation of 12%.  After this 4-year period, the circulating supply of MIOTA would be 4.6 billion tokens.  Separately the network has also set up the Tangle Ecosystem Association based in Zug, Switzerland, and the IOTA DLT Foundation based out of Abu Dhabi, UAE, have been set up to support the IOTA ecosystem, developers said.",POSITIVE,IOTA,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | IOTA | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/15/iota-eyes-big-crypto-leagues-again-with-series-of-network-boosting-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5173a1d1c6338113533823bf73458d0134c8762-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409679,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNP5s,1694781090,"BitGo, Swan to Form Bitcoin-Only Trust Company","Crypto custodian BitGo and bitcoin financial services firm Swan plan to form a BTC-only trust company as a means of offering custody without exposure to the rest of the digital asset market.  The joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval, will combine BitGo's custody capabilities with Swan's expertise in onboarding and fraud prevention. It would be the U.S.' first Bitcoin-only trust company, according to a press release on Thursday evening.  ""We believe the best model for the Bitcoin industry is the same battle-tested model that has been part of the U.S. financial industry for over a century: the separation of exchange and custody,"" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said.  BitGo is one of the custodians Swan has used for its bitcoin storage needs, with another being Nevada-based chartered trust company Fortress Trust, which has agreed to be acquired by Ripple.  Addressing that deal, Swan CEO Cory Klippsten said Swan is already working to move compliance and settlement to another partner. ""We’ve been integrating with Bakkt since early 2023 and we’ve already begun transferring some customer segments over.""  ""It's important to us to build a custodian without the risks of securing many altcoins within the same trust company as bitcoin,"" Klippsten said.  Crypto custodian Prime Trust was put into receivership in July, shortly after BitGo canceled plans to acquire it. Prime Trust CEO Jor Law revealed in a court filing in August that the firm had lost $8 million in an investment in the terraUSD algorithmic stablecoin, which collapsed in May 2022.  After aborting its Prime Trust acquisition, BitGo raised $100 million in funding at a valuation of $1.75 billion.

42409695,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPmr,1694780552,First Mover Americas: Altcoins Lead Gains and Deutsche Bank to Explore Tokenization,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  As bitcoin (BTC) moves higher, the recently shorted alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana's SOL may see leverage liquidations and exaggerated price rallies. Since Monday's brief move below crucial support at $25,000, bitcoin has risen over 6% to trade near $26,600, CoinDesk data show. Upbeat China August retail sales and factory output data released early Friday revived risk sentiment in financial markets, clearing the way for continued price gains in the leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin cash (BCH) led advancers, adding 8% over the past 24 hours. Maker DAO’s MKR followed with a rise of 5%. XRP, Ether (ETH), SOL, Tron's TRX and dogecoin (DOGE) are all tracking bitcoin higher, as usual. The altcoin bounce comes days after traders sold these tokens, pricing in the possibility of defunct exchange FTX securing approval from the bankruptcy court to sell assets from its multibillion dollar cryptocurrency holdings. The recovery puts altcoin bears, who took leveraged bets on SOL and other tokens declining because of potential sales by FTX creditors, at risk of liquidation.  Binance.US has been accused of not cooperating in a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said the company’s staking, clearing and brokerage services violate federal securities law, court filings unsealed Thursday show. Federal U.S. regulators worry the crypto exchange’s use of Ceffu, a custody service offered by Binance’s international arm, violates a deal intended to stop assets being squirreled overseas. Binance.US’ holding company, known as BAM, has provided “only approximately 220 documents ... many that consist of unintelligible screenshots and documents without dates or signatures,” the SEC said, of the evidence-gathering process known as discovery. The company also lost two more high-level executives not long after the departure of CEO Brian Shroder. Head of Legal Krishna Juvvadi and Chief Risk Officer Sidney Majalya are leaving the company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the departures. Juvvadi was hired in May last year, and Majalya was appointed in December 2021.  Deutsche Bank is working with Taurus, a Swiss startup specializing in cryptocurrency safekeeping, to establish digital asset custody and tokenization services, the companies said on Thursday. Germany’s biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, said in June it had applied for a crypto custody license from the country’s financial watchdog, BaFin. The bank’s publicly known crypto custody ambitions stretch back to early 2021, when details about a digital asset custody prototype appeared in a report by the World Economic Forum. Germany’s roll-out of rules for firms to custody crypto assets and, more broadly, Europe’s proposed regime for Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA) are providing traditional finance firms with the clarity needed to explore the digital assets industry.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows net liquidity injections by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) since 2015.  While the central bank has turned accommodative this year, it has not yet resorted to the flood-like stimulus seen in 2015-16.  The battered crypto market has been looking to PBOC to compensate for the monetary tightening in the West.

Paxos said the overpayment was due to a ""bug"" in the corporate operations side of business. Bitcoin fees are typically no more than $20 per transaction. Blockchain data shows the funds were returned to Paxos on Friday.  A bitcoin fee is what miners receive after a transaction is confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain. Fees can be adjusted by the user to give certain transactions priority over others.  ""After conducting identity verification, we have confirmed the ownership of these BTC, and fully refunded the fee to the sender,"" F2Pool wrote on X.  The refund comes after intense discussion amongst the bitcoin community, with the likes of Stake.fish founder Chun Wang saying that he ""regretted"" agreeing to a refund with Paxos.  Casa Hodl co-founder and early bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp praised Bitcoin as being a ""cooperative network"" after the fee was returned.  ""Bitcoin is an adversarial network, but on the flip side it's also a cooperative network,"" Lopp wrote on X. ""Miners are humans too, and they realize that people make mistakes.

A large driver of SOL's comparative weakness stems from soon to be liquidated FTX holding more than $1 billion in SOL tokens. Despite the FTX overhang and declining chain usage, the recent news of Visa utilizing Solana for USDC settlement is a significant milestone. It's been a volatile 12 months for holders of Solana (SOL-USD). After getting absolutely massacred from an intraday high of $38.79 on November 5th, 2022 down to $12.09 just four days later, SOL continued to range between $12-15 through most of November and December before finding what could very possibly be a cycle bottom of $8 on December 29th. Data by YCharts Since then, SOL has served as one of the better trading vectors in crypto over the last 9 months, as it has seen traded between $15-25 dollars for much of 2023. Though I've covered SOL and even held it in my portfolio at times over the last couple of years, I've remained largely on the Solana sidelines since the FTX collapse. Quick Summary As it has been nearly a year since I last covered SOL for Seeking Alpha, for the benefit of my newer followers who may not be familiar with the idea, I'll provide a very brief background. Solana is a layer 1 public blockchain that gained notoriety in the back half of 2021. The allure of Solana as a smart contract blockchain network was because the chain had higher throughput, faster transactions, and much cheaper fees than the more popular Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain. Since Solana was viable for much lower-value transactions, it was believed by many ( myself included ) that Solana was well positioned to take market share away from Ethereum in notable crypto areas like DeFi and NFTs. Since SOL served as the native asset and gas payment token of all transactions on the Solana blockchain, an increase in adoption of Solana figured to naturally drive the price of SOL higher provided demand growth outpaced token emissions. As an inflationary token without a supply cap, dilution was always a possible concern, and I personally viewed SOL as an asset that had to be staked. FTX Overhang Ending? After FTX blew up, SOL collapsed nearly 70% in a matter of a few days due to investment connections to FTX and Alameda Research. Through court filings, we later found out that FTX had over $1 billion in Solana. And as of the end of August 2023, those holdings were valued at just under $1.2 billion. FTX Top 5 Holdings Holdings ($M) Tokens (millions) % of Supply SOL 1,162 55.756 13.65% Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) 560 0.021 0.11% ETH 192 0.113 0.09% Aptos ( APT-USD ) 137 23.687 10.38% Tether ( USDT-USD ) 120 120.000 0.14% Source: CoinGecko Given FTX's control of 13.7% of the SOL supply, there have been totally justifiable concerns about those SOL tokens hammering the price of the asset when the FTX coins are liquidated. Now that the court has given the liquidation team the green light to start unwinding, those concerns have been renewed. Upon closer look though, some of these fears may be unfounded. Unlocks # of SOL Unlock Schedule Tokens per Unlock 1 12,000,000 Sep 2021 - Sep 2027 (Linear monthly) 142,857 2 32,524,833 Jan 2022 - Jan 2028 (Linear monthly) 451,734 3 7,500,000 Mar 1, 2025 (Full Unlock) 7,500,000 4 61,853 May 17, 2025 (Full Unlock) 61,853 Source: CoinGecko Coins often aren't available to be moved until they are vested. As it happens, many of the SOL coins in those FTX holdings are actually still locked and will be for some time. The true level of FTX SOL liquidations will be closer to 618k SOL per month, rather than one enormous sale of nearly 14% of the supply. But be advised there is a full block of 7.5 million SOL that can come into the market on March 1st, 2025. Network Metrics From a DeFi standpoint, Solana has experienced one of the larger collapses in TVL since late 2021. Measured in USD, Solana's TVL dropped 97% from a high of $10 billion in November 2021. However, when adjusting for the native asset price fluctuation, we can see the TVL measured in SOL is actually up to 16.6 million SOL from a January low of just 10.4 million SOL: SOL TVL (DeFi Llama) Still, at just $306 million in total value locked, Solana has already been passed by the recently launched Base blockchain developed by Coinbase ( COIN ). It hasn't been much better in the NFT department, where Solana's sales in August were down about 90% from the April 2022 high of $356 million: Solana NFTs (CryptoSlam) Even though sales have been down for months, the buyer and seller activity on Solana has weathered crypto winter fairly well compared to some of the competing ""ETH killer"" layer 1 chains. Solana (Token Terminal) That said, monthly DAUs slipped below 100k in August for the first time in at least the last 12 months and at a 482x circulating P/S ratio, Solana isn't exactly cheap compared to chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) or Optimism ( OP-USD ). However, despite all of the down metrics, Solana's destiny may not actually be one of imminent doom. The Visa Pilot One of the more positive developments regarding the fundamental story for the network was the recent announcement that Visa ( V ) would be utilizing Circle's USDC Stablecoin ( USDC-USD ) on the Solana blockchain in a pilot program that includes Worldpay and Nuvei (NASDAQ: NVEI ) for managing merchant settlements. Following that news, SOL immediately spiked over $20, but has since retreated back below $18. From where I sit, this Visa news is actually a very important milestone for Solana, and it lends credence to the notion that the future is going to be a multi-chain world. In a multi-chain environment, fast, cheap transactions will likely attract the attention of merchants globally who pay significant fees to third party processing providers. Rank Blockchain 1d Change 7d Change 1m Change USDC Circulating 1 Ethereum 0.1% 0.5% 0.9% $21.325b 2 Arbitrum -0.7% -0.6% -25.7% $658.5m 3 Solana -1.0% -1.1% -8.7% $626.29m 4 Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) -1.5% 2.9% 5.0% $611.98m 5 Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) 1.2% 0.0% -8.8% $461.24m Source: DeFi Llama Going forward, I think it makes some sense to pay attention to the circulating market cap of USDC on Solana and how that trend compares to other blockchains. Over the last month, Solana has experienced an 8.7% decline in circulating USDC on the network. This is inline with a chain like Avalanche but behind Polygon and Ethereum. At the third largest circulating cap of USDC on any one chain, I'd like to see Solana distance itself from Polygon and Avalanche and potentially even overtake Arbitrum as the second-largest blockchain for USDC supply for me to make Solana a significant holding in my crypto portfolio again. Investor Takeaways Solana is a blockchain that has almost become a joke to some in the crypto community. Among other things, there has been a history of network stoppages, concerns about centralization, and a general lack of interoperability with the rest of the smart contract ecosystem. Despite all that, the network itself is actually very impressive. I've experimented with Solana dApps. In my view, Solana offers a lot of things that other blockchains really can't match in the speed and ease of use departments. The FTX liquidation has been a concern for a long time, and it's likely been keeping a ceiling on SOL's relief rally in 2023. But now that we have some guidance on how the FTX liquidation will be handled, I believe the widespread negativity concerning Solana may be close to priced in at this point. Barring a total collapse in the broad cryptocurrency market, I believe it's relatively safe to start responsibly scaling into a SOL position again in a high-risk portfolio for long term cryptocurrency exposure. I've started buying under $19 and will keep any additional purchases small while maintaining a close eye on the chain's USDC footprint for a larger signal.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | SOL | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4635385-solana-sell-rumor-buy-news?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17671598.jpeg

Investors and enthusiasts are eagerly watching to see if this bullish trajectory is solid enough to inspire confidence in a more extended recovery. After a period of uncertainty, ADA’s price has seen a resurgence, thanks in part to the $0.24 support level. This renewed demand has ignited a relief rally, catching the attention of traders and analysts alike. But, the question on everyone’s mind is whether this upward momentum can be sustained. Related Reading: Algorand (ALGO) May Have A Chance At A Bullish Streak – Here’s How According to a recent price analysis, if the current buying momentum persists, ADA could appreciate by another 3% within the week. This modest yet encouraging gain hints at the cryptocurrency’s resilience. However, there’s a significant obstacle standing in the way of a more substantial bullish turn. As of the latest available data, ADA is priced at approximately $0.254026 on CoinGecko, with a 2.6% gain in the last 24 hours and a slight 1.3% decline over the past seven days. ADA Breaks Through The Dynamic Resistance A formidable dynamic resistance level has thwarted bulls’ attempts to push ADA higher on three distinct occasions in the past. To inspire true confidence in a prolonged uptrend, ADA’s price must decisively breach this overhead resistance. ADA market cap registers at nearly $9 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Analysts suggest that achieving this feat could have a cascading effect, repositioning the resistance as newfound support. If this occurs, it could propel ADA’s price by an impressive 12.3%, pushing it to the $0.28 mark, with the possibility of reaching $0.30 in the near future. However, not all analyses are equally optimistic. A separate assessment notes a lack of bullish signals in the short term. ADA’s price has been largely stagnant, fluctuating within the $0.25-$0.29 range. This has led to concerns about the cryptocurrency’s immediate prospects. ADA seven-day price performance. Source: Coingecko Cardano: Challenges In The Midterm Looking further ahead, the midterm outlook for ADA remains uncertain.

42409690,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPgF,1694774850,"A Year After Ethereum Merge, Net Supply Down Nearly 300K Ether","On Sept. 15 last year, Ethereum implemented a pivotal upgrade, the Merge, which switched the largest smart contract blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) setting.  Since then, Ethereum has minted 680,455.31 ether (ETH) and burned 980,377.87 ether, causing a net supply reduction of 299,922.50 ether, according to the ethereum analytics dashboard ultrasound.money. In annualized percentage terms, the supply has decreased by 0.249%.  The net supply would have increased by more than 3.8 million or 3% had Ethereum operated as a proof-of-work blockchain.  The PoS mechanism requires market participants to hold a minimum number of ether to validate transactions in return for rewards. The previous PoW setup had miners solving computational problems to record transactions in return for rewards.  The transition to the PoS setup took out a significant amount of miner supply from the market. More importantly, the PoS mechanism burns a portion of transaction fees paid by users. Validators receive the priority fee or the top that users add to the base to entice validators to prioritize transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is burned, taking ether out of circulation.  The upgrade has made ether a deflationary currency while making Ethereum more environmentally friendly, as expected. Still, at the current price of $1,630, ether has been largely unchanged since the Merge, meaning the upgrade has failed to boost ether's market valuations. Meanwhile, bitcoin has gained nearly 30% in the past 12 months.  ""In August 2022, the Ethereum Foundation warned users that the upcoming Paris upgrade would not reduce gas fees. Subsequently, prices fell, and ether was doomed to underperform bitcoin. But this also hinted towards the next potential catalyst for Ether investors—lower gas fees,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a note to clients last week.  ""The reduction of gas [transaction] fees now appears to be the critical missing building block that the next upgrade – called EIP-4844 is trying to solve,"" Thielen added.  The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, or ""proto-danksharding,"" is expected to reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput by introducing blobs for data. These blobs contain a large amount of data like blocks but aren't stored forever on the Ethereum virtual machine like blocks. That helps the blockchain process data efficiently and cheaply.  The upgrade is set to go live later this year.  ""While Ethereum is 'down' it is certainly not 'out' and Ether investors should slowly monitor any positive news flow around the EIP-4844 upgrade. But a lot is at 'stake'; if this upgrade is seen as another minimal improvement, then the best days might be behind Ethereum,"" Thielen said, noting the increase in Ethereum's monthly transactions from 28 million to 32 million since the Merge.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/15/a-year-after-ethereum-merge-net-supply-down-nearly-300k-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97ec31a4a755def6aadd091400e7d12e2e2da3ba-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17669522,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551525,1694773547,Ethereum Core Devs Greenlight EIP-7514: Implications For ETH Price,"Ethereum Core Developers have officially approved EIP-7514 for inclusion in the upcoming Dencun upgrade which is slated for late 2023. This Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) primarily aims to decelerate the growth rate of ETH staking, thereby providing the Ethereum community additional time to craft an improved validator reward scheme. The main modification brought by this EIP is setting the Max Epoch Churn Limit, the validator activation queue upper limit, to a constant value of 8. Previously, the churn limit was calculated by taking “The total number of validators/65536,” which at present equates to about 12/epoch. The decision followed an Ethereum Core Dev Meeting, as described in a tweet by Tim Beiko: “Wrapped up another Ethereum #AllCoreDevs: we covered devnet updates, additions to Dencun, and had a full overview of Reth. EIP-7514 will be part of the Dencun upgrade! Expect the EIP and associated CL specs PR to be updated to reflect all of this in the coming days.” Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean? Beiko’s statement underscored the importance of this change and provided insights into the consensus among Core Developer teams. Dankrad Feist, a Researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, outlined the importance of the approval. Feist stated: My reasoning on why I’m for EIP-7514. It is currently unclear if (especially liquid) staking will keep growing indefinitely. In the case that the withdrawal queue does not empty over the next few months, the lower churn limit will give the Ethereum community the time needed to research, debate and implement solutions. Implications For Ethereum Price The staking ratio’s continual rise could result in a diminishing amount of liquid ETH available for trading. Should the staking ratio near 100%, it might produce a supply scarcity, thereby influencing the ETH price positively. However, from the information presented, Ethereum developers are not advocating for this scenario due to potential technical and security implications. EIP-7514, therefore, indirectly impacts the ETH price by manipulating its supply side, though immediate, direct effects on the price aren’t anticipated. Instead, any potential influence on price would likely manifest over an extended period. Related Reading: Ethereum Health: Analyst’s Red Flags And Failed Bullish Patterns The motivation behind EIP-7514, as detailed on GitHub, is to “mitigate the negative externalities of very high level of total ETH supply staked before a proper solution is implemented.” If the deposit queue stays 100% full, the share of ETH supply staked will reach 50% by May 2024, 75% by September 2024, and 100% by December 2024. Remarkably, the modest returns don’t necessarily deter further capital staking, especially with the frequently substantial and erratic returns from MEV. Therefore, EIP-7514 serves as an interim measure, buying time for the community to deliberate and develop comprehensive solutions to the emerging challenges. In summary, while the immediate effects of EIP-7514 on the ETH price remain to be seen, its long-term implications, especially in terms of staking growth and supply side management, could be substantial. The community and investors alike will closely monitor the aftermath of this EIP’s implementation in the Dencun upgrade. ETH Price Builds Momentum At press time, ETH was trading at $1,628. On Monday, ETH price bounced off the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,536. A breakout above the 20-day EMA at $1,639 and consequently above the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $1,665 is critical to maintain upside momentum.

17665467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551501,1694764553,Is Bitcoin Forming A Double Bottom? Here’s What Needs To Happen,"In recent days, Bitcoin has shown signs of a potential reversal, with the cryptocurrency charting three consecutive green daily candles. The last time such a pattern was observed was early July and between mid and late June, when Bitcoin rallied from just under $25,000 to over $31,000. This shift in price dynamics has led to a change in market sentiment, with the bearish outlook slowly giving way to a more bullish perspective. While Bitcoin has successfully averted the confirmation of a double top on the 1-week chart fo the moment, this price action has fueled discussions among analysts about the possibility of Bitcoin forming a double bottom pattern, a significant technical indicator. Bitcoin Double Bottom In The Making? A double bottom is a classic technical analysis pattern that signifies a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish in markets. It is characterized by two distinct troughs or lows in the price chart, separated by a peak or a minor high in between. The pattern resembles the letter “W,” with the first trough indicating a significant low, followed by a temporary rebound, and then a second trough, usually near the same price level as the first. A valid double bottom is confirmed when the price breaks above the peak or resistance level between the two troughs, signaling a potential upward trend reversal. Rekt Capital, a renowned crypto analyst, recently shared his insights suggesting that Bitcoin’s current price pattern in the weekly chart resembles a double top, which typically indicates a bearish reversal. This pattern is characterized by an ‘M’ shape. However, for this to be confirmed, the price would need to break down from the $26,000 support. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,618, successfully fending off the double top validation at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges To $26,700, But Will This Rise Last? On the flip side, a double bottom, which forms a ‘W’ shape, would require Bitcoin to rebound from the $26,000 mark and tweeted today, “Could this BTC Double Top actually be a Double Bottom? And the simple answer is – technically, yes. But for BTC to form a Double Bottom, it would need to rebound from $26k and rally to $30.6k (which is its validation point).” He further highlighted the challenges Bitcoin faces, noting the uncertainty surrounding the $26k support level and the numerous confluent resistances ahead, which might hinder the completion of the double bottom formation. Rekt Capital elaborated on the significance of the $26,000 level, tweeting, “It looks like BTC may be choosing the ‘relief rally’ route first in an effort to potentially turn old support into new resistance. The black Monthly level (~$27,200) is approximately confluent with the Bull Market support band as well.” He also pointed to Bitcoin’s recent bearish monthly candle close for August, emphasizing that Bitcoin closed below approximately $27,150, thereby confirming it as a lost support. Therefore he warns that the current price move by Bitcoin could only be a relief rally to confirm $27,150 as new resistance before dropping into the $23,000 region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Unprecedented Liquidity And Rate Reversal: A Perfect Storm For Market Correction? “It’s possible BTC could rebound into ~$27,150, maybe even upside wick beyond it this September. […] $23,000 is the next major Monthly support now that ~$27150 has been lost,” he remarked. More Resistance Levels For BTC Price So it’s clear that BTC has a major resistance level of $27,150 to break before the bulls can even dream of confirming a double bottom pattern. But there are also other key resistances to overcome before $30,600 can be breached and the double bottom confirmed. On-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant emphasized the role of short-term Bitcoin holders, who often provide the liquidity for significant price movements. According to their data, the break-even price for these holders lies between $27,500 and $29,000. If Bitcoin remains below these levels for an extended period, these holders might be incentivized to sell, potentially exerting downward pressure on the price: The more time we spend below these price levels, the more incentive there will be to exit liquidity from the market, and the basis condition for the return of the upward trend of Bitcoin depends on the price jump above the short-term realized prices. On the 4-hour time frame, BTC needs to overcome three major resistances: $26,857 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement level), $27,365 (23.6% Fibonacci retracement level) and $28,186 (post-Grayscale high from August 29th).

42409688,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPZd,1694760326,Bitcoin Bounce Puts Altcoin Bears at Risk,"As bitcoin (BTC) moves higher, the recently shorted alternative cryptocurrencies like solana's SOL may see leverage liquidations and exaggerated price rallies.  Since Monday's brief move below crucial support at $25,000, bitcoin has risen over 6% to trade near $26,600 at press time, CoinDesk data show.  Upbeat China August retail sales and factory output data released early Friday revived risk sentiment in financial markets, clearing the way for continued price gains in the leading cryptocurrencies.  Alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, Ether (ETH), SOL, Tron's TRX, Dogecoin (DOGE) and are tracking bitcoin higher, as they usually do. The altcoin bounce comes days after traders sold these tokens, pricing in the possibility of defunct exchange FTX securing approval from the bankruptcy court to sell assets from its multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency holdings. SOL fell over 8% on Monday, leading the decline in altcoins after a court filing showed FTX's solana holdings at $1.6 billion.  Upbeat China August retail sales and factory output data released early Friday revived risk sentiment in financial markets, clearing the way for continued price gains in the leading cryptocurrencies.  The recovery puts altcoin bears, who took leveraged bearish bets on SOL and other tokens on fears of potential FTX creditor selling, at risk of liquidation. Exchanges liquidate positions when the market moves against a trader's bets, leading to margin shortage and the trader fails to provide additional margin.  Potential forced liquidation of shorts will likely bring additional bullish pressures for SOL's price, leading to a short squeeze-led rally.  ""The biggest near-term risk (pain trade) is a positive one: short-covering of altcoins leading to leveraged liquidations driving up the entire complex. SOL is a good one to watch, for example,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email.  Since Monday, funding rates in perpetual futures have been consistently negative. Funding rates represent cost of holding long and short positions in perpetual futures. A positive rate implies leverage is skewed on the bullish side while a negative rate indicates otherwise.  Open interest or the dollar value locked in active perpetual futures tied to SOL has increased by over 16% to a one-month high of $338 million, according to Coinglass.  The combination of rising open interest and negative funding rates suggests traders have recently raised bearish bets in SOL.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/15/bitcoin-bounce-puts-altcoin-bears-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a0f24c4adfcd8632e58af0bf3a81e47ac78aa2-1716x988.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409685,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPT1,1694760219,"South Korea’s Crypto Ecosystem Shakes Off Terra Debacle, With Gaming Dominating Web3 Activity","“Keep building” was the general vibe of last week’s Korea Blockchain Week (KBW) event – a complete 180-degree turn from last year’s comparatively flashier show. Homegrown gaming upstarts dominated the venue, pitching gambling, racing, metaverse and arcade apps built on networks, such as Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and others.  There were little whispers of Terra, the Do Kwon-run blockchain with a large Korean fanbase whose tokens ran up to a nearly $40 billion market capitalization before spectacularly imploding. Some opined the industry took a while to dust off Kwon’s hubris, but was slowly gaining user trust again.  “From the discussions I had with the major ecosystem players, it did have a huge impact that forever changed the Korean [decentralized finance, or DeFi] ecosystem for institutions,” Hoon Kim, the chief technology officer at blockchain project Astar, told CoinDesk. “It made it harder for the retail investors to look at domestic projects, and companies started to look at all of their options with a critical lens.”  “But I would also say that this is a net positive as institutions and corporations are more into real-life use cases with different innovations. So DeFi or anything that relies on the market condition has too much risk for businesses,” Kim added.  However, Terra continued to remain a touchy topic for locals. Some expressed they felt betrayed and expected better from Kwon, a Korean national.  As such, Korean banks are gradually dipping their toes in the market. Onstage on Tuesday, BitGo, a crypto custodian based in California, said it had signed a strategic business agreement with South Korean commercial bank Hana Bank.  The deal covers security solutions, tech tie-ups, and a possible joint venture. BitGo will also assist Hana Bank in the development of custody services in the second half of 2024, as reported.  Local developers and salespeople told CoinDesk that trading activity is picking up on local exchanges, fuelling the attention of traditional businesses.  “The industry is fighting strong scrutiny due to Terra's fiasco. But there's still a good amount of trading going on,” said Jen Kim, chief operating officer of NFTBank. “Upbit, in fact, has seen an increase in the trading volume recently. So, Korea still has the potential to play a meaningful role in driving the market up again.”  In July, a favorable court case involving Ripple Labs pushed up prices of the closely -related XRP tokens – with local exchange UpBit clocking $2.5 billion in volumes over a 24-hour period.  On the application side, publicly traded Korean game publisher Neowiz said it planned to build games on the Avalanche blockchain via its Web3 arm IntellaX. A key reason was cited as Korea having an appetite for esports and blockchain games, with a large fanbase for various gaming cultures and huge consumer interest.  Gaming Needs an ‘ETF’ Moment  However, even as blockchain-based gaming remained a huge theme throughout the event, few developers were a contrarian voice as to why the sector could be slightly overhyped.  “I wouldn't say blockchain gaming or NFTs are an immense interest in terms of the users,” said Astar’s Kim. “Users are looking more into new experiences, and businesses are starting to lose competition in the traditional market as the entire industry is being saturated.”  The sector itself is struggling to find a smash hit, as many of the most popular blockchain games only have a few hundred to a thousand users – a fraction of what third-tier traditional games on platforms like Steam count.  “So, for companies to stay competitive, they are incentivized to deliver something new for a different generation, and it just happens to be that blockchain technology is the best thing for leveraging the network effect that the young generations seek,” Kim added.  South Korea Still Isn’t a Hub  A final takeaway from the show is that it's still very much a Korea Blockchain Week, not a pan-Asia or international event such as the ongoing Token 2049 conference in Singapore.  Local companies dominated the trade show floor and advertising. An expectation, considering that Korea is a large economy with a strong domestic crypto industry.  But crypto is an international business; there’s just one market. In the world of traditional finance, one might see traders with a specialty in investing in the financial markets of emerging nations, and with that an industry of supporting infrastructure.  Crypto doesn’t have this same analogy. There’s no equivalent to the African bond market or South-East Asia equities market. There’s just one crypto market.  So a focus on localization is a sacrifice of liquidity. The more regionalized a crypto product is, save for exchanges that need to specialize in licensing and fiat onramps, the bigger the chance of it becoming abandoned or vapourware.  At last month’s IVS crypto conference in Kyoto, there were plenty of gaming and NFT projects looking to capitalize on all-things Japan but on-chain data suggests that lots of these are crashing back down to earth after launch.  Just think: how many of these projects are actually registered in Korea, and how many call Singapore home?",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/09/15/south-koreas-crypto-ecosystem-shakes-off-terra-debacle-with-gaming-dominating-web3-activity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcc7259e9bd7c703b239d949221d9b9a66874c9c-4240x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409687,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPWK,1694759555,"Binance.US Not Playing Ball With Probe, SEC Says, as Focus Turns to Custody Arm Ceffu","Binance.US continues to rely on a custody provider apparently developed and marketed by the company’s international arm, in violation of a previous deal, the SEC has said.  The crypto exchange says clients' assets are safe and that regulators are merely engaged on a “futile fishing expedition.""  Binance.US has been accused of not cooperating in a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said the company’s staking, clearing and brokerage services violate federal securities law, in court filings unsealed Thursday.  Federal U.S. regulators worry the crypto exchange’s use of Ceffu, a custody service it links to Binance’s international arm, violates a previous deal intended to stop assets being squirreled overseas.  Binance.US’ holding company, known as BAM, has provided “only approximately 220 documents ... many that consist of unintelligible screenshots and documents without dates or signatures,” the SEC said, of the process of evidence-gathering known as discovery.  “The limited discovery BAM has provided to date raises questions about whether defendants are in violation of the consent order,” referring to an earlier legal deal to ensure only local U.S. staff have access to funds, added the document, which appears to be a partially unsealed version of one filed in August.  The SEC is worried about the company’s use of Ceffu, as it says the wallet custody software is affiliated with international entity Binance Holdings Ltd, meaning other entities in Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s empire could have control over U.S. customer assets.  In a previous Sept. 12 filing, Binance.US called the regulator’s concerns over Ceffu “much ado about nothing,” and its demand for more documents a “futile fishing expedition.”  Merely creating wallets as provider of the Ceffu software doesn’t mean the company’s international arm has custody or access to customer funds, Binance.US said.  Ceffu is the new name for Binance Custody, which started operating in December 2021 and rebranded in February 2023.  In a statement sent to CoinDesk after this story was published, a spokesperson for Ceffu who declined to identify themselves, stressed separation from Binance, saying the entity had ""always operated as an independent and separate wallet solution offered to institutional clients"" and runs as a ""fully independent third-party technology service provider.""  Terms of service on the Ceffu website suggest its legal name is Bifinity UAB, a company previously identified by UK regulators as part of the Binance Group, and which SEC officials have previously testified is beneficially owned by Zhao.

17663533,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551488,1694759367,Algorand (ALGO) May Have A Chance At A Bullish Streak – Here’s How,"Algorand (ALGO) has recently announced significant changes to its protocol that are set to reshape the future of the blockchain network. These developments are aimed at increasing decentralization and fostering consensus among participants, signaling a bold step forward for the project. One of the most striking revelations in Algorand’s recent announcement is the network’s transition from relays to a peer-to-peer (P2P) network approach. This fundamental shift represents a departure from traditional blockchain architectures and underscores Algorand’s commitment to further decentralization. By adopting a P2P network, Algorand aims to empower its community, enabling more nodes to participate directly in the network’s operations. This move aligns with the broader industry trend of reducing reliance on intermediaries, ultimately enhancing the network’s security and resilience. Related Reading: Dogecoin Key Challenge: Will The $0.06 Support Level Hold? Algorand: Incentivizing Consensus For Greater Decentralization Another pivotal aspect of Algorand’s plan is the introduction of incentives to drive consensus within the network. By incentivizing participants, Algorand seeks to strengthen its decentralized nature and encourage active involvement in the consensus process. The @Algorand protocol is evolving to a peer-to-peer gossip network not requiring relays, while maintaining finality and blocktime, and introducing consensus incentivization, a game-changer toward true decentralization. 👊 pic.twitter.com/pHZmduYLn5 — Algorand Foundation (@AlgoFoundation) September 13, 2023 This approach not only enhances security but also promotes a more democratic and inclusive blockchain ecosystem. As the network evolves, these incentives are expected to attract a diverse array of stakeholders, fostering a sense of shared ownership and responsibility. The implications of these transformative changes are already resonating throughout the ALGO community and the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite ALGO’s recent price struggles, which currently hover at $0.094271 according to CoinGecko, there are signs of potential bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been steadily climbing out of the oversold zone, hinting at a possible reversal of fortune. ALGO market cap hits $736 million today. Chart: TradingView.com Moreover, ALGO has recently experienced its highest social dominance in the past 24 hours. This uptick in social visibility can be attributed to Algorand’s groundbreaking announcement, which has sparked conversations and enthusiasm among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike. Asia Broadband Inc. Joins Algorand Ecosystem In a piece of welcome news, Asia Broadband Inc. has announced its intention to migrate its AABBG Token, a gold-backed cryptocurrency, from the Ethereum blockchain to Algorand. This migration, set to occur on October 1, is expected to provide token holders with improved transaction efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced transparency. This decision underscores the growing trust in Algorand’s capabilities as a blockchain platform capable of supporting innovative projects.

XRP price could start a fresh rally if it clears the $0.505 and $0.515 resistance levels. Ripple’s token price is attempting a move above $0.510 and $0.525 against the US dollar. The price is now trading below $0.505 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.4840 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $0.515. Ripple’s Token Price Eyes Bullish Break After another drop, Ripple’s XRP found support near the $0.458 zone against the US Dollar. The price traded as low as $0.4589 and recently started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.480 resistance. XRP climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5490 swing high to the $0.4589 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.4840 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $0.505 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It seems to be facing resistance near the $0.505 zone. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $0.5145 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5490 swing high to the $0.4589 low.

Despite the native token of the Shiba Ecosystem experiencing a downturn, Robinhood has added over 800 billion SHIB tokens to its portfolio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges To $26,700, But Will This Rise Last? Robinhood’s SHIB Portfolio Hits The Trillions On August 30, crypto data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that Robinhood ranked as the fifth-largest holder of Ethereum (ETH) and owned 34.086 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $279.85 million. While the broader cryptocurrency industry faced a decline, retail investors saw an opportunity to accumulate assets during the price drop. Between August 31 and September 13, Robinhood’s hot wallets witnessed an influx of 877 billion SHIB tokens. One of the brokerage’s known wallets added 579.7 billion SHIB, bringing its total Shiba Inu holdings to 8.02 trillion tokens. This increase indicates a 2.58% rise in Robinhood’s SHIB holdings, bringing the total from 34.086 trillion to 34.936 trillion as of the current date. Remarkably, just 35 days prior, Robinhood held a mere 20 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to around $197.40 million. This surge represents a 74.8% growth in the platform’s Shiba Inu portfolio. Overall, as Robinhood continues to expand its involvement in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with its increased SHIB holdings, it remains to be seen how this strategy will unfold amidst the ongoing market fluctuations. The platform’s move to bolster its Shiba Inu portfolio suggests a long-term outlook and confidence in the prospects of the token and the Shiba Ecosystem. Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 Solution Hits Impressive Milestones Shibarium, the highly anticipated layer-2 scalability solution of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has reached significant milestones, demonstrating its potential. The latest data showcases the notable progress of Shibarium, including total blocks, transactions, wallet addresses, and daily transaction volume. Currently, Shibarium boasts a total of 631,140 blocks. Each block represents a collection of transactions within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This figure highlights the active usage of the layer-2 solution. The total number of transactions conducted through Shibarium has reached a remarkable 2,610,228. Moreover, Shibarium has also witnessed a surge in wallet addresses. Currently, there are 1,245,886 wallet addresses within the ecosystem. Related Reading: Analyst’s Ultra Bullish Prediction Puts XRP Price At $10,000, But When? Daily, Shibarium processes an average of 200.88K transactions. This transaction volume further reinforces the layer-2 solution’s ability to handle a substantial load of transactions efficiently. Despite the positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem and the growing trust from more holders, the SHIB token has only shown profits over the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.00000740. However, it is crucial to note that SHIB has experienced significant losses over longer time frames. Notably, it has declined by 7.5%, 28%, and 38% over the fourteen-day, thirty-day, and year-to-date periods. In the near term, if the token continues to generate profits in the coming days, it may encounter resistance at the $0.00000756 level, presenting a potential obstacle to further price appreciation. Conversely, if SHIB fails to maintain its current level and continues on a prolonged downward trend, there is a possibility that the token could retrace to its all-time low of $0.00000563. This scenario becomes more likely if its last support floor at $0.00000642 does not hold, and positive news regarding the ecosystem and the overall crypto market fails to spur a recovery. The future trajectory of the crypto market remains uncertain, and it is yet to be determined whether a recovery or further decline reminiscent of the crypto winter is on the horizon.

17653000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551460,1694736021,75% Of All Binance Fiat Trading Volume Is In Turkish Lira,"75% of all fiat volume in Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by client count, is dominated by the Turkish Lira (TRY). At this rate, Kaiko, a blockchain analytics firm, confirms that the Turkish Lira is the most preferred currency, pointing to a shift in the global dynamics, especially regarding crypto adoption. Turkish Lira Popular Fiat In Binance As of September 14, 75% of all fiat volume was in Turkish Lira, ahead of the Euro and Brazilian Real (BRL). In the past three years, an unidentified cryptocurrency has gained popularity over traditional fiat currencies. From 2021, TRY’s use was among the lowest, with the Euro and BRL being popular. However, the trend changed in 2022 as adoption spiked, pushing the currency to the top in 2023. Related Reading: FTX’s Billion-Dollar Solana Liquidation: Market Crash Or Just Hype? When writing on September 14, Binance remains the most popular cryptocurrency exchange, supporting over 380 coins. At the same time, the crypto exchange supports over ten fiat currencies, of which other coins, besides those mentioned above, include the Nigerian Naira, GBP, and the Australian Dollar (AUD). Looking at statistics, USDT, TUSD, and FUSD pairs are among the most liquid. This observation has been confirmed by Kaiko data, which shows that fiat trading on Binance had contracted by over 95% from 2021 when prices of top crypto assets peaked. By November 2021, Bitcoin prices had soared to nearly $70,000, lifting trading volumes in fiat and stablecoin pairs. USDT And Stablecoins Still Reign Supreme CoinMarketCap data reveals that the BTC/USDT pair is the most liquid, with the average daily trading volume exceeding $986 million when writing. On the other hand, the BTC/TUSD attracts over $486 million in trading volume. This development highlights the level of liquidity of stablecoins and how they are entrenched in crypto trading. For example, the processing of fiat deposits or withdrawals on Binance can range from hours to days, depending on the method used. Unlike fiat currencies, stablecoins are more fluid and can be transferred within seconds. For instance, USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, is available in over five blockchains, with Ethereum and Tron emerging as the most popular minting platforms. Related Reading: Analyst’s Ultra Bullish Prediction Puts XRP Price At $10,000, But When? Following the delisting of USDC, BUSD volumes spiked. However, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) directive, barring Paxos–the then issuer–from minting new tokens, saw activity shrink as USDT cemented its position. TUSD and FUSD activity on Binance remains high, as data shows. A recent survey by KuCoin, a crypto exchange, reveals that over 50% of people in Turkey own crypto. The Turkish government has also been experimenting with a central bank digital currency (CBC), the Digital Lira.
