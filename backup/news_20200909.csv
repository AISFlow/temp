42405021,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbRR,1599689574,SushiSwap Migration Ushers in Era of ‘Protocol Politicians’,"SushiSwap, the community-owned automated market maker (AMM), now has a new set of leaders. Nine signers of a multisig wallet controlling the project's funds have been elected to govern SushiSwap through full decentralization.      On Ethereum, a multisig has worked out to be something like a board of directors in the analog world, such that it takes any six of the nine members to approve changes to the SushiSwap code or to spend its development funds.      These new leaders were chosen through a process largely inside the SushiSwap Discord server following the departure of two of the project's three co-founders. Some stumped for a spot and some sailed through by name recognition within the community, reflecting a campaign-like process we are likely to see more of in the future.      For context, cryptocurrency projects approve actions using signatures by private keys. Properly signed statements authorize the Ethereum blockchain to take the actions it is directed to take. By allowing multiple-signature setups – where actions can be approved by a few of a larger set of authorized signers – smart-contract-based protocols can create a board, but without the face-to-face meetings.      In the SushiSwap election, 2,143 wallets participated, each able to vote for as many candidates as they wanted. Participants could also vote against specific candidates. Voting ended at 14:00 UTC on Sept. 9.      Users had to have liquidity provider (LP) tokens in the SUSHI/ETH pool on SushiSwap to vote, rather than simply holding SUSHI.      Read more: SushiSwap Will Withdraw Up to $830M From Uniswap Today: Why It Matters for DeFi    Voting dynamics    Newly elected multisig member Mick Hagen, a founder of crypto startup Genesis Block, explained to CoinDesk, ""The people who have the most skin in the game, their SUSHI and ETH actively at stake, should have the loudest voice and most voting power.""      Newly elected multisig member 0xMaki pointed out that this setup protects against people borrowing SUSHI to impact a vote. 0xMaki, the remaining SushiSwap co-founder, added that more advanced participation schemes such as quadratic voting will be floated to the community soon.      The newly elected members are Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX), Robert Leshner (Compound Labs), 0xMaki, Larry Cermak (The Block, who is sometimes credited with inspiring SushiSwap), CMS Holdings (an investment firm launched in November), Matthew Graham (Sino Global Capital), Hagen, Adam Cochran (DuckDuckGo) and Zippo (the pseudonymous creator of the SushiSwap dashboard).      CoinDesk has not yet managed to confirm directly with all nine of the elected members as to whether they will take their positions.      Thus far, Leshner, 0xMaki and Hagen (tentatively, pending counsel) have confirmed directly that they plan to take on the role. Based on statements on Twitter, it seems clear that Bankman-Fried, CMS Holdings, Cochran and Zippo will as well.    Seriously, campaigns?    Politics is coming to crypto.      Crypto entrepreneur Ric Burton has been well ahead of the trend of people taking leadership roles in protocols, first stating his intention back in January, during discussions of the DigixDAO token buyback, to be a ""protocol politician."" The idea is to enable smaller holders of governance tokens to delegate their clout to protocol politicians as a countervailing force to crypto whales and the big venture capital firms with large token holdings.      The SushiSwap process hewed closer to a traditional political campaign than some others have, though in much more modest ways. Several candidates posted statements of various kinds in the ""multisig-interviews"" channel on the SushiSwap Discord, for example.      There, Cochran wrote a lengthy statement, including the following:    ""I was the first voice to come out pointing out the major red flags in Chef Nomi's project and the need for a multi-sig wallet. Because of this I was accused of spreading FUD and even received personal threats. People didn't realize I was invested in $SUSHI.""    Hagen told CoinDesk that when the multisig was first floated, a lot of anonymous accounts and influencers started making noise about it on Twitter, but that quickly became pointless, from his perspective.      He wrote in an email, ""The only semi-influencer that became a signer in the end was journalist Larry Cermak. But all the other signers are serious builders/operators/investors in crypto/defi. The interview channel in Discord was mostly only used by candidates who were desperate for attention.""      Cermak has not replied to repeated requests for comment from CoinDesk since the nomination, though he has retweeted some positive mentions about his election. He told CoinDesk via email on Sept. 1, ""I am not involved in any way and have no stake whatsoever,"" though he did provide a fair amount of feedback early on in the Discord.    Distant parallels    When EOS was launched, a similar attitude prevailed, but then ""block producer"" roles were quickly overtaken not by builders but by larger holders. However, Hagen noted that the plan now is to make the multisig a temporary situation, a matter of months, not years.      Aaron Wright, co-founder of the ConsenSys-backed OpenLaw, wrote on Twitter that multisig members could get themselves in a hairy spot with regulators:      Leshner replied to Wright, saying, ""DeFi is reinventing the board of directors.""      Hagen concurred but noted, ""This multisig is only temporary. It's progressive decentralization. It's not perfect, but it's much better than having Chef Nomi or [Sam Bankman-Fried] having full control.""      Burton declined to actively pursue a role in SushiSwap. As an ongoing observer of roles like these, however, he told CoinDesk:    ""I think what we are seeing is that the incentives today are for whales to rig the game in their favour. The only way I can think of that shifting is if protocol politicians can make a great income.""  Migration update    Today SushiSwap extracted over $800 million from Uniswap, though nearly all of that had only been placed in Uniswap for the purposes of earning SUSHI ahead of the extraction. In fact, at the end of the process, Uniswap has come out ahead in terms of liquidity, at least as of this writing.      The SushiSwap token migration is complete, according to Bankman-Fried. DeFi Pulse shows Uniswap liquidity dropping from well over $1 billion in crypto assets to $430 million as of 18:00 UTC.      Uniswap had $285 million in total value locked on Aug. 26, the day SushiSwap was first announced by the now exited creator, NomiChef, on Medium.      SushiSwap does not currently have an accurate portal to check total value locked and it is not yet tracked by DeFi Pulse. Based on the estimates prior to migration, it should have something like $300 million more in liquidity than Uniswap, though representing many fewer tokens.      It remains to be seen how many liquidity providers will maintain their stakes once the liquidity mining rewards in SUSHI drop from 1,000 per block to 100, which should happen on Friday.",POSITIVE,ETH | SUSHI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SUSHI | UNI | ZRX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/09/sushiswap-migration-ushers-in-era-of-protocol-politicians,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2bcaab442785340dce376a5d8c89988129d92fe-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405029,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbYK,1599683630,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Makes Headway to $10.3K; Ether Volatility Highest Since May,"Bitcoin is eking out gains Wednesday while ether’s volatility is up on DeFi drama.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,299 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,818- $10,349  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin is slowly making gains Wednesday, reaching as high as $10,349 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin’s Correlation With Gold Hits Record High      “After the Sept. 2-3 drop, bitcoin has been stuck in a narrow range of $10,100 to $10,500, looking for direction,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for crypto quantitative firm ExoAlpha. “Each drop below $10,000 has been furiously bought, keeping BTC above that,” he added.      Over the past week, traders have come in and scooped up sub-$10,000 bitcoin, with $9,800 being a level tested but retraced.      While bitcoin is trending upward, the cryptocurrency needs volume to boost it further, Lifchitz added. “This is typical of a wounded asset recovering,” Lifchitz added.” Contrary to traditional assets, there's no federal printing press to artificially prop up digital assets, only good old demand,” he said.      So far Wednesday, demand as measured in volume is relatively flat – a paltry $245 million combined on major spot exchanges according to Skew. This is much lower than a week ago, when spot volumes hit a one-month high of $1 billion.      John Willock, CEO of digital-asset liquidity firm Tritium, says the ebb and flow in the bitcoin market is simply natural. “This short-term dip down to current levels was a reasonable pullback,” he said. “A steady move upwards in BTC is fully in line with my expectations for the medium-term and through the end of the year.”      Read More: ‘High’ Severity Bug in Bitcoin Software Revealed 2 Years After Fix      According to ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz, “Until bitcoin reaches above $10,600, there’s no hope for a retry toward $12,000 anytime soon.”      Read More: Huobi Launches Crypto Saving Products to Compete With DeFi    Ether volatility up    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $357 and climbing 6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

It is clear that ether is more volatile than bitcoin, which, at 57% one-month realized annualized volatility Wednesday, is at a level consistent with its August volatility numbers.      Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, said uncertainty surrounding decentralized finance, or DeFi, is helping drive volatility in ether, and not in the derivatives that are usually the culprit in crypto.      “I don't think much of this volatility is driven by ETH optionality, as the market is relatively small,” Shah said. “Rather, it seems to be a byproduct of pent-up disbelief in gas prices and the large rotations in total value locked in DeFI,” he added.

42405023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbSQ,1599683493,"1,000 New Token Pairs Added to Uniswap in One Week; Buyers Beware","Leading decentralized exchange Uniswap has added 1,000 new token pairs in the past week – many of questionable quality – as the decentralized finance (DeFi) craze continues unabated.    Since the start of September, Uniswap users have added an average of 150 pairs per day, signalling the popularity of permissionless token creation now possible through the exchange’s token factory, a prominent feature of the decentralized trading platform.  A record high of 221 pairs were created Sunday, according to Dune Analytics.  Exponential growth in the number of tokens and pairs on Uniswap is “a good thing,"" according to Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari, as it “shows the power of a completely open, permissionless financial primitives.""  Uniswap currently supports 8,278 trading pairs, a 90% increase over the past 30 days and nearly 10 times more pairs than Binance, the largest traditional cryptocurrency exchange, which currently supports 838 markets, according to Cryptowatch.  For all of August, Binance announced new listings for only 15 tokens, up from four listings announced a year ago.  Uniswap has reported experienced record-breaking trading volume for the past four months, as CoinDesk previously reported, even though only four tokens — SushiToken, USDC, tether, and wrapped ether — report 24-hour trading volume greater than $50 million.  Of course, without gatekeepers to approve or deny new listings, the exchange platforms will almost inevitably support “a lot of worthless tokens or outright scams purporting to be something they’re not,” Purdy told CoinDesk. Users are therefore responsible for creating tools on their own that protect against these fraudulent tokens, he added.  Demonstrating the complete permissionlessness of token listings on Uniswap, one user listed the “Uniswap Exchange Token” Wednesday afternoon, a token believed to be fake and not created by the Uniswap team.  Uniswap did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on the newly listed ""Uniswap"" token, nor to a request for comment on the exponential growth in trading pairs listed on the exchange.  However, in a blog post in late August, the Uniswap team acknowledged the problem its own permissionless system was helping create. “As the rate of token issuance accelerates, it has become increasingly difficult for users to filter out high quality, legitimate tokens from scams, fakes, and duplicates,” the Uniswap team wrote, adding that the trend is something “we expect will only accelerate in the future.”",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | BNB | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/09/1000-new-token-pairs-added-to-uniswap-in-one-week-buyers-beware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df51d9c12e536f9daf9aa3d68764f6349f1b10cc-1044x710.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuy1,1599680729,"Twetch Launches Encrypted Messaging, In-Chat Payments on BSV Blockchain","Twetch, a micropayment-based social network that runs on the Bitcoin SV blockchain, has introduced an encrypted direct-messaging function that lets users send each other money in the chat.      Released Wednesday, Twetch Chat adds a layer of privacy and security to the Twitter alternative and is in line with a trend toward more private communications that have been a focus of companies in recent years. The twist is that you need a cryptocurrency wallet to take advantage of the feature – specifically, one that connects to BSV, a splinter network from Bitcoin Cash, which itself seceded from the main Bitcoin chain.      “Unlike legacy internet services, Twetch offloads key management to the user’s account (which is a Bitcoin [SV] wallet),” said Twetch CEO Joshua Petty, whose amphibian Twitter avatar is a nod to the danker corners of the internet, in a statement. “It’s a step toward breaking up the big tech data monopoly.”    To use Twetch, you need a Moneybutton or Relayx wallet to store and send BSV. Moneybutton and Relayx both use the PayMail protocol, which creates an email-like ID like “frog@relayx.io” instead of the string of numbers and characters typically associated with a wallet. When setting up a Twetch account, the service randomly generates a 12-word seed phrase associated with each unique wallet’s public key. This seed is then encrypted and stored in Twetch's database. Whenever you want to log in, you have to decrypt the seed to prove your identity and gain access.  The AES encryption standard uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. So when you want to chat on Twetch, the chat initiator creates an AES cipher, or code, for the chat. This cipher is then used by both participants to send and read encrypted messages.  The cipher itself is encrypted by the user's seed/key and stored by Twetch in its servers so the user can decrypt it later, and only chat participants can read and send messages.  When you want to chat, you find the person you want to communicate with and agree on a room in a “house.” The person who initiates the chat creates a special “lock” and key from their and their partner’s key, so no one except them can enter the conversation.  Twetch Chat is intended to be used for business as well as social interactions. Within the chat, users can negotiate deals in private and pay each other as part of the same interaction.    According to Petty, early testers of Twetch Chat demonstrated to him that users will spend more time on the platform when using this feature.    “Messaging is a key feature for any social network,” he wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Most of the apps people use right now are not encrypted let alone give you access to the data like we do. This is setting the standard of how all software is going to work. Sound security and sound money built in by default.”    Nothing is foolproof, however.    “Just like with your bitcoin or crypto wallet, it is possible people lose access to all their wallets/private keys,” Petty acknowledged. “However, it is possible to cross-sign with multiple wallets on Twetch.”",POSITIVE,BSV,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | BSV,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/09/twetch-launches-encrypted-messaging-in-chat-payments-on-bsv-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50cf4d8818e9608c1cef1d0309701e8566477b35-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuiv,1599675715,Belarus Nonprofit Helps Protestors With Bitcoin Grants,"In protest-ridden Belarus, dissidents are using bitcoin to get around political repression.      On Aug. 8, the day of a highly controversial presidential election, a city hall employee in the town of Pinsk named Maria Koltsyna went to a polling station with a white hairband on her wrist.      It was a small gesture of protest: Belarusians who voted against the incumbent president Alexander Lukashenko wore white. Maria’s co-workers immediately took notice of her white accessory, and soon after she was fired.      People in Belarus have been protesting the re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko for a month, claiming he was not the legitimate winner. There have also been factory strikes, and some police officers publicly quit their jobs rather than violently break up peaceful rallies.      The regime has responded to protests with mass arrests, internet shutdowns and even threats to get help from Russia, its bigger neighbor to the East.      In Belarus, the state maintains an iron grip on the economy, and getting fired for political reasons means you might not find another job, at least not in your town. But Maria heard about a new nonprofit fund, BYSOL, which was helping people who were fired for their protest activities. She applied for help and got it – in bitcoin.      Maria had never touched crypto before, but the team behind the fund taught her how to install a mobile crypto wallet.      She “figured it out in 10 minutes,” she told CoinDesk. With the grant, she bought a new laptop to get a new job in IT. The rest of the money was enough to pay for several months of rent and food, so that Maria could get by until she got a new job, she said.      Maria was one of several dozen people who discovered bitcoin in Belarus thanks to BYSOL, a nonprofit fund started by a group of tech entrepreneurs and civic activists this August. BYSOL has raised over $2 million in donations over the past month.    Controllable channels    BYSOL chose bitcoin as a way to transfer funds as other ways are under the total control of the government, Russian-language publication Forklog reported. The name of the fund is an abbreviation: BY (Belarus country code) + SOLidarity.      Yaroslav Likhachevskiy is one of the founders of BYSOL and the CEO of Deepdee, a Belarussian-Dutch startup that develops AI solutions for health care. He told CoinDesk that bitcoin is the only payment method that can’t be controlled by the authorities. The regime is strictly monitoring bank transfers and can freeze funds related to protest activities.      Belarus law enforcement is paying particular attention to any money transfers by people and entities related to BYSOL, Likhachevskiy said. He shared with CoinDesk an order issued by the Belarus Ministry of Interior, which told the country’s banks to disclose information about all transactions related to Likhachevskiy and other people helping BYSOL.      Likhachevskiy said he was once a crypto skeptic, but now he believes bitcoin can really be helpful.    Can’t block it    BYSOL says it is raising most of its funds via donations through Facebook, with some money also coming via PayPal, transfers to a Revolut bank account and bitcoin and ethereum wallets. More than $2 million has been raised, which include the founders’ contributions, as well as donations from individual supporters and businesses, Likhachevskiy said.      The fund is registered in Europe for safety reasons.      “If we did it in Belarus, the funds would be confiscated,” Likhachevskiy said.      But sending money across borders isn’t easy, either.      “Right now, all people crossing the Belarus border are getting thoroughly searched to check if they are bringing cash into the country. The KGB [Belarus security services] is monitoring all the transactions from abroad,” Likhachevskiy said.      A decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin can’t be stopped on the border, so BYSOL is sending $1,500 worth of BTC to people who have been fired because of their protest activities or who chose to quit their jobs in protest.      First, people send applications to BYSOL explaining how they lost their jobs. They need to attach documents to confirm this, such as contract termination notices that are issued in Belarus when people get fired.      When a case is verified by the volunteers of BYSOL, they send instructions on how to install and use a mobile wallet that can receive BTC. BYSOL partnered with the Ukrainian startup Trustee Wallet, which allows users to connect the wallet to a bank card. Then the applicants share their bitcoin addresses, receive bitcoin and swap it for fiat right in the app, receiving money on their debit cards.      Normally, fiat gateways can be monitored by authorities, but Trustee Wallet business development director Viktor Manin told CoinDesk that when people sell their crypto in the app, they do it in a peer-to-peer fashion, so there is no centralized bank account in Belarus that can be blocked by the authorities.      Furthermore, when you have multiple people sending money between accounts, it’s harder for authorities to figure out the purpose of the transfers.    The cost of protest    Last week, law enforcement raided the office of tech entrepreneur Mikata Mikado, one of BYSOL’s co-founders. Four employees at the business, called PandaDoc, were arrested for embezzlement.      Mikado had previously published a video on Instagram offering help to police officers who rejected orders to beat and arrest innocent people and quit their jobs.      “It’s hard to move to the side of good now. But if the reason is financial difficulties, I can help you,” Mikado said in the video.      According to Likhachevskiy, Mikado put some of his own money into BYSOL. Likhachevskiy argues that the embezzlement charges are ridiculous. He pointed out the U.S.-headquartered PandaDoc has just closed another funding round and “went through all the circles of due diligence.” Mikado did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.    Road to adoption    In general, Belarus does not have a very active crypto market, said Anton Kozlovsky, head of Paxful in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.      As the political crisis unfolded, people started buying more U.S. dollars to hedge against the devaluing national currency, the Belarusian ruble, and banks even reported a deficit of dollars last week. But this has not yet prompted any significant growth in crypto volumes, said Kozlov.      Even though the country officially legalized crypto transactions in 2018, not many people use crypto and businesses don’t normally accept it as a means of payment, said Eugene Romanenko, a Belarusian blockchain expert.      However, more people, especially IT professionals who were not interested in crypto before, are starting to ask and learn about it, Romanenko said, especially when they look for ways to send money between each other or take their funds with them as they leave the country.      “More and more people are learning that cryptocurrencies can be used to solve real-life problems,” Romanenko said.      If nothing else, crypto can be converted to fiat to pay for daily necessities. According to Likhachevskiy, more than 50 people have already received help from BYSOL over the last two weeks. He added that while $1,500 might seem like not a ton of money, in Minsk, the Belarus capital, you can rent a one-bedroom for about $200 a month.      Outside of the capital, $1,500 can be a life-changing amount of money – like it was for Maria.      It’s an educational experience as well: Maria said that now that she learned how to deal with crypto, she might use it in the future. Recently, she and her friends used crypto to send money to each other, and that did not seem like a weird thing to do anymore. She added:    “Now I know that anybody can figure it out.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/09/belarus-nonprofit-helps-protestors-with-bitcoin-grants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9552472da2b5878b2ea7751e8c34680e3ee8b4b-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384652,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkunx,1599674530,Argo's H1 Revenue Soars but Profits Drop as Bitcoin's Halving Boosts Mining Costs,"Argo Blockchain's earnings look like a tale of two cities, with revenue almost quadrupling even as the arms race for ever-more powerful mining rigs caused pre-tax profits to slide 45%.    The London-listed company mined a total of 1,669 bitcoin – up 545% from H1 2019 – with revenue increasing $8 million year on year (YoY) to £11.12 million (US$14.5 million), according to half-year results released Wednesday.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) – which factors out the declining value of a mining rig over time – nearly doubled to £3.23 million (US$4.2 million) YoY.  Rising interest in mining bitcoin – which currently trades at just over $10,000 – means the computing power needed to mine bitcoin has been rising as well, reaching a new all-time high on Tuesday.  As such, older mining units, like Bitmain's AntMiner S9, quickly become obsolete and unprofitable as new rigs, with more hashing power, come to market. As an example, the Antminer S19, which came out in February, is nearly nine times more powerful than the S9.  To stay in the game, professional operators are under constant pressure to replenish their mining equipment every few years. Because of this, the mining industry is highly susceptible to rapid capital depreciation.  When rig depreciation, as well as electricity costs, are accounted for, Argo's pretax profit came to £0.52 million ($677,000) – a 45% decrease YoY.  Argo's total capacity rose to 18,000 mining rigs after it purchased 11,000 rigs in H1 2020, including $500,000 worth of zcash miners acquired at the end of June.  CEO Peter Wall, who said EBITDA was his preferred performance metric, told CoinDesk he was pleased by the results, saying they were better than those of most other publicly listed miners.  In August rival Canadian miner Hut 8 reported a sharp 28% drop in revenue in Q2. It only finished in the black because the company's bitcoin holdings increased in value.  May's bitcoin halving event – which took the block reward from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC – will likely cause the the crypto mining industry to consolidate further, Wall said, with smaller entities coming under increasing pressure to remain profitable.  Increasing mining capacity remains a core part of the company's strategy, Wall continued. He declined to comment on whether the company has any more acquisition deals in the pipeline.  Argo shares finished Wednesday trading in London at 5.66 penny sterling (GBX) – up 3% from the market open.

Top shelf    Bitmain bust A court in China has denied an appeal by bitcoin mining giant Bitmain seeking $30 million in damages from the three co-founders of Poolin, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining pools, CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports. The mining giant Bitmain claims Poolin’s founding executive broke non-compete agreements in starting its BTC mining operations, leading to millions in lost revenue. While the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court found Bitmain failed to provide sufficient evidence that its business losses equaled more than fines already imposed, it did agree to increase fines for Poolin’s co-founders. Bitmain originally sought $4.3 million in restitution when filing the suit in April 2019. Meanwhile, rival mining firm Canaan said it will repurchase up to $10 million in stock, followed by a prolonged period of underperformance.      Acquisition Blockchain investment firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) has acquired Luno, a retail-focused cryptocurrency exchange with over 5 million customers spanning over 40 countries. Luno will continue to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, the companies said. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed in an announcement Wednesday, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. The deal marks another shift in strategy for DCG (which also wholly owns CoinDesk) as it makes a full acquisition of a solidly retail-focused business. “We have invested in many retail businesses all over the world – including nearly two dozen exchanges,” said Mark Murphy, DCG’s chief operating officer. “But this is the first subsidiary that is a wallet and an exchange, which of course have large numbers of retail investors.”      Exit scam? Two blockchain security firms have warned the creators of a DeFi contract on the EOS network – Emerald Mine (EMD) – may have stolen investors’ funds in an exit scam, CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports. China-based auditing firm SlowMist and security startup PeckShield announced the liquidity mining project has begun moving users’ tokens totaling $2.5 million worth of USDT, EOS and other cryptos that were supposedly locked in smart contract to an address labeled “sji111111111” and exchange platforms. The protocol’s contract lacked a multi-signature (multisig) feature. One exchange, Changenow, said it halted the sale of EOS it believes came from the alleged scam, and urged victims to contact their local police for assistance.      Exchange denied Venezuelan officials have blocked access to Coinbase and fiat remittance platform MercaDolar, according to digital rights advocacy group Venezuela Inteligente. The advocacy group said the move, discovered late Tuesday evening, has no clear outcome or objective but that internet service providers (ISPs) have been part of the move to block access, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. ""Crypto exchanges have been blocked in the past,"" said director of Venezuela Inteligente Andres E. Azpurua in reference to ISPs blocking via a DNS block. ""Until recently all of them were lifted.""      Chain resilience? Despite three “51% attacks” in a month, Ethereum Classic’s price has demonstrated strong resilience. Though down a bit for the past month, its persistence may indicate that security is not a top priority for investors rushing to join a bull run in the crypto market, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports. ETC is no stranger to attacks, having suffered one in early 2019, a sign traders could be less concerned about long-lasting security vulnerabilities than a quick profit. Or, as a forked crypto where a large number of addresses have been inactive, some ETC holders may not see the value of selling or even claiming their ETC. James Wo, founder of ETC Labs, told CoinDesk his team has expanded the network’s core development team and partnered with Chainlink, Swarm and Bloq over the past year to improve security.

In the latest push and pull between token holders, investors and projects, hedge fund manager Arca is attempting to overhaul one of the earliest DeFi protocols Gnosis.      After backing the prediction market’s 2017 $12.5 million ICO, Arca is claiming the Gnosis platform has failed to live up to its promises and deviated from its original mission. The Block originally reported this story.      Now Arca is asking Gnosis to return value to investors and token holders. Over the summer, the hedge fund discreetly asked Gnosis to make a tender offer for all circulating GNO tokens, giving investors the opportunity to cash out and offer a stock split opportunity for those who stick around.      In a blog post published Tuesday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman reiterated Arca's prior suggestions that the project institute revenue-generating and cost-cutting initiatives. The project, he said, should aim to become “free cash flow positive,” rather than reliant on treasury assets contributed by GNO token holders.      The quasi-buyback program would provide an out for investors while also leaving the project enough runway. (Gnosis has $55 million worth of ETH and $10 million of cash as reserves.)      Dorman wrote that Arca often works with management teams throughout the lifecycle of an investment to achieve the goals of the community, which he described as a typically productive and mutually beneficial process. This was not the case with Gnosis, however.      Gnosis, which instituted one of the first decentralized exchanges, is one among many prediction markets struggling to gain a foothold.      Stepping back, the situation points to a rare example of activist investing strategies in crypto. A practice common to traditional markets, activist investing sees large investors buy large shares in companies and acquire board seats to suggest operational changes and agitate for management, in an effort to increase value for shareholders.      Activist investing, popularized by the “corporate raiders” of the 1980s, ballooned from a $12 billion industry in 2003 to having $112 billion assets under management by 2014.      DigixDAO, an early initial coin offering (ICO) which faced a situation where its treasury was more than its market cap, faced similar activist investor behavior when it offered a question to the community - dissolve the treasury or continue making grants?    Market intel    Correlations Bitcoin is now more closely tied to safe haven gold than ever, possibly bringing the cryptocurrency greater resilience to risk aversion in the traditional markets, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The 60-day correlation between the two assets is hovering at record highs, beginning this correlation in July, when the U.S. dollar began a sell-off. While others refute the “store of value” narrative due to bitcoin’s closer correlation with traditional risky assets, the cryptocurrency has defended its $10,000 support for the fifth straight day on Monday, despite losses on Wall Street.      CoinDesk 20 Orchid (OXT), issued by Orchid Labs Inc., developer of virtual private network (VPN) software designed to be decentralized and open source, has replaced the basic attention token (BAT) issued by Brave Software Inc., developer of the Brave browser, on the CoinDesk 20 list. Orchid’s price pumped last month, benefiting from attention from David Portnoy, a publisher and media personality, though it started its ascent prior reflecting anticipation of Orchid’s mobile and desktop apps, released in July. The CoinDesk 20 is a list of the digital assets that matter most to the market using a detailed methodology.    Op-ed    Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul CoinDesk columnist and author of “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” Frances Coppola thinks banks are too lugubrious to survive, but crypto has also lost its way. “But in becoming a high-risk, high-yield playground for dollar investors, the cryptocurrency world sold its soul. The early adopters of Bitcoin believed it would replace the financial system that had crashed and burned so badly,” she writes.      Bitcoin, Mescaline and Parallel Worlds Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist and director of Emfarsis, explores the phenomenon of how people get curious, then interested then obsessed with the world of cryptocurrencies – comparing it to the “down the rabbit hole” experiences of psychedelics or philosophy. “The concept of money might be the greatest illusory trick of all time. Over history, all sorts of things from paper notes to gold bars, seashells to giant rocks, and indeed, lines of code, have superseded relative obscurity to be worshipped as money. A mythical system of value is only “real” because we believe it is,” she writes.

42384653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuqT,1599666720,SushiSwap Will Withdraw Up to $830M From Uniswap Today: Why It Matters for DeFi,"Uniswap fork SushiSwap has begun migrating $830 million of crypto assets to a new community-owned automated market maker (AMM). The process began at approximately 14:15 UTC, when testing the migration first began.      The event is perhaps the largest test to date of a growing mood in DeFi: that all major projects should be community-owned. As of now, Uniswap is a standout market leader without a governance token, the type of coin that makes decentralized decision-making possible.      Stepping back, some liquidity providers to Uniswap's AMM system have given control of their crypto to the rival AMM for the purpose of migrating assets to SushiSwap (and earning SUSHI tokens for doing so). The first pool to make the trek will be CRV/ETH (CRV is the governance token for stablecoin exchange Curve).      The move is earlier than expected because the originally stated migration for SushiSwap was supposed to be this Friday. Last week, however, the community voted to move up the migration by five days, to Sunday, Sept. 6.      But then the anonymous leader of SushiSwap exited with his ETH stake, leading to drama in the community. The newly enriched SushiSwap creator turned over control of the project to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of both the synthetic exchange FTX and quant trading firm Alameda Research.      Bankman-Fried then cancelled the migration, moving it to today.      Read more: Fishy Business: What Happened to $1.2B DeFi Protocol SushiSwap Over the Weekend      Bankman-Fried tweeted out some migration details on Wednesday morning. The timeline is not completely set in stone because the project's new leadership plans to run tests as they go.      The decision to run tests appears to be in response to comments in the SushiSwap message board on Tuesday urging caution.      According to Bankman-Fried, there have been testnet runs and there will be final tests after the smart contract unlocks the migration process. Then the pools will migrate one by one.      While it's not clear just how long it will take, Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk on Twitter that he and his colleagues will likely move each pool fairly close together.      The SUSHI token is trading today at roughly $3.00, well off from its all-time high of $11.93 on Sept. 1, according to CoinMarketCap.    AMM wars    To be clear, SushiSwap is taking liquidity currently held by Uniswap. This is possible because liquidity on Uniswap is redeemed using liquidity provider (LP) tokens that account for the depositors' share of the pool (the value of the share grows as people use it and pay 0.3% fees on each trade).      Users have turned their LP tokens over to SushiSwap. The smart contract will then redeem all its pools on Uniswap, migrate the actual underlying crypto assets to SushiSwap and then replace users Uniswap LP tokens with SushiSwap LP tokens.      According to DeFi Pulse, there is currently $1.47 billion worth of crypto assets staked to Uniswap, but a community-built data portal to SushiSwap claims that 55% of those assets are staked to switch over to SushiSwap today.      Further, Bankman-Fried has promised to distribute 2 million SUSHI tokens to SushiSwap backers who stick around through the migration.      There are 18 pools of token pairs on SushiSwap, though Bankman-Fried tweeted that the BASED/sUSD pool would not be migrating. By and large, pools are an ERC-20 token paired with ETH, making it easy to swap between any two tokens (with ETH as the bridge).      Pools include SUSHI/ETH, ETH/USDT, REN/ETH, YFI/ETH, LEND/ETH and many others.    DeFi context    Both SushiSwap and Uniswap are AMMs, or robots on Ethereum who always have a ""buy"" price and a ""sell"" price for any two Ethereum-based tokens for which they have liquidity.      For Uniswap, that's just about all of them; for SushiSwap, it's a limited set, but liquidity providers accrue a stake in the platform the longer they provide funds.      SushiSwap is a part of a new crop of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects that belong in the world of Weird DeFi, new forms of companies that are meme-driven and whose goals are an emergent property of their community.      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment      Inspired by the distribution of Yearn.Finance's YFI governance token, Weird DeFi favors projects that do so-called ""fair distributions."" Fair distribution means there are no tokens set aside for the project's founders and investors.      The SushiSwap community made an exception for the creators of SushiSwap, however. The pseudonymous creators who forked Uniswap's open-source code made off with an estimated $13 million in ETH after unloading their SUSHI this weekend.      The founders were good enough to turn over control over what they built to others, however.    Election 2020    An election is taking place for the nine members of a multisig wallet that will be able to make changes to SushiSwap's code. Community member Zippo made a dashboard to follow the vote. Nine people will be chosen and any six can make changes.      In the leadup to Wednesday's migration, there had been an active if modest campaign within the Sushi Discord server. Candidates for the multisig discussed their qualifications and affirmed their devotion to abiding by the community's will, reflecting a growing interest in the emerging narrative around ""protocol politicians.""      The vote closed just before 14:10 UTC on Wednesday as the migration testing started.      Top vote-getters included Bankman-Fried, Compound founder Robert Leshner, 0xMaki (a SushiSwap co-founder who was not allocated tokens) and The Block's Larry Cermak.      Cermak did not reply to a request for comment from CoinDesk last night about whether he would accept the position, which could pose conflict-of-interest issues relating to his work as the news publication's director of research. He previously told CoinDesk he had no direct involvement in SushiSwap.      According to the nomination channel in the SushiSwap Discord server, it appears as though anyone could be nominated, even without the nominee's approval.      While SUSHI is ostensibly the governance token, votes on the multisig – which amounts to a project's board of directors – were only open to those who had staked their SUSHI in the SUSHI/ETH pool.    Who wins?    Uniswap had less than $300 million in liquidity before SushiSwap's liquidity mining scheme gave Ethereum users a reason to dump well over $1 billion more of crypto assets into the market leading AMM.      Uniswap worked well at $300 million assets and could easily come out the other side of this process with roughly the same amount or even more.      The open question following the migration will be whether or not Uniswap has really lost anything if the migration ends with roughly the same amount of liquidity, or if the greater depth on SushiSwap actually makes it more attractive for users who want to make a swap.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SUSHI,ETH | MINING | SUSHI | TRADING | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/09/sushiswap-will-withdraw-up-to-830m-from-uniswap-today-why-it-matters-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c19167909103b147ded8d13fd0a17072aa228d3b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384656,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuuF,1599660730,Judge Dismisses $200M Damages Claim in AT&T Crypto Hack Lawsuit,"A California judge has thrown out a $200 million damages claim against mobile operator AT&T from crypto investor Michael Terpin over a SIM-swap hack, but has allowed the rest of the case to proceed.    Judge Otis Wright II of California's central district court granted AT&T's motion, originally filed in April, to dismiss claims of concealment and misrepresentation, as well as requests for punitive damages.  Terpin has said the hack robbed him of cryptocurrency holdings worth around $24 million at the time and argued the telco giant is in part responsible.  In a filing Tuesday, AT&T's lawyers said Terpin's claim of deceit by concealment falls down as the mobile operator's privacy policy doesn't guarantee total protection from third-party breaches, so no attempt was therefore made to conceal or only partially represent the security protocol's limits.  Terpin alleges an AT&T employee only assured him two-factor authentication (2FA) would keep his information private so the company could keep him as a customer, and that the firm had no actual intention of ensuring his information was secured.  But, agreeing with the defendant's argument that ""overly optimistic"" promises are markedly different from false promises, the judge ruled that Terpin didn't show how AT&T intentionally misrepresented him over the protection offered by 2FA.  The court also threw out allegations that AT&T employees knew about, but disregarded, the security inadequacies associated with the 2FA protocol.  As Terpin's $200 million damages suit rested on the allegations AT&T committed fraud and that employees displayed negligent conduct, the judge has dismissed the existing claim.  He did, though, give Terpin leave to file for punitive damages on separate claims.  Terpin first sued AT&T in August 2018, claiming the company failed to adequately protect his cellphone from possible hack as it had allegedly promised.  The court previously denied AT&T's motion to dismiss the entire case, ruling Terpin had showed how hackers may have used his phone's 2FA to access his crypto wallets, something he had relied on his phone provider to help protect.  The case continues on the remaining allegations that AT&T breached its contract and that employees made an unauthorized disclosure of private information to hackers.  Terpin is still suing AT&T for $23.8 million in compensation, the dollar-value of the cryptocurrencies stolen in 2018.

The product, launched Sept. 7, is the exchange’s latest bid to beat its competitors as it boosts its assets under management.      Huobi’s addition targets retail traders less interested or involved in day-to-day trading activities but still willing to receive a certain amount of returns from their digital assets, said Ciara Sun, the vice president of Huobi Global Markets, during an exclusive interview with CoinDesk on Sept. 8.      “Huobi has millions of users but a large percentage of that is not frequent traders,” Sun said. “By offering this saving product in addition to trading, (users) can get stable and flexible income as an alternative use of their crypto assets.”      The service does more for Huobi than meet customers’ needs. It also benefits Huobi’s position as one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, Sun said. Assets under management have always been one of the key on-chain metrics to grade a crypto exchange’s performance, while other metrics such as trading volumes can be easily manipulated or miscalculated, according to Sun.      Huobi’s crypto saving product comes amid a global recession and while the crypto world is fascinated by decentralized finance (DeFI).      Read more: What Is Yearn Finance? The DeFi Gateway Everyone Is Talking About      Huobi’s crypto saving products provide a more attractive interest rates than any traditional banking services while carrying fewer risks compared with the DeFi products, according to Sun.      Users of Huobi’s crypto savings products receive an annual yield at 8% and 3.5%, respectively, for their deposited USDT and bitcoin, according to the news release. To lure new users, the exchange is giving a specialized account rate of an annualized return of 88% for the first week. Huobi will also distribute 30,000 USDT as a way to bring in users to the product.      “Choosing those different DeFi products out there is very hard for a new crypto user, so it’s a high entry barrier for those customers,” Sun said. “But as there is this DeFi craze happening in the space and people are looking at it and they may be interested and they want to participate in crypto because they see those high returns.”      The initial phrase of the new crypto saving product sets a limit of deposit of 3,000 tether or the equivalent value in bitcoin and Huobi’s security team has added a security and risk control system to protect the users’ funds, Sun said.

Mastercard announced Wednesday it had launched a virtual testing environment that can simulate issuance, distribution and exchange of CBDCs between banks and financial service providers, as well as end-consumers purchasing everyday goods and services.  In a statement, Mastercard said the new protocol would help financial institutions understand the feasibility of CBDCs and allow them to explore new use cases, including issuance at a local or regional level.  They can further evaluate compatibilities with existing payment rails such as payment cards.  A facility to analyze and compare different proposed tech stacks for CBDCs is also included.  Talking to Forbes, Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive VP, said his firm is already working with some central banks and that other entities, such as banks or tech firms, are being invited to use the platform.  Mastercard was one of the founding members of Facebook's Libra Association – an initiative now considered a catalyst for getting central banks to look at digital currencies seriously.  Along with rival Visa, Mastercard left Libra in October after mounting concerns over compliance and the business model.  Visa, which already offers payment cards for Coinbase, said in July it would do more to support digital currencies and blockchains popular with their clients.

42384650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkupD,1599656400,'High' Severity Bug in Bitcoin Software Revealed 2 Years After Fix,"A previously undisclosed vulnerability in the Bitcoin Core software could have allowed attackers to steal funds, delay settlements or split the largest blockchain network into conflicting versions had it not been quietly patched two years ago.      That’s according to a paper published Wednesday by Braydon Fuller, a protocol engineer at crypto shopping site Purse, who caught the denial-of-service vulnerability in June 2018, and Javed Khan, a core developer of the Handshake protocol.      The vulnerability was given a severity level of 7.8 on a scale of 1 to 10, which is deemed ""high"" (9 or above is considered ""critical""). It was caused by “remote nodes” failing to clear invalid transactions from their memory, Khan told CoinDesk.      The inability to clear those transactions could lead to an aggressor flooding a victim node with stale data in what is referred to as “uncontrolled resource consumption,” eventually causing the node to shut down, the paper states.      Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as the Lightning Network, the experimental payment system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, were at risk due to the vulnerability. Bitcoin full nodes were not at risk of losing funds.      Read more: Latest Bitcoin Core Code Release Protects Against Nation-State Attacks      “There was no mechanism to make sure that the pending details of a transaction are valid or not. In certain cases you could fill up the remote memory with invalid transactions,” Khan said.      No attempt to take advantage of the hole was found in the wild, Khan and Fuller wrote. The vulnerability could not be disclosed publicly for over two years as node operators took longer than expected to update, Fuller said.      While the vulnerability was fixed, its disclosure highlights the difficulties of building a global money standard on programming languages created by humans, not to mention the high technical barriers to engaging in development of the top cryptocurrency.      The vulnerability was introduced to Bitcoin Core in November 2017. Some 50% of Bitcoin nodes at the time were exposed to the attack vector, according to the paper. Earlier versions of Bitcoin Core were not affected.    Bitcoin Core and more    Khan said the vulnerability could have enabled an attacker to steal funds from nodes that had open channels on Lightning.      Bitcoin Core versions 0.16.0 and 0.16.1 were affected and patched by developer Matt Corallo following Fuller's disclosure to the core team in July 2018. Corallo did not answer questions seeking comment by press time.      The discovery by Fuller (who has also worked as lead developer at decentralized cloud storage protocol Storj) was followed by another Bitcoin bug addressed two months later in Bitcoin Core 0.16.3. Also a vector for a denial-of-service attack, one aspect of that bug allowed miners to “inflate the supply of bitcoin” as they could double-spend certain values, the Bitcoin Core team wrote at the time.      The emergency patch issued in that Bitcoin Core version addressed Fuller’s bug as well, Khan and Fuller wrote.      A spot was reserved for the resource consumption vulnerability on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) registry as CVE-2018-17145 in 2018, but it has yet to be filled out. The registry acts as a public glossary for software bugs of note.      Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation, or standard version of the network software from which others are derived. According to the paper, the exploit was also possible on several other implementations of Bitcoin and its offshoots:    Bitcoin Knots v0.16.0  All beta versions of Bcoin up to v1.0.0-pre  All versions of Btcd up to v0.20.1-beta  Litecoin Core v0.16.0  Namecoin Core v0.16.1  All versions of Dcrd up to v1.5.1.    All of these implementations have been patched.

According to a press statement emailed to CoinDesk, the “audio-reactive” collectibles combine 3LAU’s music with moving graphics from artist Mike Parsella.  Blockparty said 3LAU has also come on board as the firm’s director of music and will help oversee development of such digital collectibles.  “I am advising Blockparty on how we bring other musicians on board,” said 3LAU, who was involved in the first music concert to feature ticketing powered by the Ethereum blockchain back in 2018.  Along with ticketing for events via Ethereum, Blockparty recently launched its own non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  “The business was very difficult to scale and so we decided to spread our approach to all NFTs instead of specifically ticketing,” said Vladislav Ginzburg, CEO of Blockparty.  Larger ticketing companies with exclusive access to events also presented a hurdle for Blockparty.  The firm said that while live concerts are currently on hiatus during the coronavirus pandemic, once they do return, users who own 3LAU’s collectibles will enjoy additional perks such as giveaways and access at events.

42384663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkv1n,1599655761,First Mover: Bitcoin Acts Like a Tech Stock and Ethereum Classic Traders Shrug Off 51% Attacks,"You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team and edited by Bradley Keoun, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to.    Price Point    Bitcoin was up in crypto markets early Wednesday, bouncing after a 2.4% drop that appeared synced with a sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. Traditional markets also appeared to be pausing the recent retreat from risky assets.      The move down in digital assets has provided a ""healthy reset after a fast and furious summer rally,"" the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Arca said Wednesday in a blog post. Bitcoin prices are still up about 42% year to date.      ""This market still isn't mature enough to absorb an increase of selling pressure from the market's biggest investors,"" Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman wrote.    Market Moves    Bitcoin is suffering its worst two-week stretch since March, down 15% since the end of August, and anxious investors are once again scrambling to identify the 11-year-old cryptocurrency's closest analog in traditional markets.      Is it a hedge against currency debasement, similar to gold? A disruptor of banks and the financial industry? A revolutionary innovation that should trade in line with tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google or even Tesla?      As the Federal Reserve pumped about $3 trillion of freshly created money into the global financial system this year in an effort to calm uneasy markets, the currency-debasement investment thesis garnered the most attention. Bitcoin outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index while trading broadly in line with the high-flying stocks.      But as tech stocks have tumbled over the past week, hit by concerns over frothy valuations and the revelation that the market might be buoyed by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank's options buying, bitcoin sold off too.      ""If you get a smash in markets then bitcoin's not going to escape it,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer of the digital-asset-focused investment firm ByteTree, said in a WhatsApp audio interview. ""We've seen that time and time again, so why expect that to change?""      Longer term, bitcoin is likely to return to its outperformance, Morris predicts.      The high-flying tech-stock valuations ""make no sense to anyone who's a rational investor,"" said Morris, who spent nearly two decades as a money manager for the giant British bank HSBC. ""Bitcoin's still small and has huge upside from here.""    Crypto investors have ignored three straight 51% attacks on Ethereum Classic    For a blockchain network’s security, a “51% attack” is pretty much as bad as it gets. That’s when a single entity gains control of a majority of the network’s computing power, allowing it to siphon off extra units of the currency in what’s known as a double-spend.      So it would stand to reason that three successful 51% attacks in a month against the Ethereum Classic blockchain might dent investors’ confidence.      But as reported Tuesday by CoinDesk's Muyao Shen, prices for the project’s native ETC token haven’t really taken a hit – a sign traders could be less concerned about security vulnerabilities than a quick profit in fast-moving cryptocurrency markets.      ETC has fallen about 27% in the past 30 days, not a terrible performance given that bitcoin is off by 15%.      For large networks like Bitcoin, a 51% attack is prohibitively expensive to do given the enormous amount of computational power — and electricity — required to pull it off. Ethereum Classic is much smaller, making it far more vulnerable.  “Many people are just sort of sitting on it,” Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at the digital-asset money manager CoinShares, told CoinDesk in a phone interview.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's 60-day correlation with gold has risen to record highs above 0.5. With fortunes more tied to the yellow metal than ever, the cryptocurrency may now show greater resilience to risk aversion in stock markets.    The leading cryptocurrency defended the $10,000 support for the fifth straight day on Tuesday even as Wall Street suffered losses.  The persistent defense of key support, coupled with record miner confidence, as suggested by the hashrate and signs of dip demand suggests scope for recovery rally.

42384657,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuvV,1599651663,"Bitcoin, Mescaline and Parallel Worlds","Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      Have you ever asked a fellow Bitcoiner about the time he or she tumbled down the rabbit hole? If so, you’ll know the trademark twinkle-in-the-eye when the person recounts the precise moment of departure from everyday reality.      It is a special ceremony we repeat over and over, reliving the rite of passage that earned us membership to this secret society. Originally coined by Lewis E. Carroll, author of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the idiom implies that blockchainers have entered an alternate universe where they see, hear and experience things that outsiders do not.      The concept of money might be the greatest illusory trick of all time. Over history, all sorts of things from paper notes to gold bars, seashells to giant rocks and, indeed, lines of code, have superseded relative obscurity to be worshipped as money. A mythical system of value is only “real” because we believe it is.      Other examples of this phenomena include organized religion and the government. Even language. Just look at the collection of shapes on your screen right now. You and I have agreed to interpret these as meaning-laden symbols more or less the same way. But for anyone who is unfamiliar with the English language, my secret message remains mute, hidden behind code.    The concept of money might be the greatest illusory trick of all time.    As humans, our personal experiences are inherently individual and non-transferable. To help us make sense of everyday reality, and to relate to others, we buy into shared belief systems – mass delusions, if you will – that have the power to unite people under a common understanding of the world.      In ""Bitcoin Is Magic,"" Fortune journalist David Z. Morris presents a compelling argument for these social abstractions being real-world examples of magic. When viewed objectively and scientifically through a non-supernatural lens, magic is a technique for altering collective human consciousness through the repetitive use of symbols, rites and rituals. From monetary systems and language, to conspiracy theories and magical internet money, Morris demonstrates how these shared belief systems are “real” for those who participate in them.      He points to the Bitcoin code as a symbolic ritual chanted simultaneously by computers all over the world. Through devotion to the practice, an otherwise amorphous string of characters is turned into a global communal movement with far-reaching economic and political implications.    Memes and magic    To meditate on this a little further, may I suggest that Bitcoin really does sound like something out of the occult when reduced to its celestial symbols: a sacred script (the Bitcoin white paper) written by a pseudonymous idol (Satoshi Nakamoto) who has never proven to materialize beyond an early series of divine messages to the first disciples.      The movement has since grown throughout the social sphere, galvanizing digital worlds that boil and bubble with esoteric debate. The core philosophies of crypto culture proliferate through internet memes, that enable complex ideas (and inside jokes) to spread quickly from person to person. Take this year’s Money Printer Go Brrr, a criticism of monetary policy gone wild that went viral throughout Crypto Twitter. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s missionaries preach their vision for a world that isn’t controlled by banks or governments, seeking to convert drifters to the new thinking.      Morris wrote ""Bitcoin Is Magic"" in 2019, but it reads like the spawn of 2020, given the totally surreal nature of the world right now. With the threat of a highly contagious virus sweeping the planet, most people have been holed up in their homes for months. And isolation does weird things to the mind. People suffering chronic loneliness or left in solitary confinement have been known to develop mental health issues and psychological disturbances, including losing their sense of time and experiencing hallucinations.      The world as we knew may be gone, not likely to return. But a detour from our standard-issue version of reality might just be the catalyst needed to open doors to amazing new dimensions. Morris’ musings reminded me of another great writer, Aldous Huxley, author of the 1932 dystopian novel ""Brave New World"" and who spent much of his life and career questioning his relationship with reality and experimenting with the notion of consciousness – perhaps most infamously via his self-administered research into the effects of mescaline, a synthetic form of the hallucinogenic drug derived from the desert cactus, peyote.      In a 1958 television interview with Mike Wallace, Huxley said the antidote to a mindless existence is education and decentralization. That way, people may learn to analyze and question the doctrine that is fed to them, and fight feelings of impotence within the system by breaking up clusters of authority and control. He urged us to reject group morality, insist on individual values and protect our freedom through self-governing democracy.      Wouldn’t you say this sounds like an avid Bitcoiner evangelizing for freedom, privacy and agency of the individual?      See also: David Z. Morris - The Year in Crypto Journalism: Truth Will Always Be Human      As for the education component, we all know that Bitcoin requires some schooling. As much as the rabbit hole metaphor would like to suggest that getting into blockchain is as easy as being sucked into an open vortex against your will, there is actually a lot of effort involved. And much for noobs to learn (and lose). Thus users must consistently educate themselves if they wish to thrive in the world of crypto.      I think Morris articulates it best:    Blockchain is certainly not the total solution to our feelings of alienation from reality, or even the most important one. But it is at least a model, not just of internet-native currency, but of a base later of digital reality. It is durable. It demands commitment and shared value from participants. It extracts costs for making mistakes. These are features that blockchain shares with everyday reality.    Had he been alive to read it, I think Huxley would have enjoyed ""Bitcoin Is Magic"" as much as I did.

42384658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuwl,1599651610,Bitcoin's Correlation With Gold Hits Record High,"Bitcoin is now more closely tied to safe haven gold than ever, possibly bringing the cryptocurrency greater resilience to risk aversion in the traditional markets.    The 60-day correlation between the two assets is hovering at record highs above 0.5, according to Coin Metrics data.  The positive correlation has strengthened sharply since the beginning of July, as the U.S. dollar started taking a beating against other major currencies.  The sell-off in the greenback, the global reserve currency, is seen as boding well for scarce assets like bitcoin and gold.  The strengthening of the positive correlation appears to validate the popular narrative that bitcoin is a store of value and a haven asset. Some investors believe it is sound money, like gold.  As such, the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to movements in risk assets, mainly equities, could lessen.  Bitcoin defended the $10,000 support for the fifth straight day on Monday, despite losses on Wall Street.  The repeated defense of the critical support, coupled with several bullish developments in on-chain metrics, suggests scope for a recovery rally.  Bitcoin's hashrate, or computing power, has risen to fresh record highs near 150 exahashes per second, according to Glassnode.  That suggests miners remain unfazed by bitcoin's recent decline from $12,400 to $10,000.  Further, the percentage of bitcoin unmoved in over three years has hit a two-year high of 30.91%, according to data source Glassnode.

Luno will continue to operate as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, the companies said. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed in an announcement Wednesday.      The deal marks another shift in strategy for DCG (which also wholly owns CoinDesk) as it makes a full acquisition of a solidly retail-focused business.      “We have invested in many retail businesses all over the world – including nearly two dozen exchanges,” said Mark Murphy, DCG's chief operating officer. “But this is the first subsidiary that is a wallet and an exchange, which of course have large numbers of retail investors.”      DCG, which recently launched a new crypto mining division called Foundry, has been quite focused on institutional crypto businesses such as Genesis and the brisk cryptocurrency lending market.      Read more: DCG to Invest $100M in Bitcoin Mining Venture      Going forward, Murphy said DCG isn’t actively looking to make more acquisitions at the parent company level. “But Luno intends to expand globally both organically and through acquisitions,"" he said. ""We view this deal as a potential first step towards a ‘roll up’ strategy under Luno.”    Luno's reach    Launched in 2013, Luno was initially based in Singapore before moving headquarters to London a couple of years later. The firm has a team of close to 400, and is a leading exchange on the African continent and a major player in Southeast Asia.      The exchange, which has raised some $13.8 million in funding to date, first received investment from DCG back in 2014, and its relationship with DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert dates back even earlier.      “We've known DCG for seven years,” said Luno co-founder and CEO Marcus Swanepoel. “I can remember when we were five people in a room, and being on a call with Barry talking about the future of crypto and where the industry is going to go. So for seven years, we've been working together and having those conversations.”      Swanepoel said Luno is already in a strong financial position, and that there have been “multiple people over the years trying to acquire the company.”      See also: This Bitcoin Documentary From Africa Is Streaming on Amazon Prime      DCG’s conglomerate status in the crypto industry was an attractive feature for Luno, he added, as well as how a retail business can play a part within that.      “I think after the announcement of Foundry two weeks ago, DCG is now touching every single type of thing, every single type of market,” Swanepoel said. “But two missing pieces were having a strong presence in frontier markets or emerging markets, and they didn’t have a retail business.

42384662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkuzH,1599644903,Security Firms Warn of Potential DeFi Exit Scam After $2.5M in 'Locked' Cryptos Moved,"Two blockchain security firms have warned that the creators of a decentralized finance (DeFi) contract on the EOS network may have fled in what appears to be an exit scam.      China-based auditing firm SlowMist said on Wednesday that a liquidity mining DeFi project on EOS called Emerald Mine (EMD) has moved user tokens that were supposedly locked in smart contract to an account labeled ""sji111111111"" since early Wednesday China time.      SlowMist warned users not to send additional funds to the smart contract for liquidity mining because some of the funds have already been transferred to exchange platforms.      PeckShield, another China-based blockchain security startup, published a similar notice on WeChat soon after, saying the funds on the move include users' locked-up assets, which include some 787,000 USDT, 490,000 EOS and others – worth nearly $2.5 million in total.      After the publication of this article, crypto exchange Changenow reached out to CoinDesk and said it managed to stop the sale of 135,020 EOS from the alleged scam and has stored the funds in its cold storage.      “Anyone who has suffered from the exit scam can turn to their local police, and if they contact us our compliance team will check the legitimacy of the request and then a return procedure will be executed,” the firm said.      Both SlowMist and PeckShield said users participating in DeFi liquidity mining should be aware of EOS contracts that have no multi-signature (multisig) feature, meaning whoever is behind the contract can move assets even if they are supposed to be locked up.      Read more: Fishy Business: What Happened to $1.2B DeFi Protocol SushiSwap Over the Weekend      The EMD project's website has since become inaccessible.      PeckShield said USDT tokens that are part of the apparently absconded funds are being sold via decentralized exchanges like DeFibox.      It's not yet clear who's behind the project, but the event has sparked users to send small transactions to the sji111111111 account on Wednesday with angry messages demanding the alleged scammer return their funds.      So-called liquidity mining has drawn wide interest over recent weeks, with some of the Ethereum-based tokens in such projects seeing heavy speculation on both decentralized and centralized exchanges.

42432627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0R7h,1599639247,Court Denies Bitmain $30M in Damages From Co-Founders of Rival Poolin,"A court in China has denied an appeal by bitcoin mining giant Bitmain seeking $30 million in damages from the three co-founders of Poolin, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining pools.      The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court issued a ruling on the appeal on Aug. 31 and made it public on Sept. 8. The court’s final decision marks the closure of the year-long lawsuit that could have significantly harmed the operations of the rising rival to Bitmain’s pool business.      The court did agree with Beijing-based Bitmain's appeal to increase fines for the Poolin co-founders for violating non-compete agreements they'd made with their former employer, Bitmain's mining pool BTC.com.      As such, Pan Zhibiao, Li Tianzhao and Zhu Fa are required by the court to pay fines of about $200,000, $178,000 and $154,000, respectively.      But the court denied Bitmain's more notable $10 million claims for damages from each of the three, which in Bitmain’s argument, would make up for its losses arising from Poolin’s violation of the non-compete agreements.      The $30 million, which could have made a more material impact on Poolin's business, is an increase from an initial $4.3 million total claim made by Bitmain in April 2019.      In April, the lower-level Beijing Haidian District Court made an initial judgement that the three did violate the agreements by starting Poolin's bitcoin mining pool during the 24-month non-compete period from August 2017.      The lower-level court required Pan, Li and Zhu to pay smaller fines to Bitmain over the violation, but denied Bitmain's $4.3 million damages claim at the time.      The mining giant subsequently filed an appeal seeking larger fines and a hike in the total claim for damages to 210 million yuan, or $30 million, from the three.      Bitmain's lawyers argued in a hearing in August that Poolin made some $30 million in revenue from its bitcoin mining pool fees during the non-compete period.      Given Bitmain's pools accounted for about 30% of the market share during the period, Bitmain claimed an amount proportionate to that revenue should be handed over from the three co-founders.      Read more: Bitmain Lawsuit Seeks Millions from Staffers Who Founded Rival Mining Pool      Poolin's lawyers argued in response that the case brought to trial at a time when the market shares of Bitmain's mining equipment and mining pool operations had both declined.      Therefore, the lawyers said, even if Poolin didn't exist, the revenue may not necessarily go to Bitmain's two pools, BTC.com and Antpool, proportionate to their market share since there are plenty of other players in the field.      The intermediary court said in the latest ruling that Bitmain had failed to provide sufficient evidence that its business losses due to the breaches were higher than the fines and, as such, denied the $30 million claim for damages.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/09/court-denies-bitmain-30m-in-damages-from-co-founders-of-rival-poolin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26398678c1ea1a26f7be303f52883ab0ab9552e6-1500x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432616,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0Qhh,1599618702,Venezuela Blocks Access to Coinbase and Remittance Service MercaDolar,"A digital rights advocacy group in Venezuela said its government has blocked user access to two currency exchange platforms.    According to Venezuela Inteligente, President Nicolas Maduro's government is denying its citizens from accessing U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase and fiat remittance platform MercaDolar.  Inteligente said the move, discovered late Tuesday evening, has no clear outcome or objective but that internet service providers (ISPs) have been part of the move to block access.  ""Crypto exchanges have been blocked in the past,"" said director of Venezuela Inteligente Andres E. Azpurua in reference to ISPs blocking via a DNS block. ""Until recently all of them were lifted.""  ""Venezuela has a history of blocking exchange platforms,"" Azpurua added. ""Especially those used to exchange local currency for foreign currency.""  Azpurua also said the move to block access to Coinbase ""particularly bothers"" him as there is an abundance of crypto exchanges currently accessible to Venezuelan citizens and it's unclear why the San Francisco-based exchange might be singled out.  On Aug. 28, Venezuelan ISPs blocked access to two major virtual private networks – Tunnelbear and Psiphon – services that can circumvent DNS blocks, but appeared to have a minor impact on their functionality.  Political tensions are beginning to boil over as the country's opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido announced a “unitary pact.”  The pact, supported by a coalition of parties, is demanding increased international pressure against Maduro ahead of a congressional election in December.  Attempts at capital controls over who receives what type of funding in a politically charged climate could be just one reason among many for the recent ISP blocks, Azpurua noted.

42432621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0Qlh,1599617400,NY AG Asks Court for New Order to Make Bitfinex Turn Over Tether Loan Documents,"UPDATE: New York Judge Joel M. Cohen has scheduled a conference for next Thursday between the New York Attorney General's office and counsel representing Bitfinex and Tether. Parties can file a three-page letter detailing their positions by Sept. 14.      The New York Attorney General's office (NYAG) wants Tether and Bitfinex to immediately turn over documents detailing a $900 million line of credit the first entity extended to the second, according to a new filing with a public court system.      The NYAG's office began a formal inquiry into Bitfinex and Tether in April 2019, when it alleged Bitfinex had lost access to more than $850 million in customer and corporate funds and covered up the shortfall by borrowing from Tether, with which it shares executives and corporate owners. The NYAG won a ruling that ordered the companies to turn over information pertaining to the extension of credit and the firms' relationship. The respondents appealed, but lost the appeal in July.      ""In the time since the [appeals court's] ruling, the parties attempted to resolve this matter, unsuccessfully,"" the filing, dated Sept. 8 (or exactly 61 days from when the appeals court ruled) said.      NYAG's inquiry into Bitfinex and Tether, currently the largest stablecoin issuer, revealed there was a period in which the U.S. dollar-pegged USDT stablecoin was only about 74% backed by reserves. Tether later said its token was fully backed, but didn’t specify what makes up its reserves.      The NYAG's office is now hoping to meet with New York Judge Joel Cohen, who is overseeing the case, and to argue for a new order with a strict 60-day deadline for the crypto companies to turn over the documents.      Read more: New York Attorney General Calls Bitfinex’s Legal Stance ‘Deeply Perverse’ in New Filing      ""At the conference we seek, the OAG [Office of the Attorney General] will request that the Court order the immediate production of documents and information by Respondents as required under the April 24, 2019 Order ... to be completed no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the requested order,"" the filing said. ""The OAG will also request that the Court extend the injunction previously entered in this matter for an additional ninety (90) days.""      The injunction in question prohibits Tether from lending any more funds to Bitfinex.      ""Despite our best efforts, we were not able to reach an agreement. While we continue to be willing to discuss a potential resolution, we will file our response to the proposed next steps in due course. We will continue to pursue a fair and reasonable process,"" Bitfinex and Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner said in a statement sent by a spokesperson.      This follows a July statement where he said, ""We will respect the court's order.""      For its part, Bitfinex has sought subpoenas against various banks to try and recover its missing customer funds, which it held with Crypto Capital, an unlicensed ""shadow bank"" whose operator, Reginald Fowler, was arrested last year and is awaiting trial.      Crypto Capital’s holdings, which apparently included some of Bitfinex’s funds, were seized by U.S., U.K. and Polish authorities, and Bitfinex has yet to recover any of these funds.

BitFlyer conducted a survey of Japanese customers who opened accounts this year between January and July, with 539 responding, CoinDesk Japan reported Tuesday.  The number of new customers in their 20s doubled from a 2018 survey, when just 18% of respondents were part of that age group.
