Traders on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, saw $104 million of losses, the most among exchanges, followed by $79 million of losses on OKX and $45 million on Huobi, per CoinGlass.  Bitcoin (BTC) traders suffered the most losses, some $112 million, while ether (ETH) liquidations surpassed $73 million.  Of the liquidated trading positions in the past 24 hours, some $282 million were longs, betting on higher prices. This is larger than the highest daily long liquidation of this year, recording $254 million on Feb. 8, according to Coinglass.

BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has plummeted more than 6% in the past 24 hours, and earlier in the day reached its lowest level in seven weeks at around $20,050. Popular altcoins dogecoin (DOGE) and tron (TRX) have led the price decline.  Crypto markets enjoyed one their strongest starts year in their 14-year history, recovering some losses from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. BTC rallied above $25,000 in February at one point after starting the year at about $16,600.  The recent decline has come as concerns mounted about the stability of Silvergate Bank, a key banking partner for digital asset companies. After suffering huge losses and dwindling deposits, the bank announced Wednesday evening that it will “voluntarily liquidate” its assets and shut down operations.

42410812,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrt7L,1678404759,What Happens if Ether Is a Security?,"Is ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest by market cap behind bitcoin, an investment security?  The question has been a source of simmering speculation ever since Ethereum switched last year to a proof-of-stake blockchain network where investors can “stake” their coins in exchange for rewards – not too dissimilar from the interest that’s paid out on bonds.  A fresh allegation Thursday from a New York state regulator could push the legal debate back to the front burner.  In a lawsuit filed against Seychelles-based crypto-exchange KuCoin on Thursday, New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James alleged the firm broke the law by selling unregistered securities. Among the unregistered securities listed in the suit was ether.  Ether has long been treated as a commodity by state and federal regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Designating it as a security would have a massive impact on crypto markets, drastically changing how (and whether) the currency and others like it are traded in the U.S.  The case for ether (ETH) as a security  Ethereum apparently drew extra scrutiny from regulators starting in 2022 when it switched from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system for operating its network.  The proof-of-work system, which is still used by Bitcoin, relied on “mining” to secure the blockchain – where computers scattered around the world raced to solve cryptographic puzzles for the right to earn newly issued crypto and write transactions to the chain.  The new system, proof-of-stake, forgoes mining for “staking.” Ether holders can now lock up their crypto with the network in exchange for interest, and as a way to help secure transactions.  “By shifting to proof-of-stake, ETH no longer relies upon competition between computers, but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake ETH,” the suit explained. “The shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and incentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in staking.”  Concentrated influence  The specter of a security designation has long hung over ether, which was originally distributed to early supporters and investors in 2015 as a part of an initial coin offering (ICO).  In her suit against KuCoin, James suggested ether is a security due to its early distribution plan, as well as the fact that its infrastructure is maintained by a relatively small group of contributors.  Although Ethereum's shift to proof-of-stake ""was an amazing accomplishment, from a legal standpoint I think an argument could be made that the very fact that it occurred demonstrates a degree of centralization such that the Ethereum Network is no longer 'sufficiently decentralized,'"" said Grant Gulovsen, an attorney that specializes in the crypto industry.  James’s suit takes particular issue with the influence held by Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, claiming they retain “significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the functionality and price of ETH.”  The suit further adds that Buterin and the “small number of developers” that control the Ethereum blockchain “stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.” Buterin and the developers, the suit posits, “promoted it as an investment that was contingent on the growth of the Ethereum network.”  “Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation also received significant quantities of ETH in the ICO and are believed to retain significant stakes of that ETH today,” the suit claimed.  What happens if ether is a security?  Despite the NYAG’s assertion in its suit that ether may be a security, the decision is far from final.  What’s clear is the reasoning laid out in the lawsuit reveals definitively how at least one regulator – and possibly others, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – are thinking about ether.  The SEC has “worked in tandem with [New York] more than they have with any other state that we know of, at least that I know of,” explained Collins Belton, a California-based crypto attorney and partner at Brookwood PC. “While you can't just say this portends what's going to happen in the U.S. inevitably, I think it's a very strong indicator that these are the types of arguments” that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is “going to be thinking about trying to refine.”  Gensler – who has increasingly cracked down on the crypto industry as of late – has hinted previously that Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake brings it closer in alignment with the agency’s definition of a security.  The SEC defines securities based on the Howey Test, which says a security is “a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”  Proof-of-stake, by this logic, might bring ether closer to a “security” because its interest payouts require little work and rhyme with the Howey Test’s “expectation of profit.”  It is not, however, a foregone conclusion that the SEC will seek to classify ETH as a security. ""From a practical standpoint I still think it is very unlikely that the SEC is going to declare the current offer and sale of ETH to involve unregistered securities transactions,"" said Gulovsen, because ""the impact of doing so would be devastating to a large number of American investors"" and ""the amount of resources necessary to properly enforce that declaration"" would be ""far beyond what the SEC is probably willing"" to allocate.  Impact on industry  Should Ethereum officially be classified as a security by courts, exchanges wishing to list ether will likely need to register as securities broker-dealers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  “If you’re already registered in New York, you now have a question – do you either delist ether and/or block your New York customers from being able to buy ether or do you just simply register as a broker-dealer?” Belton said.  Belton also pointed out that James’ stance comes as a surprise because exchanges operating legally in New York (not including KuCoin, which was not registered as an exchange) offer ether, with the approval of the state’s financial regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  “It's not like New York had no idea that ether was being offered. They knew for years because to get a license and to register in New York, you actually have to have the assets that you plan to offer to New Yorkers green-listed by their financial regulator,” Belton said.  “So it's kind of insane that their attorney general was saying, ‘Oh, by the way, you guys are selling illegal securities, despite the fact that our financial regulator has been letting you operate with impunity for five years,’” he added.  It’s not just centralized exchanges that have something to worry about: Decentralized trading platforms – autonomous pieces of software that live on blockchains – could also face legal troubles if ether is found to be a security.  “Technically the way that the draft reads, if you're offering a platform to people where they can engage in these types of transactions, regardless of whether it's a commodity or a security, New York is saying, ‘Hey, we think you might have to be a broker-dealer – either a securities broker-dealer, or commodities BD,’” Belton said. “If that's right, this thing is much bigger than like, ‘Oh, hey, can the exchanges keep offering ether?’”  There is already a legal precedent for outlawing blockchain-based computer programs, called smart contracts – over the summer, the U.S. government banned the Tornado Cash mixer program for its links to money laundering.  Beyond ether  An ether-as-a-security world would have major ramifications for crypto writ large.  James’s logic for classifying ether as a security – based in part on the network’s switch to proof-of-stake – raises questions about whether other tokens might also be classified as securities.  What the NYAG is saying “can expand way beyond just ether and implicate the rest of the ecosystem,” Belton said.  Outside of proof-of-work Bitcoin, most major blockchains use a stake-based system similar to Ethereum’s, meaning it is possible that regulators could put them in a similar basket. Non-ether tokens that are hosted on the Ethereum blockchain could also be impacted.  The price of ether dropped by around 7% in wake of the NYAG’s announcement of its lawsuit against KuCoin.

A provision in the department’s “Greenbook,” its list of tax proposals and explanations for the U.S. President’s budget proposal, would create a phased-in excise tax based on the costs of the electricity used in crypto mining, imposed on the companies “using computing resources” to mine cryptocurrencies.  These companies would also be required to report how much electricity they use and what type of power was tapped. The tax would be phased in over the next three years, increasing 10% each year.  The provision explicitly makes the case that this type of tax may lower the overall number of mining machines in the U.S.  “The increase in energy consumption attributable to the growth of digital asset mining has negative environmental effects and can have environmental justice implications as well as increase energy prices for those that share an electricity grid with digital asset miners,” according to the document. “Digital asset mining also creates uncertainty and risks to local utilities and communities, as mining activity is highly variable and highly mobile. An excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners could reduce mining activity along with its associated environmental impacts and other harms,” the document added.  The House of Representatives and Senate have to pass a budget that includes these types of revenue-generating tax rules before they can be implemented. The Republican-led House is unlikely to adopt the Democratic President Biden’s proposal as is. Still, the proposal indicates Biden's fiscal priorities as he prepare to announce his bid for a second term as U.S. President.  Crypto tax rule updates  U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled his 2024 budget proposal on Thursday, highlighting a separate provision that would close a so-called wash sale loophole in the tax code. The move would block people from harvesting their tax losses by selling digital assets at a loss, marking that hit when they file their taxes and then immediately buying the same assets again.  The greenbook mentioned this provision, alongside a third crypto-related proposal that would expand the securities loans rules to include digital assets.  “The proposal would amend the securities loan nonrecognition rules to provide that they apply to loans of actively traded digital assets recorded on cryptographically secured distributed ledgers, provided that the loan has terms similar to those currently required for loans of securities,” the document said.  Yet another provision addresses Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act rules. Referencing the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s crypto tax reporting provision, Thursday’s greenbook proposes capturing foreign account-holders in the information reporting rules as part of the government’s ongoing information-sharing efforts on financial brokers.  Similarly, a fifth provision would require people with foreign financial accounts holding at least $50,000 in crypto to report these holdings in their tax reports.  Mark-to-market rules would be amended to include crypto in a sixth provision.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/09/us-treasury-department-proposes-30-excise-tax-on-crypto-mining-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f49401ca049b29fd26c9a19d5a4698b27f83a2a5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

By Wednesday afternoon, the La Jolla, California-based Silvergate Capital Corp. said that it would be “voluntarily liquidating” the bank's assets, in part due to “recent industry and regulatory developments.”  Those recent industry developments can be attributed to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and its corporate sibling Alameda Research, he said.  But the bigger problem for the crypto industry lies on the horizon, according to Bianco. Because traditional banking firms operate under a fiduciary rule, “they have to act according to the fiduciary rule, responsibly.”  Fiduciaries have a primary duty of managing and caring for the property for others, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. website, which adds, ""The Board of Directors and senior management must be able to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks inherent in fiduciary activities, and respond appropriately to changing business conditions.""  Now, thanks to the failure of Silvergate, coupled with the downfall of other crypto players, traditional finance (TradFi) companies could be taking on “a career risk,” should they choose to invest their money in crypto.  “This is the taint that crypto is going to have to face,” Bianco said. The crypto industry is likely to have a difficult time finding traditional banks that will work with it, and that will further stall TradFi's involvement in crypto. “Adoption from the TradFi space got just that much harder in the last 24 hours,” Bianco said.  But he doesn't think crypto isn’t down for the count. “I still think crypto is going to win the day at the end of all of this,” Bianco said.

Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the number 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, is campaigning to stop what he argues is the intent of President Joe Biden’s administration to set up a digital dollar that could be deployed to collect information about citizens’ financial lives.  Emmer – a staunch ally of the crypto industry he said “can be very threatening to unelected bureaucrats” – is pushing legislation that would block the U.S. Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Treasury Department has encouraged work on a digital dollar, and the Fed is still in research mode on the project, officials have said as recently as this week.  “Recent actions from the Biden administration make it clear that they’re not only itching to create a digital dollar, but they’re willing to trade Americans’ right to financial privacy for surveillance-style CBDC,” Emmer told an audience at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.  He argued Thursday that a government token could easily be “weaponized into a surveillance tool,” and the U.S. government could “program a CBDC to choke out politically unpopular activity.”  Read More: Top US Treasury Official Says Leaders ‘Actively Evaluating’ Digital Dollar Question",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/09/senior-us-house-republican-says-cbdcs-could-be-weaponized-as-political-tool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e750e56863c09a585fcee09eeda54bf0e213369-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387954,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQz6AT,1678394421,New York Attorney General Alleges Ether Is a Security in KuCoin Lawsuit,"New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed suit against KuCoin on Thursday, alleging the Seychelles-based crypto exchange is violating securities laws by offering tokens – including ether – that meet the definition of a security without registering with the attorney general’s office.  The suit is the first time a regulator has claimed in court that ether is a security. Though Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has hinted that his agency might consider ether to be a security, the SEC’s sister regulatory agency – the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – has long maintained that both bitcoin and ether are commodity assets.  James’ suit argues that ether is considered a security under the Martin Act – a 102-year-old New York anti-fraud law that gives the Attorney General powers to investigate securities fraud and bring both civil and criminal actions against violators – because the value of ether is dependent on the efforts of others, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  According to the lawsuit, the NYAG’s office believes ETH, the luna (LUNA) token and terraUSD (UST) stablecoin, all traded on the exchange, are securities. The price of ETH was down 8% 30 minutes after the suit was revealed, with the broader crypto market similarly plunging.  In a press release the NYAG’s office said, “The petition argues that ETH, just like LUNA and UST, is a speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of ETH. Because of that, KuCoin was required to register before selling ETH, LUNA, or UST.”  KuCoin did not respond to subpoenas filed by the NYAG’s office served via email and in-person.  James also argued that KuCoin sells unregistered securities via KuCoin Earn, its lending and staking product. The Attorney General’s office was able to create a KuCoin account using a computer with a New York-based IP address to buy and sell digital tokens, for which KuCoin charged a fee. It was also able to deposit tokens into the KuCoin Earn product for a fee.  The action brought by the NYAG’s office is not KuCoin’s first brush with regulators. In 2022, South Korean regulators accused KuCoin of conducting “illegal business activities” without proper registration. The Dutch Central Bank made similar allegations in December, claiming the exchange was operating without a license.  With her lawsuit, Attorney General James is seeking a court order to stop KuCoin from representing itself as an exchange, prevent the company from operating in New York and direct KuCoin to implement geo-blocking based on IP addresses and GPS locations to prevent access to KuCoin’s apps and services services from New York.

On Wednesday Silvergate Capital (SI), the parent company of the lending focused bank, said that Silvergate Bank would “voluntarily liquidate” its assets and shutter operations.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded as low as $20,050 on Thursday, its lowest level since Jan. 14, before regaining some ground to hover just over $20,370, off more than 7.6% over the past 24 hours.  “This remains a tough environment for crypto given the fallout from Silvergate Capital, so bitcoin could see further selling pressure test the $20,000 level,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note.  In the past 24 hours, bitcoin posted more than $98 million in liquidations, with over 94% of them being long positions, Coinglass data shows.  Investors became concerned and bitcoin’s price started dropping when last week when Silvergate said that it had delayed filing its annual report and warned of its potential inability to continue as a “going concern.”  Moya wrote that Silvergate Bank’s shutdown underscored crypto banking’s ongoing problems. He added that “the cryptoverse now tries to find a new services company to help make payments and other deposit-related services.”  Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, noted in an email to CoinDesk that if more service suppliers to the crypto market like Silvergate fall into trouble, it will “make getting access to crypto harder and … not be very inviting for new investors.”  Stefan Rust, CEO of economic data-aggregator Truflation, wrote in an email to CoinDesk that Silvergate’s crisis will slow the rate of institutions entering the market because “they don't have an on- and off-ramp that scales as fast.""  “It will also push more crypto business offshore,” Rust wrote. “Most, though, will find another on- and off-ramp that they can use to work around this.”  Elsewhere in markets  Most major cryptos were also recently in the red. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently down over 7% from Wednesday, same time, to change hands at $1,440.  Much of ETH’s price drop coincided with Thursday afternoon's news on the New York Attorney General's office suing KuCoin, alleging the crypto exchange offered unregistered securities and commodities. The lawsuit alleges that ETH, luna and terraUSD were securities.  Layer 2 platform Polygon’s MATIC token was down over 8% over the past 24 hours and 16% in the past seven days to recently trade below $1. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, tumbled 9% for the day to $17.09. SOL, which had been hovering above the $20 range most of this year, has lost 20% over the past seven days.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was down 4.7% for the day and 11.4% for the week.  Equity markets also struggled, with the S&P 500 down 1.9% Thursday afternoon.

The 2,000-item “Siren Collection” features a version of the company’s iconic Siren, with the stamps priced at $100. Members of Starbucks Odyssey were able to buy two stamps each starting at 12 p.m. ET, and could pay by credit card or by connecting their MetaMask wallet.  Upon launch, members of the Starbucks Odyssey Discord group complained of problems accessing the site and error messages, with the site seemingly overwhelmed by traffic.  Despite the issues, the collection sold out in 18 minutes and secondary sales quickly soared. As of this update, the floor price for a Siren Stamp has already passed $550.  NFT Stamps that members have unlocked from completing Journeys are already available in the Nifty Gateway secondary market, with the floor price “Holiday Cheer Edition 1 Stamp” hitting $1,398, with $170,636 in trading volume, as of writing.

In a call with community members on Thursday, Rune Christensen, the founder of Ethereum’s MakerDAO, said the stablecoin-issuing protocol should rebrand its flagship token to be more understandable for “normal people.”  DAI, the fourth-largest stablecoin, with a market cap near $5 billion – and the only top stablecoin backed by a basket of assets, including other cryptocurrencies – suffers from bad branding that could be inhibiting its growth, Christensen said during a call to discuss the protocol’s decentralization plan, called “Endgame.”  “What’s the right name for a stablecoin if you’re going to try to appeal to normal people? It has to have USD in it,” Christensen said on the call, which CoinDesk attended.  But that moniker would imply the token would stay pegged to the dollar, Christensen said, and there’s no guarantee a peg would hold.  The discussion of a rebranding came amid a broader debate about Christensen’s “Endgame” proposal for MakerDAO, itself a complex topic that Christensen admitted few understand. He said the move created a broader opportunity to rebrand MakerDAO and make it more approachable.  He called for “a complete rebrand, complete new name, complete new look, completely different approach to user acquisition,” saying it's “the only way to take control of the narrative.”  MakerDAO should position DAI as a currency that users can generate yield with, he added.  And DAI should be seen as “the safest and most reliable gamified crypto of all,” he argued.

Tolokonnikova’s “Activist Master Class” will draw upon experiences from her career as an artist and activist fighting for social and political justice through creative expression. The course will be open to Palm community members in May through the Palm Academy – the network’s native learning hub.  Tolokonnikova said in a press release she’s hoping the course will empower individuals to advocate for causes they most deeply care about while helping educate others on the power of digital art on-chain.  “I'm proud to work together with Palm to support and inspire creators, especially female-identified and LGBTQ+ creators, who have been smashed by patriarchy for way too long,” said Tolokonnikova.  Additionally, Palm and Tolokonnikova will continue to empower artists through an upcoming feminist art contest set to take place in April during the NFT.NYC conference. PalmDAO is calling on activists and artists to submit their work to the competition.

42411188,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLrzq,1678390508,Why Financial Analysts Missed Silvergate’s Red Flags,"Silvergate Corp. (SI) is a publicly traded company covered by at least 10 sell-side research and financial analysts. These analysts evaluate Silvergate (and other regional banks) and issue a recommendation on the company’s stock or debt (e.g., buy, sell, hold).  To a person, these analysts continued to recommend SI, even after the news of the FTX crypto exchange collapse. For example, on Nov. 9, Canaccord analyst Joe Vafi wrote, “In the event that FTX ceases operations or some customers migrate to other exchanges, it is highly likely that Silvergate will still capture that trading volume under its operational umbrella.” Vafi gave Silvergate a buy rating and a $150 price target. Silvergate closed on Nov. 9 at $34.69 and has not traded that high since.  Angelo Calvello, Ph.D., is co-founder of Rosetta Analytics, an investment manager that uses deep reinforcement learning to build and manage investment strategies for institutional investors.  Only after many subsequently damning events – a letter from members of Congress sent to Silvergate Bank, its $4.3 billion loan from the Federal Home Loan Bank, news of a Department of Justice’s probe, a joint statement from bank regulators on “Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations,” Silvergate’s notification that it would delay the filing of its annual report in which it questioned its own ability to “continue as a going concern,” and the exodus of many of the bank’s key partners – did these analysts finally capitulate. But even then not entirely, with some downgrading Silvergate from a buy to a hold.  This change of heart was too little too late. The damage had been done. On March 8, Silvergate announced its bank would wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate.  I would argue that long before November there were the fundamental problems with Silvergate that traditional analysts failed to detect, or at least grossly underestimated. Why?  Sell-side financial analysts follow a well-trodden path. They earn an undergraduate degree in finance, economics, mathematics, etc. They take an entry-level position working for a senior analyst. And maybe get a CFA, Series 7, or MBA, and become an expert on a specific sector or subsector (e.g., regional banking).  Read more: Angelo Calvello - 5 Ways TradFi Investors Are Rethinking Crypto in the Wake of FTX  This path provides them with a traditional finance (TradFi) lens that leaves them with a blind spot for decentralized finance (DeFi), causing them to miss the bank’s crypto-related troubles.  (The same can be said for analysts at traditional rating agencies, as they were slow to downgrade Silvergate.)  In the case of Silvergate, they missed several bright red flags.  Enough staff?  For most of its life, Silvergate was a sleepy, Southern California regional bank, offering the traditional suite of personal and business banking services. In 2016, it pivoted and went all-in on crypto, morphing into a self-described “nontraditional bank.”  In its 2019 regulatory filing, Silvergate expanded on this, stating that its “business model and vision differ from those of a traditional bank.” Alongside traditional banking services, it was “a leader in providing specialized commercial banking products and services to emerging financial technology ('fintech') companies throughout the United States and beyond.”  The analysts’ rosy recommendations provided Silvergate with a veneer of institutional legitimacy.  Yet, this tectonic shift in business models was not supported by a crypto-related acquisition or a meaningful capital investment, leaving one to wonder whether Silvergate had the staff and operations to run a crypto bank.  Silvergate Exchange Network  Silvergate’s flagship “specialized commercial banking product” was the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which CoinDesk describes as “a 24/7 instant settlement network used by some of the largest trading entities in the space. SEN, which replaces clunky wire transactions by allowing corporates to instantly move U.S. dollars between crypto exchanges including on nights and weekends…” The company closed SEN on March 3 and removed the page describing the service from its website.  Building on SEN’s success, Silvergate subsequently offered SEN Leverage, a custom lending that “allows institutional customers to trade any asset on-platform with leverage collateralized by bitcoin or U.S. dollars,” with “near real-time loan disbursements and repayments through the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN).” That service also closed on March 3.  While these services might represent a paradigm shift, they were also services offered by no other federally insured bank. Moreover, Alan Lane, Silvergate’s CEO, admitted in a 2021 interview that SEN Leverage was not approved by bank regulators: “It's not like it's an approved product, it's a nondisapproved product, is one of the ways we talk about it in banking circles.”  Also, these services directly tied Silvergate’s growth to the volatility and vagaries of the crypto markets. Any forecast of Silvergate’s future value would require a deep understanding of these markets and still-unfolding use cases.  Money laundering controls  SEN was the lynchpin in Silvergate’s customer acquisition strategy. And this strategy worked. Silvergate’s customer base grew from just 20 crypto customers in 2016 to more than 1,600 in 2022. These customers included hedge funds, over 100 on- and off-shore crypto exchanges, and companies doing token projects.  Importantly, customer deposits were mostly digital assets, which are not a particularly safe or stable source of funding because they directly exposed Silvergate to nontraditional risks, most notably the volatility of crypto markets. That Silvergate was lending to customers facing the same crypto-related issues compounded these risks. As one investor told me, “It all seemed like a recipe for disaster if crypto prices were to fall.” And fall they did.  Also, consider that these customers used SEN to facilitate “over $1 TRILLION IN PAYMENTS since its inception in 2017” (emphasis in the original 2022 Silvergate investor presentation).  It is incredible to think that a mid-size bank, even one that employed “twice as many compliance staff as comparable banks of its size,” would be able to perform the required anti-money laundering checks to detect and stop suspicious activities on so many clients and so many real-time currency transactions. The volume and velocity of these transactions ​– the source of many analysts’ reassuring forecasts – overwhelmed Silvergate’s compliance apparatus.  And some customers, aware of this weakness, used SEN for illicit purposes. According to court documents, FTX and sister company Alameda Research exploited the laxity of Silvergate’s compliance program and created accounts for what appears to be a fictitious subsidiary (Northern Electronics) to hide money that was used for Alameda’s trading activities.  Yet, even before FTX’s collapse there was evidence that customers were using SEN for illegal purposes as early as July 2021 and specifically for money laundering in August 2022.  A Jan. 24 New York Magazine Intelligencer story offers a sweeping indictment of such nefarious activity, describing Silvergate as “the go-to bank for more than a dozen crypto companies that ended up under investigation, shut down, fined, or in bankruptcy.” The story identifies numerous customers that have run afoul of the law (e.g., convicted Australian crypto Ponzi artist Stefan He Qin and Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange and onetime Silvergate shareholder and customer that has been sanctioned by U.S. authorities for moving money on behalf of Iran and Syria).  Read more: George Kaloudis - Crypto's Banking Problem Is Not Ironic  Other investors and researchers were acutely aware of Silvergate’s problems and publicly shared their views (e.g., the veteran short-seller, Marc Cohodes, told The Block that ""Silvergate is a publicly traded crime scene and Alan Lane belongs in prison”), going so far as to send letters to Silvergate’s auditor and regulators describing the problems and urging them to take action.  The apparent inability of analysts to understand and assess the mismatch between management’s skills and the new business model, the bank’s tremendous crypto-related balance sheet risk, the possible regulatory risks from offering “nondisapproved” products and services, and the AML risks had serious consequences. In addition to allowing some Silvergate customers to engage in fraud and other unscrupulous activities that harmed millions of people, analysts’ rosy recommendations provided Silvergate with a veneer of institutional legitimacy.  Some are quick to point out that Silvergate is a banking failure, not a crypto failure. But I see it as yet another TradFi failure: Like the institutional investors who invested in failed lender Celsius Network and FTX, Silvergate analysts used traditional investment techniques and metrics to assess the value of a nontraditional company, causing them to miss the embedded crypto risks that ultimately caused the company's failure.

In the case of Astra Protocol and Republic Crypto, the two sides struggled to agree on the contents of one issued this week.  On March 7, Astra Protocol revealed a partnership with Republic. In a statement, Astra said it had ""penned a new deal with Republic that will see the investment and financing platform acquire 10 million $ASTRA,"" the protocol's token. The statement included a quote from Andrew Durgee, the head of Republic Crypto. CoinDesk wrote a story, published on March 7, about it.  Then, Republic said the statement was inaccurate. It had not, in fact, acquired any ASTRA; Republic was simply given pre-loaded wallets containing the tokens so that it could test whether Astra's compliance platform was suitable for its needs, Republic said. Also, Republic said the quote from Durgee in the March 7 statement was unauthorized.  ""Republic is not paying for these tokens and is not distributing the tokens. ASTRA is responsible for the financial and administration considerations involved in this free trial,"" Durgee told CoinDesk in a March 9 Telegram message.  When asked about this repudiation by Republic, Astra did not initially respond. CoinDesk published a story summarizing Republic's refutation.  Then, Astra refuted the repudiation.  The original March 7 press release ""was 100% signed off and approved by Republic,"" Astra said in a March 9 message to CoinDesk. ""They agreed with the content and phrasing included in this press release. Republic alsosigned off explicitly on the [Durgee] quotein the press release.""

The vote will determine whether to close a smart contract that provided liquidity for the minting and burning of GHST, the ecosystem’s base currency and governance token that has a market cap above $76.6 million and a total supply of 54.6 million. If this vote passes, which is on its second day of voting, a secondary on-chain vote will decide whether to let AavegotchiDAO spend the DAI stuck in that smart contract.  $33 million DAI tokens that were spent to mint GHST in the contract could go toward developing the gaming protocol’s ecosystem, if the votes pass. Earlier, the community agreed to split the sum across four different pillars: liquidity, the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) treasury, the gaming studio Pixelcraft and protocol rewards.  The motivation for ending the smart contract is two-pronged, according to Jesse Johnson, founder of Pixelcraft Studios, who said in an interview with CoinDesk, “We could derisk from DAI – not be reliant on a different ecosystem at all and … fund our own destiny.”  As it stands, Aavagotchi community members are almost in unanimous support for the vote, with roughly 4.8 million GHST, or 8.8% of the total supply, cast in favor. The vote is set to end on Friday.

42411191,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLs9l,1678387067,4 Potential Winners of the Silvergate Unwind,"Silvergate Bank, perhaps at one time the most important financial institution in crypto, will wind down after a period of cataclysmic withdrawals and a failed bailout from a federal mortgage backer. The bank’s conversations with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last week, reported to be a way to avoid a shutdown and shore up liquidity, in retrospect look like the nail in the coffin rather than a sign of life.  Silvergate, which began during the savings-and-loan era and was the first bank to see an opportunity in crypto, essentially became a financial zombie after overgrowing itself in a volatile sector.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It took on a massive amount of crypto deposits ($13.2 billion at the end of September) and, like all banks, invested those in safe yield-bearing assets like U.S. Treasurys and other bonds. Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, however, a wave of customer withdrawals and required payments on a Federal Home Loan Bank loan forced the bank to sell off assets before they reached maturity, causing a mismatch – it reportedly lost over $1 billion in the fourth quarter.  No lie, the situation isn’t great for crypto. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading down significantly on the news, and there are possible spillover effects to worry about. But this moment is also an opportunity for many. Who and what – apart from the short sellers who already made their profits – could benefit from Silvergate-gate? Here are four possible winners.  Other banks  The companies that stand to benefit most directly from the collapse of Silvergate are Silvergate’s competitors. At the first sign of blood in the water a number of crypto firms including Coinbase (COIN), Paxos Trust and Galaxy Digital switched to New York-based Signature Bank (SBNY) out of “an abundance of caution.”  Signature, which had far less exposure to crypto than Silvergate did, announced some months ago that it would be curtailing its exposure to the crypto industry. There’s no denying, however, that many crypto companies are loaded with cash that needs to be banked somewhere. Even as banking industry overseers caution traditional-finance firms from dealing with crypto companies, crypto remains a well-capitalized industry on paper.  Bloomberg’s Matt Levine noted that Silvergate’s issues didn’t necessarily stem from crypto itself. The “run on the bank” didn't start with an implosion of Silvergate’s bitcoin loan book or of one of its crypto clients (well, FTX, but not as a proximate cause), but from “the normal business of banking, borrowing short (taking deposits from crypto firms) to lend long (buying Treasurys and munis),” he says.  There’s a calculus here involving regulatory concerns and risk, sure. But that’s exactly what due diligence is for. As long as it’s not explicitly illegal to bank crypto firms, and it’s not, there’s an opportunity for banks to filter out applicants that can operate as going concerns. The logical inverse is that nearly every crypto company is insolvent, which seems unlikely considering some $8 billion in deposits were withdrawn from Silvergate. That money has to go somewhere.  Stablecoins  On Monday, Kaiko analysts reported that “stablecoins will likely become even more ubiquitous among traders,” with the “death” of the Silvergate Exchange Network, or SEN, an internal system Silvergate created to allow its clients to easily swap capital, which was shut down prior to the bank’s unwinding.  Crypto firms are likely already familiar with the mechanics of stablecoins, a class of crypto assets usually pegged to the U.S. dollar. In fact, in the last year, stablecoin transactions on centralized exchanges rose to 90% of all volumes from 79%, replacing in particular USD-based trading pairs, Conor Ryder, a research analyst at Kaiko, noted.  U.S. corporate stablecoin issuers are having problems of their own getting banking status, and many will be affected by Silvergate’s collapse. Issuers like Circle Internet Financial promise to hold an equivalent amount of assets to back the number of USDC in circulation, money that has to be parked somewhere. But for smaller firms, it’s possible a conversion from cash to stablecoins could hold them over.  See also: Arthur Hayes Proposes Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin Called NakaDollar  Europe  Unlike the U.S., the European Union has been taking a proactive view toward regulating the crypto economy. The pending Market in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA, law is a broad set of rules expected to go into effect soon, providing clarity for both crypto companies and financial institutions that would serve them. The crypto problems in the U.S. could only catalyze the trend of firms looking overseas to set up shop.  One indication of that, perhaps, as Ryder noted, is that “the BTC-Euro pair hit its highest level of market share vs. [USD] ever last week, nearly tripling in market share in the space of a few weeks.”  See also: Signature Bank, Stablecoins Might Benefit From Silvergate Exchange Network Demise  Payments providers  On Monday, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of crypto financial-services firm BCB Group, told CoinDesk’s Ian Allison that his company’s payments processor is accelerating plans to add U.S. dollar capabilities to help fill the hole left by SEN. BCB launched its real-time settlement network, the BCB Liquidity Interchange Network Consortium, or BLINC, in mid-2020. It currently handles euros, British pounds and Swiss francs.

Merger in Earnings Call,"Operational issues across its bitcoin mining sites are weighing on Hut 8 Mining (HUT) as it tries to complete what would be one of the largest deals in the sector – the company's merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp.  In mid-November 2022, Hut 8 stopped mining with 7,000 rigs at a site in North Bay, Ontario, due to an ongoing dispute with its energy provider, Validus Power. Hut 8 has now removed all machines from the facility to a site in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Pressed about progress by analysts on the company's earnings call Thursday morning, Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said the firm is assessing opportunities to energize the miners, but didn't give any concrete alternatives.  At its Drumheller site in Alberta, Hut 8 has been facing ""electrical issues"" that have hit operations. ""We are in the early stages exploring supplementary options to mitigate the challenges and hope we have more definitive plan,"" said the firm's newly appointed chief financial officer, Shenif Visram, during the conference call.  Hut 8 shares are down 8% on Thursday, as are those of its mining peers, as bitcoin slides to its lowest level in a month at $21,450.  Hut 8 did receive a letter of no action from the Canadian competition authority for its proposed merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp., meaning the authority doesn't plan to challenge the move, Leverton said on the call. The company's main focus is on completing the merger, she said, which will give it access to additional power for mining rigs.  Looking at Q4 results, mining profit plunged to CAD$3.33 million (US$2.4 million) from $39.2 million (US$28.4 million) during the same period a year earlier. For all of 2022, the company mined 3,568 bitcoin, up 28.1% from 2021. Hut 8 reported a net loss of CAD$242.8 million for 2022 compared to a loss of CAD$72.7 million for 2021.  The company earlier this week disclosed sales of bitcoin for the first time in 2021 as it looked to help fund both operating costs and its merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp.

42387955,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQz6F9,1678384957,Federal Reserve Setting Up New Squad of Crypto Specialists,"The Federal Reserve is putting together a “specialized team of experts” to help it supervise the crypto sector, Michael Barr, the central bank’s vice chairman for supervision, said Thursday.  The Fed’s top regulatory official said the digital-assets specialists are needed to “help us learn from new developments and make sure we're up to date on innovation in this sector.”  Barr, the Fed official with the most potential influence over how the central bank regulates and supervises crypto, echoed the comments of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell this week that the banking regulator is hoping to preserve crypto innovations as it moves forward to put up guardrails.  “Despite recent events, we have not lost sight of the potential transformative effect that these technologies could have on our financial system,” Barr said in an event for the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. But he also had criticism for the industry.  “While crypto assets are hyped as decentralized, there has been an emergence of new, quite centralized intermediaries that are either not subject to or not compliant with appropriate regulation and supervision, which has perpetuated harm to consumers,” said Barr, who once worked as an adviser for Ripple, the issuer of the XRP token. “Our overall stance is that, at this stage of the development, banks should take a careful and cautious approach to engaging in crypto asset-related activities and the crypto sector.”  'Novel risk'  In recent months, the Fed has been releasing guidance and policy statements about digital assets in the U.S. alongside its fellow regulatory agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Those kinds of statements will continue, Barr said.  When asked whether the Fed should have been picking up crypto concentration problems at certain banks well before the banks got around to issuing open warnings, Barr said – without naming this week’s example of Silvergate Bank’s collapse – that his agency tends to give small banks more leeway than larger ones.  The Fed has observed smaller banks getting deeply involved with cryptocurrency activity, “the extent to which they are exposed to correlated risks is not well understood,” he said, and the crypto winter has been a lesson in crypto sector risks being highly correlated.  “We tend to have a very light-touch approach to smaller institutions, so there’s more of an impetus on them to actually be paying attention to these new and novel risks, and we need to make sure that they understand that,” he said.

The OPNX platform will allow investors to purchase bankruptcy claims across the crypto market that may mature over the coming years.

Combining elements from popular puzzle games Tetris and Sudoku, Bitcoin Blocks will allow players to compete against others to earn bitcoin based on their scores.  “Crypto games generally are really kind of centered around the idea of speculation,” Desiree Dickerson, CEO of THNDR told CoinDesk. “It's not just pure joy of play.”  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends? Subscribe to The Airdrop here.  As a part of the game release, the company is introducing its Gaming Graph, a feature that allows users to connect to their profiles on decentralized social network Nostr. Users can then earn “badges” for their gameplay milestones, linking them to their Nostr profiles to help build out their gaming identity across Web3 social media platforms.  Dickerson noted that Bitcoin Blocks, alongside the other five games the company has released to date, aims to help onboard people to the Bitcoin network through an entertainment-first gameplay experience, with a social element to encourage competition.  “80% of our users are new to bitcoin and we love that we’re the top of the funnel,” said Dickerson. “I hope this is a way for people to introduce their friends and family to bitcoin – that's why this has been a fun, safe, familiar place to learn.”  THNDR has been building games on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network since 2019, introducing players to the cryptocurrency through a familiar and fun gameplay experience. The company also offers its blockchain-based take on classic games like Solitaire and Snake.

42415591,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JnaX,1678377600,Securities Platform DEFYCA to Release Tokenized Private Debt Protocol on Avalanche,"Luxembourg-based digital securities platform DEFYCA will release its tokenized private credit protocol on the Avalanche blockchain’s testnet this month, aiming for a mainnet launch in late July, the firm told CoinDesk.  DEFYCA says it is the first company to offer digital securities to professional investors under the European Union’s upcoming, comprehensive crypto regulation called MiCA and the current blockchain laws of Luxembourg.  The announcement comes as crypto and traditional capital markets are increasingly getting commingled in decentralized finance (DeFi) with protocols offering tokenized versions of real-world assets (RWA) such as bonds and credit on the blockchain for investors. Private debt funds, which DEFYCA is aiming to bring to Avalanche, manage $1.6 trillion of assets, according to a report by Broadridge.  Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Asia’s private market exchange ADDX have forecast the asset tokenization industry will mushroom into a $16.1 trillion business opportunity by 2030.  Read more: Has Tokenization’s Moment Finally Come?  “Moving real-world assets and off-chain collateral on-chain is critical to the evolution of DeFi, and making the risk profile of these applications more robust,” Morgan Krupetsky, director of business development and institutions at Ava Labs, said. Ava Labs is the blockchain developer firm behind the Avalanche ecosystem.  Tokenized real-world assets  DEFYCA will join a growing roster of hybrid protocols that combine blockchain-based decentralized finance with traditional finance (TradFi) systems to cater institutional investors who are seeking yield-earning opportunities.  Earlier this year, Ondo Finance started to offer tokenized government and corporate bonds, while Maple Finance unveiled a tax receivables lending pool. U.S. banking giant JPMorgan’s Onyx protocol settled over $300 billion of intraday repurchase deals as of November.  Read more: Singapore’s DBS Explains How Big Banks Can Implement DeFi, Too  On the protocol, tokenized assets will be issued, securitized and structured into liquid pools, and investors can deploy algorithmic strategies to trade. As the usual steps of debt issuance such as liability matching, settlement, payment flows and price discovery are executed automatically by smart contracts, the process is faster and cheaper than in traditional markets, according to the protocol.  Investors will be able to deposit Circle’s USDC and EUROC stablecoins or traditional fiat money, with Citi being the cash custodian of the protocol.  At launch, DEFYCA’s platform will offer two funds to invest: a EUR100 million (US$105 million) direct lending fund that targets small and medium enterprises in Europe and a larger private infrastructure digital feeder fund of around $200 million.  “There is a strong pipeline of circa $1 billion of issuances over the next 18 to 24 months,” a spokesperson of the protocol said.

The collection is rapidly rising in interest and value because of the association of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin with the project, though his direct involvement in the NFT drop has not been established.  In one week, collectors minted 9,221 tokens at a floor price of 0.5 ETH, or about $770. The collection has already hit the secondary market in full force. According to data from OpenSea, the collection’s trading volume of 7,763 ETH, or nearly $12 million at the time of writing.  The mint, which was executed by blockchain funding company Gitcoin and NFT platform Metalabel, aims to commemorate a 2018 paper about Quadratic Funding, a public fundraising mechanism written by Buterin, Harvard University economist Zoë Hitzig and economist and social activist Glen Weyl.  Purchasing the NFT grants collectors a digital copy of the paper, as well as two essays by the founders of Gitcoin commenting on the success of the funding mechanism.  Twelve of the tokens in the collection were special “Signature Edition” records and were reserved for collectors to mint at 10 ETH, or over $15,000, and earned buyers a copy of the original white paper signed by the three co-authors.  Twitter and NFT collectors have been buzzing about the project, though some users expressed skepticism about what some are calling the ""Vitalik NFT drop,” with other users questioning if it is an ""official"" drop from Buterin.  The collection’s profits will be shared among Gitcoin, Metalabel and technology research firm Plurality Institute, with the goal of continuing to fund public goods.  “Since this idea was introduced, more than $70 million has been directed to public goods and open source projects using quadratic funding by Gitcoin and other organizations,” according to the collection’s website.

The round was led by venture capital firm Matrix Partners, with participation from notable investors including LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman; actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow; the co-founder of Twitch, Kevin Lin; and NFT investor Cozomo de Medici.  Wild plans to put the funding towards its hyper-curatorial residency program, which onboards artists in “seasons'' to create art for its native marketplace. Douglass Kobs, CEO and founder of Wild, told CoinDesk that its goal is to help artists build bodies of Web3 work to collectively contribute to the “Wildverse,” the platform’s native metaverse.  “We deem the future to be much more immersive, much more experiential, driven by AR and VR innovation,” said Kobs, referring to augmented reality and virtual reality. “What we're building at Wild is a collection of some of the most creative humans on planet earth who are building this new surface area of experiential art that we can all play with, interact with, engage with and build community within.”  Wild kicked off Season 0 in November 2022, a 12-week program culminating in an NFT drop in January 2023 from participating artists including Hideo, Mitchel F. Chan, Aluna, Sasha Belitskaja, Auguste Wibo and others.  “The Wild Residency is an incredible opportunity for artists to share creativity, ideas, and energy,” said Chan. “The program has created meaningful connections in my art practice that will continue to shape my career.”  While Wild holds weekly sales of its residency artists’ work, it also offers Wild Oasis, a founder’s pass that allows community members to bid daily on NFTs, starting at a price of 0.1 ETH or about $160.  “What we try to do is build this ecosystem in this community for all the artists to do their best work, and to learn from one another,” said Kobs. “The program is an effort to guide them to be successful in Web3.”  Since the start of 2023, several platforms have emerged that empower artists to explore digital creativity while executing the mint and sales of their work. In January, the former head of digital at Gagosian launched Tonic.xyz, a generative art platform and gallery.

The proceeds of the capital raise will help Proven expand its team and scale its infrastructure, according to a statement. Additional investors in the round included Balaji Srinivasan, Roger Chen and Ada Yeo.  The fundraise comes after a year full of headline-grabbing crypto collapses tied to insolvency issues, including multibillion-dollar centralized exchange FTX.  Proven’s technology combines ZK proofs – a type of cryptography that can prove that something is true without compromising anonymity – and quantitative solutions. Exchanges, stablecoin issuers, asset managers and custodians can show their assets and liabilities to potential customers, partners or regulators without needing to publicly disclose their balance sheets or other sensitive data. Proven’s “Proof of Solvency” can be run daily for increased transparency.  ""The last few months have highlighted an issue that has long plagued both traditional financial and digital asset firms – efficiently fostering trust with customers while maintaining a necessary level of privacy. The absence of this has led to significant distrust and, of course, contagion,"" said Proven co-founder Richard Dewey in the press release. ""We designed Proven to be a win-win solution that enables customers and regulators to have confidence in their exchanges, lenders, asset managers and stablecoins while at the same time protecting sensitive customer information,"" he added.  The Proven team includes veteran quantitative traders, researchers and portfolio managers with experience at Jane Street, PIMCO, Two Sigma and Elm Partners. Proven’s client list includes crypto exchanges Coinlist and Bitso, stablecoin TrueUSD and M11 Credit - an institutional credit underwriter for decentralized finance (DeFi).

You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  However, the dominant consensus tends to be that while the market is not perfectly efficient, it’s getting closer each year.  So why, then, do so many financial advisors struggle to view bitcoin through the same market efficient lens? They often cite it as a scam, bubble or tulip mania, yet the market value of bitcoin has steadily increased since 2009 and has been the best-performing asset for years.  It's time for advisors to look themselves in the mirror and ask why that is...  The TLDR is price = truth  Financial advisors who preach the efficient market hypothesis and simultaneously call bitcoin a scam are contradicting themselves.  If the efficient market hypothesis says that a stock's price is a good indicator of value, then the same standard should apply to bitcoin.  Price is truth if you believe in market efficiency. The longer the value of an asset is held or growing, the more it proves there is value there, regardless of whether some or all market participants agree.  Bitcoin’s price reflects the demand for sound, global, free money. The market is open 24/7, 365 days a year and all market participants have the same information on how bitcoin operates. You can look at the mining hashrate hitting all-time highs, the number of daily active addresses or the 24-hour settlement volume on the chain. All these charts have a clear pattern – an increase going up and to the right over the last 14 years.  Can bitcoin swing wildly over shorter periods? Yes, but the price has drastically from a ROI and CAGR perspective dominated the other assets advisors have at their disposal. It is not an all bitcoin or no bitcoin type of decision.  Read more: What Fat Tails and Revolutionary Ages Mean for Digital Assets  Over time, if something is deemed worthless by the market it will be sent to its agreed-upon value or arbitrage away. The cryptocurrency market is rife with these – examples recently being FTT and LUNA. And let’s not forget that pets.com and others have inked their names in the history of big losers.  Many financial advisors also make the mistake of arguing there’s not enough history around bitcoin to prove its price is capable of holding up over time.  However, as of the close of 2022, the Bitcoin blockchain had traded and been active for more hours than the S&P 500. Bitcoin has traded for about 110,224 hours; the S&P 500, 107,217. Now, critics might say the S&P 500 has existed since 1959 and that history is essential. But I’d counter most of that is pre-internet history, and the world’s changed since then. Also, Bitcoin is a more robust, unrestricted market – without reliance on a third party or use of circuit breakers when information breaks or participants look for the exits.  Throwing out the intrinsic value argument  I will tell you one thing bitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect, and that is intrinsic value. Many CFAs and industry professionals trot out this line about bitcoin.  My question is, what is intrinsic value? There is no such thing – value has and will always be subjective based on an individual's need at the time. Demand drives everything and always has.  The idea of intrinsic value is a fool’s errand. The question of whether a Rolls Royce is worth more than a bottle of water is subjective based on where you are and what you need. The demand for water in the desert is certainly going to be higher than that of a Rolls Royce. I exaggerate to make my point, but demand drives value. That's unchanging over time.  The other reason to disregard intrinsic value arguments is that bitcoin is base money – it’s not backed by anything, and that’s because it’s purely a monetary asset. An asset must only be ""backed"" by something else if it is missing the properties people value most.  Read more: Bitcoin Is the Song That Does Not End  In her ”3 Reasons I’m Investing in Bitcoin,” Lyn Alden puts it best, “Although it has no industrial use, [bitcoin] is scarce, durable, portable, divisible, verifiable, storable, fungible, salable and recognized across borders, and therefore has the properties of money. Like all ‘potential’ money, though, it needs sustained demand to have value.”  Bootstrapping from $0 to global money is one of the most significant accomplishments of any technology. Bitcoin’s price reflects demand and adoption – nothing more and nothing less. We are living through the monetization of bitcoin, and the ride will be bumpy and anything but linear.  Vijay Boyapati, in his book “The Bullish Case for Bitcoin,” summarizes it like this: “No one alive has seen the real-time monetization of a good (as is taking place with bitcoin), so there is precious little experience regarding the path this monetization will take.”  The advisor takeaway  Most advisors still don’t see the need for bitcoin in their clients’ portfolios; they cannot see the forest for the trees.  The United States will probably be the last place to need better money. We’ve had the “exorbitant privilege,” as French President General Charles de Gaulle said in 1965, of being the world’s reserve currency, allowing us to be less impacted by bad money. And I won’t claim in this piece that the U.S. dollar will fail (history tells us it will).  However, for most clients of advisors, bitcoin is the asymmetric allocation that, if wrong, doesn’t hurt them – but if correct, it’s a lifeboat to preserve their lifestyle. The proper allocation for that preservation is how you earn your keep as an advisor over the next decade.  The ego of too many financial professionals will prevent them from making a bitcoin recommendation until it’s reached full consensus. By then the asymmetry will be gone – although owning bitcoin will never be bad. The only wrong allocation in 2023 is zero.  So what is bitcoin’s price telling you today? It’s time to do your homework before the next halving and six-figure bitcoin price has everyone in a mania again.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/09/price-not-intrinsic-value-is-the-true-measure-of-bitcoins-success,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ec623c84c24afea69693249b7eca557021a7be0-7021x4680.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

10464164,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585967-bitcoin-10-years-since-cyprus?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1678368707,Bitcoin: 10 Years Since Cyprus,"Summary It's been 10 years since the Cypriot bank crisis. A moment that became the catalyst for a 600% rise in BTC. Since then, Bitcoin has seen coin holders, transactions, hash rate, and active users grow considerably. BTC remains the most distributed proof of work coin in the cryptocurrency market. A notable Bitcoin antagonist having issues with Venmo is a fitting anecdote that illustrates the need for decentralized systems. March 2023 marks ten years since the Cypriot bank bail-in. Without getting into all of the brutal details of what caused the issues, strictly at a human level the ramifications of the banking crisis were profound. After making a deal that would see the banks 'bailed-in' at the expense of depositors, the banks closed and rationed withdrawals in an attempt to prevent a total run on assets : There are fears that as soon as the banks do open their doors, Cypriots will try to withdraw as much money as they can from their account. Depositors were effectively locked out of their accounts and the idea of non-custodial digital currency immediately started to pick up some steam. Bitcoin Moons After Cyprus It may not be well understood by Bitcoiners who have joined the network in this most recent bull run, but the Cypriot bank crisis led to a bit of a coming out party for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) back in 2013: BTC Weekly Chart (Trading View) 2013 was still very much the early days of the network. Aside from the Winkevoss twins and maybe a handful of other notable investors in Silicon Valley, there were very few people talking about, let alone buying bitcoin, at that time. But that changed when BTC holders enjoyed a 600% rally over just a few weeks following the Cyprus bank bail-in. Suddenly, there were mainstream media outlets recognizing the connection between the rise in bitcoin's price with the crisis in Cyprus: Today, it's worth $72, largely because of ""incremental interest"" from euro and Russian ruble holders who are terrified by the situation in Cyprus, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a financial technology company in Manhattan. Following the big surge in price, non-zero wallet addresses holding bitcoin surged 22% by the end of April 2013. Network Growth Over the last 10 years, the growth in Bitcoin has continued and it goes well beyond the dollar denominated price of BTC - which at $22k is still up a staggering 62,000% since the Cypriot bank crisis. Back then, the annual inflation rate of BTC was over 14%. Today, that annual inflation rate is now under 2%. BTC Realized Cap (CoinMetrics) When we adjust our market valuation framework to realized cap in an attempt to account for all of the new coins that have come into circulation since Cyprus and the price that has been paid for those coins, we can really get a sense for how incredible bitcoin's valuation journey has been over these last 10 years. In mid-March 2013, the realized cap was $156.2 million. It's now nearly $382 billion, a simply astronomical increase. And this is dwarfed by the growth in mean hash rate which can only be described as parabolic: Data by YCharts The mean hash rate, or the computational power allocated to securing Bitcoin, is up 852 million percent since Cyprus. From a user standpoint, we've seen clear network adoption in the key metrics judging by the 3,353% increase in non-zero wallet addresses and the 1,581% increase in active addresses: March 15th 2013 March 7th 2023 Change Non-zero wallet addresses 1,289,445 44,524,030 3,353% Active addresses 63,245 1,063,023 1,581% Daily Transactions 62,880 360,867 473.9% Annual Inflation Rate 14.4% 1.95% -86.5% Supply Equality Ratio 0.007956 0.1074 1,250% Source: CoinMetrics What I find really interesting from the table above is the Supply Equality Ratio, or SER. According to CoinMetrics , the SER is similar to a 20:20 wealth ratio in traditional finance: Instead of income, the SER looks at supply held by different accounts within a network. It compares the poorest accounts (the sum held by all accounts with a balance less than 0.00001% of the supply) against the richest accounts (the sum held by all the top 1% addresses) Essentially, the SER tells us if coin supply is distributed well or not. To provide some context for Bitcoin's SER compared to other cryptocurrency networks, I'm showing SER trends for the various payment-focused proof of work coins in this chart: SER PoW Coins (CoinMetrics) While Zcash ( ZEC-USD ) actually does come pretty close to Bitcoin's SER, there isn't any other cryptocurrency that is distributed among big holders and small holders as well as bitcoin is and that distribution has only improved over the last decade. Why Does Bitcoin Exist? Is it a store of value or a medium of exchange? I don't know if anybody really knows for sure what the network will be ten years from now. Throughout its history, I'd argue that bitcoin has been a really simple narrative trade when you strip away all the noise. The most straight forward way I think we can look at BTC is as a bet against the current system. Hedge against inflation? More debatable. But it is very much a hedge against banking custodians and central planning. And that's a hedge that I believe warrants some attention. Cyprus may or may not be the most egregious example of bank/depositor betrayal. But even the more recent Canadian trucker protests showed why decentralized currencies should be considered : The prime minister has invoked emergency powers that allow him to ""commandeer"" banks and insurers. Despite the fact that peaceful protest is constitutionally protected in Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, two key protest organizers were arrested in the capital of Ottawa last week. GoFundMe fundraisers have been shut down and bank accounts have been frozen without a court order. When GoFundMe became compromised, Canadian protestors found financial aid through Bitcoin . But the larger issue here isn't even protesting or circumventing the state, it's simply wise to hedge trust in third parties by putting a little bit of trust in yourself. Paul Krugman doesn't seem to be suspected of any crimes, yet even he found his Venmo account to be unusable on Wednesday. He said on Twitter : I've been using Venmo for years, but now it won't allow me to make payments. I spent a long time in chat with representatives, and they told me that they can't explain why - or fix it. The software has taken control. Krugman's problem ended up getting handled but the cost of his openness came with a sound dunking from crypto advocates who first pointed out how Krugman's prior views on custodians were contradicted by his own experience. And then again with those same crypto advocates noting how most people can't simply tweet their displeasure to 4.5 million followers to get attention on their problem. This is why the distribution of BTC is so important; guys like Paul Krugman, Charlie Munger, and Jamie Dimon don't need bitcoin. But the 'filthy masses' might. Investor Takeaway 'Not your keys, not your coins' is a lesson that, apparently, has to be learned again and again as history finds ways to repeat. It's very easy to sit comfortably in the western world with the perception of safe and regulated banking institutions and not understand why anyone would feel compelled to purchase assets that live outside that world. But history shows that banks are capable of making bad bets or bad decisions. Even the banks that serve crypto markets as we just learned from Silvergate Capital ( SI ) can succumb to poor choices. 10 full years since Bitcoin's 600% single-month rally in response to the Cyprus bank crisis would indicate this is an asset that has staying power. FRED Bitcoin has seen several face-ripping rallies since Cyprus. One thing Bitcoin has yet to see is a rate hike cycle quite like the one we're currently in. Price is price and that will fluctuate. Holders, hash rate, transactions, and active addresses tell the real tale. How valuable is code? That may depend on if your bank will let you use your money or not.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585967-bitcoin-10-years-since-cyprus?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10464164.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 1,014 −2.0%  Bitcoin (BTC): $21,608 −2.0%  Ether (ETC): $1,530 −1.8%  S&P 500 futures: 3,984.25 −0.3%  FTSE 100: 7,878.94 −0.6%  Treasury Yield 10 Years: 3.98% +0.0  Top Stories  Silvergate Bank, a lender that helped customers move money in and out crypto, will ""voluntarily liquidate"" its assets and wind down operations, its holding company, Silvergate Capital (SI), said Wednesday. The bank was under fire after announcing a week ago it would delay filing its annual 10-K report. It had to liquidate much of its holdings late last year to meet customers’ requests for withdrawals in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Silvergate turned its focus to crypto 10 years ago. It was a local commercial real estate lender in San Diego before.  The collapse of Silvergate Bank is dragging down bitcoin volume. CryptoQuant data shows that transfer volume, denominated in BTC, is down 35% over the last 24 hours. At the same time, the total number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain has dropped by 17%, and the number of active addresses has fallen by 10%. So far in March, daily bitcoin trading volume has averaged $25 billion, according to data from CoinGecko, versus $36 billion in February. “Coupled with the drop in the price of bitcoin, we have seen a noticeable drop in trading volumes, too, across the ecosystem when news about Silvergate’s financial difficulties broke,” said Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of crypto market maker Flowdesk.  JPMorgan (JPM) is ending its banking relationship with Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by entrepreneurs and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to a person familiar with the situation. In early 2020, JPMorgan took on Gemini and U.S.-listed exchange Coinbase (COIN) as customers, the Wall Street Journal reported. Coinbase's banking relationship with JPMorgan remains intact, a spokesperson for the San Francisco-based exchange confirmed. Gemini didn’t respond to requests for comment. In a tweet sent after the publication of the CoinDesk article, however, Gemini wrote, ""Despite reporting to the contrary, Gemini's banking relationship remains intact with JPMorgan."" Reuters has also since reported on the matter.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the MOVE index, which tracks volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, continues to rise and has reached its highest level since December.  ""Higher volatility for assets that are supposed to be the safest in the world is not exactly a vote of confidence,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, wrote in Wednesday's edition.  The crypto market is one of the purest liquidity plays, and liquidity is affected by asset price volatility. Higher volatility in bonds means increased collateral requirements.

This follows recent news that streaming service Spotify is testing token-gated playlists.  Artists on Audius who have released their own NFTs can “gate” their content so only token holders of the corresponding collection can have access to it. Listeners can link their wallets to Audius to confirm their NFT ownership and access B-sides, unreleased tracks and other special types of content.  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends? Subscribe to The Airdrop here.  “A big focus of Audius from day one is enabling deeper connections and deeper interactions between the fans and the artists directly,” Forrest Browning, chief product officer and co-founder of Audius, told CoinDesk. “In the future there will be many other ways that you could demonstrate to an artist that you're a superfan, but if you purchase one of their NFTs that feels like a fairly strong signal.”  Additionally, Audius aims to cater to artists who are active NFT community members but may not have their own collections. If an artist is a holder, or has an affinity for another NFT project such as popular Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks collections, they can gate their content with those NFTs.  Audius has been working away to integrate features to boost fan engagement over the past year. Last month the company upgraded its ongoing partnership with TikTok, allowing Audius users to integrate their favorite songs from the platform onto the social media application. In July, the company rolled out its tipping feature, allowing listeners to “tip” their favorite artists in the platform’s native AUDIO token.

42415610,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5Joof,1678365414,Shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Form Bullish Chart Pattern: Technical Analyst,"The future looks bright for the battered Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares (GBTC), a technical analyst told CoinDesk, pointing to an inverse or reverse head-and-shoulders pattern on GBTC's price chart.  The reverse head-and-shoulders structure is identified by three price troughs formed along a resistance line, with the middle trough being the lowest and the other two relatively smaller and similar in depth.  The occurrence of the pattern after a prolonged and notable downtrend, as in GBTC's case, is said to signal a potential bullish trend reversal. The bullish shift is confirmed once prices top the common resistance line, called a ""neckline"" by technical analysts.  GBTC jumped to a six-month high of $13.54 Wednesday, testing the neckline resistance of the reverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. A close above the neckline hurdle would confirm the breakout, opening the doors for further gains.  ""Both anatomically and structurally, we do recognize an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern necklined around $13.00,"" Goncalo Moreira, a chartered market technician and author of VocabTA, said.  ""The reversal formation would be fully confirmed with a daily close above this level, with a measured objective at $19.00, almost a 50% gain,"" Moreira added.  Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  The bullish pattern has been in the making since early September and comes after a more than 80% price slide. A breakout and a subsequent expected rally to $19 would fill the price gap between $15 and $18 created in June last year when the shares were trending south.  GBTC has rallied more than 17% this week, decoupling from weakness in bitcoin's (BTC) price, thanks to the U.S. court questioning the Securities and Exchange Commission's rejection of Grayscale's attempts to convert the trust into a spot-based exchange-traded fund.  On Tuesday, the panel of appeals court judges appeared to be skeptical of SEC's logic of drawing a distinction between bitcoin spot market prices, which it considers prone to manipulation and futures market prices while rejecting Grayscale's spot-based ETFs. That has revived hopes of an eventual victory for Grayscale and the launch of a spot-based ETF.  ""If judges turn more favorable, then there is the chance that GBTC Trust shares can be converted into an ETF. In that case, the discount in GBTC shares relative to the fund's net asset value could be quickly arbitraged away, and that's why GBTC shares are rallying now,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, noting the bullish pattern on the technical chart.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/09/shares-of-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-form-bullish-chart-pattern-technical-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b5ce873e9ef1da7645773193cc37959ea19a802-4800x3188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415598,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JnyK,1678365319,"India's Crypto Regulation Now Has Teeth, Experts Say","India's inclusion of crypto businesses under money laundering rules has given teeth to the regulators overseeing the industry for the first time, lawyers and industry participants said.  On Tuesday, the Finance Ministry added the industry to anti-money laundering (AML) rules, requiring crypto-related businesses to register with its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and comply with other mandatory processes under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). These include performing verification processes such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and reporting suspicious activities.  Penalties range to as high as $1,220 for each failure.  “This move is an ask with teeth because if entities fail to report regularly and on a near real-time basis, they can be penalized,” said Vijayendra Pratap Singh, a senior partner at law firm AZB & Partners. “But this can also be seen as the next big further restriction on crypto in India after the tax regime” that saw crypto volumes in the country plummet.  Bringing the industry into the AML regulatory framework follows the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) June 2022 call for nations to fast-track checks on crypto users’ identities. At the time, the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog said only 11 of 98 surveyed jurisdictions had enforced and supervised the measure known as the “travel rule.”  ""The move is a step towards implementing the FATF recommendation on virtual assets,"" said Jaideep Reddy, counsel at law firm Trilegal, who has advised various crypto businesses in India. ""The decision on a licensing regime (global regulatory framework) appears to be separately evolving based on discussions at the G-20 and international level.""  The move comes months after several of India's crypto exchanges were investigated by law enforcement agencies. Several executives said the industry was already complying with such requirements, including KYC.  The Bharat Web3 Association, the body representing the crypto industry, said it had asked the Ministry of Finance for this step, and the move was welcomed by industry leaders, including Ashish Singhal, co-founder of of crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber, Sumit Gupta co-founder of its rival CoinDCX, who both tweeted their support.  This gives crypto in India ""more legitimacy"" and will help in ""curbing the activities of bad actors,"" said Punit Agarwal, founder of crypto taxation platform KoinX.  Some in the industry were more guarded.  The new regime ""will create a negative impact on centralized crypto entities in India,"" said Dileep Seinberg, founder and CEO of MuffinPay, a crypto neobank. It will ""reduce massive transactions and business will move to decentralized exchanges and companies.""  ""It is a reasonably fair step,"" Trilegal lawyer Reddy said. ""The only downside to this is it has come in overnight and appears to become effective immediately, whereas there should have been a window of compliance to put processes in place.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/09/indias-crypto-regulation-now-has-teeth-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1e52dc3e35bc43280915b71c2437f60c6ef7865-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415594,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JnfI,1678361810,Arthur Hayes Proposes Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin Called NakaDollar,"Arthur Hayes, a co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, has proposed NakaDollar (NUSD), a stablecoin backed by bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin derivatives, which would theoretically be deeply liquid and attractive to traders and provide stability if accepted and used by investors and crypto exchanges.  The token wouldn't rely on a centralized entity such as a bank and instead would be supported by member crypto exchanges that list inverse bitcoin perpetual swaps – a derivative product that is traded and settled with the underlying asset.  “We, the crypto faithful, have the tools and the organizations needed to support $1 trillion or more worth of NakaUSD outstanding,” Hayes wrote Thursday in a BitMEX blog post. “If this solution were embraced by traders and exchanges, it would lead to a large growth in bitcoin derivatives open interest, which would in turn create deep liquidity.  “This would help both speculators and hedgers. It would become a positive flywheel that would not only benefit the member exchanges, but also DeFi (decentralized-finance) users and anyone else who needs a USD token that can be moved 24/7 with a low fee,” Hayes added.  Holding a perpetual swap that shorts, or bets against, the price of bitcoin along with $1 worth of bitcoin means the dollar value of NUSD ultimately remains the same – as losses and gains effectively cancel each other out.  Hayes proposed setting up a decentralized autonomous organization with its own governance token, NAKA, to help seed liquidity and allow holders to vote on operational matters. Funding generated from holding the perpetual swap could be funneled back to the DAO.  Both NAKA governance tokens and NUSD would be ERC-20 tokens that live on the Ethereum blockchain, Hayes added.  Demand for stablecoins  Hayes’ proposal comes in response to the growing demand for stablecoins that aren't tied to traditional currencies like the US dollar or euro.  With the rise of DeFi platforms comes a need for stablecoins that aren't subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as traditional currencies.  Stablecoins are an immensely important feature of crypto markets, because they facilitate billions of dollars in trading, lending, and almost all crypto-based services now offered to users.  Tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) dominate the centralized stablecoin market, both claiming their dollar-pegged tokens are backed by an equivalent reserve in the form of spot currencies, commercial paper or bonds.  There are then decentralized algorithmic currencies such as frax (FRAX), djed (DJED) and the upcoming crvUSD, which will rely on baskets of locked tokens to maintain their peg to U.S. dollar.  Concerns remain, however, after the demise of Terra’s UST tokens last May. A change in market dynamics at the time caused Terra’s LUNA prices to snap at a breakneck pace, falling 99.7% in less than a week as UST lost its peg and fell to a few cents.  That was because of how algorithmic stablecoins like UST operated. One UST could be redeemed or minted for exactly $1 worth of LUNA at any time. In theory, that helped UST retain its value while creating demand for both tokens.  Traders can continuously buy and sell LUNA and UST to maintain the peg and profit by doing so, incentivizing them to maintain UST’s peg. But although that experiment was ultimately a failure, it hasn’t stopped crypto hopefuls from trying out new iterations of a crypto-based stablecoin.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/09/arthur-hayes-proposes-bitcoin-backed-nakadollar-which-would-rely-on-exchanges-to-maintain-dollar-peg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38eb02459e42cc8a4e6ae36bbd71b21663a080b4-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Volatility in the sector has prolonged the crypto winter. 2023 will be a challenging year for both HIVE and the cryptocurrency space as a whole. HIVE is a hold until more clarity surfaces about the future of Bitcoin mining. Investment thesis I have closely followed the cryptocurrency sector for over five years, and I have published 2 bullish articles on HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ) - 8/17/19 and 5/11/20 the base case of which was the company was worthy of some of “your spare change.” HIVE traded at $0.26 on the date of my first article, and has closed as high as $26.31, or a 100X since then. My interest in this industry pioneer was largely based on: HIVE was the first public crypto mining company HIVE was the first crypto miner for both Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum HIVE has a well-defined green energy and ESG focus HIVE has a global presence (Canada, Iceland, and Sweden) HIVE has a strategic HODL policy However, HIVE has made a 180-degree pivot since my most recent article as of 12/31/22 bitcoin represented 99.9% (38.9/39.0) of their digital currencies compared to then when bitcoin represented 25.7% (887/3,455) of their digital currencies. The increased froth in the cryptocurrency sector has resulted in a prolonged bear market. HIVE (like many other cryptocurrency companies) has incurred suboptimal financial results as shown in the company’s SEC filing of 2/21/23. Stock performance seekingalpha.com/hive As the above chart shows, HIVE has decreased from $4.60 to $2.75, or 41.3% since 9/15/22, when Ethereum merged to proof-of-stake because it is better for implementing new scaling solutions, less energy-intensive and more secure than the previous proof-of-work architecture. This performance is much worse than the 30.9% average decline of the 6 stocks the company referenced on the 2/28/23 earnings webcast. HIVE's beta of 4.4 is higher than the average beta of 3.6 of their peer group. The company has a quant rating of 1.77 which is a “sell” and is about the same as the average quant of 1.83 of their peer group. In my view, these suboptimal metrics foreshadow a challenging near-term future on both a company-specific level and on a macro (Bitcoin mining sector) level as the crypto winter drones into month 10, as storm clouds linger on the horizon. Q3 Form 6-K Key takeaways from my review of the above SEC filing is that the condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position show that HIVE had a significant current ratio decrease from 3.17 as of 3/31/22 to a current ratio of 1.31 as of 12/31/22. The company also had a significant working capital decrease from $174.1M as of 3/31/22 to $15.3M as of 12/31/22. The condensed interim consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income show that HIVE had revenue of $88.1M for the 9 months ended 12/31/22 compared to revenue of $161.4M for the 9 months ended 12/31/21. HIVE had a net loss of $222.3M for the 9 months ended 12/31/22 compared to a net loss of $113.6M as of 12/31/21. The condensed interim consolidated statements of cash flows show that HIVE had net cash provided by operating activities of $46.8M for the 9 months ended 12/31/22 compared to $52.6M for the 9 months ended 12/31/21 Recap Based on my review of HIVEs Q3 6-K, as of 12/31/22, the company is on track to report a record loss in excess of $235M for FY23, which ends on 3/31/23. Since the price of Bitcoin is a de facto proxy for the sector, HIVE and the other Bitcoin miners will be affected by the incessant volatility of this widely-held cryptocurrency, which decreased 65% in 2022. This price meltdown is the principal reason HIVE recorded impairment charges of $98.8M and a revaluation of digital currencies of $80.5M for the 9 months ended 12/31/22. These writedowns had a material effect on HIVE's balance sheet and income statement, as shown by their worsening financial metrics referenced above, and will further constrain their ability to access the capital markets. To meaningfully rebound from the 45.4% YTD revenue decrease would require a significant increase in bitcoin, which appear unlikely. Other items of concern are that $2.8M of the $6.6M, or 42.4% of the sales taxes receivable is conditional upon a ruling by the Swedish Tax Authority related to an ongoing value-added tax issue and the 48.4% YOY increase ($9.8M vs. $6.6M) in general and administrative expenses. 2024 bitcoin halving According to current projections, the next bitcoin halving event (which happens approximately every 4 years) will occur in early 2024. Speculation that this event will result in a price spike in bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies are supported by the following graph: www.commons.m.wikimedia.org Based on my study of the Samuelson hypothesis as an Economics major shortly after it was created more than 55 years ago, I believe that the upcoming bitcoin halving may very well serve as a litmus test of the Samuelson hypothesis as it applies to volatility in the cryptocurrency sector. Former “bitcoin billionaires” and FOMO evangelists Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss may insert themselves in the upcoming bitcoin halving narrative and thereby add their perspective to the situation. In addition, a combination of other factors will contribute to a fever-pitched froth in the sector as the bitcoin having date approaches, and thereby support the validity of the Samuelson hypothesis. Unfavorable risk/reward profile 2022 was a tumultuous year for all Bitcoin miners- the FTX collapse, the Ethereum merger, and pronounced volatility in the sector. HIVE managed to withstand this upheaval but in my view, 2023 will be a watershed year for the company. The company has deployed 4,200 HIVE BuzzMiners powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC and is also launching its high-performance computing cloud business, which is 25 times more profitable than mining in order to meet the challenges of Bitcoin mining However, in my view, these laudable initiatives will not have a serious impact on profitability until Q4. Since HIVE has increased 79.7% YTD, I believe that the stock is currently “over their skis” based on my assessment of the cryptocurrency sector. My back-of-the-envelope price target is sub-$2.40 or 12.7% less than the 3/3/23 price of $2.75 absent a Black Swan-like event that would implode the entire industry. Conclusion Based on the foregoing financial and operational analysis, HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. faces many serious challenges going forward, highlighted by pronounced volatility, which is embedded in the DNA of the cryptocurrency sector. The following caveats which I stated in my 8/7/19 article are even more of a concern in the present environment: Investment in this sector is fraught with a multitude of perils and pitfalls. The inherent volatility of the industry is reason enough that most investors should allocate no more than 0.005% of their portfolio to this space. The bottom line is an investment in the emergent cryptocurrency sector should be limited to “mad money” and appropriate only for those with a high-risk tolerance. Given the uncertainty of the bitcoin mining landscape, I believe that HIVE is a “hold” on a short-term basis and Caveat emptor (""let the buyer be very aware"") is appropriate in the circumstances. The company’s fiscal year ends on 3/31/23 which means their audited financial statements will be available at sec.gov. in the coming months. I may update this article then as I expect more clarity about all things financial to be disclosed by HIVE management, which has a history of an aspirational thought process. At present, however, my view is that HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. is a ""hold.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585931-hive-blockchain-technologies-faces-a-challenging-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10460465.jpeg

The decision by crypto-focused Silvergate Bank (SI) to wind down, citing industry and regulatory developments, shuttered an on-ramp for converting fiat currency into crypto in the U.S., and regulatory action might lead to other avenues being closed, too, Morgan Stanley said.  The firm noted coordinated action by regulators to highlight the risks in U.S. banks offering crypto services. The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint statement late last month warning banks to consider liquidity risks related to cryptocurrencies.  “Flows into the crypto sector will slow without the ability to provide on-ramps between the fiat and crypto,” analysts Sheena Shah and Kinji C. Steimetz wrote.  Silvergate has been at the “center of the growth of the crypto industry, as a U.S. registered bank providing crypto services to crypto exchanges,” the analysts said, noting that the bank's shares fell 58% on March 2 after the company said it was evaluating its ability to continue as a going concern and that it was being investigated by regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice and facing inquiries from Congress.  The focus for the cryptocurrency market will now be on rival crypto bank Signature Bank (SBNY) and Binance, which is the world's largest crypto trading platform by volume, and on any further regulatory actions related to specific companies or products, the note said.  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped below the important $22,200 technical support level, the report added. At time of publication, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading at around $21,700.

42415607,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JoaO,1678359399,Crypto.com Faces Difficulty Maintaining Fiat On-Ramps in the Face of Crypto Banking Crisis,"The digital assets industry is in the middle of a banking crisis with the collapse of crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, and Crypto.com hasn’t been spared.  As Metropolitan Commercial Bank announced it is quitting the crypto business, and Silvergate has collapsed, Crypto.com is watching its fiat pipelines dry up as it will soon lose the ability to accept U.S. dollar (USD) deposits. The exchange is currently able to provide Euro-denominated banking services to users in the European Economic Area (EEA), but had to scramble to find a new banking partner after its prior provider had its accounts frozen by the Lithuanian Central Bank.  For any crypto exchange, maintaining adequate fiat off-ramps is key to ensuring liquidity and impacts the ability for digital asset prices to rise. Market analysts attributed a 10% correction in bitcoin prices in January to Binance halting USD transfers.  An exchange that only has the ability to service users in one part of the world, and then in euros, a far less liquid currency for crypto (most crypto trading pairs are denominated in USD), is going to have questions raised about its liquidity.  “Our EUR fiat wallet service provider recently reduced access to EEA residents via the single euro [payments area (SEPA) system],” a spokesperson for Crypto.com told CoinDesk.  “As SEPA’s intended purpose is to facilitate local borderless transfers between network participants within EEA, the EUR deposits/withdrawals via this service provider are not available to those not residing in the EEA,” the spokesperson added.  Finding a reliable partner is challenging  All this comes as Crypto.com has faced turbulence due to its relationship with two banks and wider fallout in the crypto industry.  Crypto.com’s prior banking partner was Transactive Systems, which held licenses in the U.K. and Lithuania. The Lithuanian Central Bank, which also has the role of market supervisor for the country, ordered the company to cease dealing with virtual currencies in January because of “serious infringements” of anti-money laundering laws.  Bloomberg reported that Transactive is the offspring of PacNet, a Vancouver-based payments processor that was accused by the U.S. Department of Justice – which called it a “transnational criminal organization” – of processing payments for mail-fraud schemes.  Four executives of the company have been charged in the U.S. with mail fraud and money laundering. Provincial authorities in British Columbia, home to the company, are attempting to seize over C$17 million (US$12.31 million) in property belonging to executives via a civil forfeiture lawsuit.  It is not known how much fiat currency belonging to Crypto.com was frozen when authorities seized Transactive Systems’ accounts.  Crypto.com will soon lose the ability to receive USD fiat deposits from U.S.-based users when its U.S-based banking partner, Metropolitan Commercial Bank, exited the crypto industry in January following a review by its Board of Directors. This is a broader problem facing the crypto industry in the United States after the collapse of Silvergate.  The exchange still offers the ability for users to buy crypto via credit card, and in September, started to waive fees for new users for the first week.  An exchange that will soon be only reliant on credit card deposits – an expensive pipeline – for USD liquidity would be the subject of broader questions about its liquidity.  A spokesperson for Crypto.com declined to name the exchange's specific banking partners only saying it works with a “variety.” They said that a migration to a new payment provider was completed on Jan. 25.  On-chain data shows healthy deposits  Data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen shows that Crypto.com currency has an exchange balance of $3.6 billion and a stablecoin balance of $776 million. It has also seen a positive net flow of $248.8 million during the last week.  Currently, there are fewer than 1000 active addresses for CRO, Crypto.com’s exchange token, according to data from Cryptoquant. This could be seen as a proxy for the number of engaged power user traders on the platform (exchange token holders get fee discounts on trades).  This number is down from around 1100 in mid-January, during the mini bull market, and 10,000, when the exchange bought sponsorship rights for the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers arena.  CRO is down 16% over the last 30 days, and 82% on-year.  CORRECTION (March 10, 2023, 08:25 UTC): Corrects to clarify that Crypto.com retail users within the U.S. can still deposit U.S. fiat currency.

42415599,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JoCb,1678359043,Nansen Rolls Out Query Product Offering Historical Data to Curate Datasets,"Nansen, a blockchain data analytics firm, has launched Nansen Query, a platform that allows clients to programmatically access unique, curated datasets pulled from Nansen’s databases, according to a Wednesday press release.  The new product aims to help firms perform blockchain analyses more efficiently by demystifying on-chain transaction history and pricing data. It promises to offer users a complete overview of markets to value “up to 60 times faster than competitors,” according to the press release.  The product provides coverage for 95% of all on-chain total value locked, or TVL, asset data and 98% of stablecoin deposit data across 17 blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Optimism, Ronin and Solana.  Nansen Query differs from Nansen’s base-level offering by pairing data with the company’s proprietary and trading indicators like the “wash trading filter,” which helps identify suspicious on-chain activity by scanning trades between several linked wallets and transactions bounced between various trading counterparties.  Nansen’s labeling system achieves that goal by facilitating firms’ analyses of on-chain data, which, while recorded on a public ledger system, can sometimes be difficult to access, Andrew Thurman, an analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk.  ""Actually getting to useful data is difficult given the scale of blockchain data and the ways in which you need to parse it to access the most useful information,"" Thurman said. ""We help people do that.""  A query is a request for data from a database or a request for action on that data that allows users to edit large information sets and identify trends among them. A programming language, like SQL, is used to create a query.  Nansen’s data analytics tools, which were released in 2019, have gained traction among firms throughout the cryptocurrency industry, including prominent players like Coinbase (COIN), OpenSea, MakerDAO, Polygon, Avalanche and Andreessen Horowitz.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MATIC | SPONSORED | TRADING | ARB,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/09/nansen-rolls-out-query-product-offering-historical-data-to-curate-datasets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6aba34a16c4d960f4df70f72b4d989a0a9a9930-2418x1240.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415609,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5Joju,1678357792,"Kwenta DEX Lures Traders to Capture Bitcoin, Ether Returns Regardless of Direction","Tokens issued by perpetual futures-focused decentralized exchange (DEX) Kwenta Protocol haveoutperformed the broader crypto market in the past week as traders have moved to decentralized platforms to generate relatively risk-free returns from direction-neutral strategies.  The DEX's native token (KWENTA) surged to over $670 on Wednesday, rising from under $250 in mid-February to reach a market capitalization of more than $150 million at yesterday’s peak price. Bitcoin fell 5% over the same period, according to CoinGecko.  KWENTA is used to incentivize the growth of the Kwenta decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and has two primary functions – staking and platform governance. Trading volumes for the token have grown steadily in the past few weeks to nearly $50 million from just $3 million at the start of this year, statistics show, contributing to $880 million in lifetime volumes since the platform’s early 2021 launch.     Kwenta works in tandem with Synthetix, a popular DEX that offers crypto, equity, and forex futures to traders. On Kwenta, Synthetix stakers take the other side of every trade. Funding rates attract traders on each side, balancing the skew. DEXs rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to process trades.  How traders are utilizing Kwenta  DEX traders have found a way to profit from perpetual futures funding arbitrage opportunities by utilizing the spread in funding rates between perpetual futures on different exchanges.  By taking bullish long and bearish short positions on the futures contract and the underlying asset, traders can capitalize on the difference in funding rates between the two markets.  For example, at writing time on Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures on Kwenta have an hourly funding rate of -0.001935%, giving a daily rate of -0.04% pocketed by short position holders. The daily yield on such a position at a 25x leverage – the highest offered by Kwenta – is close to 1%.  On dYdX, another DEX, the funding rate for bitcoin is 0.000164%, meaning it is paying 0.003% daily to traders who hold BTC perpetual futures on the platform.  The difference between funding rates can be exploited with the help of a market-neutral strategy.  A trader can place a bearish short position on Kwenta and collect the funding rate of 0.04% per day and simultaneously take a long position on dYdX and pay the funding rate of 0.003% per day. That way, the trader can safely pocket the difference in funding rates while bypassing market volatility.  “As there is a difference between the funding rates, the trader profits from the difference after all fees,” according to Synthetix documents.  What is funding?  Funding is similar to an interest payment. It is a set percentage of one’s position size that traders either pay, or get paid, at regular intervals. If funding is positive, longs pay shorts, and if funding is negative, shorts pay longs.  Funding rates are used to adjust the price of the contract over time to keep it in line with the price of the underlying asset.  Just as traders pay funding, those on the opposite side of the trade collect funding, based on market demand. This can boost profit and loss on directional positions, or be used as part of a more complex strategy.  However, funding reduces the profitability of a trade, and increases risk of liquidation. For example, hourly funding of 0.01% is about 87% annualized, Kwenta’s technical documents show.  Traders can utilize funding rates to create their own strategies, such as basis trading and funding rate arbitrage. These common strategies are known as Delta Neutral, where short and long exposure is balanced and returns are made regardless of market direction.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/09/kwenta-dex-lures-traders-to-capture-bitcoin-ether-returns-regardless-of-direction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11d5cc1bec53086818ddbe9c4369c82c00369fad-1024x576.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At press time the 30-day bitcoin skew, derived by looking at the difference in implied volatility/demand for cheap out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and OTM put options expiring in four weeks, shows the strongest bias for bearish put options in over two months.  That's a sign investors are worried about a deeper slide in the bitcoin price and are buying put options to hedge their long spot or futures positions, or are simply looking to profit from potential bearish price action.  ""BTC 25d skews are firmly back to puts > calls in shorter dates as it feels upside momentum has been sucked out of the market,"" Paradigm, an institutional liquidity network for crypto derivatives traders, said in a market update early Thursday.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell. A long position is one in which an investor owns the asset.  The renewed bias for put options appears justified, considering the market depth for U.S. dollar trading pairs has deteriorated amid the bitcoin price slide. That means a small sell order can lead to an outsized price drop. Depth refers to the ability of the market to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices.  ""USD market depth has dropped almost as much as BUSD's in the past month. After the BUSD news, liquidity for its top pairs dropped more than 40% before recovering. Meanwhile, the Silvergate news is weighing on USD pairs,"" Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko tweeted.  Bitcoin has slipped to three-week lows under $21,000 in the past 24 hours, extending the decline from the highs above $25,000 reached last month.  The sell-off could be attributed to the crisis at Silvergate and the resulting fears of liquidity drain, the sharp hawkish repricing of Federal Reserve interest-rate expectations and operational bottlenecks at major exchanges.  The 30-day bitcoin skew has dropped to -3.62, the lowest since Jan. 7, a chart provided by Amberdata shows. The 60- and 90-day metrics slipped to two-month lows of -2.72 and -1.58%, respectively.  A similar pattern is observed in options tied to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, despite the hype around Ethereum's impending Shanghai upgrade.

Chief Executive Officer John J. Ray III, who took charge on Nov. 11 when the company filed for bankruptcy, wants to offer bonuses as much as 94% of salary to stop those with knowledge of programming or company accounting practices from quitting.  “Mr. Ray and the newly appointed executives require the knowledge and intensive support and efforts from the Debtors’ ongoing workforce,” said the filing. “These remaining employees and contractors have institutional knowledge and, in some cases, unique and specialized skillsets that would be difficult to replace and that are critical to the Debtors’ objectives in these cases.”  The plan will be discussed at a March 29 hearing in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Ray has previously bemoaned poor record-keeping at the company, and the company says it faces a “massive shortfall” as it attempts to return funds to creditors.  Bonuses between 17% and 94% will be in the best interest of the FTX group as it seeks to wind up affairs, the Tuesday document said. The overall package is capped at $4,027,204 and targets staff with key skills and knowledge, including programming languages such as Python, Rust and Flutter. No bonuses will be paid to directors or officers of the company, to founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his family, or to any staff believed to be engaged in wrongdoing, the document said.

The agreement could be closed as soon as March 31, though deals made by bankrupt companies are subject to close judicial scrutiny. The would-be buyer, Al Nawwar Investments RSC Limited, is ultimately owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, and already invests in Sequoia, the document said.

42415628,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JuUl,1678346402,Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume,"Bitcoin traders are taking a breather and considering their next steps as the market digests the collapse of Silvergate Bank, which culminated in its “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday U.S. time.  CryptoQuant data shows that transfer volume, denominated in BTC, is down 35% over the last 24 hours. At the same time, the total number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain has dropped by 17% during this same time period, and the number of active addresses has fallen by 10%.  For the month of March, bitcoin trading volume has come in at an average of around $25 billion, according to data from CoinGecko, versus around $36 billion for the month of February.  “Coupled with the drop in the price of bitcoin, we have seen a noticeable drop in trading volumes, too, across the ecosystem when news about Silvergate’s financial difficulties broke,” Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of Paris-based market maker and brokerage Flowdesk, told CoinDesk in a note.  Silvergate was one of the major fiat payment rails in the crypto market, offering traditional banking services to exchanges and market makers. As such, trading volumes have dwindled since Silvergate’s problems became public.  Chaumont said trading has since then been quiet, and suggests the first shock has been priced in while traders digest the situation.  “It certainly has a ‘calm before the storm’ feel to it. So the market is not shaking it off – FTX has made us all very much aware that anything can happen,” he said. “However, the situation can still go either way – meaning that if news about a reassuring resolution came, the confidence that characterized the first two months of 2023 could return.”  Silvergate’s demise might accelerate the shift toward trading pairs denominated in the dollar-pegged stablecoins like tether (USDT).  ""With the death of Silvergate, stablecoins will likely become even more ubiquitous among traders. Rather than deposit your dollars with an exchange, you deposit them with a stablecoin issuer, receive stablecoins and then transfer those to an exchange,"" analysts at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko said in a note on Monday.  Most of the trading volume is already concentrated in USDT pairs. Data tracked by Kaiko show BTC/USDT pairs account for over 90% of the trading volume, up from 3% in 2017.  At the same time, the number of new crypto-USDT pair listings has been falling.  USDT daily volume is currently at an average of $32.3 billion per day so far in March, according to CoinGecko data, down from an average of $47 billion a day during February.

Questions have arisen about the viability of SI in the future. SI may perish, but crypto will live to fight another day. Overview The shares of crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital (SI), trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), have fallen in price by over 63% in the past week. The effects of the crypto contagion seem far from over, as crypto-friendly bank Silvergate faces fresh insolvency concerns that have dampened the February crypto market rally. The Backstory Silvergate is known as the payment “rails” of crypto, connecting the crypto industry to the traditional banking system. Big-name crypto firms have used Silvergate to process crypto-related transactions. However, the bank has now been ditched by most of its clients and has suffered declining deposits. Crypto-related deposits dropped by 68% in the last quarter of 2022. Coinbase said it has stopped ""accepting or initiating payments in light of the recent Silvergate developments."" Paxos has also stopped processing transactions through Silvergate. Other crypto firms that have severed ties with Silvergate are Circle, Bitstamp, Crypto.com, Gemini, and Galaxy. Silvergate’s woes began in late 2022, following the collapse of FTX and the cans of worms it opened in the crypto industry. Lately, the woes have worsened as Silvergate revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its annual 10-K report — a legally required document that shows a company's financial and business state — would be delayed. The announced delay of the 10-K filling raised immediate concerns about the financial state of the crypto-friendly bank. The bank, in the SEC filing , expressed concerns over its ability to operate smoothly in the coming months. In January, Silvergate reported a net loss, attributable to common shareholders, of nearly $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. To keep up with customers’ withdrawals, Silvergate liquidated its balance sheet debt (sold debt securities), resulting in a loss of $718 million. Silvergate has hinted that these losses could result in the bank not being well-capitalized. The bank processed over $8 billion in customers’ withdrawals in Q4 2022, resulting in a bank run. Silvergate took $4.8 billion in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) in the fourth quarter of 2022 to manage the bank run it experienced. To stay afloat, the bank took measures, including laying off about 40% of its staff and shutting down the Silvergate Exchange Network ((SEN)), its proprietary, round-the-clock payment network. As Silvergate prepares for what it expects will be a sustained period of lower deposits, it is taking several actions to help ensure the business is resilient, including managing its expense base and evaluating its product portfolio and customer relationships going forward. In addition, Silvergate has made the difficult decision to substantively reduce its workforce to account for the economic realities facing its business and the digital asset industry today,” the report released in January stated. Source: Silvergate Under the Microscope of the Authorities The series of crypto-related implosions that occurred in 2022 has drawn the attention of financial and governmental authorities. In the US, the SEC has continued to scrutinize crypto firms. In December, a group of US Senators asked Silvergate to release complete records of FTX transactions it processed. The Senators requested to gain clarity on FTX-Silvergate ties. Alan Lane, Silvergate CEO, stated that FTX's deposits represented less than 10% of the total deposits from all Silvergate's digital assets customers, waving off the fears of possible Silvergate insolvency. Silvergate still faces a slew of inquiries from US authorities, including the US Department of Justice (DoJ) fraud unit. The DoJ opened a fraud investigation earlier this year to look into Silvergate’s dealings with Sam Bankman-Fried’s fallen crypto exchange FTX and its trading arm Alameda Research. The White House is Aware During a recent White House press briefing , White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration knows about the Silvergate situation. The administration also monitors the crypto-focused bank's situation, ""comparing it with those at other crypto companies,"" Jean-Pierre said. Karine Jean-Pierre pointed to recent guidelines that the US banking regulators have issued on how banks can protect themselves from crypto-related risks. ""In recent weeks, banking regulators have released guidelines on how banks should protect themselves from risks associated with crypto,"" she said. ""As you know, this is a president that has repeatedly called on Congress to take action to protect everyday Americans from the risk posed by digital assets, and he will continue to do so,"" Jean-Pierre added. The Press Secretary declined to comment further or specifically on the Silvergate situation. Takeaway The recent delay in filing the annual 10-K report has created an ominous feeling in the crypto community and among investors who own Silvergate shares. Though the bank is under investigation by regulatory agencies, Silvergate has not yet been accused of wrongdoing. The main concern is its ability to continue to operate smoothly. If Silvergate becomes insolvent, the effects will be drastic on the crypto space. But as we know how resilient the crypto space and community are, there will be a rise from the ashes, and alternative payment ""rails"" will be sought. Digital Asset Capital Management, a crypto hedge fund that oversees over $400 million worth of assets, used Silvergate's SEN network to move funds to and from Coinbase. However, as Coinbase announced severing ties with Silvergate, the hedge fund has sought alternatives with Swiss banks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4585876-silvergate-capital-latest-crypto-casualty?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10466456.jpeg

Bitcoin dipped under $22,000 during European hours on Wednesday, even as broader traditional markets remained relatively unchanged. Ether (ETH) shed over 2%. Among other large-caps, solana (SOL) and matic (MATIC) fell 6% in the past 24 hours, while Uniswap’s UNI and Avalanche’s AVAX fell 4% in the same period.  Artificial intelligence-focused tokens The Graph (GRT) and SingularityAI (AGIX) fell as much as 8%, paring gains from a month-long rise. Curve ecosystem tokens curve (CRV) and convex (CVX) fell 7%, while gaming-focused ImmutableX (IMX) dropped over 12%.

A White House official confirmed the budget will include a tax provision intended to reduce wash sales trading by crypto investors. At present, investors can sell any cryptocurrencies at a loss, claim the loss on their taxes and then buy the same amount and type of cryptocurrencies again.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the provision would be expected to raise up $24 billion.  The president's proposed budget will lay out his fiscal priorities. White House officials told the Journal the plan would lower the U.S. deficit by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.  Any budget would need passage through the House of Representatives and the Senate before going to the president's desk for his signature.  This isn't Washington's first effort to close this ""loophole"" – lawmakers introduced a bill in late 2021 that would similarly prevent investors from claiming a loss only to repurchase the same cryptocurrencies again.  The president's team has already passed one crypto tax-related piece of legislation into law; in 2021, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which later became the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, included a controversial tax provision that would impose certain reporting rules onto brokers facilitating crypto transactions. The definition of ""broker"" was seen by many in the industry to be overly broad, to the point where miners and other types of entities that don't directly facilitate transactions or collect personal data from those conducting the transactions could be considered brokers.

(SI), said Wednesday.  The bank was under fire after announcing a week ago it would have to delay filing its annual 10-K report due to questions from its independent auditors and accounting firm over its figures. In Wednesday's announcement, Silvergate Corp. announced it had tapped Centerview Partners as a financial adviser, the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP and Strategic Risk Associates for ""transition management assistance."" Under the winding down all deposits will be repaid in full, the company said.  ""In light of recent industry and regulatory developments, Silvergate believes that an orderly wind down of Bank operations and a voluntary liquidation of the Bank is the best path forward. The Bank’s wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits. The Company is also considering how best to resolve claims and preserve the residual value of its assets, including its proprietary technology and tax assets,"" Silvergate Corp. said in a press release.  The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the state regulator for the La Jolla, California-based firm, said it was monitoring the situation.  ""The Department is evaluating compliance with all financial laws, as well as safety and soundness obligations, and is working closely with relevant Federal counterparts,"" DFPI Commissioner Clothilde Hewlett said.  A White House spokesperson referred CoinDesk to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's remarks that the presidential administration was monitoring the situation from earlier this week. At the time, Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden would continue to urge Congress to take action on crypto issues.  In a statement, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said, ""As the impact of FTX’s collapse continues to ripple outward, today we are seeing what can happen when a bank is overreliant on a risky, volatile sector like cryptocurrencies. I’ve been concerned that when banks get involved with crypto, it spreads risk across the financial system and it will be taxpayers and consumers who pay the price. That’s why I am continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and financial regulators to establish strong safeguards for our financial system from the risks of crypto.”  Spokespeople for the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency declined to comment.  'Going concern'  In last week's announcement, Silvergate Bank revealed it was facing inquiries from bank regulators and the Department of Justice, and warned its ability to be a ""going concern"" over the next 12 months may be in doubt.  As a result, major crypto clients announced they would suspend their relationship with the bank, and its holding company's stock price fell 58% in intraday trading to an all-time low of $5.72 – down over $115 over the past year. Its stock tumbled even further after Wednesday's announcement in after-hours trading. Signature Bank, another crypto-friendly bank, saw its own stock tumble around 5% in after-hours trading dipping nearly 10% before rebounding slightly.  Read more: Was Silvergate on Borrowed Time as Regulators Backed Banks Away From Crypto?  Silvergate took out approximately $4.3 billion in loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, a federal banking entity that provides this type of loan for banks. Still, the fact Silvergate's situation warranted these loans should have sparked concern from the FDIC months ago, a banking industry veteran told CoinDesk.  Silvergate has provided banking services to crypto companies since 2013, and launched its own internal settlement tool, the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). Silvergate announced late Friday it had suspended SEN.  The company revealed it had nearly 500 crypto clients when it filed to go public in November 2018. Its initial public offering (IPO) was completed in 2019, trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The bank boasted more than 750 crypto clients at the time.  While Silvergate was not on the FDIC's ""failed bank"" list (as it is voluntarily liquidating, rather than going into an FDIC receivership), it appears to be the first major bank collapse since October 2020, and possibly the largest bank to fail since 2009.

Meanwhile, the Crypto Council for Innovation blamed the collapse of Silvergate on a bank being overly exposed to one sector and encouraged regulators to let more banks take crypto deposits.  “Discouraging banks from providing deposit accounts only exacerbates this problem by creating fewer options for any one sector to obtain banking services. The problem is not about crypto, but concentration risks,” Shelia Warren, the council’s CEO, said in a statement.  “Hopefully, this situation serves as a needed reminder to regulators of the risk of concentration, which is certainly not unique to the crypto industry, and will cause them to encourage responsible distribution across the banking sector,” she wrote.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/09/crypto-stakeholders-say-no-exposure-to-shuttered-silvergate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbc34b589ee5481892b336c5f6845bf3dbca2d8a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415635,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JtjB,1678325259,U.S. Government's $1B Bitcoin Transfer Spooks Investors; Bitcoin Dips,"U.S. authorities transferred $1 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) recovered from a dark web hack to new wallet addresses, including one owned by Coinbase, on Wednesday, stoking investor fears that intense sell pressures could drive down the token's price.  Authorities moved the bitcoin in three transactions, according to data from blockchain security firm PeckShield. Nearly 10,000 bitcoin were sent to Coinbase-controlled wallets, while roughly $41,000 tokens were directed to government-controlled wallets.  PeckShield published its findings on Twitter early Wednesday, and investors were quick to notice. In the hours after the report's release, investors expressed their fears that authorities would sell the recovered bitcoin on the open market, potentially tanking the price of bitcoin, which has recovered from its two-year low of roughly $15,500 in November. The concerns caused bitcoin's price to dip roughly 2%, pushing it below $22,000.  An open market sale would be a departure from authorities' past handlings of seized digital assets. The government usually sells seized assets at auction. In 2014 and 2015, the government auctioned off bitcoin seized from the owner of virtual black market platform Silk Road.  Although concerns about the tokens' sale on the open market may be overblown, fears that bitcoin prices could take a hit are not entirely unjustified, said Conor Ryder, a researcher at crypto markets analysis firm Kaiko.  ""The movement of Silk Road bitcoin to Coinbase is almost definitely being done with the intention to sell [the recovered tokens], so one has to wonder if bitcoin is due for some short-term headwinds,"" Ryder told CoinDesk.  Whether the market will absorb those pressures will likely boil down to the market's composition, says Mark Connors, head of research at 3iq, a digital asset manager. In other words, who the token holders are and how many tokens they hold will largely influence the extent to which the market reacts to a potential market-moving event.  The current composition of the bitcoin market may help bitcoin stand up to sell pressures better than it did in the wake of last spring's Terra crash, according to Connors. That's because the market has less leverage than it did last year. It's also because the market today is composed of more investors owning wallets holding more than $1,000 worth of tokens than it was last year, when the market was flooded with a large amount of crypto-curious investors who held much smaller amounts of bitcoin.  ""There should be a quicker bounce back if there's sell pressure, given the larger amount of push [in] the market today compared with the weaker hands and greater leverage [that characterized the market] a year ago.""  Bitcoin's price may still move as the government reveals its plans for the recently transferred bitcoin, however. Many things about the government's plans for the tokens remain unknown. It remains unclear if authorities will auction off the bitcoin. It is also unclear if the government will consolidate the assets at some point.

Good morning, Asia. Here's what's happening in markets.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talked tough for a second consecutive day. Banking giant JPMorgan ended its relationship with crypto exchange Gemini, as CoinDesk's Ian Allison first reported. Crypto-friendly bank Silvergate will shutter operations.  Bitcoin absorbed it all and then inched downward to its lowest level in nearly a month. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $21,750, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours. BTC sank below $21,600 at one point after largely teetering over $22,000 for much of this month. Investors have been wrestling with worrisome jobs and price data that has prompted Powell and Fed governors to rekindle their monetary aggressiveness as an inflation prescription.  The prospect of a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate hike now rests about 70% after various indicators heavily favored a more dovish 25 bps increase in previous weeks.  “After celebrating disinflation greenshoots the past two months, the Federal Reserve has had to restart its hawkish positioning by talking tough on rate hikes,"" Quinn Thompson, head of growth and capital markets at blockchain-powered capital markets platform Maple, wrote CoinDesk in an email. ""I think it's interesting to note that [the Fed] were parading their hikes as having a substantial impact on inflation, and then it became clear that inflation has proved to be more stubborn than had been anticipated. A 50-basis-point rate hike is basically inevitable now.""  Thompson added that ""barring any breakage in the system, such as a credit event of some sort, it seems increasingly likely that there won’t be any rate cuts until next year.""  Ether fared similarly to bitcoin and was also down about 2% to change hands just above $1,530. That level was well off its late February highs over $1,700. Other major cryptos were mostly in the red, with SOL, the token of the Solana, blockchain off more than 9% and APT, the native cryptocurrency of layer 1 blockchain Aptos Labs down over 6%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the broader crypto market's performance, was down nearly 3%.  The Nikkei rose about 0.5% as trading in Asian equity markets opened. U.S. indexes were flat with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a heavy technology component, climbing slightly but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining a couple of ticks of a percentage point.  Maple's Thompson was wary about the cryptos' prospects amid the Fed's apparent hawkish turn, which has historically sent prices of crypto and other riskier assets tumbling.  ""I suspect that we could again test the lows that were reached last year as a result of hiked rates, but also because of the Fed’s ongoing monetary tightening regime that is draining liquidity out of the markets,"" he wrote. ""A lot of this tightened monetary policy is being priced into the fixed income markets. But risk assets have yet to price in the potential for downside spillover, and this could spell trouble for equities and crypto.""

An earlier version of this story appeared separately on CoinDesk's website.  A new tool to capture yields from prominent stablecoin swapping service Curve has attracted over $60 million from depositors just over a week after launch.  Conic Finance, which went live on March 1, allows users to deposit tokens into its omnipools, a new product that diversifies exposure across the Curve ecosystem while increasing rewards.  Each omnipool allocates liquidity of a single asset into different Curve pools. All Curve liquidity provider (LP) tokens get staked on Convex to boost curve (CRV) rewards earnings. Convex (CNX), another Curve ecosystem token, is also rewarded, and so is conic (CNC), Conic’s native token.  Conic users can earn up to 21% annualized yields on the three omnipools for dai (DAI), frax (FRAX) and USD coin (USDC). The USDC pool has attracted over $50 million in liquidity alone, as Conic is currently providing one of the highest available yields in the crypto market for USDC. Deposits of frax and dai are considerably lower at $7 million and $5 million, respectively.  Holders can lock their CNC tokens for vlCNC to participate in Conic governance and directly control how liquidity is allocated across Curve pools by participating in Conic’s Liquidity Allocation Votes (LAV) – which determine the share of an omnipool’s liquidity that a Curve pool can receive.  In the coming weeks, Conic’s demand among traders for its yield-generating products could ultimately generate value for its own CNC token.  As such, CNC tokens currently trade at $8, losing 4% in the past 24 hours with a market capitalization of $32 million.  To be sure, not all DeFit observers are fully embracing Conic's approach. Colin Johnson, the CEO and co-founder of tokenized art investment platform Freeport, called Conic ""an interesting new avenue to access yield within the Curve ecosystem,"" yet added warily that ""we've seen historically what happens with promised returns of 20% or more (Terra).""  ""They either rapidly fade – which is most likely to happen here – or they build up an amount of stress that the system cannot handle, and we get an implosion,"" Johnson wrote. ""Users should always beware when yield is delivered in a token that represents the very system they’re interacting with. When that token falls out of favor, its price tends to plummet.""  Why use Conic?  Curve uses smart contracts to offer an efficient way to exchange stablecoins while maintaining low fees and low slippage, according to developer documents. Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform, which locks over $5 billion worth of Ethereum-based tokens on its platform.  Curve tokens (CRV) are issued as yield farming rewards to liquidity providers on Curve Finance, and can be converted into vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). Holding veCRV allows users to participate in platform governance, earn higher rewards and fees and receive airdrops.  The tokens are time-locked, meaning users are incentivized to lock their CRV for a long time to receive more veCRV and platform rewards. However, this mechanism effectively locks up liquidity, creating opportunity costs for users.  This is where protocols like Conic come into play, allowing users to gain exposure to, or provide liquidity to, the Curve ecosystem to get rewarded while not having to lock up their tokens for long time periods by depositing on Curve directly.

In the proposal, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications developer firm and Lido partner MixBytes announced it would stop developing and providing technical support to Lido on Polkadot and Kusama liquid staking protocols as of Aug. 1, 2023.  “The decision was made because of several challenges, including market conditions, protocol growth, limited capacity and priority alignment,” Kosta Zherebtsov, chief product officer of MixBytes and the author of the proposal, said.  Lido has become the DeFi world’s largest protocol with some $9 billion worth of digital assets locked on the platform. Its growth has come as investor demand for liquid staking has grown steadily.  Staking is a popular yield-earning strategy in the digital asset space, where crypto holders can lock up and delegate their tokens, such as ether (ETH), to secure proof-of-stake blockchains in exchange for a reward. With liquid staking, investors can keep their capital liquid and use their staked tokens as collateral by receiving derivatives.  Read more: Liquid Staking Replaces DeFi Lending as Second-Largest Crypto Sector  The proposal may affect some $25 million of assets. Data aggregator DefiLlama shows that investors have staked $22.3 million worth of DOT and $2.34 million of KSM, the native tokens of Polkadot and Kusama, on Lido.  Zherebtsov suggested halting acceptance of new DOT and KSM for liquid staking by March 15, and automatically unstaking tokens later in June, according to his proposed timeline.
