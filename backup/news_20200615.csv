42432089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hfh,1592263116,Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan's Stock Hits Record Low 1 Month After Halving,"Shares of Canaan Creative, one of the few publicly traded crypto miner manufacturers, plummeted below $2, their lowest after going public in November.      The Nasdaq-listed stock has been steadily falling since the bitcoin halving on May 11, according to data from Yahoo Finance. It closed at $1.98 at the end of the trading session Monday, down 3.9%.      The China-based crypto miner maker is trying to make a comeback after the halving damped demand for its machines and logistics disruptions caused by coronavirus hurt first-quarter sales.      Demand for crypto mining machines from some Chinese miners may have begun to soften a few months before the halving in May, said Aries Wang, co-founder of crypto exchange Bibox.      See also: Miners Are Selling More of Their Bitcoin. That May Actually Be Bullish      As early as last July “some of the earliest Chinese miners started to raise funding from institutional investors and buy new models and phase out old machines so that they would be prepared for the halving,” said Wang, whose company has invested in crypto mining businesses. “Many had already completed the update on infrastructure such as mining sites and miners before the end of February.”      Canaan tried to spur sales earlier this year by cutting prices in half, compared with 2019 average prices. However, it still suffered a $5.6 million net loss for the period, according to the latest quarterly report.      First-quarter sales were also affected by the coronavirus outbreak in China, according to the report. Logistics in mainland China had stopped around the Chinese new year on Feb 10. The firm couldn’t deliver machines to customers even as demand surged due to a price rally in bitcoin, Nangeng Zhang, CEO and chairman of Canaan, said on its first-quarter earnings call.      The firm enjoyed a rebound in April after China declared it had contained the spread of coronavirus and the logistics issues subsided. The stock reached $5.99 per share on May 13, two days after the halving, and has tumbled since then.      The halving, a preprogrammed event that cuts mining revenue by half every four years, previously had been considered bullish for miner makers.      See also: Chinese Chip Maker With a Hand in Crypto Mining Plans $2.8B IPO      The Chinese crypto miner manufacturer's Nov. 20 initial public offering (IPO) priced the stock at $9 per share, but a month afterward the shares were down by half. It was briefly back above $8 on Feb. 12 after a surge of more than 80% from $4.40 from the previous day. The price started to fall again as China rolled out coronavirus quarantine measures.      Canaan’s cash and cash equivalents on hand decreased by 48% in the first quarter, from $71 million as of the end of last year. The firm said the drop was partly due to $24.5 million in short-term investments including its partnership with Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), one of the largest computer chip makers from mainland China.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/15/bitcoin-miner-maker-canaans-stock-hits-record-low-1-month-after-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35d648da5a1fdc411f7433bf395ac4a6298bcfca-1500x1035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432101,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hzh,1592255994,US Supreme Court's Computer Fraud Ruling Has Big Implications for Crypto,"Andrew Hinkes is an attorney with Carlton Fields and is an adjunct professor at the New York University Stern School of Business and New York University School of Law.      This summer, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider how to interpret the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a key data protection law. The court’s decision could criminalize common but technically prohibited computer-related conduct, put limitations on a powerful law that punishes insider data theft and abuse like exchange hacks, or come down somewhere in the middle.      At issue in United States v. Van Buren is the interpretation of a provision of the CFAA, [18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C)], which makes it a federal crime to “access[] a computer without authorization or exceed[] authorized access,” and “thereby obtain[] information from any protected computer.” To “exceed[] authorized access” means “to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.”      See also: How Imposters Scam Entrepreneurs Out of Their Crypto      The case was initiated by a Georgia police officer, Nathan Van Buren, who was authorized to access and search a police database for law enforcement purposes but instead accessed that database to identify a person in exchange for payment by a private citizen. Van Buren was charged criminally with a violation of the CFAA.      Van Buren argued that “accessing [information] for an improper or impermissible purpose does not exceed authorized access as meant by” the CFAA. The government argued that “a defendant violates the CFAA not only when he obtains information that he has no ‘rightful[]’ authorization whatsoever to acquire, but also when he obtains information ‘for a nonbusiness purpose.’”      Van Buren was convicted at trial of violating the CFAA. On appeal, his conviction was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals based on United States v. Rodriguez, which holds that a person with access to a computer for business reasons “exceed[s] his authorized access” when he “obtain[s] ... information for a nonbusiness reason.”    This interpretation could also criminalize 51% attacks against public network blockchains.    Not all circuit courts of appeal interpret that provision of the CFAA the same way. The First, Fifth, Seventh and Eleventh Circuits have imposed liability where an authorized person accesses data on a system with authorization and exceeds that authorization by obtaining information for an improper purpose. The Second, Fourth and Ninth Circuits have ruled a person violates that portion of the CFAA only if he accesses information on a computer that he is prohibited from accessing for any reason.      Van Buren’s appeal asks the U.S. Supreme Court to decide on this split and determine “[w]hether a person who is authorized to access information on a computer for certain purposes violates [the CFAA] if he accesses the same information for an improper purpose.”    What's at stake    Resolving this conflict is important.      The position taken by the Eleventh Circuit may protect crypto users in case of insider theft. For example, if an insider at a crypto exchange has the right to access customer data or private keys and uses that access for an improper purpose (i.e. to sell that data on the dark web), that insider could be charged under the CFAA and subject to criminal penalties.      However, it has been argued this interpretation could criminalize common conduct such as operating ""March Madness"" betting pools on employer-owned computers in violation of company policies, and activities that are not illegal but are contractually prohibited such as lying about your height on an online dating site in violation of the website’s terms of service.      See also: JP Koning - The $10B Stablecoin Industry Has a Fraud Problem It’s Not Addressing      This broad interpretation has been attacked in Van Buren as problematic from a constitutional perspective on the grounds that it can transform a violation of a private agreement into a criminal offense and raise due process issues.      From a crypto perspective, the broad (11th Circuit) interpretation may suggest a trader on a crypto exchange who spoofs, churns or wash trades (actions that may violate applicable commodities law but which are rarely punished) may be subject to criminal liability under the CFAA if that activity violates the exchange’s terms of use. This interpretation could also criminalize 51% attacks against public network blockchains if a court viewed the consensus rules, software and work contributed by miners to form implied contracts that prohibit such conduct.      Under this broader interpretation, intermediaries such as exchanges or custodians that grant insiders access to valuable information may attempt to protect themselves and their information by updating their policies to expressly prohibit insiders from using that information for any non-business purpose. These companies may also seek to confirm that their insurance policies cover any potential violations.    The outcome could have big implications for the cryptocurrency industry which increasingly relies on legally enforceable privacy rights.    The narrower interpretation promoted by Van Buren would limit the application of the CFAA to access without authorization, regardless of use. This interpretation restricts the application of criminal penalties to conduct that is more like “traditional” hacking, and may reduce the possibility that minor violations of boilerplate agreements could be treated as federal crimes. This interpretation could limit claims against insiders who have the authority to access data and use that data for an improper purpose.      The CFAA can be a powerful weapon against hackers. It could allow civil parties to sue and enable prosecutors to seek criminal penalties, including potential incarceration of violators for up to five years. Limitations on the CFAA’s reach could deprive prosecutors of a tool to punish data breaches and insider attacks.      Like many other computer-related federal laws, the CFAA pre-dates the modern internet and is showing its age. Although there may be reason to suggest a modernization of the law to better fit the current internet- enabled business world, courts, parties and prosecutors alike continue to rely on the CFAA to protect computers, data and online assets. A variety of industries and interests, including the crypto world, should await the court’s verdict with interest. The outcome could have big implications for the cryptocurrency industry, which increasingly relies on legally enforceable privacy rights and the power of the law to ensure that intermediaries properly secure their customer’s digital assets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Andrew Hinkes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/15/us-supreme-courts-computer-fraud-ruling-has-big-implications-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0923971ff6da6e0316df7f35a532e75ad5b64dcc-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432096,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hvh,1592255914,US Air Force Gives Blockchain Firm $1.5M to Build Supply Chain Network,"SIMBA Chain, a blockchain-as-a-service company with deep ties to the Department of Defense, has two years and $1.5 million to research and develop a blockchain for supply chain logistics for the U.S. Air Force.      The South Bend, Ind., firm said on Monday it has entered Phase II of its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) USAF project with a renewed mandate to investigate blockchain’s military supply chain value propositions. It has also gained a new partner: Boeing.      SIMBA CEO Joel Neidig said his firm will “stand up” a node running Hyperledger Fabric at Oklahoma’s Tinker Air Force Base – a hub for Air Force supply chain logistics – with a special focus on risk management: knowing the what, where, who and how of parts that may one day go through the USAF’s $62 billion procurement machine.      That means anticipating and identifying areas in the supply chain that could one day break down. Neidig declined to state what Boeing parts the USAF will track in Phase II but did reiterate that it will use “real data.” A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.      Read more: Pentagon War Game Envisioned a Generation-Z Rebellion Funded by Bitcoin      Neidig offered Chinese-sourced computer chips as a future example for which the USAF could use the SIMBA Chain.      “There might be transistors or microprocessors and we're looking at how we mitigate that risk and see where the items are coming from,” he said.      The blockchain could help secure parts by documenting every relevant datapoint, a critical feature for the Armed Forces’ procurement gurus, according to Neidig. He said they think out their supply chains in ways civilians “don't even take into consideration.”      “Within the military they’re also thinking about how people are sharing data, where it is coming from, where else is it connected to. They think out all the things that can go wrong, and that's where blockchain can come in,” he said.      A USAF press officer did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.    Blockchain in the Air Force    SIMBA Chain has been investigating blockchain on the military’s behalf since receiving seed funding for a crypto chat app from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2017. Since then, the platform, a project of Indiana Technology and Manufacturing Companies, has entered into multiple SBIR contracts with the Navy as well as the Air Force.      The company has become an advocate for blockchain utilization in the military supply chain, an expansive network of thousands of parts worth billions of dollars moving across tens of borders every day. Last month, SIMBA Chain co-wrote a private sector white paper hailing blockchain-enhanced supply chains.      Read more: US Military Is Falling Behind China, Russia in Blockchain Arms Race: IBM, Accenture      The USAF’s need to securely track its billion-dollar parts network has only gotten more complex with the introduction of additive manufacturing. Commonly known as 3D printing, the process promises to allow warfighters to print whatever they may need while deployed, according to Jeffrey Slayton, director of Special Programs, Strategy and Policy for the USAF.      “Emerging technologies like SIMBA Chain's blockchain platform have the potential to achieve the reliable exchange of information over an unreliable network where not all participants can be trusted, and in so doing, continue to advance the technological supremacy of America's air, space and cyber forces,"" Slayton said in the press statement.      SIMBA Chain could also help the military get ahead of problems that may arise with the proliferation of new technologies, like artificial intelligence and machine learning, which can draw analysis from reams of data – assuming that data is legitimate, Neidigl said. That’s where blockchain can come in.      “We’re supplying that trust layer, the data integrity,” Neidigl said. “We need to have a great foundation of trusted transactions before we start ingesting data into AI.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/15/us-air-force-gives-blockchain-firm-15m-to-build-supply-chain-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/041aff01f7e5ff993629e880770310c32bdf600a-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,426 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining less than a percent over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Monday (8:00 p.m. Sunday EDT), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,327 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. It then dipped 5% to as low as $8,895 before picking back up to over $9,300. The price is now above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator.      “Bitcoin is trading off with other asset classes, having suffered a loss of short-term momentum,” said Katie Stockton, lead analyst for Fairlead Strategies. “There is room to short-term oversold territory, but no support has been broken. The neutral consolidation phase is intact, in my work, as long as bitcoin is above the 200-day moving average, about $8,340, and below resistance near $10,055.”      Read More: Bitcoin Price Drop May Be a Bear Trap, Options Market Suggests      Traders say traditional markets seem to be taking the lead these days. “Our actual concern at the moment is the correlation between equities and gold,” Singapore-based quantitative trading firm QCP Capital wrote in an investor note Monday. “If both start trading lower in tandem, which happened prior to Black Thursday in March and also before the Thursday sell-off last week, it could be a strong signal for BTC to trade a leg lower as well.”      Indeed, both bitcoin and the S&P 500 saw similar movements on June 10’s drop across most markets. Gold has held its own throughout the year, with the exception of March’s decline.      That bitcoin’s performance is matching stocks of late concerns George Clayton of Cryptanalysis Capital. “The correlation with stocks is continuing,” he told CoinDesk. “That’s negative for crypto right now.”      Read More: JPMorgan Analysts: Bitcoin Is Likely to Survive (as a Speculative Asset)      The market may seem weak right now but it could be worse, said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. “An interesting point is that miners do not appear to be selling. Otherwise, we would have seen the market significantly lower.”      A look at the market for options with June expiration shows where some traders see the price heading. According to data collected from aggregator Skew, bitcoin has a 90% probability of being over $7,500, yet only a 13% chance of hitting $10,500 for the month of June.      Thomas said the sweet spot for bitcoin is around the $8,000 range going forward. “I think we may drift a bit over the next few days and week, perhaps make a new leg lower into the $8,000 territory,” he said. “There are a lot of buyers and sellers sitting on the sidelines waiting.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the red Monday.

Moreover, open interest made a new all-time high on six consecutive days from June 5-10.      Significant growth in CME futures points to rapidly growing interest by institutional investors in trading regulated bitcoin derivatives products. Despite this growth, however, CME Group “has no plans to introduce additional cryptocurrency products,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Thus for now, CME Group’s cryptocurrency products will only involve bitcoin.      CME, which launched its bitcoin options product only at the beginning of 2020, now represents over 20% of the global bitcoin options market measured by open interest, or the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. It’s now the second-largest bitcoin options market in the world behind Panama-based Deribit, according to Skew.      See also: Crypto Derivatives Exchange OKEx Launches Options on Ether      Growth in CME’s bitcoin options market is “a strong signal that regulated institutions are exposing their books to bitcoin,” said Matt Kaye, managing partner at Los Angeles-based Blockhead Capital. “CME has a higher cost of capital and is closed on weekends, so anyone trading there is likely making those sacrifices because they have to.”      Much of CME’s growth appears to have come at the expense of Deribit. Market shares claimed by competing bitcoin derivatives markets LedgerX, Bakkt and OKEx have remained largely unchanged since January.

42432098,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9i3h,1592245370,"Inactive Bitcoin Supply Reaches 4-Year High, Pointing to Bullish Sentiment","On-chain data indicates crypto investors aren’t taking profits but are holding on despite uncertain economic conditions and bitcoin’s strong performance.      At the time of publication, 60.63% of all bitcoins have not moved in at least a year, according to data from Glassnode. This data suggests bitcoin ownership is consolidating, and investors who bought at the cycle bottom in 2018 have been reluctant to take profits and relinquish their bitcoin holdings. It’s been over four years since a percentage of supply this large has been inactive.      One method to analyze inactive bitcoins has been to group them by the length of time they’ve been inactive. Called “HODL Waves,” this data analysis was pioneered by Austin, Texas-based Unchained Capital to display macroscopic shifts in bitcoin ownership and use. It may also give a sense of investor preferences.      Read more: Number of Bitcoins on Crypto Exchanges Hits 18-Month Low      Each wave — one day, one month, six months, two years, five years, etc. — represents the period of time in which a percentage of the issued supply has not been used in a transaction, or, in other words, has been inactive.      The term “HODL” represents the behaviour of die-hard bitcoin investors who chose to hold bitcoins with practically no intention of using or selling those coins. Thus, each wave visualizes what percentage of the bitcoin supply has been “HODLed” and for how long.      Dhruv Bansal, co-founder and CSO at Unchained Capital, explained that this HODL Wave data suggests investors “who bought bitcoin on the way down from $6,000 to $3,000 in 2018 are still holding it despite the tremendous gains since then and the recent economic turbulence.”      Read more: Another Data Point Suggests Bitcoin Close to Prolonged Bull Market      Curiously, the two age segments that have grown the most are coins held for more than 10 years and those held for two to three years, which are up 31% and 26% year to date, respectively. In 2020, the two- to three-year band represents coins held from the 2017 market all-time high to present.      Every bitcoin investor might not intentionally HODL though. Speculating on the two- to three-year band wave’s growth, Yassine Elmandjra, cryptocurrency analyst at ARK Investment Management, told CoinDesk his “guess” is growth in this coin age group could, among other things, be a function of retail investors “who bought at the peak and lost their Trezor [wallet] or can’t log into Coinbase.”      Despite an extremely volatile Q1 2020 and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, an increasing amount of dormant bitcoins confirms that buyers still believe in their investment more than ever.      According to Bansal, “If you believe bitcoin's price history repeats or at least rhymes, then this may be a bullish sign, the market consolidating into strong hands as macro trends highlight bitcoin's value proposition.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/15/inactive-bitcoin-supply-reaches-4-year-high-pointing-to-bullish-sentiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7eb45b772aa37c96c0d7ab87acdcbc991cf667b-1500x1008.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revealing twin policy changes in an email sent to users and obtained by CoinDesk Monday, the mobile bank said it will cede its status as the “legal owner” of Revolut's five available cryptos – bitcoin, ether, litecoin, XRP and bitcoin cash – over to its clients who purchase them next month.      There is a catch, though: that crypto still cannot leave Revolut’s client ecosystem.      Users “can’t transfer cryptocurrency to anyone who is not a Revolut customer,” the updated terms and conditions read, detailing that while users “have complete control” of their crypto, they “will not be able to carry out transactions” themselves.      Revolut is also ending crypto card payments, one of the few ways its users could use their crypto outside the ecosystem.      While Revolut did not expressly allow customers to pay for goods using crypto under the old policy, they were able to do so if their accounts only held cryptocurrencies, with the bank exchanging crypto for fiat on its customers’ behalf. Revolut plans to suspend this ability on July 27.      The policy changes will let Revolut expand its crypto features, the bank said in its statement to users. A representative did not respond to CoinDesk requests for comment by press time.      Revolut has recently been expanding its crypto offerings and also its global presence: it entered the U.S. market in March.

42411951,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhJfb,1592243710,0x (ZRX),"0x is an open-source protocol built on the ethereum blockchain that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of ethereum-based tokens. It is also referred to as a decentralized exchange (DEX).  The 0x platform provides a means of exchanging a variety of tokenized assets such as stocks, gold, real estate, video game items, etc. and seeks to promote interoperability between decentralized applications (dapps) which include exchange components.  Will Warren and Amir Bandeali co-founded 0x in 2016 with the intention of providing a standard protocol on the ethereum blockchain that allows any ethereum token to be traded as well as for anyone to operate a decentralized exchange (DEX). The parties operating the exchanges and building on top of 0x are referred to as relayers, and they host off-chain order books and can choose to charge fees for their work, though 0x does not require users to pay fees to utilize its platform.  0x’s own ethereum token (ZRX) has two main use cases within the protocol. The first is for paying trading fees to Relayers for their services. The second and most important use is to enable ZRX token owners to influence the blockchain’s governance. This means that the owners have authority, proportional to their holdings, to provide input as to how the protocol should be developed over time.  How does 0x work?  Vision  0x is an ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) meant for trading assets and cryptocurrencies using smart contracts on the 0x platform. The 0x platform was founded in 2016 by Will Warren and Amir Bandeali with the intention of providing a standard protocol on the ethereum blockchain that facilitates the exchange of any ethereum token.  0x protocol’s native token (ZRX) is used for two primary reasons. The first is to pay fees to the Relayers - those who create a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange using 0x protocol. The second use case is for the decentralized governance of the protocol. This means that those who hold ZRX tokens are given complete control as to how the 0x protocol changes over time.  Launch & issuance  0x completed its initial coin offering (ICO) on July 16, 2017 and raised $24 million in ether - the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network - from a group of 12,000 backers.  The majority of the support for this project came from venture capitalist firms, including Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital, along with Chinese investment firms Jen Advisors and FBG Capital.  Network Design & Security Model  0x is built on the ethereum protocol. The main issues that 0x aims to address are the costliness, slowness and illiquidity of other decentralized exchanges. Rather than recording every transaction (new orders and adjustments) on the blockchain the 0x protocol waits for all transactions to be settled off the blockchain before sending the orders on-chain to be settled.  Monetary Policy & Token Policy  0x has capped the ZRX supply at 1 billion tokens. 500 million ZRX tokens were sold to the public through an initial coin offering for a total of $24 million dollars worth of ETH.  Transaction Processing  According to the 0x white paper, the fixed supply of ZRX tokens are issued to partnering dapps and future end users. In order for the relayers to get paid in ZRX tokens, they must host and maintain and order book off-chain in exchange for transaction fees. These fees are moved from the maker and/or taker of the smart contracts to the relayer upon settlement of a trade.  Coding  0x is implemented through an ethereum smart contract that is free and accessible to the public. The protocol is written in the Solidity programming language.",NEUTRAL,ETH | ZRX,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/0x-zrx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/893168a8b36983865fa4ee5867e4615f315e7640-1500x878.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hZh,1592242208,Business Is Booming for DeFi Insurer Nexus Mutual Ahead of Ethereum 2.0,"Nexus Mutual, an alternative insurance provider for a variety of Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, has seen its risk pool double over the past 90 days to more than $4 million.      Indeed, Nexus can barely keep up with the demand for smart-contract cover in the exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) arena.      “We are in this position where there are lots of people that want heaps of cover, but we don’t quite have enough assets to cover everything we would like to right now,” said Nexus Mutual CEO and founder Hugh Karp. “So it’s a good problem to have and we’re working on it.”      The recent boost has been due to a few large covers, especially on Balancer, a newly launched protocol that is offering bonuses for people providing liquidity. Other significant deals for Nexus stem from DeFi platforms Aave and Compound.      Stepping back, the London-based Nexus may be using bleeding-edge tech but the mutual insurance model dates back to the 17th century and potentially aligns the interests of participants better than today’s profit-maximizing insurance firms.      Nexus is exploiting an unregulated pocket within the British insurance sector called a “discretionary mutual,” where members have no contractual obligations to pay claims. As a provider of insurance, the platform recently proved to be worth its salt, however, making its first payout following an exploit of the smart contract code of DeFi lender bZx.      Read more: DeFi Insurance Firm Nexus Mutual Makes Its First Payout Following bZx Attacks      The way Nexus works is members of the mutual join by purchasing NXM tokens that allow them to participate in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). All decisions are voted on by members, who are incentivized to pay genuine claims.      “DeFi is expanding rapidly so I’m expecting the number of yield-bearing options to increase exponentially over the next few years,” said Karp.“DeFi users want the returns available, but want to avoid the smart-contract risk. A new protocol wants liquidity, so they offer some bonus to enhance yield, and more professional users take out Nexus cover to access yield safely.”      Two areas Nexus is updating to help it scale are risk assessment and pricing. Karp said members are about to vote on the changes, and the upgrades should go live in about a week.      Risk assessors effectively choose and price the risks that Nexus Mutual covers, said Karp, which should encourage more participants and ultimately enable more cover to be provided to the wider DeFi ecosystem.      “We’re also updating the pricing mechanism to be simpler but also more flexible. It’s another step towards our vision of allowing Nexus to take on any type of risk, like a super-efficient Lloyd’s of London,” he said.    Eth 2.0 looms    Nexus sees plenty of opportunity in Ethereum’s gradual transition to Eth 2.0, which is expected to begin sometime later this year. Eth 2.0 moves the network from its more energy-hungry Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a method of staking cryptocurrency in order to keep the network afloat.      Earning a steady yield from staking ether (ETH), is somewhat comparable to the way insurance firms in the real world invest the premiums they collect.      Traditional insurers tend to invest the majority of their funds in relatively low-risk, yield-bearing assets – such as government bonds, high-grade corporate bonds and infrastructure investments, which ideally have a similar cash flow to future expected claim payments.      Read more: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0      “From our point of view, [Eth 2.0 staking] will be very interesting because we want to earn investment returns from the float,” said Karp, referring to the risk pool of capital held by Nexus. “We hold a chunk of ETH so we will be able to start staking that and earning a return, which is obviously very important for insurance entities.”      Once staking commences on Ethereum, the Nexus DAO can delegate a large portion of its assets to Eth 2.0 staking, which is “conceptually comparable to a very highly rated government bond and therefore will be very well suited to Nexus from a risk perspective,” Karp said.      DeFi also has the ability for yield to be “stacked,” where one yield-bearing token is deposited into another protocol where it earns additional yield. This comes with additional risks, noted Karp, and must be carefully managed, but Nexus will also look to take advantage of yield stacking, which is something that is not readily available in the regular financial world.      “The medium-term goal for Nexus is to start earning something like 5% on the $4 million float,” which Karp said would likely be a few months after Ethereum’s beacon chain launch in the latter half of this year.      “We are quite likely to purchase a tokenized version of staked ETH, which we are expecting will become available soon after the beacon chain launch,” he said. “That token would earn staking returns immediately and not require Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0 being merged yet.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/15/business-is-booming-for-defi-insurer-nexus-mutual-ahead-of-ethereum-20,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb44eb99dc1e543a5769b83e9900770582843f78-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Whoever cracks it will be tapping into the largest underserved segment in the world,” Callon-Butler said.    Market intel    Bear Tracks Back?

42432093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hth,1592229005,Mining Pools Distribute $2.4M Transaction Fee After Flood of Phoney Refund Claims [Updated],"UPDATE (June 16. 08:50 UTC): This article has been updated with a note from Spark Pool, which has decided to distribute transaction fees to its miners.      Two mining pools have called time on waiting any longer for an ether whale to reach out after making two transactions with unusually high fees worth in the millions of dollars last week.      Bitfly, the company behind the Ethermine pool, announced Monday it had opted to distribute a total of 10,668 ETH (now worth just under $2.4 million) in transaction fee to miners that were active at the time the transaction went through last Thursday.      ""As the sender of the transaction ... has not contacted us after 4 days we have made the final decision to distribute the tx fee to the miners of our pool,"" Bitfly tweeted. ""Given the amount involved we believe 4 days is sufficient time for the sender to get in touch with us.""      Chinese mining pool Spark Pool has also now said that it will distribute its $2.6 million transaction fee out to its members. ""The legitimate sender of the transaction has not yet contacted us to provide a validating signature to prove their identity,"" the company said. ""We have, therefore, decided to distribute the transaction fees to Ethereum miners working on that day.""      On Wednesday, Spark Pool processed a transaction from a single address with a hefty ETH balance, who sent a minuscule 0.55 ETH (then worth $133) with a transaction fee worth $2.6 million at the time. Barely a day later, at approximately 04:00 UTC on Thursday morning, the same address sent 350 ETH with another fee, also worth $2.6 million.      When the network's running smoothly, the average fee for an ether transaction hovers around the $0.50 mark. Two transactions would, therefore, cost about $1. But in total this single wallet holder, who has not been identified, dished out over $5.2 million in fees for just these two transactions.      Spark Pool, which has been through this before, froze the transaction to give the sender time to reach out and work on a deal to reclaim some of the transaction fees. After it happened again, less than a day later, Ethermine followed suit and gave the sender a grace period to get in touch.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Pool Poolin Partners With BlockFi to Expand Crypto Lending Service      But that hasn't happened. Bitfly said it had instead received requests from, ""multiple people [who] claimed being the sender of this transaction, [but] none of them was able to produce a valid signature of the sending account.""      Perhaps flagging from the volume of phony requests, the company has ruled out freezing transaction fees like this ever again, regardless of how much the fee might be.      ""In the future, we will no longer interfere in the payout of large tx fees,"" they tweeted. ""Our advertised payout policy is to always distribute the full block reward and we will be sticking to that independent on the amount involved.""      Spark Pool has said it will distribute the transaction fee out to the miners who were active on that day, based on a snapshot of miner hash rate that will be taken on Wednesday at 07:30 UTC – exactly seven days after processing the mysterious transaction.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | MINING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/15/mining-pools-distribute-24m-transaction-fee-after-flood-of-phoney-refund-claims-updated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08db6cfa5e1592063367cb8418ebb303bccd1277-1500x992.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Korea's Central Bank Forms Legal Panel to Advise on Possible Digital Currency Launch,"South Korea's central bank is moving ahead with research into digital currencies as it sets up a legal panel to advise on possible regulatory sticking points.      Per an article in The Korea Times on Monday, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said the six-person panel, comprised of legal experts in the financial and IT sectors, as well as one specializing in fintech, would provide guidance and advice to the bank as it develops and tests a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      ""We established the advisory group to discuss legal issues surrounding a CBDC and figure out which laws need to be revised or enacted for smooth progress in the BOK's possible issuance of digital currency,"" a BOK official told Korea Times.      See also: South Korea’s Central Bank Is Building a New Blockchain System for the Bond Market      This is the next phase in the BOK's rapid reappraisal of CBDCs. In December, when it set up its task force to look into digital currencies, it said it was more to ""keep an eye"" on what other countries were doing rather than to create something themselves.      But that changed in April when other countries including Japan and the U.S. began moving faster than originally anticipated. Abandoning its wait-and-see-approach, the BOK jumped into a 22-month pilot program to develop and test a new CBDC that could be used to replace physical cash.      While the BOK is keeping its cards close to its chest, it has dropped a few hints. It appears the proposed CBDC, as it looks like now, would piggyback off the settlement systems they and other central banks use to enable high-value transfers between financial institutions.      Last Friday, Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol described it as ""noteworthy"" that central banks appeared to be developing digital payments systems on top of their real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) – interbank payment networks – ""to reduce settlement risk.""

""The currently ongoing research and development on central bank digital currency must be carried out as planned,"" he added.

42404690,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkE2o,1592220607,"First Mover: Cardano's No Ethereum Killer Yet, but It's Winning in Crypto Markets","As Ethereum pushes slowly toward a new type of blockchain technology that some cryptocurrency experts predict could represent the future of decentralized finance, the upstart competitor Cardano is getting ready to go live.      And Cardano’s digital token, ADA, is soaring this year in digital-asset markets on speculation the project’s early embrace of a “proof-of-stake” blockchain might put it in a stronger position to challenge the much-larger Ethereum network.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Prices for ADA have climbed over 120% this year, the second-best performance among digital assets with a market value of at least $1 billion. It’s trouncing the 80% year-to-date gains for ether (ETH), the Ethereum network’s native cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is up 31% in 2020.      The goal for Cardano, similar to Ethereum’s, is to build a massive, decentralized computing network that millions of people, businesses and governments could someday use to run financial applications from anywhere in the world. And while the Ethereum blockchain’s native token, ether, currently has a commanding lead in the competition, with a $26.3 billion market capitalization that’s 13 times the size of ADA’s, the smaller challenger might be poised to win a growing share of the fast-moving industry.      The recent catalyst for ADA’s price rally appears to be Cardano’s progress toward a key upgrade of its network known as “Shelley,” scheduled to go live over the next month.      Cardano launched its token in early 2017, but that version was “federated,” or managed more centrally. The Shelley upgrade aims to make Cardano “50 to 100 times more decentralized than other large blockchain networks,” according to the supporting foundation’s website, using proof-of-stake blockchain technology that is seen as more efficient than the electricity-hungry proof-of-work system used by the Bitcoin blockchain. A testnet of Shelley launched on June 9.      Ethereum is moving to shift to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work as part of a “2.0” upgrade, but backers of that project have only stipulated that the transition will begin by September and then be phased in over stages.      “We believe Cardano’s recent price appreciation is partially related to the anticipation of their mainnet launch,” Guy Hirsch, managing director of multi-asset brokerage eToro, told CoinDesk. “If the team working on the project fails to deliver what was proposed, then the market might react negatively.”      Cryptocurrencies tied to staking have been among the hottest this year in digital-asset markets, partly because holders can earn rewards akin to interest – especially prized as the world’s biggest central banks have slashed interest rates to accommodate economies racked by the coronavirus and related lockdowns. Another staking token, Tezos (XTZ), is up 93% this year.      According to the Cardano website, investors can receive 10% a year in “delegation rewards” from staking ADA.      Some cryptocurrency investors see the Shelley upgrade as little more than an opportunity for Cardano to hype itself. The giant U.S. digital-asset exchange Coinbase already offers Tezos staking, and custodian Staked lists eight different digital assets allowing users to earn a return simply for holding them.      “I'm personally short on ADA currently,” Mostafa Al-Mashita, vice president of digital liquidity firm Secure Digital Markets, said via a Telegram chat. “We do trade it for our clients. I think the Shelley upgrade will be another case of, ‘Buy the rumor, sell the news.’”  Cardano’s charismatic leader is Charles Hoskinson, who marshals the project as co-founder of his own five-year-old engineering company, IOHK. And he might be perfectly equipped, based on his prior work experience, to take on Ethereum: He was an Ethereum co-founder before leaving in 2014.      Hoskinson posted a roadmap on Twitter showing that full staking via the Shelley upgrade would be available by August 18.      “Cardano has very high potential in my opinion,” Michael Gord, CEO of GDA Capital, a firm that trades various cryptocurrencies, including ADA and ether. In the race to build a computing platform for applications designed to run on decentralized networks, he said, “it’s the only blockchain that is challenging ether as the potential No. 1 operating layer.”      Yet, in crucial ways, Cardano lags far behind Ethereum.      Cardano doesn’t plan to add smart contract programming – the key to building decentralized applications, known as dapps – until a subsequent phase; Ethereum already offers the functionality. According to the website DeFi Pulse, 19 of the top 20 dapps by volume are using the Ethereum network, and the remaining dapp is on the Lightning Network, which is associated with the Bitcoin blockchain.      Among open-source software developers, Ethereum garners far more attention. Some 28 people are active on the IOHK GitHub, where the Cardano node and wallet open source software is hosted, versus 61 people working on open-source repositories on Ethereum's GitHub.      In digital-asset markets, Cardano registers little more than a blip compared with the Ethereum network, already used as the backbone for dollar-linked stablecoins like tether and USDC, as well as early-generation decentralized exchanges and lending platforms.      Ether’s liquidity at $594 million per day is about 10 times ADA’s, according to Messari, a provider of data on digital assets.      “Replicating Ethereum's developer footprint and network effects is nearly impossible for a smaller network today, and probably value destructive for the crypto ecosystem,” Lex Sokolin, global fintech co-head at the Ethereum-focused software-engineering firm ConsenSys, told CoinDesk in an email.      One thing the competing projects have in common is high-profile leaders: Where Ethereum has Vitalik Buterin, Hoskinson provides the charismatic presence for Cardano’s development.      He frequently conducts live ""ask me anything"" sessions on YouTube, interspersing discussions of the Shelley release with musings on meditation, fasting and picking radishes in his garden.      He can be brusque with questioners he feels are unprepared or less informed. In a surprise AMA session on June 9, Hoskinson told one community member, “I will answer your questions if your questions are new, but if your questions have been answered previously, you need to pay attention.”      Admirers say he’s merely doing his job of taking Cardano to the next level.      “Thanks to Charles Hoskinson, Cardano enjoys some of the same audience and hype that has carried Ethereum into the upper echelons of the industry,” said Edward DeLeon Hickman, founder of Anatha, a startup building its own blockchain.      In a recent interview with Hoskinson, he acknowledged how little control he has over the market for ADA tokens.  “Sometimes the market just values something differently, and you just accept that as reality, because you can’t really fight the market, and then you just do your best to try to work within the constraints of a broken system,” Hoskinson told CoinDesk in a recent interview.      Traders seem more willing than ever to take a view on Cardano as a cryptocurrency. And gains this year in the ADA token may represent a bet on the ability of network's leader to execute the project roadmap.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,107 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,441 | 24-Hr Low: $8,910      Trend: Bitcoin fell to three-week lows below $9,000 earlier on Monday and may be looking at further losses as technical charts have turned bearish.      To start with, the 14-day relative strength index has dipped below 50, confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength, is beginning to produce deeper bars below the zero line. That implies that the downward move may be about to pick up the pace.      On the downside, key support is located at $8,630 (May 25 low). A breach there would invalidate the bullish higher-lows pattern and may invite stronger chart driven selling. Below $8,630, the focus would shift to the 200-day moving average (MA) at $8,000.      So far, however, downside has been restricted near $8,900. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $9,089, representing a 2.7% decline on the day.      While the daily chart indicators are biased bearish, the longer duration charts are still calling a move to the higher side. Notably, the weekly chart RSI is hovering in bullish territory above 50 and the 10-week MA is still trending north in favor of the bulls.      As a result, a fresh move to $10,000 cannot be ruled out. The probability of a move higher would improve if prices hold above $9,000 through the U.S. trading hours.      The options market is also suggesting losses may be limited, with the put-call volume ratio having risen to three-month highs.",POSITIVE,ADA | ETH,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Daniel Cawrey, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/15/first-mover-cardanos-no-ethereum-killer-yet-but-its-winning-in-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6f218a3e6c3ccaf86c2c0da944cd9b6212b2ce1-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to a sell-off in stocks and increased miner hoarding is a sign the market lacks strength.    Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity on Monday alongside losses in the traditional markets.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,080, representing a 2.7% decline on the day. Prices hit a three-week low of $8,910 during the early European trading hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 are down over 2.5% and major Asian and European equity market indices are in the red red, apparently over fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections in China.      The decline in bitcoin prices, however, could be short-lived, options market data suggests.      While bitcoin looks to be tracking equities lower, the top cryptocurrency’s put-call volume ratio has risen to three-month highs. At 1.79, the ratio currently stands at the highest value since the markets crash on March 12, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

""A put-call ratio above 1 is considered to be an indicator of a selloff while a put-call ratio below 1 is an opportunity to buy,"" as per Investopedia.      However, when the ratio gets too high (extreme bearishness), the market is considered to be ready for a reversal higher, and when the ratio is too low, the market is considered close to topping out.      In bitcoin’s case, a reading above 1.7 could be considered too high. In the past, the ratio has breached that level only two times. Further, on both occasions, prices bottomed out on the same day or the following day.      The put-call volume ratio rose to a high of 1.89 on March 12, when the cryptocurrency fell by nearly 40%. On the following day, prices bottomed out at $3,867.      Similarly, the cryptocurrency bottomed out near $6,500 in mid-December with the put-call ratio rising to levels around 2.00.      As such, the latest reading of 1.79 could be considered an advance warning of an impending bear trap – more so, as the put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of open put options relative to open call options, recently hit a 14-month low of 0.40.      “The divergence between the put-call volume and the decreasing put-call open interest implies that a lot of the put positions have been closed out on profit-taking,” according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      Validating Thomas' argument is the recent decline in the one-month put-call skew from 9.4% to 6.3%. The put-call skew measures the price of puts relative to that of calls. The decline, therefore, represents a recovery in demand for (bullish) call options.      Meanwhile, the three-and six-month skews are also hovering in the negative territory, implying stronger demand for call options expiring in the September and December expiry contracts.      That said, options market positioning is known to change quickly and the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to potential deeper sell-off in the equity markets.      “The key thing to watch over the next few weeks is the Covid related equities sell off. If markets react very negatively towards the increased Covid cases, we may see more panic which could also pull bitcoin lower,” said Thomas.      In addition, bitcoin’s network statistics are painting a bearish picture and the cryptocurrency’s ""fair value"" looks to be below $7,000, according to Atlantic House fund manager and ByteTree founder Charlie Morris.      Miners, in particular, have accumulated inventory over the past seven days, selling less coins than they generated.      Miners often hoard coins when they feel the market lacks the strength to absorb further sales, as discussed earlier this month.

42404686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDys,1592212723,Encrypted Messaging Site Privnote Cloned to Steal Bitcoin,"Privnote, a free web service that lets users send encrypted messages that self-destruct once read, has been copied with the reported aim of redirecting users' bitcoin to criminals.      In a Sunday post on cybersecurity blog KrebsonSecurity, journalist Brian Krebs warned users of a phishing scam that lures unsuspecting victims to a near-identical version of the privnote.com website known as privnotes.com.      However, the fake site doesn't fully encrypt messages, as Krebs discovered in tests, and can ""read and/or modify all messages sent by users.""      Just as worrying, it contains a script that hunts out messages containing bitcoin addresses and changes the original address into the bad actor's own address in the sent message. This would mean any funds sent would arrive at the bitcoin address owned by the criminal, not the one intended by the message sender.      ""Any messages containing bitcoin addresses will be automatically altered to include a different bitcoin address, as long as the Internet addresses of the sender and receiver of the message are not the same,"" Krebs said in the post.      ""Until recently, I couldn’t quite work out what Privnotes was up to, but today it became crystal clear,"" he said.      Krebs explained he'd been notified by the owners of privnote.com that someone had built a clone version of their site and that it was tricking users of the legitimate site.      See also: Crypto Scams Targeting Pacific Communities on the Rise, Say New Zealand Regulators      ""It’s not hard to see why: Privnotes.com is confusingly similar in name and appearance to the real thing, and comes up second in Google search results for the term “privnote.” Also, anyone who mistakenly types “privnotes” into Google search may see at the top of the results a misleading paid ad for “Privnote” that actually leads to privnotes.com,"" Krebs wrote.      A quick Google search by CoinDesk verified this finding.      Making the scam harder to spot, the self-destructing nature of these messages means victims are unable to go back and check on the bitcoin addresses the script alters: they are sent, read and deleted. According to Allison Nixon, chief research officer at Unit 221B, who helped identify and test the phishing scam, said the script appears to only alter the first instance of a bitcoin address if it's repeated within a message.      ""The type of people using privnote aren’t the type of people who are going to send that bitcoin wallet any other way for verification purposes,” Nixon said in the post. “It’s a pretty smart scam.”      See also: FBI Warns COVID-19 Scammers Are Targeting Crypto Holders      Bitcoin-related scams have been on the rise in recent months, particularly with concerns relating the coronavirus pandemic.

42404685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDwu,1592208137,"India's Rumored Crypto Ban May Be Overblown, Say Industry Pros","Rumors that India might be considering a new ban on crypto may be premature, according to exchange founders and startup CEOs working in the sector.      Indian news site The Economic Times created a stir Friday by suggesting lawmakers in India, where the Supreme Court overturned a punitive banking ban from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) only four months ago, were planning on slapping a new ban on crypto companies.      The article, titled ""With a law, India plans lasting ban on crypto,"" cited one unnamed ""senior government official"" who told The Economic Times, ""A note [presumably on crypto] has been moved (by the finance ministry) for inter-ministerial consultations.""      The article doesn't provide any information on what the note could be but says it was spurred on by the Supreme Court ruling, which allowed crypto exchanges to finally access banking services after nearly two years stuck in the wilderness.      The article said the government could lean on a previous government draft law, from July 2019, that proposed all forms of cryptocurrency be banned, with anyone caught holding them facing up a fine and up to 10 years imprisonment.      But is there any substance to this?      Well, the report in question relates to one published by a government panel, chaired by former Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg. While the report recognizes blockchain technology is an ""important new and innovative technology,"" it notes, ""with serious concern,"" that the use of cryptocurrencies in India is ""mushrooming"" at an alarming rate.      Highlighting that many crypto assets don't have any intrinsic value and supporting the RBI ban, the report concludes: ""The Committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalising carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India.""      The only exception, they say, would be a digital currency issued by the state itself.      See also: India’s Central Bank Plans to Fight Supreme Court Crypto Ruling      Speaking to CoinDesk, Nischal Shetty, the founder and CEO of WazirX, a local exchange acquired by Binance late last year, said a blanket ban on crypto wasn't what he was seeing.      ""This is all leaked information,"" Shetty said. ""There is movement for sure, but no one has been able to get clarity on whether it specifically talks about a ban, or whether it talks about just moving forward with regulation. There are a lot of assumptions.""      Based on his own government sources, Shetty said he believes the Finance Ministry is consulting with other government departments to determine what the next regulatory step should be.      ""I've personally met people in government, right, ministers in Parliament, and what I've seen is they've been very positive about regulating,"" Shetty said. ""Some of them have been very vocal that a ban is not the solution because they understand technology ... they understand that banning a technology is not a solution.""      The original draft bill from the Garg committee – which has long since been wound up – is still floating in the Finance Ministry and Shetty agrees it could form part of the ""default content"" when determining how to move forward with crypto regulation.      ""Someone from the Finance Ministry has proposed that they should consider looking into cryptocurrencies and figuring out what to do, either to ban it, or to regulate it,"" Shetty said, as the lifting of the RBI ban has made this a priority for officials. ""[The government] wants to see progress and regulations,"" he added.      But, he points out, the idea of reaching out to other departments is in order to take in other viewpoints. Citing Bloomberg Quint's appraisal of the note, Shetty highlighted: ""if in any way, they [the Finance Ministry] get pushback that a ban is not the right way approach, then they would set up another committee, which would explore [crypto] regulation.""      ""I see this as a positive step,"" he continued, ""there is no clarity in India today. It's a good thing that someone is taking the initiative.""      See also: Indian Crypto Exchange Adds Bank Transfers Hours After RBI Ban Lifted      Shetty's thoughts have been echoed elsewhere.      A spokesperson for the Bangalore-based exchange CoinSwitch said, ""the report has no mention of the particular government body responsible for such actions or contains quotes from reliable sources. As such there is a lack of clarity and until further details reveal we would carefully monitor the situation.""      Similarly, Sumit Gupta, the co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, one of the country's largest exchanges, told CoinDesk in an email that ""reconsidering past bills is likely part of the process of forming clearer regulations around the use of cryptocurrencies within India.""      Gupta noted the lifting of the RBI ban has led to record trading volumes and user adoption, calling recent growth in the sector ""unprecedented.""      CoinTelegraph reported earlier this week there has been a flurry of new exchanges launching in India, as well as a wave of outside investment from global players, including OKEx and Binance.      ""Given the previous open-mindedness of government officials and regulators in the Supreme Court case, where they were willing to engage with cryptocurrency sector leaders in dialogue about the future of the industry – we are confident that a similarly communicative approach will be taken in making this decision,"" Gupta said.      See also: India’s Central Bank Removes Lingering Confusion Over Banking for Crypto Firms      Among some of the existing industry players in India's crypto scene, a consensus is building around starting more formal dialogues with officials. There's already an active crypto-related trade body within the Internet and Mobile Association of India, which helped challenge the RBI ban.      Shetty said WazirX was looking at creating a self-regulatory framework.      ""We have to show our government on why we are already practicing KYC [know-your-customer verification] and all the standard practices in India as exchanges,"" he said. ""I think a formal regulatory note from us would be helpful in going in the right direction.""

42404676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDr0,1592204400,Just-Launched Ziglu Wants to Make It Stupid Easy to Buy Crypto,"U.K.-based cryptocurrency platform Ziglu has launched, following a £5.25 million (US$6.6 million) seed round. As a starting point, the platform aims to painlessly put crypto in the hands of consumers.      Announced Monday, Ziglu allows users to exchange GBP for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), with more fiat currencies to be added and a debit card coming in July or August.      Ziglu is the brainchild of Mark Hipperson, former CTO of U.K.-based Starling Bank, one of a crop of so-called “challenger banks” that took on the incumbents with sleeker, more intuitive and transparent services.      Things have changed since 2015 when all the challengers entered the market, though, said Hipperson.      “In 2020, we think the 25-45 [age] demographic will want easy, safe access to crypto,” he said. “Only about 1% of people go to the large platforms to buy crypto and we think we can do better, and perhaps get them better prices as well.”      The marketplace for apps that offer crypto is heating up. For instance, Square, the fintech unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, rolled out bitcoin purchases in mid-2018 and recently reported bitcoin revenues of $306 million on its Cash App service.      Read more: Bitcoin Revenue in Square’s Cash App Tops Fiat Revenue for First Time in Q1      In Europe, London-based Revolut, which recently raised $500 million, valuing the platform at $5.5 billion, allows users to buy cryptocurrencies sourced from the Luxembourg-based BitStamp exchange.      Ziglu’s original plan was to launch with five major exchanges, but for now it’s connecting to two, both of which Hipperson declined to name. The startup has had to adapt its go-to-market plans in light of COVID-19, he said. More exchanges will be added in the coming weeks, he added.      Part of Ziglu’s secret sauce involves routing requests to find consumers the best deal. For example, if the best price for bitcoin happens to be in dollars on Kraken, the service converts fiat and sources the deal on that exchange.      The forthcoming debit card has Mastercard as a scheme partner and Global Processing Services is Ziglu's payment processor. The seed round was sourced from high-net-worth individuals and friends, but no VCs, Hipperson said.      In terms of fiat, Ziglu plans to add currencies based upon customer demand.      “I’d expect we would be at 15 currencies” by the end of the year, said Hipperson.

42404673,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDn4,1592191203,JPMorgan Analysts: Bitcoin Is Likely to Survive (as a Speculative Asset),"Bitcoin proved itself a resilient asset, if not a stable or useful currency, during March's global financial meltdown, according to analysts at one of the world's largest investment banks.      In a note to investor clients circulated June 11 and obtained by CoinDesk, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts described how bitcoin has shifted from a fairly uncorrelated asset to one whose price more closely tracks traditional stocks.      ""Though correlations were modest and mostly mean-reverting around zero for much of the past couple of years, in recent months they have moved sharply higher in some cases (equities) and lower in others (U.S. dollar, gold),"" wrote the team of strategists led by Joshua Younger.      The analysts, who normally cover bonds, noted bitcoin's success in outperforming traditional assets in March on a volatility-adjusted basis. The report also found that liquidity on major bitcoin exchanges was, surprisingly, more resilient than for traditional assets such as equities, gold, U.S. Treasury bonds and foreign exchange.      The results of their analysis ""suggest that bitcoin saw among the most severe drops in liquidity around the peak of the crisis in March, but that disruption was cured much faster than other asset classes,"" the researchers wrote. ""At this point, bitcoin market depth is above its 1-year trailing average, while liquidity in more traditional asset classes has yet to recover.""      Stablecoins, whose values are generally pegged to government currencies, got a brief mention and were described as relatively ""unscathed"" by the March turbulence.      From March 2-23, the S&P 500 plunged 29% as investors looked to cash out amid increasing concerns about the coronavirus.      The JPMorgan analysts reckoned that cryptocurrencies successfully passed their first stress test during this period despite volatile price action. During the March panic, crypto valuations did not diverge all that much from their intrinsic values, showing little flight to liquidity within the asset class, the analysts wrote.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: Cryptocurrency Markets May Be Decentralized, but They’re Still Accountable      While the market structure for crypto during this period was more resilient than its traditional counterparts, according to the report, bitcoin did not quite live up to its reputation in some corners as a port in a storm.      ""There is little evidence that bitcoin and others served as a safe haven (i.e., ‘digital gold’) — rather, its value appears to have been highly correlated with risky assets like equities,"" the report concluded. ""This all likely points to the continued survival of the asset class, but likely still more as a vehicle for speculation than as a medium of exchange or store of value.""      While that may sound like faint praise, the analysts' assessment differs sharply from past comments by JPMorgan's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, who dismissed bitcoin as a ""fraud"" around the height of the 2017 bull market. During the subsequent ""crypto winter,"" financial services giants such as Fidelity and ICE began laying the groundwork for potential institutional investment in the asset class.      JPMorgan Chase has been experimenting with blockchain technology since 2016, and it recently began banking two of the largest U.S. crypto exchanges, the megabank's first clients in the sector.
