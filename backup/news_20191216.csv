42403715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgYFL,1576536428,Chainalysis Report on PlusToken 'Scammers' Blamed for Monday’s Crypto Selloff,"As bitcoin and ether prices fell below technically significant levels, some traders are citing fear emanating from a report about the alleged PlusToken Ponzi scheme as the reason for the plunge.      The slide began at 18:28 UTC on Monday. In just seven minutes, bitcoin slipped 4 percent, to $6,800 from $7,085 according to data from Coinbase. In that time, ether took a bigger hit, dropping 7 percent from $140 to $130. Neither had seen such lows since Nov. 25, when the crypto markets suffered a temporary selloff.      With little news to go on, the markets found at least one culprit: Chainalysis’ new report, published nearly four and a half hours earlier in the day, saying 20,000 BTC (now worth $137 million) and 790,000 ETH (now worth $102 million) remain likely controlled by PlusToken “scammers.”      Further, Chainalysis claims $185 million in stolen bitcoin have already been liquidated by individuals related to PlusToken.      Six people tied to PlusToken were arrested and extradited to China from Vanuatu, where Beijing claimed the company operated a Ponzi scheme. Chainalysis said it was able to track down $2 billion in cryptocurrencies taken from victims, with a lot of that going to other “investors” – a hallmark of traditional pyramid schemes.      The arrests occurred a little more than a week before bitcoin reached its 2019 peak of $12,575.90. Since then, the cryptocurrency, which represents the lion’s share of the sector’s overall market cap, has drifted downward. While Chainalysis wouldn’t say for certain that liquidations from PlusToken-related accounts sunk bitcoin’s price, the blockchain forensics firm was willing to claim “that those cashouts cause increased volatility in Bitcoin’s price, and that they correlate significantly with Bitcoin price drops.”      A trader at an over-the-counter cryptocurrency broker attributed Monday’s steep decline to jitters that more of PlusToken’s ill-gotten bitcoin and ether was going to flood the market.      “This [Chainalysis post] may have something to do with it, driving a little bit of fear among participants,” he told CoinDesk, quickly adding: “It’s not news. I’m not sure why that story is driving the market. People see stuff on Twitter and make their own conclusions. It’s largely the tail wagging the dog.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/16/chainalysis-report-on-plustoken-scammers-blamed-for-mondays-crypto-selloff,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91502bd26ded2c0a614a431ea6a3306804ce212c-1472x810.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""In Russia, there have been two cases recently when people were brought to criminal responsibility for getting access to computers [of state organizations] and using them to mine cryptocurrencies,"" TASS quotes Nikolay Murashov, deputy director of the National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents, as saying during a press conference.      According to the TASS report, one of the nationals is a resident of Kurgan who used almost a whole botnet in various regions of the country. A criminal case was initiated against a second national for using the site of JSC Rostovvodokanal for mining. The report gives few other details but quotes Murashov as saying the attackers ""infected"" web pages and mined crypto currency at the moment the pages were viewed in the browser.      Murashov said companies must be on the lookout for suspicious activity on their networks, even if no activity is immediately detected.      ""Up to 80 percent of the computer’s free power can be used to generate virtual coins, and a legitimate user may not even know about it,"" he said.

42403675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWjs,1576529145,What Do Women Want? More Educational Materials Before Investing in Bitcoin,"There would be more women investing in bitcoin if they had more educational materials to help them, a new report found.    According to Grayscalehttps://grayscale.co/insights/bitcoin-female-investor-study/, women and men are not so different when it comes to their interest in cryptocurrency. The issue is education. More female investors indicated they lack familiarity with bitcoin (76 percent female vs. 52 percent male investors) but 93 percent of the women surveyed said they’d be more open to investing if they had more educational resources available to them.    Of the 1,100 people polled, 51 percent were women. The people were surveyed between March 28 and April 3, 2019. All respondents were between the ages of 25 and 64 and were involved with some form of personal investing, with at least $10,000 in household investable assets (excluding workplace retirement plans or real estate), and at least $50,000 in household income.      The survey found women were just as likely as men to see bitcoin’s high growth potential (56.2 percent of women, compared to 56.4 percent of men). They also understood bitcoin’s finite supply could drive future price increases (49.8 percent of women, 49.9 percent of men).      But the women appeared to be more risk averse, with 60 percent prioritizing financial security over building wealth. Also, 67 percent of women felt their lack of familiarity with bitcoin stopped them from investing in it, compared to 48 percent of men.      Women surveyed were also more cautious about the relative newness of the asset class. The absence of a track record was a concern noted by 65 percent of women compared to 56 percent of men.      More women than men surveyed admitted to being less savvy on investing in bitcoin, too: 44 percent of women versus 22 percent of men.    The researchers concluded that greater education could go a long way to allaying investor fears and prompting more investing into crypto. A previous Grayscale reporthttps://grayscale.co/bitcoin-investor-study-2019/ from July found 43 percent of investors interested in bitcoin were women. The recent study found 92 percent of female investors would consider investing if bitcoin had a longer track record.    For now, crypto remains a male-dominated industry. Nearly 10 percent of bitcoin community engagement came from women in the past week, according to Coin.Dance. Quartz found nearly 85 percent of blockchain companies between 2012 and 2018 were founded by men, and a 2019 study found female developers accounted for fewer than 5 percent of the GitHub commits to the top 100 cryptocurrency projects.      Still, there is an opportunity for more women to invest in bitcoin if they had more information. According to Grayscale, 47 percent of female investors feel a stronger sense of urgency about bitcoin than men and believe now is the time to invest before prices rise; by contrast, 39 percent of men think the same way.      As one female respondent told Grayscale: “I feel like [bitcoin] has a good chance of being a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity that could pay off big.”      Edit (10:47 UTC, Dec. 18, 2019): We updated this article to include data on the male:female ratio of the survey respondents that was provided to CoinDesk after publication.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/16/what-do-women-want-more-educational-materials-before-investing-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fcd7e61bd365c8dd116ed75251738ec9b28de880-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWkr,1576528641,Chinese City Warns Investors: Crypto Isn't Blockchain,"Weihai, a port city in Shandong province of eastern China, has a stern warning for investors: make sure you are really investing in blockchain innovation and not cryptocurrency masquerading as blockchain.       The Weihai Local Financial Supervision and Administration said Friday investors should be more cautious because illegal crypto issuance and trading are on the rise, according to a statement from the authority.       Crypto trading and ICOs have been illegal in China since 2017 but blockchain has been encouraged by the Chinese President Xi Jinpin. However, the government claims more companies, most masquerading as blockchain startups, have launched crypto exchanges and raised money through centralized token sales.       “As the country is promoting blockchain technologies, people start to hype virtual currencies again and some of the related illegal operations have come back to life,” the Weihai authority said in the statement.       Other local authorities, including the police department and the Weihai branch of the central bank and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, have endorsed the statement and plan to carry out an inspection of illegal ICOs and crypto exchanges.      “Some companies set up servers outside China and promote their products among Chinese investors on social media,” the authority said in the statement. “They usually process transactions via online payment applications, therefore many of these funds are hard to retrieve as they floating abroad.”       According to the statement, some crypto exchanges use celebrity endorsements and popular yet complex technological concepts to lure investors, while making profits by manipulating crypto prices and cash withdrawal limits.       Other illegal operations to attract investments include Ponzi schemes and promising high value appreciation in crypto with false information, according to the statement.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/16/chinese-city-warns-investors-crypto-isnt-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb435635de73c4a3ecb40a7f0063965b0373654d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CipherTrace's chief financial analyst published research Monday showing that the top 10 retail banks by asset size in the U.S. worked with unregistered crypto money services businesses by transmitting funds on their payment networks. CipherTrace Labs also announced a tool to help banks identify those transactions and assess the risk profiles of Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs).      “We think of it as two types of banks: Banks that love crypto and want to embrace it and understand the risk profiles and banks that hate crypto – those banks want to make sure there are no crypto transactions of any shape or form on their network,” Jefferies said. “But whether they want to acknowledge it or not, they’re all doing crypto.”      The analysis shows that a typical large bank is processing as much as $2 billion in undetected cryptocurrency-related transfers, such as customers sending fiat to VASPs. This poses a threat to banks trying to stay in compliance with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and Financial Action Task Force's travel rules requiring financial institutions to identify the MSBs they facilitate.      The blockchain sleuthing firm is offering banks a tool called CipherTrace Crypto Risk Intelligence which it developed in coordination with bank security teams.      The tool helps banks by revealing risks created by hidden connections between VASPs and bank payment systems, providing risk scores of more than 500 crypto exchanges and other VASPs, identifying unregistered MSBs and P2P schemes using bank accounts and identifying dark web risks and stolen financial products for sale that use cryptocurrencies for launding funds, the company claimed.      CipherTrace also aims to help banks identify crypto companies that are low risk enough for them to bank. The tool gives bankers access to CipherTrace’s monitoring of more than 500 crypto companies and provides risk scores, compliances scores and anti-money laundering filtering data for financial institutions.      CipherTrace is entering into a space that’s increasingly interested in serving banks.       Last week, blockchain forensics startup Elliptic announced Elliptic Discovery, a tool providing bank compliance teams with up-to-date risk profiles of more than 200 of the largest exchanges globally. TRM Labs’ offers a risk-score for cryptocurrency transactions, with the startup analyzing more than a dozen blockchains for banks looking to fight money-laundering and fraud in the crypto sphere.

42403685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWrk,1576519200,This Year's Top 10 Crypto Narratives,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ryan Selkis is the co-founder and CEO of Messari. The following is an excerpt from Messari's “Crypto Theses for 2020.”      1. “Hyperbitcoinization vs. Digital Gold.” While you’ll see a great deal of chatter about the coming decade’s hyperbitcoinization if you read The Bitcoin Standard (which I recommend) and follow the hardcore libertarian crypto crowd on Twitter, it’s a mistake for everyone to keep hammering away at this currency narrative. It’s threatening and unnecessarily and prematurely hostile to the powers that be. It’s a harder narrative to grok for newcomers, and everyone that converts to crypto ends up hoarding bitcoin like digital gold, anyway. Practically speaking, we should go after the $7 trillion gold market first, see how that goes, then move up the value chain to the next milestone if we get there. Bitcoin as everyday cash will also always suck in a world with stablecoins because of the tax consequences of spending, and the public audit trail those transactions leave.      2. “Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers.” In a world where every transaction has an associated cost basis and tax event, the real killer app for the industry is in collateralized lending. This is especially true in the U.S. with its crypto hostile tax regime. Rather than spend crypto and deal with accounting headaches, it’s becoming feasible to lend bitcoin in return for (tax free!) dollars out, at reasonably low interest rates! Of course, there is always liquidation risk in these products if your collateral declines in value, but borrowing against 10-20 percent of your holdings, for instance, is plenty of cushion for most people, especially if they’d be otherwise looking at 20-30 points of incremental capital gains tax liabilities in a sale. It’s nonsensical to take the tax hit on a big purchase (e.g. a down payment on a new house) if you can avoid selling. I’m waiting for one of the crypto tax software companies to collaborate with the lenders and create a calculator that runs through this logic for their customers. Borrow money from your own bank.      3. “Stack Sats & Earn Crypto.” I’m disappointed in what has become of Earn.com and Streamium. (You’d have to be OLD to remember Streamium.) The potential to monetize your time via crypto is significant (an Airbnb or Uber for “spare time” is capital efficient), but it hasn’t hit yet. The potential for streaming metered payments is also there (telemedicine, international consulting, and of course, porn), but that hasn’t clicked either for some reason. I’m shocked we haven’t seen a BIG specialized payroll company that offers bitcoin payouts as a percentage of your paycheck (though Coinbase may be working on it). In the meantime, we put together an easy overview at Messari of how to earn “free bitcoin.” Perhaps the easiest method today is Lolli, a browser extension that sends users bitcoin rewards for online shopping. Honey just sold to PayPal for $4 billion. Lolli could be on a similar trajectory in the next bitcoin bull cycle.      4. “Unbank the Banked.” I love this quip. (I believe it originated with the OmiseGo team in mid-2017.) It’s SPOT ON. There’s building tech for the disenfranchised, who often need financial services, but don’t make tremendously compelling early customers because of their low CLV (customer lifetime value). Then there’s building tech for those who are on the inside already, but feel like they may be on the way out: the misfits, the tinkerers, and the dissidents. We desperately need more success stories from Latin America, and the Middle East, and other emerging or unstable markets, particularly in regions where the rule of law is weaker and there are security risks associated with having a healthy bank account. Bitcoin took off in the U.S. in large part because Wences Casares, Silicon Valley’s “patient zero,” was a successful entrepreneur from Argentina with a superhero backstory and a stunt that caught the attention of the rich. Bitcoin caught fire in the U.S. because he passed $250k of bitcoin around a table of Silicon Valley power brokers at an exclusive 2013 dinner, not because someone at the party bought LSD on Silk Road (ok, ok, maybe it was both).    The only crypto communities that will survive in the long-term will have strong memes.    5. “Missionaries vs. Mercenaries.” The only crypto communities that will survive in the long-term will have strong memes. On the flipside, most attempts to bribe developers and users with airdrops and developer grants will fail (many already are), and most attempts to recruit insiders to a cause with pre-sale discounts and the (diminishing allure) of token flips will bring dysfunction and gridlock to projects that otherwise may have had a chance. We’re starting to see some teams come to terms with this reality. Stellar just burned 50 percent of its token supply because they quite literally can’t give it away. The EOS “cartel” has likely led to irreparable damage in that protocol’s reputation in developer circles (why build on infrastructure that will get hijacked by ruthless investors). And I’m predicting another bloodbath for privately funded token networks that come to market in 2020. We’re also intentionally avoiding coverage of many new competitive Layer 1 blockchains in these theses for this same reason: the vast majority are simply not interesting from a narrative standpoint.      6. “Bitcoin is a Platypus.” Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart had one of the all-time classic analogies for Bitcoin in a 2017 post: the platypus. He writes about the platypus’s history:    ""The platypus is perhaps the most bizarre creature on the planet. It’s a venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal. Those things simply aren’t supposed to go together. In fact, when leading scientists first read accounts of the platypus, they dismissed it as a joke – and for good reason: the platypus is a seemingly impossible animal that combines features from three different animal classes and four different animal orders. ... Even once the platypus was broadly accepted as a real and legitimate animal, classification provoked arguments: What type of animal is it? As it turns out, the platypus isn’t good at being a duck, it’s not good at being an otter, nor is it good at being a beaver or a reptile. The platypus is, however, great at being a platypus! In the end, the platypus was so distinct that scientists had to create a new animal category to accommodate its unique features. The platypus is a category creator.""    Bitcoin can be used for payments, has provable scarcity like a commodity, can split like a stock, and serves as a foundational protocol for other types of value transfer. We’d do well to capitalize on the limited time bitcoin has left being considered a punch line. When someone in power says “This isn’t money, it sucks as money. No one accepts it!” You should say, “You’re right!” When they say, “This isn’t digital gold, it sucks as a store of value.” You should say, “You’re right!” Please, please, please, let us hide in plain sight for one more bull run that gets us too big to fail.      7. “The Revolution Needs Rules.” I wrote last year that I thought Gemini’s controversial campaign was brilliant. A year older, wiser, and more disgruntled has made me an even bigger fan of the messaging, though perhaps my punch line is different than that of the Winklevoss twins. I believe they were trying to convey that Gemini is a regulated exchange that follows the law and sets the standard for what compliance should look like in crypto investment products. Good for them, but I take a less supplicant stance. When I think “The Revolution Needs Rules” I don’t think of placating U.S. regulators so much as I do of training a rag-tag militia. If we want to be better than the incumbents, then token teams: start disclosing insider sales; exchanges, clean up your wash trades; wallets, learn how to integrate with tax software systems and help your customers minimize their liabilities and pay only to Caesar that which is actually Caesar’s. The rules to the revolution shouldn’t all be defensive. Let’s play some fucking offense in the 2020s.    I told [a] room full of 'decentralized world computer' fanatics it was stupid for the Ethereum community to build non-financial applications.    8. “ETH is money.” Back in May I spoke at Ethereal and told the room full of “decentralized world computer” fanatics it was stupid for the Ethereum community to build non-financial applications. Being the reserve currency for DeFi / Open Finance was plenty good enough, and things like low-value collectibles, gaming, and distributed applications were a complete distraction whose use cases they should forfeit to other blockchains. This was a good take, and a lot of other ETH fans are starting to fly that flag. Ethereum could power most major stablecoins, synthetic securities, and the vast majority of the programmatic crypto lending and derivatives market. C’mon, fam, FOCUS. Rebuilding literally the entire financial system would be a big enough win. Push the kitties to a separate blockchain.      9. “Dissident Tech.” Web 3 got real fast. I thought it would take years to get excited about “decentralized internet” applications, but perhaps it's sooner than we think, especially if it’s getting the satirical treatment on Silicon Valley. The continued exploitation of user data from tech behemoths (looking at you, Zuck) is making the concept of dissident tech – coined by Maya Zehavi – not only relevant, but cool. And new generations of users tend to gravitate towards ""cool"" tech. The demand for privacy and freedom of expression sparked a proliferation of crypto solutions over the past year-plus, from decentralized hardware networks like Helium and Orchid to privacy-focused browsers like Brave, which provide a glimpse of what’s to come with the Web 3 data stack. I'm not too bullish on the projects sporting token-first models, but upstarts that apply token models to applications that already work are more interesting. What's also intriguing is the rate at which investors are defining their investment theses around dissident tech, emphasized by funds such as Cyberpunk Holdings and the mysterious Unknown Fund. Demand for privacy and censor-resistant solutions will require a shift in user behavior, but ""the undercurrents are growing"" in the current environment.      10. “Ok, boomer,” but for crypto. Crypto has some pretty good memes for insiders. But I’m not sure how effective our narratives will be during the political battles ahead. Are any of the nine narratives above capable of winning elections? Every time I look at that bald, conniving ape Sherman, I see someone who will lead and win the narrative battle against crypto with the most powerful people we cannot afford to lose. It strikes me there’s a generational divide we must recognize in that battle, a frustration we can capture and turn back against leaders like Sherman. An “ok boomer” that provides an effective counter to the damaging narrative that crypto is for “frauds, terrorists, and criminals.” I don’t know what it is, but I like these 500+ efforts to get it right.

42403687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWvg,1576517754,Bitcoin-Savvy Retailers to Experiment With Point-of-Sale Lightning App in 2020,"It’s easy to see why litecoin creator Charlie Lee just invested an undisclosed amount in the lightning-friendly bitcoin wallet startup Breez: CEO Roy Sheinfeld is a hustler. Sheinfeld responds to messages 24/7 and executes just as quickly.      Since the mobile wallet app launched in June, Breez integrated with shopping and payment apps like Fold, MoonPay and Bitrefill, just to name a few. According to company data shared with CoinDesk, Breez’s ready-made lightning setup facilitated 4,273 transactions in October alone. That claim might be hard to swallow if whispers of Breez weren’t omnipresent among startups experimenting with bitcoin scaling solutions.      Now Sheinfeld’s eight-man team is looking to help launch a point-of-sale app, powered on the back-end by the trading firm Iterative Capital's software library called Escher, in early 2020. Some retailers are already testing the beta version of Breez's app.      “We did a test run around a month and a half ago and it worked beautifully,” said Perrin Ehlinger, owner of the video game store Station Retro in Alabama. “I’m hoping to get it integrated into the store by the end of December.”      Ehlinger said the process is shockingly easy compared to other self-custodied options for merchants. His small business can’t handle bitcoin’s volatility and on-chain fees, so the wallet itemizes purchases made with the Lightning Network’s signature low fees.      “I just get a statement every morning for what the lightning transactions were and make a quick bank transfer to the store’s account,” Ehlinger said. “It’s almost quicker than the credit card machine.”      Iterative Capital’s managing partner, Chris Dannen, said this product will offer a fiat on-ramp, via the banking network Zelle, as well. Plus, he added, the trading firm is working with Silicon Valley startup Lightning Labs to improve the network's user experience via a service called Lightning Loop.      “You don’t have to manage channels or any of that. You can settle the invoice with one task-flow,” Dannen said. “We can do a round-trip process with bitcoin – buy, sell, settle – in four seconds.”      Sheinfeld said they will start a pilot this month in Israel, where bureaucracy is discarded faster than bad hummus, as they build out Escher’s on-ramps for American banks. Of course, anyone who prefers to use self-custodied bitcoin can also do so with Breez.      “We expect to generate serious revenue in one to two years as the network grows,” Sheinfeld said, referencing adjacent plans to facilitate a channel management marketplace where a variety of providers handle routing on the backend, for a small fee.      For those beyond the American banking system, Breez offers FastBitcoins vouchers that users can redeem for bitcoin that goes straight to the lightning wallet. According to FastBitcoins managing director Danny Brewster, over the last six months, this startup alone facilitated lightning payments worth more than 11 bitcoin ($78,210 at current prices).      “Most point-of-sale payments are driven by meetups that occur in retail locations where our services are available,” Brewster said, adding it will take at least a decade to determine if this scaling solution actually works. “The lightning network is still extremely new. But with more and more people building better infrastructure around it, the user experience is only going to (hopefully) improve.”      Perhaps that’s why some lightning fans are predicting more merchants will experiment with crypto payments in 2020, when Escher will be compatible with most lightning wallets. Plus, Brewster said the British grocer Nisa will join the roster of FastBitcoins merchants in 2020.      “Bitcoin needs to move. It needs to become a currency in order for people to trust it more,” said Ehlinger, the Alabama game store owner. “I hope this encourages people to spend their bitcoin that they otherwise would not.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/16/bitcoin-savvy-retailers-to-experiment-with-point-of-sale-lightning-app-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78205a4f3c0bb5d7dd21c797f75bd6f6f26b028f-1500x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421795,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXsGMf,1576515600,Blockchain Projects Work Better When Everyone Collaborates,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Sheila Warren is head of blockchain at the World Economic Forum.      Another year has rolled on by, and while many things in the blockchain space have changed, a lot remains the same. 2019 saw a continued cooling of indiscriminate funding and a renewed focus on quality over hype. In addition, we’ve seen the acknowledgement by some big names, including Facebook and the other Libra Association members, and even a few central banks, that blockchain technology, and digital currency, are truly exciting innovations that just need a bit more experimentation to stick.      At WEF, we’re keen to ensure that greater blockchain adoption, which we deem inevitable, happens in ways that support inclusion and avoid replicating the consolidation of power that currently exists, particularly in the financial system. In addition, we remain focused on rationalizing this technology across sectors and publicizing our learnings in an effort to guide the public sector and civil society knowledge, funding, and robust experiments.    To Go Far, Go Together    This year, we saw less of established actors pitching competitors on unilateral projects. Instead, we saw either totally internal initiatives or creative attempts at consortium building (for example, Food Trust, Tradelens, INATBA, Libra), with varying degrees of success. Companies are waking up to the idea that to go far, they ought to go together (as an example, the Forum recently launched a consortium to explore the use of blockchain technology in the mining and metals sector, where a collaborative approach would have been hard to imagine even a few years ago).    We expect to see a similar collaborative approach from the public sector as 2020 progresses, and in fact, the Forum has already seen an increased willingness on the part of public sector agencies to share learnings and challenges (an example is our Central Banks Digital Currency projecthttps://www.weforum.org/projects/central-banks-age-of-blockchain, which has brought together more than 45 Central Banks to explore parameters for successful deployment of a CBDC. Our CBDC Policymaker Toolkit, co-created with over 45 Central Banks, will launch in Davos at our Annual Meeting.  Devil in Details    The term “governance” used to cause immediate recoil among even blockchain enthusiasts. But 2019 saw a gradual recognition (or perhaps resignation) that governance is a feature that drives adoption. Of course, as Facebook learned, the promise or potential for good governance is not enough; the devil is in the details, and 2019 saw laypeople diving deep into the specifics of operations, business models, and legal structures in an effort to assess risk. That was also reflected in regulators’ investigations in the 2017-2018 slate of ICOs, exemplifying the importance of specifics (despite the lack of clarity that continues to cloud the regulatory space globally).    Social Impact    At the WEF, we’re focused on bringing together stakeholders to pilot policy projects focused on social impact. The social impact space continues in an ongoing, and frustrating, attempt to remedy complex societal problems with technical solutions. Our view, which is informed by the previous generation of tech experimentation, is that technology alone simply cannot adequately address social challenges, and that accompanying policy is essential to ensure that a blockchain, or really any technology, is deployed in a way that addresses its limitations.    This is a welcome change from the insanity of 2018, when merely adding the word 'blockchain' to a pitch was enough to claim authenticity.    Celo, a payments startup, is a good example of a team that understands cultural and social realities and its baking that learning into its user experience. Another example is AZA Group (aka Bitpesa), with its deep knowledge of frontier markets, particularly in Africa. In a similar vein, our government transparency project, which focuses on aligning civic engagement with a blockchain deployment designed to reduce corruption in public procurement, will pilot in Colombia in early 2020 and looks to develop local talent needed to maintain deployment over time and avoid vendor dependency.      We are seeing increased understanding that blockchain technology is not exempt from the need for robust understanding of context. This is a welcome change from the insanity of 2018, when merely adding the word “blockchain” to a pitch was enough to claim authenticity. Of course, there is still a long way to go. The reality is that the most transformative applications of blockchain technology are arguably best-suited to the most challenging contexts (for example, “banking the unbanked” is a deeply complex problem that can’t be solved by simply rolling out a token), and we are still a long way from realizing the true potential of this technology in the social impact space.    Whither 2020?    Next year, we expect to see increased experimentation with hybrid blockchain models, both in the financial sector (for example, decentralized finance or DeFi and “synthetic” CBDCs) and the public sector ( increased use of smart contracts). These are a great way to increase comfort with the technology.      We are not close to realizing the promise of truly decentralized systems, but the space continues to evolve in exciting new ways, and it’s just a matter of time before something huge gains traction.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Sheila Warren,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/16/blockchain-projects-work-better-when-everyone-collaborates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4369ce73cb241e860c7ccb7abc497bc6652ef22b-1200x852.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Levine: On Today’s episode, we’re exploring the market as we enter the holidays, justice on the blockchain, and a look at security tokens. It’s December 16 2019, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here At Coindesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      First, we turn to the daily bitcoin market briefing and the important news affecting the crypto industry       Brad Kuen: Bitcoin is right around $7100 with not much change over the weekend. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole writes that price charts are looking bearish, potentially heading back toward $6500 during the holiday. Prices would have to climb above $7870 to signal a short-term bullish reversal or above $8500 for a convincing start of a new bullish trend. The good news? This is far from the market low we hit a year ago on December 15 and prices are up 127% since then. The price has been stable, which has defied some market prognosticators’ call for a big bull run into bitcoin’s expected mining-reward halving in May 2020. We’ll have more clarity on that in the new year. In Bull News, Mark Yusko, CEO of the money-management firm Morgan Creek Capital Management, was once a skeptic of bitcoin. But he told Business Insider recently that he sees the price going to $100,000 by 2021, and potentially all the way to $500,000 by 2030. Turning to the news, Chinese media are reporting that police arrested the CEO of MicroBT, a Chinese manufacturer of computers used to mine bitcoin. The arrest happened in October and the CEO, Yang ZUO SHING, previously worked at the dominant industry leader, Bitmain, where he was mining chip design director. According to the report, the CEO is accused of embezzling $15,000 Bitmain has a pending civil case against Yang and MicroBT, alleging the former employee of infringing a Bitmain patent on bitcoin mining equipment Separately, CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports that a district court in Shenzhen ordered the freezing of $680,000 in assets belonging to a unit of Bitmain over a contract dispute with an electronics supplier. Coming back to the US, Fidelity Digital Assets, a unit of the giant asset manager Fidelity, might enable support for ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, as soon as next year. According to reports, Tom Jessop, the unit’s president, said that it has so far only supported bitcoin because it has a longer track record Finally, we offer some news of the weird. Lingering suspicions over the death of Gerald Cotten, former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, have led to calls for Canadian investigators to exhume his body      An attorney for Cotten’s widow says he died a year ago in India due to complications from Crohn’s disease. CoinDesk’s Nikihilesh De reports that Ernst & Young, the court-appointed monitor, found that the exchange’s crypto wallets had been emptied, with most of the crypto holdings transferred to other exchanges and wallets. Cotten’s death was kept secret for a month after his passing, with the exchange accepting deposits but not allowing some customers to withdraw funds throughout that time.      Adam: Turning to today's featured story, and with a hat-tip to CoinTelegraph, the China Justice Observer reported: On the morning of December 4th, 2019, the Supreme People’s Court-issued a white paper on Chinese Courts and Internet Judiciary. In another article from the China Justice Observer titled ""Why are Chinese Internet Courts Keen on Blockchain Technology,"" they lay out a simple and illustrative scenario.      This is mostly a quote with a little paraphrasing to simplify      One day, you find your copyrighted photographs have been sold online to many people by a photo sales website without your permission. You intend to sue the website in court, so you save the sales webpage of your works to your computer and print it out at the same time. When you appear in court, you find that the website has deleted this page and refuses to acknowledge its sales of your works. You provide your saved and printed evidence to the court. However, the defendant challenges the authenticity of your evidence. The court can’t tell whether the electronic evidence you submitted and the printed copies thereto are authentic and untampered with. To have an expert validate your evidence costs around $430, as much as your intended claim. After calculating the cost, you give up the appraisal.      Not surprisingly, you lose the case.      This website sells your works again. Becoming smarter this time, you engage a notary office and ask them to notarize the sales webpage to prove that the website was indeed selling your photos. The notary office says that they would also charge around $430 for notarization. It’s still too expensive for you. So, you’re going to drop the claim. And just then, you bump into the blockchain platform provided by the Internet Court. You submit these webpages to the platform which captures these webpages and saves them on the blockchain platform, costing less than a dollar. Then you bring a lawsuit with the court and provide the court with the webpage you saved, and inform the court that the page is also saved on the blockchain platform.      After review, the court confirms that the electronic evidence submitted by you is consistent with the electronic data stored on the platform. The court reviews the entire process of generating, storing, disseminating and using electronic data on the platform and deems it credible. The defendant does not challenge your evidence either. So, the court admits the evidence and rules on your favor.      This story, in fact, shows the problems encountered by almost all parties when using electronic evidence. That is, the use of electronic evidence in the form of notarization or appraisal is so expensive that many parties have to drop their claims.       It’s really really interesting watching a government, any government thinking about Bitcoin and blockchains as tools which can be integrated into so-called normal life, and make things better, fairer and probably most importantly, a lot less expensive. This example comes from China but is true broadly speaking, that in legal matters while the truth may be on your side it is often not enough. Lacking the often substantial funds required to prove your case, being right is just the first step towards a win. In this story, we see that Blockchain can, and has lowered the cost of proving such a case by hundreds if not thousands of times, and that is significant. While the world at large may be thinking about Blockchain for money, or for ownership, those systems all require real scaling solutions that don’t at the same time compromise the underlying system. Proof of Existence, on the other hand, requires no such thing and is ready for these sorts of broad deployment, real applications today. With China jumping on board, the big question is - Who's next?      And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at the market for security token offerings, as the industry is shaking off the reputational hit from the wave of abysmal initial coin offerings that took place in recent years. Brad has the details for you and what it all means for crypto-traders      Brad: CoinDesk is currently in the midst of publishing 100 year-end perspectives, including opinion pieces looking out into 2020 and several of those focus on the market for security token offerings, or STOs, which are a different name for initial coin offerings, or ICOs.      ICOs are a way for companies to raise money, and to build support for a blockchain community, by selling new digital tokens to investors. But they’ve been tarnished not just by the lackluster performance of many of the new digital assets launched during the bull market of 2017 when they went off at a frenzied pace.      And U.S. regulators have brought cases against some large ICOs for being essentially unlawful securities offerings, contrasted with initial public stock offerings that are typically heavily vetted by regulators before they can go forward.      Andy Bromberg, co-founder, and president of CoinList, a platform for token sales, writes that 2019 saw startups take their token-based fundraising models in new directions. For instance, Algorand ran a Dutch Auction sale where participants paid a uniform, market-determined price per token to ensure fairness and transparency.      Some projects conducted what are known as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) to provide liquidity for investors.      Based on what we’re seeing today, public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens to a broad array of stakeholders, with the capital raise being a secondary consideration, Bromberg writes.      Kristin Smith, director of external affairs for the Blockchain Association, an industry group, notes that new token sales remain haunted by the possibility that the U.S. Securities Regulators might deem an initial token offering to be improper. She says, you can get to a place where these tokens are not securities, but it's still not clear how to get there without having this period of time following an initial offering where something might be considered a security. Smith takes aim at SEC Chair Jay Clayton, saying that as long as he’s at the agency, there won’t be a whole lot of progress in terms of breaking down regulatory barriers for the crypto industry.      Meanwhile, Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler writes for CoinDesk that literally thousands of blockchain projects have yet to land on broadly adopted use cases. But he believes this new technology’s promise is real. Gensler writes that The potential to lower verification and networking costs is worth pursuing, particularly to lower economic rents and data privacy costs, and promote economic inclusion.      What’s more, shared blockchain applications might help jumpstart multiparty network solutions in fields that historically have been fragmented or resilient to change.      Even in this slightly less ambitious form, simply providing competition to traditional financial players and technologies is a benefit in and of itself.      Finally, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen writes that if 2017 was the token boom and late-2018 was a crypto winter, then 2019 was the year of “dogfooding,” or ""using your own product."" Cuen writes that, throughout 2019, leaders from more than a dozen leading crypto projects told her they were distributing tokens to stimulate usage, development, and growth.      Which raises the question: If companies are giving tokens away, do they have a legitimate business with organic demand?

42403686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWuh,1576510200,Musicians Want to Break Free of Big Tech,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Roneil Rumburg is co-founder and chief executive officer of Audius, a blockchain music streaming platform.      Imagine if you could make a song about Vladimir Putin and there was nothing he could do to take it down.      In 2019, this sort of dream scenario became closer to reality. The fight to defend the world’s content began in earnest, as mainstream creators became more aware of the stakes involved. Decentralized platforms emerged, offering an alternative to creators who are disenfranchised by existing centralized content platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify.      Despite creating all the value on these platforms, creators do not control their content or data, or get their fair share of revenue. But in 2019, the seeds were planted to bring freedom of expression, information, and interaction to the masses.      The need for decentralized content platforms is here. Publishing will happen on blockchains where transparency, censorship-resistance and community-control is baked into the platform. The key to mass adoption is to provide the benefits of decentralization without degrading user experience. We have to simplify the user experience so people don’t even know they’re using dApps.    Centralized Censorship    Western tech companies struggle to succeed in places like China, where censorship is at an all-time high. To remain operational, centralized platforms like Spotify or Apple Music must comply with local regulations, no matter how strict or counter to the First Amendment they may be. Rather than losing access to the world’s most populous country, these companies make concessions to the government.      2019 was the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen, and the year demonstrators stood up in Hong Kong. And many centralized content platforms chose to bend to China’s will, including Airbnb, whihc disabled bookings in Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests and LinkedIn, which censored content mentioning Tiananmen Square.      Unfortunately, content is taken down by big tech companies all the time, via black-box processes which offer little to no transparency on how these decisions are made. Over the summer, YouTube removed educational cybersecurity videos, making it difficult for IT professionals to learn about new threats. It took public outrage for YouTube to admit the videos were “taken down by mistake” and revert their decision. SoundCloud takes down music arbitrarily and kicks creators off its platform, taking artists’ livelihoods for granted. Recently, the company (which is German) scrubbed an original track from an artist because it was leaked elsewhere. When the artist notified SoundCloud, the platform refused to rectify the situation.    Breaking the Chains    Rather than continue being taken for granted — controlled, suppressed or censored — by centralized authorities, creators are ready to move to new platforms that free their content, data, and interactions. User-generated streaming content platforms like Audius, YouNow, and others are gaining meaningful mainstream adoption (230,000 individuals have acquired Props, YouNow’s token, for instance) for content networks by rewarding users in proportion to the value they contribute. In addition, users of these networks also have a say in how these protocols develop over time.      Frankly, mainstream users could care less about the technical merits of decentralization. But creators do care about arbitrary censorship and disenfranchisement. When they are incentivized to bring their fan-bases to new platforms, that will begin to create critical mass and a shift in user numbers.      Decentralized platforms are the best means to solve equity problems in creative industries. By creating open-source networks and rewarding users with incentives, they can challenge big tech by removing its ability to rent-seek at a fundamental level. With no central authority determining what can or can’t be seen, content moderation is community-driven and disputes can be handled by a jury of peers. This means creators cannot be silenced.    Cracking the Code    Decentralized projects are starting to crack the code to mainstream adoption by solving some of the music industry’s biggest problems. For example, Open Music Initiative, a nonprofit calling for more transparency in the music industry, has created a community governed protocol for consistent identification (and eventually compensation) of music metadata. In October, pop-duo The Chainsmokers backed Yellowheart, a blockchain-based ticketing platform that allows artists to gain control over the secondary event ticketing market and eliminate scalpers.      Blockchain-based live-streaming company YouNow has also seen success with the SEC approving the distribution of its props token under a Regulation A+ qualification. Popular streamers with large followings can receive digital gifts, like animated balloons or flowers, from fans by using its in-game currency. Once a gift is purchased, a portion of the money spent goes directly to their pockets. YouNow saw a $10,000 increase in gift purchases since the props token went live.    The Future of Streaming    Streaming services today replicate the current structure of the music industry they service. They are centralized, rent-seeking, and damaging to the artistic freedom of music creators. Music streaming should be a common utility controlled by the masses, not a centralized rent-seeking business.      2019 kicked off the decentralized music revolution, where artists maintain control and users engage more directly. As we look ahead into the next decade, decentralized platforms will be the way power is reclaimed from big tech, giving control back to the artists.      Mainstream users are not concerned with the technical merits of decentralization. But the more we can educate the masses around the value of decentralized services, the better our chances for converting music fans to an open, community-owned distributed platform. We have the opportunity to create a brand new kind of streaming service.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Roneil Rumburg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/16/musicians-want-to-break-free-of-big-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dacbe78e929f71918cae47c836b81c4d3d89400e-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced Friday that those groups would be airdropped 0.5 petro (said to be worth $30) as a holiday bonus this week, according to local news source El Universal.      To be eligible, citizens will first have to sign up to PetroApp, the official government crypto wallet that launched back in May. The only platform that supports the oil-backed cryptocurrency, PetroApp is designed to allow users to purchase goods and services from their phones, as well as for standard transfers.    PetroApp can also be used to exchange other cryptocurrencies, too, meaning users may well use the app to swap their airdropped petro for the currently supportedhttps://www.petro.gob.ve/petro-app.html bitcoin, litecoin and dash.    Maduro said that the airdrop will be another opportunity to encourage Venezuelans to switch to the petro, which has been available to the public since October 2018. Considering the national minimum wage is less than $10 a month, eligible citizens will be strongly incentivized to register for the app.      During the same announcement, the president also said more than 500,000 petros would be paid out from the state’s own supply to support town and local governments across the country.      This is the latest in a series of efforts to push nationwide adoption. In September, Maduro ordered future funding for a social housing initiative to be paid out in petros. Back in the summer, he requested the Bank of Venezuela (BoV), one of the country’s largest banks, to make the token available to its customers. Despite a limited number of use-cases, the government has reportedly been paying state pensions in petro for the past year.      Although the petro has received strong government support and been in circulation for more than a year, it hasn't found much organic growth across the Venezuelan economy. There were only 400 businesses that accepted petro payments as of last month, according to a government press release. In the same release, Maduro ordered businesses to begin integrating the petro so it can be as widely accepted as the nation’s fiat currency, the sovereign bolivar.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | AIRDROP,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/16/venezuelas-maduro-says-he-will-airdrop-half-a-petro-each-to-public-employees-retirees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2072ea3dade8ca7667026eeba1c1a561cb88375d-1080x761.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403693,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgX0b,1576501200,Bitcoin Has Got Society to Think About the Nature of Money,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Daniel Gorfine is the founder of fintech advisory firm Gattaca Horizons LLC. He currently serves as an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, and is former chief innovation officer of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.      Sometimes I imagine the advent of bitcoin as akin to the sudden appearance of the monolith in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey that triggers curiosity, suspicion, euphoria and then ultimately evolution across a band of interested primates. Satoshi Nakamoto’s now more than 10-year-old white paper has elicited a broad range of human emotions, reactions, and responses ranging from those who believe this is all nothing more than digital smoke and mirrors, to those who argue blockchain is the biggest innovation since the development of the internet.       Regardless of your view, it is clear that bitcoin has driven society to think more broadly about the nature of money, the way we engage in economic activity, and the role of financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure in our markets. As we head into the year 2020, and wrap-up over a decade of experience with cryptocurrency, it is worth taking stock of five key market and regulatory topics that are likely to drive the crypto agenda heading into the new year.      The first topic is a remnant of the global ICO mania of 2018, which catalyzed fierce debate on the definition of a security in the crypto-context. Some within the crypto community have argued that tokens will serve a utility or consumption function in powering new decentralized economic models, and therefore should not be viewed through the lens of a securities offering. Global regulators have looked through the promise to argue that in reality many pre-sales of tokens bear the hallmarks of a traditional capital raise, and, therefore, are the proper focus of securities laws.      Much of the mania over ICOs dissipated in 2019, but it remains the case that there is still existing ambiguity at the margins of when a token may be a security as compared to – or “morph” into – a decentralized utility or consumption coin. Absent (unlikely) legislation to clarify this perimeter, 2020 may be the year that the judiciary more fully applies doctrines such as the “Howey Test” in the crypto context, including in cases like U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Kik Interactive Inc.      To the extent that further clarity allows certain token projects to move forward outside of the securities law context, 2020 may also be the year that we begin to learn more about the viability, value, and economics of such projects (an area where I have previously expressed skepticism that we will see thousands or even hundreds of successful standalone tokens).      A second topic, derivative of the first, is looking at how regulation will evolve in the U.S. to the extent that a token falls outside of the securities laws. Platforms that facilitate the trade of digital commodities are currently subject to a patchwork of state regulation that largely treats the exchange of virtual currencies as money transmission (although some states, such as New York, have tailored specific crypto-regimes). With the exception of FinCEN registration, there is no coherent federal framework that provides oversight of a digital commodity exchange (also known as the cash, spot, or underlying market). While the CFTC may have backward-looking fraud and manipulation enforcement jurisdiction, this is not a federal framework to oversee spot digital commodity trading as with securities, or futures and derivatives markets.      The above-regulatory landscape seems to poorly serve both innovators and regulators. Digital asset market participants and innovators would benefit from a more efficient, rationalized, and mature regulatory framework that recognizes crypto-trading from a markets perspective instead of simply as money transmission. And regulators would better be able to satisfy regulatory interests – including investor protection and policing for trading manipulation – if the regulatory framework provided for direct market oversight.    2020 may be the year that policymakers at the state and federal level begin more robust consideration of a rationalized digital commodity regulatory framework.    For the above reasons, 2020 may be the year that policymakers at the state and federal level begin more robust consideration of a rationalized digital commodity regulatory framework.      At the federal level, an opt-in federal licensing option for cash-market digital commodity platforms could hold promise. At the state level, I would expect leaders to emerge in creating more streamlined, coordinated, and market-oriented licensing frameworks. These regimes would need to create properly tailored platform requirements, while leveraging appropriate market and trading oversight capabilities. The private sector, for its part, should continue to develop and deploy crypto-market surveillance and compliance tools, including through potential industry or self-regulatory bodies. All of these developments could help to enhance the integrity of underlying crypto markets.      A third topic will be further exploration (and ideally clarity) around the application of the securities laws to digital assets that are deemed to be securities or that are involved in a registered offering. In other words – whether the token represents a registered or legal form of an ICO, the mere tokenization of a traditional securities offering, or the underlying basket of assets in an investment fund – how can blockchain technology or blockchain-based assets satisfy regulatory expectations and requirements?      Let’s drill down on a few examples to highlight what I mean. If we assume an asset is in fact a security, the way the security is marketed, transferred, cleared, and custodied must all satisfy securities laws. These laws, for example, impose requirements on SEC registrants to ensure that customer assets are not lost, misused, or misappropriated. While this may sound straightforward, satisfying such standards poses unique challenges when the involved asset is secured with cryptographic keys, which can be lost or potentially shared with third parties.      A second related example of unique securities law considerations in the crypto context arises with respect to applications for a crypto-based ETF. The SEC has made clear successful applications will ultimately have to demonstrate how the fund can “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.” A core challenge here derives from the regulatory framework outlined above – one which does not systemically surveil the underlying crypto-market for potential fraud and abusive trading practices.      My view is that efforts to further ensure the integrity of the underlying market – whether through application of more coherent regulatory frameworks or industry self-regulation – will be critical in enhancing requisite market integrity from a securities law perspective. CFTC oversight of evolving crypto futures markets may also advance these efforts.      A fourth topic for 2020 will be ongoing developments around stable coins and digital fiat currency, including the Libra initiative, global CBDC efforts (including in China), or a U.S. hybrid model I have advocated for that recognizes a role for the government, but in partnership with private sector dynamism and ingenuity. The truth is that, despite bitcoin’s longevity, we have not yet seen the mainstream adoption and success at scale of a tokenized medium of exchange powered by decentralized blockchain rails. We know the potential benefits – including efficiency, speed, transparency, and inclusion – but we need to test the merits as compared to traditional payment rails. This testing and evolution will inevitably happen, and 2020 may prove to be a catalyzing year.      A final topic moves beyond crypto as an asset and instead focuses on the many ancillary benefits that may arise from renewed focus on the technology infrastructure that underpins our broader markets and provision of financial services. I have frequently suggested that one of the positive outgrowths of the launch of bitcoin is that it has made the topic of interoperable databases and smart-contract-based automation a ‘hot’ area in the context of middle and back-office systems. Although existing infrastructure may be Scotch-taped and bubble-gummed together to serve its purpose, there is little question that new systems, which promote interoperability, data standardization, open architecture, and ready application of machine learning tools are the next generation of enterprise-level fintech. 2020 may be the year that we begin to see the value proposition of such infrastructure justify the up-front investment cost.      It's hard to believe it has been more than a decade since Satoshi Nakamoto released the bitcoin white paper. We still do not know who Satoshi Nakamoto is and how cryptocurrency-based innovation will evolve. But, as one of the earliest popular articles I could find on bitcoin noted back in 2010 (when one bitcoin traded for 20¢): “purely as an intriguing idea that might indicate a possible future . . . Bitcoins are worth taking a look at.” Indeed, this intriguing idea promises to continue to drive our march into a 2020 cyberspace odyssey.

42403679,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWno,1576500962,Tata's IT Arm Says Its New Toolkit Will Enable Faster Blockchain App Development,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has launched a new blockchain developers' kit that it claims will make developing apps up to 40 percent faster.      TCS, the information technology subsidiary of Tata Group and India's largest company by market cap, said Monday that its Quartz DevKit is now generally available as an ""intuitive, low code development kit for enterprises to quickly build and deploy blockchain applications on any popular blockchain platform.""      Designed to remove some of the complexity of building with blockchain, the toolbox allows devs to create apps on major blockchain platforms such as ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric or R3 Corda, according to a press release.      ""We developed the Quartz DevKit to help [clients'] teams rapidly put together high-quality pilots using smart contracts on any platform with reduced coding effort. We have received very positive feedback from our pilot customers, and are pleased to make the DevKit available for use at scale,” said R Vivekanand, global head of Quartz at TCS.      As with more consumer-driven software products, developers are offered a choice of templates for their projects that can then be tailored with code extensions specific to their chosen blockchain. DevKit also offers a web-based development environment, and plug-and-play components across areas such as security authentication and user management, cutting down on the time it takes to build smart contracts, TCS says.      The product further has a built-in tool to scrutinize developers' smart contracts and help keep coding at ""best in class"" standards.      The DevKit comes as part of TCS' Quartz suite of products aimed to facilitate the development of blockchain products and integrations for enterprises, including a set of business solutions for a range of industries, a means of integrating existing solutions with blockchain platforms and a central hub for admin and monitoring.      For some time, TCS has been working on a wide range of blockchain projects in-house, and has joined a number of collaborative efforts around the tech.      As far back as 2016, the firm claimed to be involved in “more than 100” blockchain prototypes as it eyed use cases across finance. More recently, TCS said in April that it had completed a trial using blockchain to facilitate cross-border securities settlement between two central securities depositories.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/16/tatas-it-arm-says-its-new-toolkit-will-enable-faster-blockchain-app-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97e853c52e815b5c16e7399f2607037cb21c42cb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWzc,1576495300,"A Year After Bottoming Out at $3,100, Bitcoin Is Up 127%","Bitcoin is currently reporting triple-digit gains since the 2018 bear market bottomed out exactly a year ago.      The largest cryptocurrency by market value is currently priced around $7,050, representing a 127 percent rise from the low of $3,122 registered in Dec. 15, 2018, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Back then, while the selling ran out of steam near $3,100 in mid-December, buyers remained on the fence for at least 3.5 months, leaving bitcoin in the range of $3,300–$4,200, as seen below.      The narrative that bitcoin was repeating history by bottoming out almost 1.5 years ahead of the next mining reward halving started doing the rounds during that consolidation period. Bitcoin is set to undergo the scheduled halving in May 2020, following which the reward per block mined on the blockchain will drop from the current 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.      The previous bear market ended at lows near $150 in January 2015, 18 months ahead of the supply-cutting event in July 2016.    Breakout in Q2    The three-month consolidation period was breached to the higher side with a high-volume move from $4,130 to $5,100 on April 2 and the expectations for a pre-halving rally strengthened with the bullish breakout.      By the end of May, though, bitcoin was looking overbought at highs near $9,000. The resulting pullback to $7,500, however, was short-lived, as prices surged to $13,880 in the 16 days to June 26. The near 90-degree rally occurred as the bitcoin market was pushed into a state of frenzy by Facebook's announcement of its proposed cryptocurrency Libra.    Bears dominate H2    The Libra rally ran out of steam in early July after regulators across the globe voiced concerns regarding Facebook's cryptocurrency project. Notably, President Donald Trump called for banking regulations for Libra.      As a result, many in the investor community began worrying that Facebook’s Libra project will end up fast-tracking regulations for the crypto market. That shift in the sentiment likely weighed over bitcoin's price.      Bitcoin fell nearly 23 percent in the third quarter and has shed 15 percent so far in the October-December period.      The cryptocurrency declined to $7,300 on Oct. 23, erasing the entire Libra rally from $7,500 to $13,880.      Prices jumped from $7,300 to $10,350 in the two days to Oct. 26, reportedly due to Chinese President Xi's encouraging comments on the blockchain. The move, however, failed to attract sustained buying and prices fell back to $6,515 on Nov. 25.      The decline was also possibly influenced by miners selling off their bitcoin, as noted by prominent analyst Willy Woo.    Looking forward    Historically, bitcoin has put on a good show in the six months ahead of the reward halving.      This time, however, the pre-halving period has begun on a negative note with the cryptocurrency falling by 17.5 percent in November. At press time, bitcoin is reporting a 6.5 percent month-to-date loss.      The analyst community is divided on whether the impending supply cut is priced in or not.      Charles Hwang, managing member of the hedge fund Lightning Capital and an adjunct professor at Baruch College, expects the reward halving to power bitcoin to new highs above $20,000.      Meanwhile, pseudonymous trader Plan B has predicted a bitcoin price of almost $60,000 after the next halving.      However, Jason Williams, co-founder at digital asset fund Morgan Creek Digital, believes the halving will be a non-event for the markets. Mining giant Bitmain’s CEO Jihan Wu is also “pessimistic” about the prospect of a price surge after the halving.      The technical outlook is currently bearish with the cryptocurrency trapped in a falling channel, as seen below.    Weekly chart    A convincing move above the upper edge of the falling channel, currently at $8,500, is needed to confirm a bullish breakout. That would imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 seen on April 2.      The narrative of the pre-halving rally would gain credence if the breakout happens in the next few weeks.      Currently, the prospects look bleak for such a move. The 50- and 100-week averages produced a bullish cross last week, but that's failed to attract buyers – a sign of bearish market sentiment.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is looking heavy, having closed (UTC) below key support at $7,087 on Saturday.      The MACD histogram is about to cross below zero in favor of the bears, while the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting bearish conditions, too, with a below-50 reading.    3-day chart    Bitcoin fell 2 percent in the three days to Dec. 14, validating a bearish ""outside bar"" candlestick pattern created in the preceding three days.      All in all, bitcoin risks revisiting recent lows near $6,500.

42403682,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWql,1576493096,Bitmain’s Miner Manufacturing Subsidiary Had $680K in Assets Frozen in a Contract Dispute,"A district court in Shenzhen, China, recently ordered the freezing of almost $680,000 in assets belonging to a fully owned subsidiary of bitcoin mining giant Bitmain.      In a ruling issued on Sept. 27 and published Friday, the Shenzhen Bao'An District Court sided with a firm called Dongguan Yongjiang Electronics, granting an application for asset protection in a contract dispute with the defendant, Shenzhen Century Cloud Core.      Yongjiang, which supplies electronic device components, asked the court on Sept. 25 to freeze 4.7 million yuan (around $676,000), in assets owned by the mining subsidiary to ensure it would be able to claim such an amount should the court rule in its favor in an ongoing trade contract dispute.      Century Cloud Core is fully owned by Beijing Bitmain Technologies and is a significant subsidiary of the mining giant, being responsible for manufacturing, carrying out quality assurance and packaging for Bitmain's bitcoin mining equipment, which currently holds a dominant market share.      It's not clear at this stage how long the freeze will be in effect. Based on Chinese laws, freezing of bank accounts and other stores of funds in general should be no longer than six months, while current or liquid assets shouldn't be held in custody for more than a year. Bitmain declined to comment on the case.      This is not the first time that the Shenzhen subsidiary has been caught up in purchasing contract disputes with electronic component providers.      Since January 2019, at least four cases had been filed by different electronic device makers in Shenzhen against Century Cloud Core and Beijing Bitmain Technologies, based on court data compiled by CoinDesk.      Another plaintiff, Shenzhen and Hong Kong-based Youda Electronics, also filed for asset protection in March, leading to the court freezing 5.2 million yuan ($745,000) owned by Bitmain and its subsidiary. That decision was not made public until Nov. 3.      The court cases came at a time when Bitmain was struggling through the crypto market downturn seen since late last year and major layoffs at the firm in December 2018.      At an internal meeting last month, Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, admitted to staff that the firm had had suppliers pushing for clearing account payables in December of last year.      Had the overall market not rebounded since April, Bitmain may not have been able to weather the bearish 2018 period, Wu said. The company recently retooled its sales strategy in order to appear more attractive to mining customers ahead of bitcoin's scheduled halving event in May 2020.      So far, apart from the ongoing case with Yongjiang, the rest of the trade disputes filed this year have all been withdrawn by their respective plaintiffs.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/16/bitmains-miner-manufacturing-subsidiary-had-680k-in-assets-frozen-in-a-contract-dispute,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc5064b88aba0e1fa170fa422fe1bdd1ef79fe8b-1500x1029.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403673,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgWit,1576472400,Founder of Bitmain Rival MicroBT Arrested for Alleged Embezzlement,"Yang Zuoxing, founder and CEO of Shenzhen-based bitcoin miner maker MicroBT, has been arrested for the alleged embezzlement of about $15,000.      The arrest, noted by the Shenzhen Nanshan District Prosecutor on Dec. 12 and reported by business publication Caixin on Sunday, comes amid ongoing battles between mining giant Bitmain and MicroBT, which has been a rising competitor this year challenging Bitmain's market dominance.      The Shenzhen district prosecutor said on its website last Thursday that it has recently authorized the arrest of a suspect named Yang *Xing (name partially redacted) on the allegation of embezzlement and the criminal case is still ongoing.      Caixin said in the report, citing people familiar with the case, that the person arrested is indeed the founder and CEO of MicroBT, which manufactures the WhatsMiner bitcoin mining equipment with about 40 percent of the market share. The alleged embezzlement amount is 100,000 yuan, or about $15,000, the report said.      The arrest follows media reports early November that Yang had been taken away by local police to assist an investigation over possible IP dispute, though that might not necessarily mean he was arrested at the time.      It also comes at a time when MicroBT is gaining serious market share in the bitcoin miner maker business while Bitmain's dominance has been waning over 2019. Notably, Yang was taken away by police after Jihan Wu, co-founder if Bitmain regained control of his firm by ousting his rival co-founder and chairman Micree Zhan.      While the prosecutor didn't specify whether the alleged embezzlement relates to Yang's own firm or his former employer Bitmain, the report said it followed Bitmain's move of escalating its failed civil lawsuit against Yang to a criminal case by reporting to police in Beijing with charges against him for trade secrets infringement.      MicroBT and Bitmain declined to comment on the case.      Yang was a former mining chip design director at Beijing-based Bitmain, responsible for developing the mining giant's flagship AntMiner S7 and S9 models around 2016. Bitmain made $1 billion in profits by selling those models in 2017 and $1 billion in profits in the first half of 2018.      Yang left the firm to start MicroBT after his negotiation with Bitmain co-founders for the firm's equity fell through. Bitmain brought up a civil case against Yang and MicroBT in 2017, alleging him of infringing a patent Bitmain was granted for bitcoin mining equipment.      In October 2018, Yang's team successfully appealed to the intellectual property court in China to void Bitmain's awarded patent and hence the civil case was dismissed.      MicroBT launched its latest WhatsMiner M30 product last week that features a computing power at 88 tera hashes per second.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/16/founder-of-bitmain-rival-microbt-arrested-for-alleged-embezzlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bd11bb98bedd80e6189ca7c691d7a50ccf4424f-1500x868.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
