Compared with the price trend for the past few years, BTC has not made an impressive move in 2022. Instead, the token has been held bound in a bearish grip that no one expected.

42411763,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfWxP,1663104895,What Is CC0? The Copyright Designation Buzzing in the NFT Space,"Over the past two years non-fungible tokens (NFT) have exploded in popularity, with blue-chip projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) or CryptoPunks selling anywhere from several thousand to over a million dollars per NFT. Celebrities have even endorsed some NFT projects, including World of Women, which drew in an exclusive partnership with Reese Witherspoon’s production company Hello Sunshine in February.  While some in the crypto space are skeptical that the wave of profile picture (PFP)-focused NFT projects will remain relevant, many holders are hopeful about the potential long-term value of NFTs through intellectual property rights and a copyright designation known as CC0.  NFTs and intellectual property (IP) ownership  NFTs are digital assets that exist on a blockchain. They are unique and cannot be replicated, and are used to verify ownership of an item.  To those unfamiliar with digital collectibles, buying an NFT can be confusing because owning one does not necessarily equate to a physical, real-life asset. In this way, it is often difficult to understand what you actually “own” when you purchase an NFT.  One of the ways NFT communities have made the value of their NFTs more concrete is by giving holders exclusive access to events, membership groups, merchandise and long-term perks. This approach is known as “utility.” But more valuable than unlocking perks, some argue, is the long-lasting value of intellectual property (IP).  Purchasing an NFT creates an indelible record of ownership that lives on the blockchain. Like sticking a flag post into the moon, purchasing an NFT tells the world that you own a piece of digital artwork – and with that ownership may come the right to commodify it.  “Intellectual property is like an umbrella term,” says Jeff D. Karas, a financial lawyer who focuses on crypto and digital assets. Under the umbrella of intellectual property falls three legal categories of IP ownership: trademark, patents and copyright.  From T-shirts to baseball caps to liquor and even to cereal and candles – owning an NFT might give you the right to reprint the art associated with it and stamp it all over any kind of good you may want to sell, depending on the ownership rights a project affords its holders.  For example, BAYC parent company Yuga Labs released the IP rights to CryptoPunks and Meebits in August 2022, outlining how owners could use their NFTs for derivative works. Prior to this, BAYC holder Andy Nguyen opened a physical burger joint in Long Beach, California, based on the likeness of his NFT, Bored Ape #6184, that he purchased in March for 90 ether (ETH), or about US$267,000.  The value of the NFT, in Nguyen’s case, was not in the JPEG or the metadata attached to the NFT, but the record of ownership documenting his right to use the IP for his fast-food business.  Meanwhile, the NFT licensing startup Snowdrop is creating a newsletter and branding service that connects NFT holders with companies that want to use their artwork for products like moisturizers and beverages.  CC0, explained  However, there are some NFT enthusiasts who believe NFT artwork shouldn’t belong to just a single person or company. A growing trend in the NFT world is a copyright classification known as CC0, which refers to a specific “no rights reserved” copyright.  CC0 is the most permissive of Creative Commons licenses. Under CC0, a creator can share content in its entirety for any purpose, even commercially. Anyone, without having to ask permission, may use the work in any way they like, including to display, perform, reproduce, publish and modify the work.  According to Karas, CC0 classification is similar to a public domain classification, which usually includes classic artwork and works by artists who are no longer living.  A CC0 classification allows creators of digital content – including code, text, music, photos and videos – to waive all copyright and related rights on their creative works. CC0 does not give one person exclusive rights over the work, nor does it put any limits on how others can use or share it.  Some argue that CC0 classifications give projects more value because there’s no limit on how many times a person’s NFT may be reproduced. Nouns, an experimental Etheruem-based CC0 project, has generated millions in trading volume through spinoff projects and derivative artwork. The project is based solely on the premise that the more widely shared derivative art is, the more value the original NFT will become.  CCO controversy  The profile picture collection Moonbirds made a splash in early August after announcing the project will transition to a CC0 license, rather than giving NFT holders exclusive rights to use the Moonbirds IP.  Needless to say, not all NFT holders were happy. Some complained that they had to pull out of licensing deals once Moonbirds announced the switch over to CC0 because they no longer owned the exclusive right to license the artwork.  Downside of CC0  While CC0 classifications are democratic in nature, they may present a double-edged sword, according to Karas.  “There are all these great derivative projects out there, but maybe you don't want all the new projects because maybe they're incongruent with your project’s morals,” he says.  For instance, if an extremist group used an artist’s CC0 image to incite violence and the image became a viral meme, that situation could damage the reputation of the artist, the NFT community and the artwork itself.  “That's the strong argument where it might make sense to hold on to your IP rights as a project, because you get to control the narrative,” Karas explains.  But not everyone thinks the downside of CC0 renders it useless. Many believe that openly sharing artwork fulfills the true spirit of art because there are no limits or constraints preventing it from being freely shared. Some folks, such as members of the CC0 investment decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) C0C0 believe in supporting CC0 ecosystems because they foster a culture of open-source information sharing, which some consider to be core to the Web3 ethos.  Meanwhile, top VC firm a16z recently made the argument for new types of NFT IP licenses inspired by the work of Creative Commons, dubbing them the “Can’t Be Evil” licenses.

42394762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVT02,1663103916,Ordered Chaos: Why the CoinDesk Market Index Matters for the New Economy,"For a viable capital market to form around a nascent industry, investors need a standardized, broad-based benchmark against which to measure and assess performance. Without it, they are flying blind.  With the newly launched CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), CoinDesk Indices (CDI) is seeking to resolve that challenge for investors in digital assets. The CMI brings a clarity of vision that was previously lacking from the sprawling, opaque, poorly categorized crypto economy.  There’s a reason a trusted index had not yet arisen for crypto. A technology with huge potential to disrupt multiple sectors and a dizzying array of projects (of sometimes dubious quality) requires detailed, rigorous analysis to define and weight the various constituents of an appropriate index.  For one, because the services and use cases of the decentralized crypto economy don’t easily match the framework of the old, centralized one, there are significant challenges simply to categorize the many digital assets in the market. Identifying the different digital asset sectors and determining which assets belong to each one requires clear-headed analysis and consistently applied rules.  Secondly, the market data needed to compile the index constituents is not always reliable. Rogue actors – who may be incentivized to distort prices and volumes – are uniquely empowered via pseudonymity to use strategies such as wash trading to do so. There’s also a lot of inconsistency across the many exchanges around the world that list the same assets but under very different regulatory and operational frameworks.  Rigorous framework  With the CMI, the CDI team has tackled both challenges head on.  The first has been addressed by CoinDesk’s groundbreaking Digital Assets Classification Standard (DACS), the first of its kind, launched back in December. Under the DACS, more than 500 of the largest digital assets have each been assigned to an industry defined by its technology and use case. Currently, each digital asset is assigned to one of 36 industries, and each industry is assigned to one of 23 industry groups. Finally, each industry group is placed within one of six distinct sectors: currency, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi), culture & entertainment, computing, and digitization.  This consistently applied framework is the foundation for the CoinDesk family of market benchmarks. There, the broad CMI is accompanied by six subindices representing the six DACS sectors, along with an ex-stablecoins market index and an ex-stablecoins currency index, both of which limit the influence of market movements to tokens that are intended to rise or fall versus the U.S. dollar.  The CMI family can be used in a variety of ways. The broad market index can be a single proxy for the entire investable crypto asset class, helping traditional investors decide how much of their portfolio to allocate to digital assets. It can also allow observers to assess active fund managers’ performance relative to that benchmark.  Drilling down, investors can use the subindices to rank different sector-focused funds – funds purely focused on bitcoin, for example, or on smart contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana. Or those same subindices can be used as part of a sector rotation strategy or to help determine the nuanced sector-by-sector allocations of an effective, diversified, cross-crypto investment strategy.  As for the challenge of data integrity, CoinDesk is uniquely positioned as the market leader with the most experience working with the challenging crypto data set. In November 2014, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) was launched as the first-ever crypto index. Since then it has been reliably calculating every second of bitcoin’s pricing through pitfalls of variable data.  Given the number of exchanges supplying bitcoin prices, a methodology and tech stack designed to expel unreliable variant data was designed to provide a trustworthy price.  CDI’s Single Digital Asset Price Index Methodology (PDF) has proven through time to withstand the volatility and anomalies enough to support approximately 75% of the assets under management across all crypto tracking products  When it comes to the CMI, the knowledge gained from evaluating exchanges and data helps maintain the integrity to create a broad-based index that makes sense for the market. The index’s methodology narrows the DACS digital asset universe – down from more than 500 to currently 148 – by imposing the following criteria on tokens’ eligibility: First, they must be classified in the latest DACS report; second, they must be listed on at least two of CoinDesk’s carefully vetted list of eligible exchanges for a minimum of 30 days; and third, they must be available for CoinDesk Indices to apply its reference price calculation, which occurs approximately every five seconds and uses a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) from at least two contributing exchanges over the prior 60 minutes.  The constituents that meet these requirements are then weighted by market capitalization. The CMI index family is calculated in real-time using reference rates for each asset. The index is reconstituted and rebalanced monthly.  A lens on the crypto story  As asset managers and other service providers license these indices to offer specialized investment vehicles designed to mimic or contrast with the indices’ performance, we foresee an interconnected environment in which different providers of liquidity arise on both sides of each trade.  The DACS-powered CMI is more than a much-needed tool for digital asset investors, however. It is a critical lens through which to observe the larger crypto economy.  The CMI brings structure to the process by which investors define and value the myriad digital assets in existence, bringing order to the otherwise chaotic world of crypto. As such, we see the CMI as a narrative device, a means by which to describe a more cohesive picture of the crypto economy, a framework with which to talk about, assess, and compare the many tokens, protocols, and dApps that comprise it.  Just as the Dow Jones Industrial Average helped define American capitalism within the centralized paradigms of the 20th century, the CMI can help frame the 21st century’s emerging decentralized digital economy in which people exchange currency, property, services and data peer to peer, without the intervention of middlemen.  That’s why it’s especially appropriate that CoinDesk, the leading media organization for the crypto and blockchain community, is driving this effort to advance the CMI. As a trusted chronicler of that economy’s evolution, CoinDesk Media is not only best placed to objectively determine the elements of this new narrative device, it can use this storytelling tool to bring clarity to the evolution of crypto technology in the public interest.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Jodie Gunzberg - CoinDesk Indices, Michael J.

42394775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVTBq,1663102820,"Market Wrap: US Inflation Data Roils Markets, Bitcoin and Ether Fall","Price Action  Risk markets declined across the board after inflation data disappointed investors on Tuesday.  August’s consumer price index (CPI) data showed an unexpectedly high 8.3% increase in prices versus expectations for an 8.1% increase. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 6.3% versus forecasts of 6.1%  Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell immediately on the news, declining 5% during the 12:00 UTC hour, when the inflation data was released. BTC was recently up more than 9%. Volume was robust, with trading volumes approximately seven times higher than its average 20 day volume. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap fell below $21,000.  Ether (ETH) prices moved in concert with BTC, falling 6.27% during the 12:00 UTC hour, and more recently about 7.5%. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap also traded on higher-than-average volume. ETH’s decline comes ahead of its much-anticipated Merge upgrade from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, now expected to occur around Sept. 15.  Economic Calendar: Today’s inflation figures will get the bulk of attention across markets. The larger-than-expected inflation number sets up an aggressive interest rate hike during the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) next meeting  The CME FedWatch Tool, which is used to evaluate the probabilities of FOMC rate moves, now forecasts an 82% probability that rates will increase by 75 basis points (down from 91%), during the upcoming Fed meeting.  The 9% chance of a 50 basis point increase set Monday has gone to zero Tuesday. Markets now project an 18% chance of a 100 basis point increase.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities markets were down, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500, down 3.9% and 4.3%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 5.3% and is on track for its worst period since May 2020  Commodities: The price of crude oil fell 0.2% while that of natural gas increased 1.9%. Despite being viewed as a traditional safe haven asset, gold fell 1.5%. Copper prices declined 2.2%  The Dollar Index (DXY) increased 1.22%, maintaining its inverse relationship to BTC prices.  Altcoins were down. The Polygon blockchain’s MATIC declined 8% while Polkadot’s DOT and Avalanche’s AVAX fell 7% and 10%, respectively.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $20,272 −9.5%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,615 −6.4%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $1,019 −7.1%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,932.69 −4.3%        ● Gold: $1,712 per troy ounce −0.9%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.42% +0.06        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC and ETH markets all seeing red.  There’s little confusion around what occurred in crypto and traditional markets Tuesday. The 8.3% inflation figure disappointed investors across the board, the odds increased that the Federal Reserve will continue its hawkish pace of interest rate hikes and assets sold off as a result.  As highlighted in an earlier CoinDesk report, annual inflation slowed from July’s 8.5% reading but was less than expectations of 8.1%. Month over month, inflation figures disappointed as well, given the forecast of a 0.2% decline in prices as opposed to the 0.1% increase that occurred.  Over the past two weeks, Fed officials have reiterated their commitment to quell inflation, which stands near four-decade highs. They now have additional data to support their stance. How investors respond to Fed actions is an evolving theme that may continue to rock already volatile asset markets.  Investor expectations for a 75 basis point increase have remained consistently high and are likely to continue at that level until the FOMC meets Sept. 21, even if the possibility of a 100 basis point hike was floated Tuesday.  Both BTC and ETH’s hourly charts highlight the sharp sell-off during the 12:00 UTC hour. Both assets moved into oversold territory when using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a measuring stick for price momentum as well. A distinction between the two assets is the bid that ETH seemed to catch during the 15:00 UTC hour, which accelerated in subsequent hours.  In Monday’s Market Wrap the divergent catalysts for BTC and ETH were mentioned. Where BTC appears completely tied to macroeconomic news, ETH prices are also tied to this week’s Merge, which is expected to occur within the next 24-48 hours.  The pause and reversal of ETH prices shown below likely implies optimism ahead of the Merge, as traders see an opportunity to accumulate oversold ETH.  BTC prices paused their decline during the 17:00 UTC hour, but on what appears to be far less conviction than ETH’s reversal.  Altcoin Roundup  Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Timing Posted: The Merge is a technological overhaul of the Ethereum blockchain that will shift its protocol from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).

42421091,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSWr,1663100032,"Solana Co-Founder Sees Upside From Ethereum’s Merge, Saga Web 3 Mobile","Ethereum’s anticipated Merge could be the beginning of the blockchain’s expansion on a wider scale, according to Raj Gokal, chief operating officer at technology company Solana Labs.  “It’s one step for Ethereum in a long road map toward having the type of scalability that Solana has today,” Gokal said during an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.  Gokal, who is also the co-founder of the Solana blockchain, said the company wants to “see Ethereum succeed,” in part because it could drive confidence across the industry.  Read more: Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know  “We want to see the Merge succeed,” Gokal said. “It’s good for onlookers to the crypto industry to see big upgrades, release and be successful.”  The Merge, which is expected to occur in a matter of days, will shift Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol towards a faster and more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model.  Solana currently operates under a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus and a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The blockchain-based smart contract platform allows users to build and invest in crypto-native apps via the Solana blockchain. That “energy efficient” protocol was implemented from the beginning, according to Gokal.  Read more: Reminder: The Merge Won’t Solve Ethereum’s Scaling Woes by Itself  And while Ethereum’s Merge is not expected to improve scalability, throughput or cost, Gokal says those are the areas users are most concerned about, based on non-fungible token (NFT) volumes.  “From our perspective, these NFT volumes just go to show users really do care about that cost and performance,” Gokal said. Because “Ethereum is probably the largest by mindshare for NFT projects as an ecosystem,” its shift away from proof-of-work towards a less-environmentally harmful protocol, “is a really good thing.” he added.  Read more: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Timing Posted  Stacking Solana’s Saga and Apple’s iPhone 14  In June of this year, Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, said it was building “Saga,” a Web 3 mobile phone.  According to Gokal, the Android-based phone, which is expected to launch soon for $1,000 a pop, has “almost sold out” its developer kits.  When asked how the mobile phone would stack up against Apple’s iPhone 14, Gokal said he was “surprised to see that there hasn’t really been any focus on the crypto-conscious consumer.”  Read more: Solana Labs Is Building a Web3 Mobile Phone  “Given the last year of explosive growth in usage, and the fact that crypto is arguably going more mainstream, we expected Apple would be launching crypto-native features in iPhone 13 and that Google [and] Samsung would be doing the same” on their own phones, Gokal said.  The market continues to be “open and hungry for this type of product,” according to Gokal, who added that tapping into that sub-segment of consumer electronic purchasers could drive a significant amount of volume for crypto, especially if the “right 50,000 or 100,000” tap in.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/13/solana-co-founder-sees-upside-from-ethereums-merge-saga-web-3-mobile,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9dc76e79511631272f06e90b3cb13d59fe85073-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394778,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVTDo,1663099269,4 Things Blockchain Analysts Are Saying About the Ethereum Merge,"Cryptocurrency market watchers are eyeing the long-awaited Ethereum Merge this week as the network changes from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) system.  The Merge is predicted to reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by 99.95% – considered to be positive for the network's sustainability and security. Based on the latest estimates, the changeover will take place late Wednesday or early Thursday.  There’s a lot of speculation among crypto traders as to how it will all play out. The blockchain analytics platform Nansen and data firm Kaiko have published reports on what to watch.  Here are four things about the Merge that the firms are monitoring.  1. ETH funding rates  Funding rates are similar to interest rates – but for traders: It's what they pay for leverage when betting on cryptocurrencies. When they’re negative, generally speaking, it means that there’s more demand from traders to bet on price declines.  As the Merge approaches, Kaiko is keeping tabs on the funding rates in crypto markets.  While bitcoin (BTC) funding rates have recently flipped positive, ether (ETH) funding rates slipped to their most negative since July 2021, according to Kaiko’s research.  The research found that investors are increasingly turning to futures markets over spot markets to readjust their exposure ahead of the Merge, which leaves the market “primed for a potential short squeeze.”  If the Merge goes ahead successfully, one would expect these short futures positions ""to be closed out and funding to move back towards positive territory,"" which could act as a positive factor for the price of ETH post-Merge, according to Kaiko.  2. Staked ETH  Both firms are looking at staked ether (stETH) – a type of digital token from the Lido protocol that allows traders to get liquidity even when their ether is staked on the Ethereum blockchain – essentially making it locked up for a long period of time.  In theory, the stETH tokens should trade at the same price as the ether tokens they’re supposed to substitute for. In the lead-up to the Merge, though, they have been trading at a discount.  Nansen’s research showed that Lido, a staking service, holds the greatest amount of stETH at 31%, followed by Coinbase, Kraken and Binance with a combined around 30%.  Despite that each token is redeemable sometime post-Merge at a 1:1 ratio, the Kaiko researchers observed a significant discount across the three largest staked ether tokens: stETH from Lido, cbETH from Coinbase and bETH from Binance — reflecting the various risks perceived by investors.  Nansen also highlighted the technology risk of whether The Merge will be properly executed and if the PoS chain will be adopted.  The good news was the improvement in the discounts for stETH and bETH on Sept. 11, according to Kaiko. “Investors might be sufficiently happy with the discount to invest in both tokens, earning both the yield from the staked ETH as well as the price discount once the token is redeemable 1:1.”  3. Ethereum classic derivatives  Ethereum Classic, a blockchain similar to Ethereum that’s expected to remain proof-of-work following the Merge, has gained significant traction since July, according to Kaiko.  Researchers observed strong capital inflows into its ETC token's perpetual futures contracts as Ethereum miners shift computational resources to the PoW chain, according to Kaiko.  ""The trend will likely continue as last week the second largest Ethereum mining pool, F2Pool, announced it will halt ETH mining in September and transition to Ethereum Classic (ETC) instead,"" the report read.  4. Smart money  Nansen researchers said that ETH millionaires and billionaires – large holders – have consistently been stacking ether since the beginning of this year, seemingly without being fazed by volatile markets.  Yet the ”smart money,” as Nansen describes it – the capital controlled by institutional investors – has started scaling in after a low in mid-June, researchers pointed out. “They are anticipating some positive price action around the Merge,” according to Nansen.",NEUTRAL,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/13/four-things-blockchain-analysts-are-saying-about-the-ethereum-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a732a3cc49560eeba32ef2a2184ccf697dd61cd6-4992x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411384,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNR0H,1663095600,SEC's Gensler Holds Firm That Existing Laws Make Sense for Crypto,"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler told the Practising Law Institute last week that existing securities laws fit the crypto markets in a speech that’s garnered attention from all parts of the digital currency ecosystem. Prior to the speech, I had the opportunity to speak with the longtime regulator about his agency’s approach to crypto.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Gensler's words  The narrative  SEC Chair Gary Gensler was one of CoinDesk’s 2021 Most Influential honorees for his role running the federal regulator. He spoke to CoinDesk ahead of last week’s speech on cryptocurrencies and how they fit into federal regulations, echoing comments he made in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal last month.  Why it matters  The following interview has been edited for clarity. You can also watch the video above.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk: Thank you so much for joining me and agreeing to speak about all things crypto. I know it must be one of your favorite subjects. I wonder if we could get things started with previewing your speech to the SEC Speaks [program] tomorrow. You're talking about crypto, you're addressing a lot of I want to say frequently heard complaints from the crypto industry that the SEC is not doing enough to provide clarity. You do seem to address that head on. So I’m wondering if you could just speak to how you are looking at this issue. What are the top-of-mind issues for you when you're talking about crypto regulation?  SEC Chair Gensler: So, Nik, good to be with you, good to be with an audience of CoinDesk subscribers or viewers. I think about investing in the context of markets. We had the Securities and Exchange Commission set up nearly 90 years ago, and it was to protect the investing public. And the speech that you reference, I start with those foundational things around President [Franklin] Roosevelt [and] Congress [and] what they tried to put together, and the first chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Joe Kennedy [father of later President John Kennedy and senators Robert and Ted Kennedy].  And so I think of it in that context. And 90 years later those basic bargains are really what it's about when somebody is raising money from the public – the public gets to decide which risks they take. We at the Securities and Exchange Commission are not a merit regulator. If you want to take a risk, take a risk. But we are, and what our regime is about, is about disclosure, making sure there's full and fair and truthful disclosure. Even President Roosevelt called it the “truth in securities act,” the first of our four key acts. And so I think of it all in that context.  Satoshi Nakamoto writes the white paper Halloween night in 2008 – a number of years later, people start to invest in it, they're buying and selling it. Some years later, we start to see other coins, other tokens. And, you know, if you just look at coinmarketcap.com, there's like 10,000 or so tokens listed there. Some have more liquidity than others, of course, and some have more value than others. But what is the investing public doing? They're investing for a better future, based upon the efforts of others. There [are] websites you go to, Medium posts that you read, there's Crypto Twitter, there's Reddit forums and places you can look for information. And it's about that common enterprise and that entrepreneurial effort which is the hallmark of investment contracts, which are securities. So I think that's where we are, that most of the tokens meet the traditional standards that our Supreme Court has laid out, and that we, the SEC, have a role to help protect investors and instill and enhance trust in these markets. But back to you, Nik.  Well, you know, so to your point about instilling trust to these markets, you've said on numerous occasions that you believe a lot of crypto trading platforms, which we commonly referred to as crypto exchanges, should be registered as national Securities Exchanges because in your view, and in the view of your predecessor Jay Clayton, and in the view I think of many other SEC staffers and even lawyers, a lot of cryptocurrencies do resemble securities. What's the next step?  They don't just resemble securities, they are securities. Thurgood Marshall, a great Supreme Court Justice, wrote in an opinion – and I think it was in the 1970s – that the Congress painted with a broad brush to protect the public when somebody is raising money from the public and the public anticipates a profit. That's kind of the core. And yes, the service providers, if you wish, the crypto exchanges, the crypto lending platforms, whether they call them such centralized or decentralized (so-called DeFi), they're transacting and providing services to the public. And they're providing those services around some very small handful of non-security tokens, crypto non-security tokens. But the vast number of these thousands of tokens – without prejudging any one of them – meet the standard of being a security, and thus the platforms have an obligation to come in and register, work with us and find a path forward.  Ultimately, it's about protecting the investing public and, if the investing public is investing in crypto, to have some basic protection. So we just went through a time, earlier this year, where a number of platforms went bankrupt, or they just froze out their customers. I wonder about how many of your readers got frozen out or held [cryptos], and they just get in line in bankruptcy court. Even if the platform started to honor their obligations, sometimes they were frozen for three hours or three days or a week. And there are basic protections in our securities laws that guard against that. What's more, right now, if you're investing on any one of these service providers [or] platforms, you're not getting those basic protections insuring against fraud, manipulation, what's called front-running. The platforms are an amalgam of different services. Not only are they doing what you might be familiar with at the New York Stock Exchange, but they are also … acting as a broker against you. They're like an amalgam of dealers trading against their public, they could be trading ahead of you. And our securities laws say no, that's not allowed. So there are a lot of protections that you right now are not getting the benefit from but should be because it's the law.  Right. My question is what's the next step in having these platforms registered as securities exchanges or come in?  The next step is if they successfully register, the investing crypto public can get to decide. These are, by their very nature, speculative assets. There's give or take 10,000, and pretty much any venture capitalist would probably tell you that most startups fail. That's just the nature of the economics of startups. And so the investing public will get a fuller disclosure about those individual token projects. You'd also have protections in your trading against fraud, manipulation and the transparency of those platforms, how orders are matched and the like. And that if they are also dealers, that this amalgam of different features that they're doing gets separated out.  If you have a desire to take your crypto and lend it, that you actually have some disclosures [from] the service provider providing you that interest. And remember, if somebody says reward or yield or interest or return, the label doesn't matter. It's similar to when you put your money with the money market fund and you say, well, they're going to give me a return. Then they actually have to disclose what they're doing with your money, and it's your money ultimately. What are they doing with it? Are they trading like a hedge fund or are they lending it to somebody else? Are they putting it in safe assets or more speculative assets?  I guess I should clarify. If these platforms don't come in voluntarily, which it doesn't look like any of them will, is the SEC prepared to bring enforcement actions? Is there a rulemaking process?  Nik, [the SEC has] been doing that by my predecessors. I think you can go to our website and read about it. And sometimes the entrepreneurs and service providers in this field will say, ‘what has the SEC said on this?’ The SEC has said a lot. We've, as a commission, as a five-member commission – I've spoken to this numerous times, dozens and dozens of times, every enforcement action – it's voted on by a five member commission, by my predecessor commissions and then I'm what I'm honored to chair, we’ve spoken about it directly.  In 2017, five years ago, in two really important circumstances, something called the DAO Report, and the Munchee order, both in 2017, [we] laid out – consistent with Supreme Court cases – when tokens are securities, and so it's actually pretty straightforward there. And we are a cop on the beat. That's what Congress set up in the 1930s. But we work with market participants and, and I said this, quoting Joe Kennedy, the first chair of the SEC, who spoke clearly on this – he said, “no honest business need fear the SEC.” Come in, we will look to see how we can facilitate compliance using those tools in our regulatory toolkit. We have various tools that the community understands about how to try to fit this in.  Look, I'm technology neutral. Before I was in this job, I was not so technology neutral, maybe. I was honored to be at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studying and researching and teaching on the intersection of finance and new technology, around artificial intelligence and finance, but also around this topic, crypto markets and finance. And the job I’m in now, I'm technology neutral. I mentioned that to give you a sense of where I come from, but I'm not public policy neutral.  I think that the investing public not only deserves to be respected and to get its basic disclosure and anti-manipulation [and] anti-fraud protections, but also other issuers, other companies and entrepreneurs that raise money, need to have somewhat of a level playing field here. I think, without that, this field can't reach any of the goals that many of the readers of CoinDesk might believe. If you believe in crypto, and I know there are both people that believe in it and don't believe in it, but if you believe in it and you want to invest in it, I would say this. Few things ever persist without coming into basic public policy perimeters protecting investors, not undermining our capital markets or our financial stability at large. Being inside of the remit of fostering just legal activity and not illicit activity. Those are our basic bargains in our economy.  There's a lot to unpack in all of that. We're seeing enforcement actions being brought against companies that conducted initial coin offerings as far back as 2017, 2018. Is the SEC able to keep up with the sheer numbers, the 10,000 cryptocurrencies out there, or does the agency need more resources to address that?  I thank you for raising that. I joined an agency about a year and a quarter ago that had actually shrunk about 5% in the prior four or five years. And the capital markets, as we all know, had grown quite significantly, not just in value but in complexity and numbers of public companies, number of investors, and then this crypto field came up.  Though it's give or take upon this recording a trillion dollars of worldwide asset value, the U.S. capital markets are a little over $100 trillion in total. So we've got a lot going on. I'm really proud of this agency, but we had shrunk about 5%. So absolutely, I think that we should be at least where we were in 2016, and should be above that. We should have grown in this period of time.  I would say this to any of the lawyers and accountants and entrepreneurs out there that are advising folks in this field: If you're in, if you're thinking about doing a project, come in, talk to us, let's get it right. If you've been doing a project for three, six years and so forth, don't wait for us to knock on your door. But I would say this also, Nik, this is a very concentrated ecosystem, some would say otherwise. But there's really a handful – five, eight, crypto exchange platforms – that have the dominant market share. Similarly in so called lending platforms, even though a handful of them just went bankrupt. Also in the so-called decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, these are highly concentrated actors and players, they often have hundreds of tokens and so on.  So given what we've discussed, it's highly likely they have securities on them. Come in, work with us, work on getting the right facilitation around your exchange function, your broker-dealer function, your custodial or clearing house function, your lending. We've spoken in a clear voice. I mean, over a year ago, in a speech, I said, “Make no mistake, if you have a platform, and you're lending or borrowing crypto securities, you've got to come in and work with us and get registered.” And we did that with a company named BlockFi earlier this year. And we're still sorting through in the crypto lending space. So there's a path forward here.  Do you think that, not necessarily the SEC specifically but some of these lenders that are currently bankrupt – we've heard that numerous state regulators and the SEC have been looking into quite a few of them. Celsius Network, for example, just today, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation said that over 40 states are looking into Celsius’ operations. But that hasn't stopped these companies from taking investors' money. And then, as you pointed out, [Celsius is] currently going through bankruptcy proceedings. Is there something more that regulators could be doing to be proactive on this issue, to have prevented getting to a point where these companies are built up, and they have this huge customer base and then they go to the courts and say, ‘we need some bankruptcy protections while we try to restructure our operations’?  So, for your listening public, let me just explain, I can't speak to any one company. I can speak about things in the past as I did the settlement with one company as I did about BlockFi or the DAO Report from 2017. So let me just go to a more generic general question that I think you have. I think the investing public, whether you want to go and buy crypto or even, you think that it's all too highly priced in so you want to short it. And remember, those risks are your choices. Whether you're pro or you want to go short, that, entirely your choices. There's a role for the official sector. The bulk of the tokens, though maybe not the bulk of the market value in crypto, but the bulk of the tokens have entrepreneurs at the middle, have a website, you're reading the Reddit post, you're reading the Medium and Crypto Twitter, you're following those, and there's somebody in that middle generally touting that.  We're trying to help and look out for you. On these concentrated actors, the centralized actors, the exchanges, the lending the custody, the so-called DeFi, right now you're not getting the compliance. The investing public is not only taking a risk on crypto, but you're also taking a risk that the platforms are even doing what they're saying they're doing. I think that we're actually aligned with the crypto investing public more than sometimes the news would report. I do think that in terms of the lending platforms, it's unambiguous. Because it doesn't matter what you hand over to a platform, if you hand over gold, if you hand over bitcoin, or you hand over any one of 1,000 plus alternative coins. Frankly, if you hand over chinchillas, that the platform is taking those funds of value and doing something with it, they might be operating a hedge fund, they might be lending it out, they might be operating other investment schemes.  That platform is under the securities laws book because of how they've taken that money from you. You deserve the benefits of disclosure and certain investor protections. And we're going to continue to be leaning into that. But at the same time, trying to work with the platforms, the service providers, there's probably only 20 or 30 that you really cover at CoinDesk actively. I apologize, maybe you're going to tell me that you cover a lot more lending and exchanges and platforms. It's a pretty concentrated market share.  Yeah, I mean, I can't speak with any certainty as to how much we cover. We've grown quite a bit in the last couple years. I do know, we have written about some of the potential dangers posed by these same companies that we're now talking about. But, you know, it brings you back to my first question, which is what role does or should the SEC have in being more active with these lenders, with these trading platforms, and all these other service providers that refuse to [register]. They believe that they don't need to come in to talk to the SEC or register. At what point does it go from an invitation to something more forceful?  So, let me let me close on this, because I know our time is about up. I think that the platforms would be prudent to take the opportunity and work with us. We are a cop on the beat. And that's what Congress wants, that laws and roles are meaningful. As everybody knows, if there wasn't a cop, things would get a little messy on the highway. If I could just do an analogy to football. I mean, what would the game of football look like if we didn't have rules of the play and everything and there were no refs on the field?  Congress writes the ultimate laws, but we are the ones that have to oversee the markets, like the refs on the field, and write some of the on-field roles. That game of football would look really messy after a while, and after a while it wouldn't even look like rugby. It would be really messy. And the fans wouldn't want to come after a while. I just think that you're right. There is a role to work with these companies and service providers, both in the intermediary space and the token space. But also we're going to be a vigorous cop on the beat. We're going to work very closely with our colleagues at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, because part of this market, what I'll call crypto non-security tokens, I think it's very few tokens, but, again, they have a lot of market value.  We're gonna work with our colleagues at the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve around stablecoins and ensuring that there's the appropriate safety and soundness in those markets as well.  And our international colleagues, I mean, there's a lot to be done here. If we're successful, there'll be more trust in these markets and investors will get to decide and entrepreneurs will decide and projects will win or lose or fail, based on their inherent risks. But right now we've got another set of risks. And it's the risk of non-compliance with investor protection or non-compliance with broader safety and soundness public policies, and working with our fellow regulators. We're going to continue to use the authorities Congress gave us but also the mandates to help best protect the public.  Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it.  All right. Thank you, you be well.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  I think I'm going to replace this chart in the coming weeks as it seems pretty static now. Anyone have thoughts or suggestions on what I should have up here instead?  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) Former U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated federal Judge Raymond Dearie to be a special master who can review the materials seized by the Department of Justice to verify whether they were classified or not, a nomination the DOJ says it will agree with. I’m flagging this largely because Judge Dearie ruled in 2018 that the federal government could prosecute (alleged) initial coin offering frauds under securities laws.

But one of the more exciting crypto application niches is betting. It is no secret that people love betting, given that it is a billion-dollar global industry. But what happens when betting is given an innovative crypto touch? The answer is Zikbo, a crypto betting and sports gaming platform. The company has made waves for its unique algorithm which allows users to play fixed bets, bet against each other, bet on events, and many more. We speak with Richard Brooks, COO of Zikbo about betting, the crypto industry, and what is next now that the company has made the leap into the betting sector. 1. What inspired the creation of Zikbo? &apos;There are many different offers with events and odds in the betting world now. They are difficult to understand for both a professional and a beginner.

42411383,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQjk,1663091677,Nansen Casts Doubt on Merge-Initiated Staked ETH Sell-Off,"Nansen, a blockchain analytics firm, published a report on Monday addressing one of the principal fears raised by Ethereum’s monumental Merge event expected this week: that a significant number of so-called “stakers” could cause a major sell-off of ether (ETH) the second they get the chance.  Sometime this week, if all goes according to plan, Ethereum developers will pull off the most sophisticated network upgrade in crypto’s short 13-year history. In an event called the Merge, Ethereum will port over its network security from the bank of miners that for years expended computing power to race for block rewards and transaction fees, using a system called “proof-of-work,” to a new model where ETH holders “prove” their stake in the blockchain.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  People have been able to stake ETH since the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020, by locking up their assets but earning rewards along the way. Some $20 billion worth of ETH has been staked to date, accounting for 11% of ether’s supply.  According to Nansen, more than 70% of all staked ETH is worth less today than when it was purchased. This is conceivably a good thing, the researchers argue, as ETH holders in the red are less likely to sell their assets into the market. Only 18% of so-called illiquid stakers (those who used a third-parties to stake) are “in profit.”  Even more to the point, ETH stakers will have to wait another six to 12 months until the so-called Shanghai upgrade before they can unlock their bags. The Ethereum Foundation has also proposed a sort of “withdrawal queue” meant to prevent a mass sell-off.  Nansen again crunched the numbers and found that if all current ETH stakers want to sell their holdings, the queue would extend for 300 days.  While a mass sell-off of staked ETH is improbable, there’s still the chance that people who bought ETH recently specifically to trade on the headline-making event will sell after the Merge is completed. Buy the rumor, sell the news.  See also: Sell the Ethereum Merge | Opinion  Nansen’s research found other concerning details. Just five entities account for over 64% of all staked ether. Of those, three are exchanges – Coinbase (COIN), Kraken and Binance – accounting for 30% of staked ETH. Lido, an open financial platform run by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), holds the largest share of 31% of staked ETH.  This sort of concentration raises serious concerns about Ethereum’s “credible neutrality,” and the chance that base-layer transactions could be censored. And that’s not purely theoretical: Following the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanction of Tornado Cash that effectively banned all U.S. users from touching the service, Ethereum validators will need to determine whether they blacklist wallets associated with that protocol.  It’s the type of problem that doesn’t have a technical fix.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/13/nansen-casts-doubt-on-merge-initiated-staked-eth-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/017e71dd290dd577edc30f0015b08ab48c11a275-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVSv7,1663091528,"Binance Sued in Italy Over Exchange Outages, Hearing This Week","Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance is due to appear in an Italian court on Thursday over a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of investors seeking damages for losses suffered during platform outages at critical trading times last year.  A group of Italian and international Binance users filed suit against the company and CEO Changpeng Zhao in November 2021, citing multiple incidents when the platform went offline and locked users out of the exchange. The investors allege the outages made it impossible for them to change their trading positions and led to “tens of millions” in losses.  Binance is not the only crypto exchange to go offline when trading volumes go up. When big news drives crypto prices up, traders flock to exchanges, and exchanges have historically tended to buckle under the pressure. One incident cited by the disgruntled investors occurred in February 2021, when multiple high-profile crypto trading platforms like Binance, Kraken and Gemini experienced technical issues due to increased trading loads over news that Elon Musk’s Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin.  The suit also alleges Binance violated Italy’s financial regulations when it let Italian users trade leveraged futures on the platform. Futures are trading agreements to sell an asset at a set price and time in the future.  Read more: Exchange Outages Are Going Mainstream: What Robinhood Can Learn From Crypto  Legal action against the exchange was already taking shape when Italy’s financial regulator warned in July last year that Binance was not authorized to provide investment services in the country. Earlier this year, Binance was approved to register in a regulator-maintained list of crypto service providers in Italy. The registration itself does not imply compliance with local regulations and is only a precursor to subjecting firms to anti-money laundering standards in the country.  Day in court  Last year, a group of Italian Binance users approached the Swiss blockchain consortium looking for advice on how to recover losses tied to outages, according to Michele Ficara Manganelli, director of the consortium.  “Being Italian-speaking and having a more advanced market than the Italian one, we are one of the main points of reference for Italian investors,” Manganelli said in an email to CoinDesk. The consortium called in Milan-based law firm Lexia Avvocati to represent the investors.  Although Binance did offer to compensate affected investors, the proposed compensation was a “negligible” amount, according to Francesco Dagnino, managing partner at Lexia Avvocati.  “We've been told by some investors that even those who accepted were not refunded,” Dagnino said during an interview with CoinDesk, referring to Binance’s offer to compensate users for losses sustained due to the outages.  Binance was also offering futures trading to Italian customers without regulatory approval and without complying with local laws, Dagnino said, addressing the other allegation against Binance. “It is absolutely clear that when you are selling a future, especially with that type of leverage, it doesn't matter what the underlying asset is, it’s always a derivative and always a financial product,” Dagnino said.  Read more: Crypto Futures Trading, Explained  Dagnino said the next step is for the court to decide on whether it will accept the class-action lawsuit, after which investors can begin to join the suit. There are at least 100 investors involved in the case, but more will join, Dagnino said. Manganelli added that the suit will be open to Italian and European Binance investors seeking damages.  Binance has not yet joined the proceeding, which means it has not filed any statements of defense before the deadline set at 10 days before the hearing. Dagnino says it’s not mandatory to file anything, and although he is uncertain if Binance will show up at the hearing, he’s hopeful it will, given the company’s recent efforts to register an office in Italy and be entered into the list of virtual asset service providers operating in the country.  “[Binance] made major announcements about their interest in the Italian market and the Italian people. So I don't know. … I would expect that they want to clarify these matters. But we will see,” Dagnino said.  If someone from Binance does not show up on Sept. 15 at the Court of Milan, a judge will decide on the case without Binance present and the company will lose the right to file statements of defense.  Following the publication of this article, Binance responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment with a written statement that said it aims to address users' concerns swiftly.  ""Like any other organization, we are limited in what we can share in the context of legal proceedings. Putting users first has been a core tenet for Binance since our founding. When issues arise, we strive to take care of users to the best of our ability,"" the statement said.

It will initially focus on only a ""handful"" of tokens including bitcoin (BTC) that its lawyers are confident aren't securities – thus avoiding a regulatory drama still playing out in Washington.  The firm, EDX Markets, is backed by the two largest U.S. retail brokers, Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Fidelity Investments (through its digital-assets arm). Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial (VIRT), two of the biggest trading firms in U.S. stocks, and investment firms Paradigm and Sequoia Capital are also supporting the venture, and EDX expects others to join the group.  Read more: Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity, Other Wall Street Firms Start Crypto Exchange EDX Markets  It's seeking to nudge crypto toward the low costs seen in U.S. stocks, EDX CEO Jamil Nazarali said in an interview Tuesday. He gave a theoretical example of an investor seeking to buy $5,000 worth of an S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, whose cost for that trade – as measured by the cut, known as the spread, an intermediary would take to complete the transaction – would likely be a few pennies. A similar-sized BTC trade might now cost $25, Nazarali said.  ""This market structure costs individual investors a lot of money,"" Nazarali said. ""We want to bring a lot of those efficiencies [seen in stocks] to the digital marketplace.""  The securities question  U.S. regulators are in the process of sorting out whether some crypto assets are actually securities and thus deserving of more oversight. EDX is sidestepping that battle. At launch, it will offer only ""a handful of tokens that we feel good are not securities,"" Nazarali said. That includes bitcoin.  Nazarali, who declined to name others or quantify the exact number of tokens, said EDX will open for a pilot round of trading in November, and officially launch in January.  Read more: Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says  The retail brokers in EDX's consortium of backers will bring order flow to the exchange, and Citadel Securities (Nazarali's former employer), Virtu and potentially other market makers will execute them, a role they are familiar with from equities. Competition among market makers will be part of what leads to lower trading costs for customers, Nazarali said.  So will, he added, bringing over some of the accoutrements professional trading firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu rely on in stocks and other conventional markets.  The EDX exchange will be based in the NY4 data center in Secaucus, New Jersey, the East Coast hub for almost all trading in U.S. financial markets, besides the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which operate out of data centers elsewhere in New Jersey.  That opens up the possibility of colocation – jargon for allowing exchange customers to house their computers inside the same data center. Crypto exchanges have historically been based on cloud platforms, which makes the physical location of an exchange – and thus getting the fastest access to it – harder to pin down.  Colocation ""results in lower latency and higher determinism, which allows market makers to quote tighter prices,"" Nazarali said.  The New Jersey location also stands out because major trading firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu use fast, microwave-communications networks connecting NY4 to another important colocation-offering exchange elsewhere in the U.S.: CME Group (CME), which is housed in a data center in Aurora, Illinois, outside Chicago. CME lists bitcoin futures contracts, giving professional traders on EDX a fairly obvious place to offset risk if they are trading BTC itself.  Robinhood Markets and other major U.S. retail brokers not presently listed among EDX's backers outsource crypto trades to third parties for execution, including Jump Crypto, the digital-asset division of a trading firm Citadel Securities and Virtu compete with in traditional markets.  Nazarali said he would love to lure that volume to EDX. ""We want all of that to come on exchange, and we think that that'll be good for the retail broker-dealers,"" he said. ""We want Jump to be a big market maker on EDX.""  As for why he made the leap from traditional finance to crypto – he had been a senior executive at Citadel Securities – Nazarali said the energy in the ecosystem was a draw.  ""There's a lot of younger people,"" he said. ""There's a lot of dynamism, and it's quite energizing.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/wall-street-titans-new-crypto-exchange-aims-to-seriously-cut-costs-for-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42e9dd7f5ba5a9d2fa1240ee35dac638bf27f52d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto miners, and those on the Bitcoin network in particular, have been facing severe criticism for their carbon footprint. The industry consumes as much energy as some small countries, not all of which is renewable, which has irked environmentalists and authorities alike.  Through the partnership with Isla Verde, which specializes in such offerings, BlockFills will sell carbon emissions offsets and renewable energy credits (REC) and other carbon accounting instruments to miners, according to a Tuesday press release. RECs are certificates that represent the production of electricity from renewable sources.  ""Miners are seeking sustainable solutions to their challenges in the energy industry, while also fighting public scrutiny over their consumption and carbon footprint,” Neil Van Huis, a partner and director at BlockFills, said in the press release.  Isla Verde co-Chief Investment Officer Ronnie Virissimo said that ""it is becoming more imperative that all groups, particularly those on the blockchain, are proactive about reporting on and lowering their carbon footprint, with greater potential for regulation and rules to be put in place.""  Elliot David, head of strategy and partnerships at Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol, a company that is developing an on-chain product for miners looking to certify their energy use, said that ""unless a miner is holding the RECs attributed to their power consumption, they can't technically claim that they're using clean energy. As a result, we've seen miners take a wide range of existing approaches"" from nothing at all to buying high-quality RECs.

42373832,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVV7j,1663086281,Path Forward for Crypto Gets Tougher After US CPI Report Comes in Hot,"The path forward for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, may have become more challenging. The U.S. inflation rate, it turns out, isn’t slowing nearly as much as economists had predicted it would.  The latest reading comes from Tuesday’s release of the U.S. consumer price index, which showed the 12-month inflation rate slowed to 8.3% in August from 8.5% the prior month – a tiny decrease that is likely to keep investors worried about price pressures. The CPI report had been expected to slow to 8.1%. The Federal Reserve’s target for inflation is 2% annually.  Energy prices tumbled, but food prices shot up. The price index for cereals and bakery products rose 1.2% over the course of the month.  Perhaps more importantly, the core CPI rate, which excludes the impact of volatile food and energy prices and is considered a better gauge of demand-driven inflation, rose 0.6% from July, or double what was expected.  The core CPI shows the underlying inflationary pressures remain a concern and warrant a hawkish repricing of the Federal Reserve expectations, according to Jon Turek, author of the Cheap Convexity blog.  What it means for the Federal Reserve  Ahead of the data, interest-rate traders expected the Fed to hike borrowing costs by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) at the U.S. central bank’s monetary-policy meeting next week, followed by a 50 basis points move in November and 25 basis points in December. Such moves would have left the benchmark interest rate between 3.75% to 4% at year end. Broadly, traders in traditional markets expected the Fed to pause rate hikes next year and eventually switch to liquidity easing by June 2023.  With inflation proving persistent, however, the Fed may have to delay the anticipated pause and deliver two more 75 bps hikes before slowing the pace in December and January.  Turek tweeted after the CPI release: ""I think the pricing assumption now has to be 75, 75, 50, 25. Which is massive shift from the potential of 75, 50, 25, pause. The market now has to bear that adjustment.""  Prices for risky assets tumbled after the CPI release, with bitcoin falling from $22,700 to nearly $21,000. Ether, the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, dropped from $1,760 to $1,594, in a sign of the macroeconomic development overpowering the bullish narrative surrounding that blockchain’s Merge – an expected transition this week to a more energy-efficient blockchain system.  The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro, jumped over 1% to 109.55, snapping a four-day losing streak.  Futures trading in federal funds now reflects a minor probability of the Fed raising rates by 100 basis points next week and suggests the rate-hike cycle peaking at 4.25% in March 2023. The pricing for the so-called terminal rate was 4% before the inflation data.  The Fed has increased the benchmark borrowing rate by 225 basis points this year, roiling risky assets, and has begun unwinding its balance sheet at a pace of $95 billion per month.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/13/path-forward-for-crypto-gets-tougher-after-us-cpi-report-comes-in-hot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50e127a4514f9ce0647b4d738427860779fad311-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He’s planning to use the funding to hire more staff with a focus on nabbing former options traders.  The platform will seek to bring European-style options trading to newcomer audiences, a review of Synquote’s documentation shows.

The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), its sanctions watchdog, updated its ""frequently asked questions"" (FAQs) document Tuesday to provide guidance for the crypto industry on how people and companies can remain compliant with sanctions against Tornado Cash, the Ethereum privacy mixer blacklisted last month on allegations that North Korean hackers used it to launder funds.  The sanctions saw an immense backlash from the crypto industry, with concerns ranging from whether software could be sanctioned to how people using Tornado Cash for legal purposes could recover any funds locked in the tool's smart wallets. While Treasury did not address the software concerns, the FAQs said people could request an OFAC license to withdraw their funds.  ""U.S. persons should be prepared to provide, at a minimum, all relevant information regarding these transactions with Tornado Cash, including the wallet addresses for the remitter and beneficiary, transaction hashes, the date and time of the transaction(s), as well as the amount(s) of virtual currency. OFAC would have a favorable licensing policy towards such applications, provided that the transaction did not involve other sanctionable conduct,"" the FAQs said.  A group of individuals backed by crypto exchange Coinbase sued Treasury last week, in part over the locked funds question.  Read more: Issues Crypto Should Watch For in the Tornado Cash Sanctions  The FAQs also addressed the fact that people tried trolling celebrities by sending them small amounts of ether through Tornado Cash after the sanctions were announced.  The FAQs state that while U.S. persons ""are prohibited from engaging in"" any transaction that involves Tornado Cash, if a U.S. person receives a small amount unsolicited, they don't have to immediately report the transaction, OFAC said.  OFAC said in its initial sanctions announcement that Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked hacking entity, had sent millions of dollars worth of crypto through Tornado Cash, alleging that around 20% of the mixer's volume was tied to illicit activity.  ""North Korea has increasingly relied on illicit activities – including cybercrime – to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,"" a Treasury spokesperson said via email.  ""U.S. persons must comply with these sanctions. More broadly, we call on the cryptocurrency industry to do its part to prevent illicit activity – nation-state or otherwise – as that is what 'responsible innovation' requires,"" the spokesperson said. ""This would include ensuring adequate cybersecurity measures, implementing know-your-customer measures, and complying with sanctions and anti-money laundering obligations.

CPI came in at 8.3% Y/Y in August, exceeding the 8.1% consensus, but easing from 8.5% in July. Core CPI, which excludes volatile prices and happens to be the Fed&apos;s more preferred inflation gauge, climbed 6.3% from a year ago vs. 6.1% consensus and 5.9% prior. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slumped 5% to $21K at 10:45 p.m. ET, and ether (ETH-USD) plunged 6.8% to $1.59K. All three major U.S. indices opened the session sharply lower after the disappointing CPI numbers came out.

42373827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVV3x,1663078176,Crypto Lender Maker Turns to Staked Ether to Reduce USDC Influence,"Crypto lending platform Maker, the world's largest decentralized-finance (DeFi) app, doubled the debt ceiling of its staked ether (stETH) vault this week as it looks to reduce its reliance on centralized stablecoins after Centre, the issuer of USD coin (USDC), blacklisted 38 addresses linked to sanctioned crypto tool Tornado Cash.  More than 34% of all assets locked on USDC are locked on Maker, and the tokens are the single-largest source of collateral that backs DAI, Maker’s native decentralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Approval of the proposal to raise the ceiling to $200 million allows more stETH to be deposited against DAI, reducing USDC’s influence.  This role of USDC in the system has led to criticism for DAI among market observers, with some even terming it “wrapped USDC” – or an alternative for USDC tokens. Erik Vorhees, the founder of crypto trading platform ShapeShift, has publicly appealed for Maker to start “unwinding its USDC collateral immediately.”  “There’s a natural tension between centralized stablecoins and projects like DAI that want to be permissionless and uncensorable,” Maker founder Rune Christensen said in a CoinDesk TV interview in August. The decision to lean on USDC allowed Maker to grow and focus on an easy user experience, but that came with trade-offs that are now fully visible, he said.  Some $49 million worth of stETH has flowed into the vault since the ceiling was raised, data from tracking service Daistats shows. Staked ether is a token supplied to users who lock up ether on Lido, a staking service, and receive the stETH tokens in return. More than 245,377 stETH is locked on Maker, the data shows. Maker has a total value locked of $8.4 billion.  The stETH vault has a 0% stability fee, meaning users don't have to pay fees to Maker on their positions. This essentially creates “free dai” for users, Maker said in a Tuesday tweet.",POSITIVE,DAI | USDC,MARKET | TRADING | DAI | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/13/crypto-lender-maker-turns-to-staked-ether-to-reduce-usdc-influence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f517fb5ad178f483ed22e31c1dbe9fc27542d039-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411739,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXl0,1663078173,Aave: Understanding the Crypto Lending Platform,"Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform primarily based on the Ethereum blockchain. It lets you take out instantaneous loans of cryptocurrency using other cryptocurrency you own as collateral. It also allows users to lend out their crypto to earn returns.  People who borrow funds pay interest, people who deposit funds get interest, just like at a bank, but there’s no bank or loan manager making decisions. Smart contracts, which are sets of code that automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met, replace the middleman.  The central mechanism that allows Aave to function is that deposits go into something called a “liquidity pool” which the protocol can then use to make loans to others. This large pool of crypto allows the code to be able to dip in and pull out funds for loans at scale and on demand. The smart contracts automate transactions, which means everything from lending to borrowing happens nearly instantaneously, but it also means if you can’t pay back your loan in a timely fashion, there’s no one to ask for more time or explain a difficult situation. The smart contract that rules the protocol’s decisions will liquidate your assets exactly according to the rules of the code, without hesitation.  Aave was created by a team of coders led by Stani Kulechov. It launched in November 2017 as ETHLend and rebranded in September 2018 to its current name (which means “ghost” in Finnish).  The protocol has since grown to become one of the largest cryptocurrency lending protocols around, alongside rivals Compound and MakerDAO (the precise leader fluctuates all the time). As of this writing, Aave has over $6 billion in total value locked (TVL) across all chains.  See also: How Does MakerDAO Work? Understanding the 'Central Bank of Crypto'  Lending assets on Aave  Users can supply a few dozen assets to Aave such as stablecoins like tether (USDT) or USDC, as well as tokens such as BAT, MANA and more. Annual rates of return vary by asset, by blockchain, by supply and demand and finally by which version of Aave you are using. Currently, there are three iterations of the protocol: Aave version1, v2 or v3 – each of which brought upgrades to the network.  According to analytics platform DeFi Llama, Aave v2 remains the largest public lending market, with $5.29 billion in TVL. Aave v3, by comparison, has $1.47B in TVL. Aave’s largest market is Aave Arc, a permissioned DeFi lending protocol used by financial institutions, such as Binance and Coinbase.  V3, which launched in March 2022, cuts transaction costs and allows the community to vote on approved stablecoins for borrowing and collateral. Notably, the protocol’s third iteration does not support Ethereum’s base layer – it only supports Ethereum layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism, and other layer 1 blockchains such as Polygon and Fantom. The second iteration (v2) supports Ethereum natively, plus Polygon and Avalanche.  To supply an asset on Aave, head to the market, and select the blockchain and version of Aave you want to contribute to. For instance, in this example, we’ve selected Ethereum and Aave v2:  Once selected, you can scroll through the list of “Assets to supply,” choose the asset you want to lend, then hit “supply.” At this point, you’ll enter the amount of the asset that you’d like to provide and confirm the transaction in an in-browser wallet, such as MetaMask. Returns vary by asset; as of this writing, supplying ETH on Aave v2 provides an annual return of 0.7%.  Borrowing assets  Borrowing assets works similarly, just in reverse. You’ll need to supply assets as collateral first before you’re allowed to borrow. The maximum amount you’ll be able to borrow depends on how much you deposit, as well as a metric called the “health factor,” which is a number that represents the safety of the asset you deposit as collateral against the borrowed assets. The higher that number is, the better, but keeping that number above 1 is key for the safety of your deposit.  The protocol is perhaps most famous for popularizing the “flash loan” – an instantaneous crypto loan that doesn’t require any collateral, so long as the loan can be repaid in the same transaction.  Flash loans became infamous in the early 2020s after several coders used them to overload the systems of other DeFi protocols. Flash loans could temporarily lower the price of a token by manipulating the ratio of funds in liquidity pools. This allowed fraudsters to acquire tokens for cheap and drain a protocol of funds.  Aave governance and token  In October 2020, Aave launched its own governance token, AAVE. The token launched amid the “yield farming” craze of that summer, which allowed traders to mint governance tokens by using various protocols.  Although these tokens had a genuine utility – governance – in practice they were more commonly traded as financial assets whose worth depended on speculation about the value of a DeFi protocol. AAVE rose from $53 in October 2020 to a high of $666 in May 2021. It crashed for the rest of the year, resting at about $85 in September 2022.  This token is used within the protocol’s governance module. Holders can vote on, for instance, which assets to add to the protocol’s lending markets.  It’s possible to stake the AAVE token within Aave’s Safety Module – which is a huge pool of reserves that the protocol can dip into in case the protocol falls into debt. The protocol offers returns of up to 9.1% a year for staking AAVE in this manner, but the risk is that the protocol will use your tokens to protect itself, which it states plainly in the staking section:     Other Aave projects  Lending isn’t the only thing Aave does. In February, 2022 it launched Lens Protocol, a decentralized social network protocol built on the Polygon network. Aave founder Stani Kulechov described Lens as an “open, composable social media protocol to allow anyone to create a non-custodial social media profile and build new social media applications.” In an interview with CoinDesk, he said he hoped Lens would help foster a “better and more humane user experience” on social media.  In August 2022, the community passed a proposal to launch GHO, a yield-generating stablecoin that is fully collateralized by cryptocurrency, similar to MakerDAO. Aave aims to charge interest on loans taken out in GHO which will help fund their DAO.

Market Moves  Bitcoin Hits 3-Week High on Dollar Weakness, But TradFi Firms Retain Bullish Bias on Greenback  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of whatever the U.S. dollar is doing in foreign exchange markets.  Early Tuesday, BTC jumped to a three-week high, tracking continued weakness in the U.S. dollar index (DXY).  ""We see the current market moves to be largely driven by the pullback in the dollar index as well as position unwinds ahead of the Ethereum Merge,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  It may be too early for BTC devotees to throw caution to the wind as some investment banks expect the greenback to regain its mojo soon.  The index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, peaked above 110 last week as the European Central Bank rate hike put a floor under the euro, and inflation expectations fell, offering relief to risky assets, including bitcoin. As of press time, the index was trading lower at around 108.  The dollar's pullback, however, could be fleeting, according to Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.  ""With the Fed expected to hike another 75 basis points next week and introduce new quarterly projections, we doubt much momentum will be behind a dollar correction,"" Turner wrote in Monday's edition of ING's foreign-exchange market update. ""We would be favoring a move back above 110.00 next week.""  Multinational investment bank UBS (UBS) expects the dollar to remain well supported in the near term.  ""We think investors should brace for continued dollar strength over coming months,"" the bank's strategists led by Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management, wrote in a client note published on Sept. 9.  The team said the combination of a weaker growth outlook for the Eurozone and China and relatively robust U.S. economic data is likely to keep the DXY in demand.  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  Open Interest in ETC Futures Surges  By Omkar Godbole  The dollar value locked in the open perpetual futures contracts tied to ethereum classic (ETC) has tripled to over $300 million in two months.  “It's a clear sign that traders are searching for any and all trading opportunities ahead of the Merge,” Paris-based Kaiko Research said.  The influx of capital could also be related to Ethereum miners switching to the Ethereum Classic blockchain, which uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to validate transactions. “Miners could be hedging using perpetual futures,"" Kaiko said.

42411380,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQd8,1663076828,Bitcoin Should Change ... Slowly,"Bitcoin is slow to change. Transaction speeds are too slow for a global payment system. The community is reluctant to embrace novelty. And the rate of new innovation, in comparison to nearly every other blockchain, is tortoise-like. Fortunately for Bitcoin, I believe its slow and steady pace will ultimately be its superpower.  This year Ethereum will undergo a radical upgrade known as the Merge. This event, scheduled for mid-September, will change the underlying “consensus mechanism” that allows blockchains to function from something like Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system to a more experimental model called proof-of-stake. It’s a development that has been underway for years.  Chris Castiglione is co-founder of Console.xyz, a secure chat platform for Web3. He's also a general manager at Trust Machines, where he's working on MultiSafe.xyz, and an adjunct professor at Columbia University Business School.     Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, announced at a Paris-based Ethereum conference that after the Merge, Ethereum will still only be 55% complete. There’s a list of upgrades to Ethereum slated for the next two decades. The Ethereum community, Buterin cautioned, should learn to expect “short term pain, and long term gains.”  See also: Ether May 'Inevitably' Turn Into a Store of Value  This mentality of development opens Ethereum up to new possible futures, but also risk. Herein lies the opportunity for Bitcoin – an opportunity to embrace its slow rate of change so that it can become the world’s most valuable “forever database.”  A forever database is a gift to humanity  I’ve heard blockchains described a million different ways: “an immutable ledger,” “a shared system for recording data,” “a growing list of records secured by cryptography.” All of this is fine. But for the average person, these explanations are confusing. The simplest definition of a blockchain is a forever database.  Maybe you’re a total beginner and you can’t picture a database. No problem. A database is basically a fancy Excel spreadsheet. And a forever database is one in which when you write data that is stored, well, forever.  Due to a series of design decisions, blockchains are immutable. Theoretically, the data stored becomes a bullet-proof record of truth for thousands of generations to come.  Since Bitcoin went live on Jan. 3, 2009, the network has never gone down, been hacked or stopped storing new data. Bitcoin (BTC) is also a currency that can’t be inflated, a selling point that has become the network’s chief use case. The bookkeeping is never wrong.  Imagine being able to trust that 1,000 years from now your data and money will still be accessible. Not only that, but people living many generations into the future could verifiably trust that this ledger is true. That’s powerful.  Forever databases enable novel use cases beyond money-like instruments, which are primarily being explored on networks beyond Bitcoin. Mike Bodge’s crypto-art project, 0xinfinity, allows you to publish love letters the site claims will last “forever or as long as the Ethereum network is running.” Arweave is a file storage service that claims “to store documents and applications forever.” And Starling Labs is a project that, among other things, has uploaded 56,000 Holocaust survivor testimonials to preserve evidence of human rights abuses and protect against future disinformation.  A forever database ensures the integrity of our collective memories in a way that previous databases could not.  And yet, consistency is the key ingredient. As long as Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains continue to upgrade their codebase, they can’t compete on consistency.  In early 2022, the Solana blockchain, known for its “move fast and break things” mentality, suffered two outages, each of which took down the network for several hours. The key superpower that makes a blockchain a forever database is being resilient to outages. A forever database should never go down; if it does, let’s just call it “database.”  For Bitcoin to thrive, users need to do more than just hold their money. Bitcoin needs to become productive. There is an opportunity for biticoiners to harness the power of their forever database through the use of additional layers (e.g., Lightning or Stacks) so that they can build new applications.  The race to embrace layers  Stacks is an example of a layer that adds programmability to Bitcoin. With Stack’s Clarity smart contracts, you can create applications (social networks, photo-sharing apps, chat apps) where the underlying transactions are secured by Bitcoin.  On Ethereum, similarly, Polygon is a popular layer developers use to scale the Ethereum network. The difference is that if Ethereum were to fail, Polygon and all of Ethereum’s additional layers would follow, falling like a house of cards  See also: Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know  We need a new layer, one that can access Bitcoin’s forever database. It, and only it, can be a complete system on which we build the future.  In 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s founder, first encouraged the idea of building layers on Bitcoin. ""I think it would be possible for [a blockchain] to be a completely separate network and separate block chain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin."" What Nakamoto saw back then was the opportunity for Bitcoin to be more than just money.  Slow and steady wins the race  If we wish to create a forever database, we must celebrate Bitcoin’s approach to long-term stability. This is what Vitalik Buterin was doing when he said Ethereum should become more Bitcoin-like by “emphasizing long-term stability.”  Both Bitcoin and Ethereum will do great things for humanity. I’m excited to see them each take their own approach to building the future. As Ethereum evolves swiftly I believe it will continue to innovate.  However, until Ethereum settles down, it will lose its standing in the race to become a forever database. It’s taking on too much risk, and the world may never know exactly what Ethereum will look like until decades down the line.  This is Bitcoin’s moment. Bitcoin needs to embrace building layers. Bitcoin should not remain as money, it must learn how to be productive. Ultimately I believe slow and steady is the secret to winning the race — because while fast may get all our attention, it’s slow that has all the power.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MATIC | ZRX,Chris Castig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/13/bitcoin-should-change-slowly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf27359bad7be3a8ac94a398bd0ad77e7565301d-2400x1592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Latin America saw the fastest growth pace of cryptocurrency in 2021. In particular, about 41% of adults in Brazil own some cryptocurrency, according to a report from Gemini. Latin Americans led this wide adoption with the desire for a viable alternative to traditional banks, receiving over $60 billion cryptocurrency in 2021.  The report published by blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos said cryptocurrency, particularly dollar-linked stablecoins, are appealing to Latin Americans more trusting of the greenback than their own hyperinflation-prone national currencies. It didn’t mention which stablecoins people are using.  Read more: Why Latin American Crypto Exchanges Are Doubling Down on Yield Products  As the region is enduring the highest inflation in the world, lingering around 12%, the dollar keeps its dominant position as a tool to counter the local inflation challenges. In this way Latin Americans already see dollar-backed stablecoins as more secure than their own currencies, the report said.  The report also cited data from Mastercard, unveiling that over 33% of Latin American consumers have used stablecoins for everyday purchases.  “The consumers in Latin America have suffered their currencies depreciation and capital controls for a long time, so they were quick to understand the advantages of crypto and embrace it,”Wences Casares, chief executive officer of Gibraltar-based Xapo Bank, said in the report.

The round was led by Seven Seven Six, the venture-capital firm created by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Doodles specializes in profile pictures.  NFTs are digital assets that represent ownership of virtual or physical assets.  “We are using the funding to rapidly acquire a world-class team of engineers, creatives, marketers and business executives. As well as to fund product development, acquisitions, proprietary technology, media and collector experiences,” the Doodles team tweeted.  The fundraising round comes during a crypto bear market that has put price pressure on the market for NFTs, digital assets like images and music with smart contracts to prove their uniqueness. The amount of U.S. dollars traded in the NFT market dropped 25% between the first and second quarters of this year, according to recent NonFungible.com data.

42373838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVVCl,1663073492,"US CPI Report Shows Inflation Hotter Than Expected, Bitcoin Plunges 9.6%","U.S. inflation decelerated in August, but remained higher than what economists had expected, a sign that the U.S. Federal Reserve will stay aggressive in raising interest rates.  The consumer price index rose 8.3% in August from a year earlier, a mild slowdown from the 8.5% reported for July. Economists at FactSet had forecasted a 8.1% increase, and so the number was slightly higher than expectations.  On a month-over-month basis, inflation rose 0.1% from July, when inflation remained unchanged, which many economists and politicians saw as a huge success.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 15% over the weekend in anticipation of a positive report for August but dropped 4% after the new numbers were released. Ethereum (ETH), which has largely been trading in an upward trend because the Merge, a software update on the Ethereum blockchain that is set to take place this week, dipped over 7%.  Core CPI, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.6%, a much larger increase than in July.  Tuesday's report was expected to show a much faster slowdown in prices as energy, gasoline and airfare prices – the main drivers behind high inflation in recent months – started to cool off. But other sectors offset those price decreases and caused overall inflation to remain elevated. Health insurance, for example, rose 24.3% year-over-year, the largest increase ever. Food at home and rent prices were also one of the main drivers this month, up 13.5% and 15.8%, and services inflation rose above 6%.  ""The latter is the biggest concern, fueled by an acceleration in rental inflation that looks like it’s got quite a bit further to go,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.  Tuesday’s report will provide key guidance for the central bank’s September meeting next week, during which members of the Federal Open Market Committee will likely decide to raise rates by another 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point.  The jobs report earlier this month revealed that the labor market, although still robust, is starting to slow amid rising labor costs, which signals that the Fed’s policy changes are starting to take effect. But with a still very strong labor market and high inflation, there is little reason for the Fed to stop its aggressive approach just yet, and in recent weeks, Fed officials in several speeches have indicated that they are willing to do whatever it takes to defeat inflation.  “The release can potentially be a dial mover for how hawkish Chair Powell’s press conference will be and by extension the direction of risk sentiment and market pricing in the near term,” Anthony Woodside, senior solutions strategist at LGIM America, a global institutional asset manager, said, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.  Several FOMC officials have said that the central bank will keep its front-loading approach, meaning that it will hike rates fast now and let the rates sit for a while once the bank's preferred rate is reached. But traders have been wondering what that rate is, and it seems as though central bankers have different opinions on that matter.  “Increased clarity on 'how high' the terminal rate may go can help define risk and volatility in a market that has been plagued by limited visibility,” Woodside said. “We believe the terminal rate will at least reach the 4% threshold this cycle.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/13/us-inflation-higher-than-expected-in-august-bitcoin-dips-4,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94ca41ddfaebc98a021f8eb5c7754fb4857a20fb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a Tuesday post on its official Medium account, Poolin Wallet said that it will calculate user balances across its native wallet and mining pool before issuing a total of six IOU tokens. Deposits made after Sept. 15, when the IOUs will be distributed, will not be frozen and will not be affected by the IOU mechanism, the post said.  The tokens will reflect a 1:1 ratio of user balances across bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT), litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Poolin IOUs can be traded for the corresponding cryptocurrency, used to buy new mining machines or shares of the company.  Otherwise, Poolin's intention is to gradually burn IOU tokens batch-by-batch. Users can also withdraw IOU tokens from the platform at any time.  Users on Poolin's official telegram channels didn't seem convinced by the solution, with some being confused about the mechanism and others compared the situation to Terra, which collapsed in May.  Poolin said that the reason behind the withdrawal freeze was related to liquidity issues.

The complaint was filed in Delaware Chancery Court and will be made available to public on Thursday. On Aug. 15, California-based BitGo declared its intention to sue Galaxy, which had planned to acquire BitGo, labelling the termination of the deal as ""absurd.""  A spokesperson for Galaxy Digital told CoinDesk at the time that BitGo's claims were without merit. Galaxy Digital didn't respond to a request for comment.  The deal came to a halt in March as Galaxy waited for a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission decision on its plans to reorganize as a Delaware-based company. Galaxy's shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the firm still intends to list its shares on Nasdaq.

The different data collected for these purposes include personal demographics (age, location, gender, etc) as well as behavioural patterns (locations visited, interaction with different pages, etc).

(KKR) has made its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund available on the Avalanche blockchain.  KKR, which had $471 billion in assets under management at the end of 2021, is working with digital-asset management platform Securitize Capital, which will handle the onboarding of new investors, according to a press release.  Individuals will be able to invest in KKR's health-care fund through a tokenized feeder fund on the Avalanche blockchain provided by Securitize. ""What we're going to be providing to investors are digital asset securities or security tokens that represent an economic interest [in] a feeder fund of the the main KKR healthcare fund,"" Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, told CoinDesk TV. ""It's a way for individual investors to get access into a high quality private equity fund - from a very reputable firm, like KKR - that otherwise is not available [to them],"" he said.  Traditional finance companies are still entering the crypto industry this year despite a market downturn that has seen the price of bitcoin (BTC) slump by more than 50%. Wall Street clearinghouse Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. launched a private blockchain last month, and venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz doubled down on its crypto stance by establishing a fourth crypto fund worth $4.5 billion in May.  Read more: BlackRock to Offer Crypto for Institutional Investors Through Coinbase Prime  KKR said it hopes that the tokenized health-care fund will provide a more accessible investment vehicle to individual investors.  “With its ability to digitize operational inefficiencies and increase ease of use for individual investors, blockchain technology has the potential to play an important role in the future of private markets,” Dan Parant, managing director and co-head of U.S. private wealth at KKR, said in the statement.  This isn't the only way to invest in the closed-end health-care fund as it was originally catered towards institutional investors. However, its the only way retail investors can invest in the fund as the requirement for institutional investors to buy in is in the millions, while the minimum threshold for individual investing through the feeder fund is $100,000, Domingo told CDTV.  The feeder fund is sold through its own broker dealer called Securitized Markets, Domingo said. Investors will need to setup an account with Securitize and go through KYC, AML accreditation to invest in the fund, he added.  “This new fund is an important step toward democratizing access to private equity investments by delivering more efficient access to institutional-quality products,"" Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement.

2636037,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=502031,1663062319,"Bitcoin (BTC) Closes Week Above $21K, Is Bullish Reversal In Sight?","The expectation of every crypto investor this month is to see some bullish trends in the market. Many top assets have recorded more pullbacks than rallies in the months following the overall market crash. Every week starts and ends with a new trend for the green or the reds. This uncertainty has kept everyone guessing and scared of imminent losses if the bearish trend continues. But it seems that the week beginning from September 5 to 12 brought a lot of bullish moves for many cryptos. Related Reading: Why Ethereum Price Is Unlikely To Dump After &apos;The Merge&apos; There were some pullbacks, but the rallies seemed to take the upper hand as the week ended. For instance, Bitcoin closed the week above $21 after struggling to reach the $20K mark without success. BTC price from September 5 was $19,988 and continued dropping until it reached $19,328 at the opening of markets on September 9. Before the market closed the same day, BTC spiked above $20 to hit $21,381.15. Indicators of an Imminent Bullish Trend After ending the week above $21K, Bitcoin climbed past that price level to reach $22,122.04 on Monday, September 12. Analysts have studied other indicators of a possible bullish reversal for the number one crypto. First, BTC&apos;s sharp bounce in the first week of September created a long lower wick indicating buying pressure. Also, the coin price hit a bullish close of $21,826 after maintaining a $19400 horizontal support area since ...",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-btc-closes-week-above-21k-is-bullish-reversal-in-sight/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
42373843,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVVKJ,1663062273,"Bitcoin Hits 3-Week High on Dollar Weakness, But TradFi Firms Retain Bullish Bias on Greenback","Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to a three-week high early on Tuesday, tracking continued weakness in the U.S. dollar. It may be too early, however, for BTC devotees to throw caution to the wind as some investment banks expect the greenback to regain its mojo soon.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to $22,600 during Asian trading hours, marking its highest price since Aug. 19 and representing a 21% gain in seven days, according to CoinDesk data.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, was trading lower at around 108. The index peaked above 110 last week as the European Central Bank rate hike put a floor under the euro and inflation expectations fell, offering relief to risky assets, including bitcoin.  ""We see the current market moves to be largely driven by the pullback in the dollar index as well as position unwinds ahead of the Ethereum Merge,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  The dollar's pullback, however, could be fleeting, according to Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.  ""With the Fed expected to hike another 75 basis points next week and introduce new quarterly projections, we doubt much momentum will be behind a dollar correction,"" Turner wrote in Monday's edition of ING's foreign-exchange market update. ""We would be favoring a move back above 110.00 next week.""  Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the dollar. The cryptocurrency's market value has halved to $427 billion this year, with the DXY rising over 10% in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's rapid-fire rate hikes. The Fed has raised rates by 225 basis points this year, lifting the benchmark borrowing cost to 2.25%-2.5%.  Turner said money markets are now pricing a 4% interest rate for next spring, adding that Tuesday's U.S. consumer price index data could show core inflation remained sticky in August. Core inflation strips out the volatile food and energy component, which has cooled in the past few weeks.  So a sticky core figure would mean underlying inflation continues to run hot, pouring cold water over the optimism generated by the recent slide in market-based measures of inflation expectations and perhaps halt the DXY's decline.  The U.S. Labor Department will release the August inflation report on Tuesday at 12:30 UTC. According to a FactSet survey, CPI probably rose 8.1% over the past 12 months following July's 8.5% increase and June's 9.1% rise. The core CPI likely ticked up to 6.1% from 5.9%.  Multinational investment bank UBS (UBS) expects the dollar to remain well supported in the near term.  ""We think investors should brace for continued dollar strength over coming months,"" the bank's strategists led by Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management, wrote in a client note published on Sept. 9.  The team said the combination of a weaker growth outlook for the Eurozone and China and relatively robust U.S. economic data is likely to keep the DXY in demand.  According to UBS, the Fed will look for a three-month run of low month-over-month price rises – along with signs that the labor market is cooling – before softening its tone.  While bitcoin has chalked up a double-digit rally in seven days, the broader downtrend, represented by trendlines connecting the November 2021 and March 2022 highs remains intact.  A breakout may invite more substantial chart-driven buying pressure.  TDX's Lo, however, prefers selling on the rise. ""The ongoing bounce may be extended to $23,700, but we are sellers into this rally and looking at downside option strategies,"" he said.

The move was spurred by ""tightened restrictions"" on crypto in China and ""solidified by the fact that China's Web3.0 strategy is going in a different direction,"" the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Chinese authorities have signaled that despite their dislike of crypto, they want the country to be a leader in Web3 applications the government deems palatable, such as permissioned blockchains that increase efficiencies but can be controlled.  Many crypto firms from mainland China moved to Singapore after last year's crackdown because of the city-state's perceived friendly regulatory framework toward crypto.

The bullish reversal rally exceeded the psychological mark of $0.050 and approached the overhead supply zone at $0.075. However, the selling pressure growing at the supply zone teases a bearish turnaround. Nonetheless, the growing underlying bullishness teases an inverted head and shoulder possibility if the reverting prices take support at the $0.050 mark. Key Points: The Ravencoin price action shows an increased selling spree at $0.075. The bullish crossover of the 50 and 100-day EMA reflects solid underlying bullishness.

Source - TradingView RVN Technical Analysis As mentioned in our previous article, the RVN prices reclaim the psychological mark of $0.050 and continue challenging the overhead resistance of the $0.075 supply zone.

The GALA/USDT pair daily showcases a short-term range-bound movement between the $0.07 and $0.0465 barriers. Furthermore, with the recent widespread sell-off in the market, the bears offset the July to early August gain and plunged to bottom support of $0.0465. Thus, a retest to this high accumulation zone offers a reversal opportunity for coin holders. Key Points: The GALA price breaks the falling channel pattern. The coin price has surged 14% in the last six days. The intraday trading volume in GALA is $166 million. Source - TradingView GALA Technical Analysis The GALA price was wavering near the $0.0465 support for nearly a month, trending lower into a falling channel. Once the prices break above the resistance trendline, this pattern usually results in a strong directional rally. Thus, on September 9th, the GALA price gave a decisive breakout of the pattern trendline, hitting an early sign of a bull run. The coin price currently trades at the $0.051 mark, with an intraday fall of 1.81%. The Doji-type candles in the retest phase reflect a quarrel between buyers and sellers. Hence, if the buying pressure persists, the altcoin could rise 34% to the top resistance of $0.07. On the contrary, a failed breakout would offer sellers another opportunity to breach the $0.0465 support.

Bitcoin rose but ether fell a day before the release of the latest U.S. inflation reading and three days before the launch of the Merge.  BTC was recently trading at about $22,200, up almost 2% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market value soared past $22,000 early Monday as investors' appetites for riskier investments returned.  Ether recently plunged over 2% from the previous day to trade just below $1,700 after rising over this threshold late Sunday. Investors continue to eye Thursday's expected Merge, the technological overhaul of the Ethereum blockchain that will shift its protocol from proof-of-work to more energy efficient proof-of-stake.  In an email, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya attributed the two cryptos' differing paths to some traders' ""sell the event"" reaction. ""It looks like some of the profit-taking with Ethereum is benefitting Bitcoin and other blockchain crypto bets such as Cardano, Solana and Polkadot,"" Moya said.  Moya added optimistically, ""Many are still skeptical of a September crypto rebound, but if price action does not turn south here momentum traders could trigger a decent move higher.""  Most other major cryptos were recently in the red, with ADA and CRO both off more than 3% over the past 24 hours but SOL rising over 3%.  Cryptos' earlier gains tracked equity markets, which continued a mini winning streak with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all climbing more than a percentage point. Investors have been feeling more upbeat about the prospect of a positive Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday showing inflation's momentum continuing to wane. Consensus expectations are for a CPI equal to or lower than July's 8.5% figure. Other indicators, including job figures, have remained strong, suggesting the economy will achieve the U.S. central bank's hoped-for soft landing. Asset markets may also be responding positively to Ukraine's successful counteroffensive in its war with Russia and the prospect of diminishing macroeconomic activity.  ""The start of the trading week was supposed to be all about the August inflation report, but Kyiv’s sudden momentum has many hoping that this moment is a turning point with the war against Russia,"" Moya wrote, refewrring to the Ukraine capital. But he added that ""Russia’s strategy may now shift to attacking civilian infrastructure, which could lead to widespread blackouts and slow the current counteroffensive moves.""  In crypto news, financial services giant Fidelity is contemplating whether to let individual brokerage customers trade bitcoin (BTC), The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The initiative would offer the latest evidence of traditional financial services firms' growing interest in the crypto space.  Earlier in the day, crypto exchange Huobi said that it would delist seven tokens, including monero and zcash.  In an interview on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Lex Sokolin, head economist of decentralized protocols at software company ConsenSys, said that cryptocurrencies respond to external events similar to other riskier assets. ""The story about the macroeconomic environment is, if it allows consumers to have a larger budget – and certainly the COVID-19 environment was that – they're more likely to take risks, they're more likely to use Web3 and try new protocols,"" he said. ""And if they're compressed, and they're much more worried about paying down their mortgages or their rents, they're going to have less discretionary budget. And so that's going to be damaging for crypto prices in the short term.""

One day it's a risk asset, and the next day a hedge against inflation.  A surge Monday sent bitcoin over $22,000 for the first time in more than three weeks after the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization spent the past three days comfortably above $21,000.  But a recent report from South Korea-based CryptoQuant outlines a number of different price valuation metrics that show bitcoin bottoming out between $10,000 and $14,500.  The Delta price metric is at the high end of CryptoQuant’s bearish model. The delta price measures the difference between the realized – the average price at which all bitcoin in existence has moved – and the historical moving average price. CryptoQuant puts the delta price at $14,478.  “Historically, the market has confirmed reaching a bottom when the price has touched the delta price, as in the 2015 and 2018 bear markets,” CryptoQuant writes.  CryptoQuant also points to valuation models based on exchange flow as possible indicators of where bitcoin will bottom out.  One of them, developed by CryptoQuant’s research team, is the Whale Exchange Inflow Price. This metric, which it says signaled the bottom in 2013 and 2018, measures the price at which bitcoin whales (those that hold between 1,000-10,000 bitcoins) have sent bitcoin to exchanges. Currently, CryptoQuant puts this number at $10,335.  Finally, there’s also the Miner Exchange Inflow Price, which comes in at $14,214 (very close to the delta price). As the name implies, it's the price at which miners send bitcoin to exchanges. Cryptoquant says this metric signaled the bottom of the Covid-19-induced panic sell of March 2020 as well as the bottom of the 2015 bear market.  An old tale  In late 2020, Cointelegraph compiled a list of some of the worst bitcoin price predictions. Sure, there were many guesstimates from information-light influencers, but there were also serious attempts to create predictive models.  Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev predicted that bitcoin would end 2020 at $50,000 because of its lack of correlation with equities markets and moves in tandem with the price of gold.  Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road darknet market, said that the volatility of March 2020 meant there would be a prolonged bear market throughout the year.  Twitter analyst CryptoWhale’s ""quantum model,"" which “effectively predicted every major move since 2018,” posited a bull run post-March 2020 that would hit $24,000 by mid-2022.  Ironically, the best predictor of the bitcoin price is now the stock market. The correlation narrative to equities, ironic as that might be for bitcoin’s maximalist followers, is something that the world’s largest digital asset can’t shake until there are major macroeconomic changes.  Bitcoin price prediction isn’t anything new, but so far there just hasn’t been a reliable model or method to do it. At the start of this year, analysts were calling for bitcoin to remain in the $40K-$60K band citing macroeconomic factors.  “We predict the catalyst for this move to be stubbornly high inflation numbers coupled with a continuation of negative real interest rates,” Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora, told CoinDesk in January.  High inflation numbers are certainly with us, but $40k bitcoin is not. As bitcoin opened the Asia Tuesday trading day at about $22,100, we’ve got a long way to go – despite some macro indicators saying we should be elsewhere.

42394790,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVX6r,1663035290,Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Timing Posted,"Ethereum's proof-of-work fork will occur 24 hours following the Merge, according to a thread posted Monday on the @EthereumPoW Twitter feed.  The thread did not specify a precise time, saying this information would ""be announced 1 hour before launch with a countdown timer."" The Merge is expected to take place on Thursday.  ""...Everything including final code, binaries, config files, nodes info, RPC, explorer, etc. will be made public when the time’s up,"" the thread said.  The ETHW mainnet will begin at ""the block height of the Merge block 'plus' 2048 empty blocks"" to ensure that the chainID converts to 10001 and that ""the chain is the longest ... of ETHW.  Merge block +2049 will be the first to note any transactions on ETHW. ""Block rewards for the empty blocks will be directed to the 1559 multi-sig wallet,"" the thread said.  The Merge is a technological overhaul of the Ethereum blockchain that will shift its protocol from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Merge advocates say the change will make the blockchain faster and more energy efficient.  Some of Ethereum’s miners – those who run computers to process and validate transactions on the current proof-of-work (PoW) network – plan to keep the old network up and running.  The forked network will look and feel like Ethereum, but it will only be a skeleton of the real thing, with apps and tokens floating around without usage or value.  Justin Sun is a cheerleader for the EthereumPOW token (ETHW), but questions remain about how much traction it can possibly get when it's up against the already established Ethereum Classic blockchain, which maintains PoW.

42394783,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVWzy,1663027200,Crypto Custody Specialist Anchorage Digital Offers Japanese Yen Stablecoin,"Regulated cryptocurrency custody platform Anchorage Digital is supporting a Japanese yen (JPY) stablecoin, adding to its digital U.S. dollar and euro custodial offerings and fostering fintech use cases from payments to payroll in Japan.  Anchorage custody of the GYEN stablecoin results from a partnership with GMO-Z.com Trust Company, a subsidiary of Japanese financial services and internet conglomerate GMO Internet Group. The JPY stablecoin is approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and is 1:1 backed with assets held at FDIC insured banks, the companies said Tuesday.  Stablecoins such as USDT and USDC have become cornerstones of crypto and the catalysts for new trading paradigms such as decentralized finance (DeFi). But non-crypto natives are now realizing the wider possibilities of stablecoins, and the expansion of use cases is particularly visible when it comes to offering regulated stablecoins in a local currency such as the Japanese yen, according to Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica.  “Think about a ride hailing firm or food delivery company, or payroll or remittances. This is about instant availability of funds and the velocity of money in society,” Mónica said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Crypto is just implementation detail. It’s just a way that we built on the internet that has caused this to be so cheap.”  As far as the current climate is concerned, events like the collapse of terraUSD (UST) and sister coin LUNA, followed by several high-profile crypto firms going into bankruptcy have led to a flight to safety, Mónica added.  “Conversations that weren’t really being had last year around whether crypto is part of bankruptcy procedures, are assets commingled etc. were not really asked in 2021,” he said. “These types of questions are now asked every week in 2022. We have the clearest answers because we are a regulated federal bank.”  Read more: Anchorage Digital to Introduce Ether Staking for Institutions as Move to PoS Approaches",POSITIVE,LUNA | GMO,ASIA | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING | GMO,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/crypto-custody-specialist-anchorage-digital-offers-japanese-yen-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0510de8b76b1f2edf9bf1591926316b5050533e1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
