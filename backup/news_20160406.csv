42398982,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpmX,1459967982,Bitcoin Core Opens Doors to Outside Funding With Sponsorship Program,"Bitcoin Core has announced a new sponsorship program, a move that finds the largely volunteer community that develops the open-source bitcoin software opening its development process up to funding from industry stakeholders.  The announcementhttps://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/04/04/announcing_sponsorship_programme/ comes weeks after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced a $900,000 support fund aimed at promoting bitcoin development. In that instance, however, the funds are being directed to three specific developers – Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan.  In interview, Van der Laan, the project's lead maintainer told CoinDesk that the initiative grew out of desire from startups in the bitcoin space to help support the open-source project financially.  ""A few companies are showing interest in funding Bitcoin Core development, which could be a big help to us,"" he said. ""It would allow more directed development in addition to the open-source approach we've always used.""  Van der Laan went on to explain:  ""This means that some tasks that either require longer research or development, such as sync algorithm and privacy improvements, or the (usually perceived as) less sexy tasks such as documentation and Windows support suffer. Also more delicate areas such as the wallet currently suffer from lack of active development.""  This funding, according to the announcement, would go beyond simply funding specific projects.  According to Core’s announcement of the sponsorship program, the project needs funding to help support quality assurance testing as well as money ""for communications, public relations, documentation and other resources"".  Van der Laan told CoinDesk that he’d like to see new documentation for both users and developers, as well as improvements to bitcoin transaction privacy and work on the Lightning Network project.  A list of other top priorities identified by the project can be found herehttps://bitcoincore.org/en/about/sponsorship/programme/.  Decentralized support  Van der Laan said that under the arrangement, companies that are sponsoring a project will remain in control of the funds, or could opt to set up an escrow to disburse them over time.  “Core developers choose a mentor for a project, who will make sure it gets implemented, probably by choosing someone that has contributed to the project before, and that has a reputation of doing such changes right,” he said. ""The funding will just allow them to spend more time on it. Companies decide what specific projects they want to fund.""  Van der Laan went on to suggest that the arrangement is best suited to Core’s capabilities, as opposed to other routes like crowdfunding.  ""We don't have the capacity to deal with, say, crowdfunding and all the noise that entails,"" he said.  In comments to CoinDesk, Core contributor Peter Todd said the process used helps avoid putting responsibility of funds in the hands of a centralized organization like the Bitcoin Foundation, which in previous years had supported development of Core.  ""The structure of it isn't as a central institution, but rather something closer to a 'matchmaking' service – the actual financial interaction is between funder and fundees, with Bitcoin Core helping the two sides get together,"" he said, adding:  ""This is quite unlike, and much more decentralized, than the model of the Bitcoin Foundation as a central entity to hold and distribute funds.""

42426748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUPh,1459963824,The ‘Unsexy’ Way Earthport is Using Shared Ledgers for 'Blockchain' Efficiencies,"""It isn't really sexy.""  That's how Leonard Jaramillo, VP product development at Earthport, describes the way his payment services firm is using distributed ledgers, contrasting its approach to the tech to more convoluted use cases involving QR codes or 'blockchain' technology.  Jaramillo is discussing an integration of Earthport and Ripple technology that takes advantage of the efficiencies of distributed ledgers, without using a form of digital currency, or asset linked to the ledger itself.  This means Earthport is using the Ripple Consensus Ledger, the company’s open-source distributed ledger technology, but not its native asset, XRP. Even without using this part of the offering, Jaramillo argues Ripple helps make its cross-border payments processes ""better and faster"" for all parties involved.  Jaramillo told CoinDesk:  ""There’s still a correspondent with bank A and bank B, and we use currency held at bank A and bank B. Structurally, that isn’t fundamentally changed, you still have counterparties. The advantage is [transactions] now all happen very quickly and everyone reconciles to single balances on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. They get driven down to near real-time.""  Jaramillo said that, in this context, the main benefit Earthport receives from Ripple is the ability to unite correspondent banks and market makers in the same ledger for the purposes of cross-border transactions.  ""It works solely on fiat currencies. There’s no bitcoin, there’s no XRP. There’s no digital bridging asset, it’s standard [foreign exchange],"" Jaramillo emphasizes.  Earthport’s correspondent account network is already live in 60 countries and at 40 institutions. By leveraging this existing account structure, the company has since 1997 worked with banks to offer lower-cost FX conversion.  But the innovation in its latest distributed ledger offering, Jarmillo said, is in the information sharing between the parties this allows.  ""Earthport, banks and market makers can be in the ledger system. Today, it’s just the banks and their counterparty,"" he said. ""There is a single transactional record, everyone can reconcile, everyone can see the balances.""  No cancer cure  To onboard to the system, each bank receives a Ripple node, and in turn, the bank is able to access Earthport's existing global payment services network.  Earthport also onboards market makers to its system, which determine the bid/ask rates for transactions and then facilitate cross-border payments for clients in trades using traditional government currencies.  In this light, Jaramillo suggested that the hype around blockchain technology more broadly is overblown. For example, he called certain efforts ""dog and pony shows"" that perhaps overstate the importance of new digital assets or suggest that collaboration is needed for the benefits of shared ledgers to be realized.  ""[Shared ledgers] are not going to cure cancer or stop global warming, but it is a tool that can make processes more efficient, and we’ve figured out a good way without a whole lot of work required,"" Jaramillo said.  Unlike proof-of-concepts in development, Jaramillo asserts that Earthport’s program is live today, and that as such, it is able to clearly show clients the value of the technology.  ""We can show them, this is the entire process flow, there’s how compliance works, here’s how fraud detection occurs. We do compliance and AML,"" he said.  Jaramillo said that this ability helps mitigate concerns of clients who may be more familiar with the open bitcoin blockchain, which uses a largely anonymous network of validators.  ""It’s no longer a tech that lives in a lab, it’s real-world applications, real-world bank accounts, real-world financial transactions that can be audited and reported on, and it brings it reality so banks and market makers can jump in,"" he said.  No need for XRP  As for the role of XRP, the Ripple Consensus Ledger’s publicly traded token, Jaramillo said it isn’t needed for this project because the traditional market makers it works with already have access to the currencies they need to facilitate trades.  ""There’s enough individuals who do this now. There’s not a lack of liquidity,"" he continued.  Studies conducted by Ripple still suggest users of its Ripple Consensus Ledger can save upwards of 40% on trades by using XRP, a figure slightly higher than the savings achieved by those who do not use XRP.  Jaramillo said that while he sees the value in potentially encouraging market makers to use a ""common asset"" between parties, regulators have perhaps not given sufficient guidance for financial services firms like Earthport to leverage these offerings.  ""I understand how a digital currency could be used, and I think there’s potential for that in the future, but the chasm that is between us and that reality is no central bank or government or institution in the world has given approval to use a digital currency,"" he said.  He said that, in this light, both bitcoin and XRP, as well as other alternative digital currencies currently fall into a gray area, and that even without these tools, Earthport’s solution enables the same efficiencies but in US dollars or British pounds.  Jaramillo said:  ""Earthport is in the business of providing banking solutions to banks. We brought Ripple in to make banking better.""

42426762,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUrh,1459953953,"Hours After Launch, OpenBazaar Sees First Drug Listings","The open-source, peer-to-peer marketplace software OpenBazaar officially went live yesterday, marking a major milestone for the long-in-development project.  Powered by the use of bitcoin as a payments method, OpenBazaar is intended to serve as a decentralized alternative to marketplaces like eBay, in which a central entity acts as a money clearing house as well as an arbiter for behavior.  OpenBazaar, by contrast, uses the distributed bitcoin blockchain to handle payments, and users can act as judges to resolve disputes or hire their own mediators.  Yet within hours of launch, what appear to be listings for drug-related products have already begun to appear.  Two vendors have advertised marijuana purchases (with one now inactive at press time), while another that previously sold cannabis seeds has also gone offline. OpenBazaar listing tracking tool BazaarBay.org still lists some of the now-removed offerings.    The big question is: Are they the real deal?  Brian Hoffman, project lead for OB1, the development startup that oversees work on the OpenBazaar protocol, told CoinDesk that his team is aware of the listings, and that the listings boil down to two sources: legitimate vendors taking a risk in an attempt to sell their wares via OpenBazaar, and trolls simply looking to stir up trouble.  He continued:  ""We continue to plan to create ways for users to better control the [user] experience on the network, but unfortunately the good comes with the bad and there will most likely always be those who choose to participate in ways that disrupt or ruin the experience for others. We will continue to find more ways to mitigate those challenges.""  The project has long drawn comparisons to the Silk Road, the now-defunct dark market, and OpenBazaar’s potential to serve as a distributed version that has no central point of failure.  While the OpenBazaar team has stressed in the past that they are agnostic about the offers made through the open-source protocol, these listings will no doubt continue to fuel that comparison.

42426753,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwUdh,1459952458,Circle Inks Bank Deal With Barclays After UK Regulator Approval,"Bitcoin wallet startup Circle has been granted an electronic money license from a top UK financial regulator.  The approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority – the first of its kind for a digital currency startup – allows Circle to establish a business relationship with London-based bank Barclays.  As a result, Circle is now able to store pound sterling on behalf of its customer base – similar to how it holds dollars for its customers in the US. Further, UK customers can now send money to and from their bank accounts.  ""We support the exploration of positive uses of blockchain that can benefit consumers and society,"" a spokesperson for Barclays told Reuters.  Circle outlined the announcement in a new blog post, which also detailed the company’s thesis on creating a more social payments platform. For example, customers can include digital media like emojis when they transfer funds.  Co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire wrote:  “With Circle’s UK launch, we’re bringing this global vision another step forward. For the first time ever, any consumer in the US or UK can instantly send value, without fees, and with the convenience of sending an email or text. US dollars and pound sterling are becoming more digital and global, and we’re gearing up to bring the same capability to Euro-zone consumers.”  The E-Money license extends past the UK, opening the doors to the rest of the European Union for Circle. The startup indicated that it has plans to add support for euros later this year as part of that planned expansion.  The move also earned praise from the government. In a statement, MP Harriett Baldwin, economic secretary to the UK Treasury, framed the move as part of a broader push for more FinTech firms to make their home in London.  “Britain’s FinTech industry is growing all the time and I am proud the government is playing its part,” she said. “Circle’s decision to launch in the UK and the firm’s new partnership with Barclays are major milestones.”  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Circle.
