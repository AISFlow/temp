42397149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0A9,1369766179,Liberty Reserve's lesson: Don't take liberties with the law,"There’s at least one lesson to be learned from the recent closure of Liberty Reserve for alleged money laundering: whether you use “real” government-backed fiat or a distributed digital currency controlled by no one in particular, what you use it for is subject to laws and regulations of many kinds. Fall afoul of those, and the authorities will sooner or later come looking for you.  The Costa Rica-based Liberty Reserve used its own digital currency -- also called the Liberty Reserve, or LR -- to provide low-cost payment processing services to customers around the world. Its ease of payments is credited with helping early Bitcoin adopters use their dollars or euros to buy and sell the digital currency via exchanges.  However, Liberty Reserve’s minimal verification requirements (“Essentially, all a customer needed to open an account was an e-mail address,” noted the New York Times.) appears also to have appealed to those looking for a way to make illegal transactions ""anonymous and untraceable,"" according to the 27-page indictment handed down against the company and its principles in US federal court on Tuesday.  “Through the defendants’ efforts, Liberty Reserve has emerged as one of the principal means by which cyber-criminals around the world distribute, store, and launder the proceeds of their illegal activity,” the indictment states. “Indeed, Liberty Reserve has become a financial hub of the cyber-crime world, facilitating a broad range of online criminal activity, including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking.”  The indictment notes that “virtually all of Liberty Reserve’s business derived from suspected criminal activity,” adding that the scope of its unlawful conduct was “staggering.”  “Estimated to have had more than one million users worldwide, with more than 200,000 users in the United States, Liberty Reserve processed more than 12 million financial transactions annually, with a combined value of more than $1.4 billion,” the indictment states. “Overall, from 2006 to May 2013, Liberty Reserve processed an estimated 55 million separate financial transactions and is believed to have laundered more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds.”  Arthur Budovsky, described as Liberty Reserve’s principal founder, and Vladimir Kats, a company co-founder, were both arrested this past week – Budovsky in Spain and Kats in Brooklyn. Also arrested was Azzeddine El Amine, a company principal. Two others – past manager Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani and manager/part-owner Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez – reportedly remain at large in Costa Rica.  This is not Budovsky’s or Kats’ first run-in with the law. Both were arrested in 2006 when US authorities determined their digital currency exchange, Gold Age – which dealt in the digital currency e-gold – was conducting “money transmittal without a license”. The two were sentenced to five years of probation in 2007. (Around this same time, Budovsky emigrated to Costa Rica; he later renounced his US citizenship and became a Costa Rican citizen.)  The unlicensed money transmission charge is the same one used recently by the US Department of Homeland Security to seize Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox funds held in Dwolla.  The Costa Rican financial regulator SUGEF in 2009 denied Liberty Reserve’s application for a money transmitting business license, noting – according to the US indictment – that “Liberty Reserve did not have even basic anti-money laundering controls in place such as ‘know your customer’ procedures, and otherwise lacked any effective means of tracking suspicious activity within its system.”  Liberty Reserve subsequently set up a computer portal that “appeared to give Costa Rican regulators the ability to access Liberty Reserve transactional information and monitor it for suspicious activity.” However, the indictment adds, most of the data appearing in the portal was fake and could be manipulated to hide information from authorities.  By late 2011, Liberty Reserve had also been flagged by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which warned financial institutions about the risks of providing services to the company.  FinCEN earlier this year issued new guidance that applies to “persons administering, exchanging or using virtual currencies.” In the wake of that release, several Bitcoin exchanges ceased operations.  “I’m not surprised,” Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck said at the time. “Since long before the guidelines came out I have been counseling bitcoin exchange operators, both formally and informally, to register with FinCEN as Money Service Businesses (MSBs) and to run a thorough AML/KYC (anti-money laundering/know-your-customer) compliance program for all users of their service. FinCEN stepping in is the least surprising aspect of the guidelines being released.”  Figuring out how the Bitcoin ecosystem fits within a regulatory environment designed for fiat currency is “still a work in progress,” Murck added.  Both alt-currency businesses and traditional regulators are feeling the growing pains, and minimizing those pains will require the two groups to communicate better with each other and educate each other.  “The biggest threat to FinCEN realizing its own goals and mandate (to prevent financial crime) is that they lean too hard on the existing, centralized system of exchanges and push market share to further decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges,” Murck noted. “FinCEN has talked a big game about public-private partnerships but hasn’t followed through.”  Part of following through effectively, he added, is recognizing that regulators – while pursuing their anti-crime efforts online and off – need to make room for legitimate uses of digital currencies in today’s evolving economy.  “The genie is out of the bottle and distributed, math-based currency is here to stay,” Murck said.  But that genie still has to obey the law. Or face some harsh consequences.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/28/liberty-reserves-lesson-dont-take-liberties-with-the-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397164,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0Nv,1369754475,Is Bitcoin science fiction come to life?,"Part of the geek appeal for Bitcoin users is that it is a real-life example of a concept often featured in science fiction or sci-fi-oriented computer games: an advanced, universally accepted form of currency.  Universally accepted forms of payments become essential in a society in which space travel enables humans – and other sentient beings – to hop from planet to planet inhabited by civilizations of all kinds. In some science fiction scenarios, though, the money system is universal not just for expediency, but because it’s backed by a centralized power seeking complete control. That aspect of digital currency does not jibe at all with the freedom from government authority that distinguishes Bitcoin.  “If you ever read sci-fi, it’s like creds,” Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik recently observed. (“Credits” are used by inhabitants of Star Trek within the Federation, though species outside of it, like the Ferengi, take “Gold Pressed Latinum” for payment.)  Gesturing to the USB cards designed to hold bitcoins, Garzik said, “It’s like giving someone your cred stick.”  But are credits truly central to Star Trek? The question of money for the Federation is a subject of both speculation and debate, as the television series and films have not been altogether consistent about if and how money is used in the universe envisioned three centuries into the future.  An article on the Star Trek site – “A Look at Money in Star Trek - Italian Style – examines the subject in detail, from the original series all the way up to the most recent reboot by JJ Abrams. Writer Gabriella Cordone begins by asserting that Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry decreed that no currency was used at all in the Federation. Rodenberry didn’t want “the concept of accumulating wealth” in “his universe,” recalled Ronald D. Moore, co-executive producer of the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine series, in a web interview … nor did he want money to be the prime motivation for doing a job.  That’s consistent with Captain Picard’s famous statement in Star Trek: First Contact: “The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.”  In Star Trek: The Next Generation, in the episode “The Neutral Zone,” Captain Picard tells a businessman revived after three centuries in a cryosatellite that no one in the present time tracks wealth anymore.  “A lot has changed in three hundred years,” Picard tells the man, who had asked about the current value of his holdings. “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of ‘things’. We have eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions.”  That particular change in attitude was supposed to have occurred late in the 22nd century.  In Star Trek: Voyager, Lieutenant Tom Paris refers to Fort Knox as, “the biggest gold deposit Earth had ever had in his history. Over fifty tons for a value of nine trillion dollars.” Under the New World Economy – when “money went the way of the dinosaurs” – Fort Knox was made into a museum.  However, there are instances in the original series where money is mentioned and used … which don’t correspond at all to the attitude expressed later.  In one episode, “The Apple,” Kirk asks Spock,“Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you?” The officer begins to respond, “Twenty-two thousand, two hun ...,” but is cut off by the captain.  Likely, he would have finished that sentence with “credits,” which seems to be the favored term for interplanetary currency.  The Star Wars series also uses the “credit” (full name: Galactic Credit Standard) for commerce.It’s identified as the primary currency (though there are others) throughout the Galactic Republic. While credits serve the same practical purpose in Star Wars as they do in Star Trek, they also represent the galactic reach and control of the Empire. The planetary systems all accept the same currency because there is one ruler over them all who mandates it.  When a governing agency controls currency, it can use that power to consolidate control and to render certain people powerless. That’s what happens in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. The novel envisions a near-future America transformed into the dystopic Republic of Gilead. In Gilead, women have been completely disenfranchised. Thepatriarchical government dictates every aspect of their lives, and decides who gets to keep their children. And it all starts with the control of money.  The narrator, a woman named Offred, recalls that paper had already “gone the way of the dinosaur” during her childhood, for she remembers her mother showing her dollar bills in an album. Money by then had evolved into a “compunumber” that referred to the amount in an account. Offred’s compunumber ceases to work the day the government decrees that women are to have no control over money. Purchases can only be authorized by men, and women soon become no more than property themselves.  Since it was published in 1985, The Handmaid’s Tale has sold millions of copies, and was adapted as both a film and an opera. It has also achieved the distinction of appearing on both required reading lists and banned book lists of schools.  Libertarians who embrace the concept of Bitcoin point to the dangers of government manipulation of digital currencies as a prime argument for having a monetary system that is independent of national control.  Money enables both control and freedom. And money in a universally accepted form does seem to be the wave of the future. Even if we don’t run into civilizations from other planets anytime soon, there are clear benefits in our current global economy to having a system of currency that is accepted all over the world without the need for exchanges and wire transfer fees.  Bitcoin might not be the ultimate answer. But it certainly invites plenty of speculation into the question of how money will evolve in the near future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | SPONSORED,Ariella Brown,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/28/is-bitcoin-science-fiction-come-to-life,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b39c27c2067479a9b1f8b92da4eba0841228bda-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
