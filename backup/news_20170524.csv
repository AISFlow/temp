42399934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7xm,1495657515,"Bitcoin, Ether Set New All-Time Highs Amid Market Boom","The price of bitcoin and ether, the digital tokens that power the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains, reached new all-time highs today.  At press time, bitcoin had topped $2,500 and a total market capitalization of $40bn for the first time ever. Ether, currently the second-largest by market capitalization, hit $228.37 at roughly 13:30 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap.  By rising to this level, ether prices surpassed the previous record of $201.75 set on 22nd May, though at the time of report, the cryptocurrency's price had fallen back somewhat, trading at $188.18.  Bitcoin and ether's price rose to this record level amid a broader rise in investments in cryptocurrencies, with others like zcash, hitting multi-month highs.  Enterprise interest  Several analysts pointed to the general increase in attention on cryptographic assets of late as reason for the gain, with the CEO of Fidelity making a public statement of her enthusiasm for both bitcoin and ether yesterday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference.  Fidelity's statement coincided with an announcement that the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a consortium focused on harnessing ethereum's technology for enterprise, had more than tripled in size as helping fuel ether's recent price gains.  The alliance announced the addition of 86 members, including major corporations Merck, Samsung and Toyota.  An announcement  by JP Morgan that it would seek to use the open-source tech underlying zcash further impacted the price of that asset, with analysts largely crediting this move to its price breakout this week.

42399922,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7pu,1495648824,Consensus 2017: Blockchain Consortia in A Rapidly Changing Market,"""Whatever we build today will probably have to be changed again.""  So said Eiki Hatakeyama of the Western Asset Management Company, highlighting a sense of realism that came through in a series of workshops sponsored by distributed ledger consortium R3 during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference.  Discussions revolved around the rapidly changing marketplace – and the difficulty of keeping up, even within industry consortia that bring together a wide array of stakeholders.  For that reason, he explained, his fixed income investment firm was ""okay with dragging our feet a bit just a little bit longer to see how this technology changes"".  David Sullivan, a VP for insurer MetLife, echoed that sentiment, joking that:  ""You're ok with dragging your feet a little bit, we're dragging our feet a lot.""  Keep on moving  In spite of the uncertainty surrounding the technology and its applications, some panelists stressed the need to experiment and think big.  Chris Swanson of US Bank pointed out that most current proofs-of-concept that exist today are on such a small scale that they're ""almost not real"". He urged financial enterprises to focus their efforts on one thing they're comfortable with – and then move on it.  ""Getting something real to market will get us so much data,"" he said.  Panelists advocated for a more gradual process, however. Jennifer O'Rourke, blockchain business lead for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity's Office of Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Technology, pointed out that to get buy-in from both colleagues and the markets you serve, you need to be able to explain the tech and to calm any concerns.  She went on to say:  ""You can't use the Uber approach of just plowing forward.""  O'Rourke later pointed out that, in her opinion, any distributed ledger technology application would be implemented gradually, on top of existing processes.  Hatakeyama also expressed the need to move carefully, recommending that businesses start with a low-volume area of their business.  Working together  While Corda itself may have advantages for the market its targeting, several panelists strived to highlight the risks of choosing one system over others.  Swanson of US Bank pointed out that one of his biggest concerns was interoperability over the next couple of years. He also highlighted the overlap between several of the consortia out there, especially when it comes to asset representation.  Andrew Golomb, an equity investments director for Bank of America, invoked the difficulties of balancing one's own interests with those of the consortia. He argued that a consortium could fail if members move to protect themselves too much.  ""The whole point of a consortium is to enhance competition and bring down costs,"" he said.  Jenny Cieplak of Crowell & Moring recognized the concern, and that it was a challenge for consortia to come up with an intellectual property structure that gets everyone comfortable with sharing.  Along with the other panelists, though, she believes that enterprises have a better chance of getting things done when working together – and that people are more likely to trust a consortium than an individual financial institution.  She explained:  ""It's about developing a framework for the sharing of ideas, even if not sharing code or technical design.""

42399914,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7k0,1495641628,Consensus 2017: Bitcoin Exchange Execs See Promise in Multi-Token Future,"How would you build a bitcoin exchange if you had to start from scratch?  According to Adam White, head of Coinbase's GDAX exchange, the answer is you wouldn't want to simply support bitcoin alone.  ""We'd design our exchange to be able to support more assets more quickly. There was this theory that network effects would aggregate everyone into one asset. We see that's not the case,"" he remarked at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference today in New York.  White went on to tell attendees:  ""There will be hundreds if not thousands of digital assets in the coming years.""  The remarks come amid growing enthusiasm for blockchain-based cryptographic assets that offer different value propositions than bitcoin. Overall, the market for all cryptocurrencies is up 400% this year, rising to $88m from $17.6m in January.  Amidst this diversification, Ola Doudin, CEO of Dubai-based bitcoin exchange and brokerage BitOasis, remarked on the rise in enthusiasm for alternative digital assets, noting how its customers in the Middle East are now twice as likely to buy ether than bitcoin.  Tony Lyu, CEO and founder of Korbit, also discussed the challenges in listing new cryptographic assets, given the variety of new opportunities and the short attention spans of a small set of early adopters.  ""For every asset we list, there's diminishing returns,"" Lyu said. ""If you go chasing to the next hot coin, by the time they launch it on the exchange, the fad has passed.""  Conversation later turned to the subject of how, exactly, tokens should be dispersed to users.  While the bitcoin software offered a mining network, enabling users to run computing power to gain a share of the bitcoins it created, entrepreneurs are now largely bucking this trend. Through a process called an initial coin offering (ICO), many projects are simply creating and selling tokens on existing blockchains to build a network effect and raise capital.  Here, opinions were split with some industry luminaries emphasizing the opportunity the new blockchain use case creates, and others offering more bearish insight.  ""There was probably a time in the distant past where Silicon Valley startups were funded too much too soon, and I think the ICO market is in the similar space,"" said Zooko Wilcox, founder of the Zcash Electric Coin Company, which manages the Zcash blockchain.  Erik Voorhees, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange startup ShapeShift, gave the most eloquent defense for the model onstage. His remarks showcase how the industry is defending the concept even while acknowledging that failures in the current environment are likely.  ""You can have shares of a common endeavor that people would like to build, and to give immediate liquidity around that idea,"" Voorhees said, adding:  ""All sorts of ideas will happen. Not all will be good. That's not really the point, the point is the friction of money and liquidity.""

42399921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7ov,1495634436,"Coinbase Today: Armstrong Talks Token, ICOs and Blockchain's Netscape","You have to give credit where it's due – and looking at the increasingly strange and diversifying blockchain industry, it's not hard to view Coinbase as some sort of bastion of sanity.  If that's true, then much of that connotation stems from Brian Armstrong, the firm's founder and long-time CEO. Founded in 2012, Coinbase has grown from a one-man developer project to a multi-product conglomerate of public blockchain services, one that has a strong wallet and brokerage product (Coinbase) and blossoming exchange business (GDAX).  In an industry where grown-ups spend most of their time fighting on Twitter, chasing ideas that defy any rational explanation and talking about changing the world with an almost religious zealotry, Armstrong's firm has been called bitcoin's 'blue chip' for this reason.  That's not to say there haven't been hiccups. A plan to build a developer ecosystem on top of bitcoin, for example, largely fell away, and Armstrong's attempts to influence the digital currency's long-running scaling debate did much to disillusion some customers.  Through it all, though, Coinbase has kept up progress – raising more than $100m, somehow consistently building brand and product through three boom cycles and checking in with CoinDesk along the way.  Speaking before Consensus 2017 this week, it's less of an interview and more of a conversation between people who have been staring at the same screen for too long. We talk about a $2,000 bitcoin. There's a mutual acceptance that the once small cryptocurrency space might be coming of age.  Armstrong told CoinDesk:  ""You've got the mainland, and you've got this little island, and initially there were people who made it to the island on a raft or something. Coinbase built a bridge and we've got a shitload of people who go over that bridge. That island is starting to get pretty populated.""  Before the conversation drifts too far into unknowns, we cover expected ground. Armstrong is bullish on ethereum, excited for the launch of his new ethereum-powered payment app Token, cautious on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and clear and concise when talking about his company's direction forward and the various opportunities available to it.  As bitcoin gains more traction as a financial asset, Armstrong said he's focused on the technology to achieve bigger goals, and that's why Token is an important step in the evolution of Coinbase's product suite.  ""I'm excited for the world to have an open financial system. What I want the whole industry to think about is how we can continue to shift digital currency from being a speculative investment to being used for goods and services,"" he said.  On Token  Like other digital currency startups, Armstrong has a certain company in mind when talking about its new Token product, and that's WeChat.  The messaging app was also cited by Circle in its pivot away from competing with Coinbase as a broker, yet Armstrong painted the paths the two companies are taking differently. Key to Token is the rising interest around the ethereum blockchain, a platform that is winning favor with developers in a way that bitcoin never seemed to be able to achieve.  Looking back, Armstrong recalls that it took former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn (now with R3CEV), eight to nine months to build an app called Lighthouse on bitcoin.  With ethereum, Armstrong believes he's found a way to open up a payments platform to developers in the way he envisioned bitcoin might allow.  ""There are already some apps on Token. Even the whole thing took three hours to build, so there's this order of magnitude difference,"" Armstrong said.  In this way, he called ethereum blockchain tech's ""Netscape moment"", crediting the phrase to venture capitalist Fred Wilson, whose firm Union Square Ventures is a Coinbase investor.  On central bank-backed blockchains  Yet, there's the matter of whether public blockchains are still the best way to achieve financial inclusion, or if that's the best future for bitcoin, which has seen most of its popularity stem from its use as a 'digital gold'.  One question posed is whether Armstrong would ever shift the company's technology strategy if its vision required it, say in some hypothetical situation where bitcoin became more specialized and central bank-backed digital currencies became the vehicle by which financial access was increased.  For his part, Armstrong agrees that this is a possibility, especially with global central banks increasingly becoming a vocal part of the blockchain community.  ""My theory is there are going to be some countries in the world that are progressive and they're going to get this stuff from government. But, there's another category that will come from this grassroots movement,"" he argued.  While this might be a ""valid way to get financial inclusion"", Armstrong continued, it still likely wouldn't provide the kind of open banking system that he wants to build. Further, in most cases, this development might happen ""in spite of the government"" and without the help of traditional financial services providers, he said.  On ICOs  Democratization of access remains the theme, and this emphasis eventually guides the conversation to initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which entrepreneurs are selling blockchain-linked data that will power distributed networks or products.  Like CoinDesk, Armstrong noted that Coinbase has been inundated with offers from companies seeking to list these tokens on its exchange. But while other exchanges perfect the art of quickly adding new offerings, thus capturing the market, he indicated we shouldn't expect his company to follow the same path.  ""We're not trying to be the fastest and the cheapest, we're trying to be the most trusted and easiest to use. I would love to have a dozen digital currencies listed by the end of the year, that's the right long-term strategy, but it's about making sure we do that safely and deliberately,"" he said.  Still, he agrees that there's something about the concept, encapsulating how bitcoin achieved value creation and network effect, but realizing it in a new way. In this way, Armstrong sees ICOs as another way to use blockchains to expand access to a service, in this case, startup capitalization.  ""Certain people have access to tons of capital in Silicon Valley, but that is not true of most people in the world,"" he remarked.  On Wall Street  Armstrong is also setting his sights on another key region across the country from his San Francisco offices – and maybe unsurprisingly given the recently escalating value of the cryptocurrency market – that's Wall Street.  While he's short on details, he acknowledged that GDAX has hired a number of personnel to begin meeting with hedge funds and family offices. Asked if this means Coinbase could launch a stock market vehicle, or a specialized product, he also deferred.  ""I think one of the best things we can do with the GDAX product is slowly eat up the food chain,"" he said, going on to liken Coinbase as a the Fidelity of cryptocurrencies and GDAX as a sort of New York Stock Exchange.  Still, he said it will likely be a long road. ""Some traders, if they can't move $1bn in volume, it's not interesting,"" he said, concluding:  ""But every year it's tripling in volumes, so it's a matter of time.""

42399928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7tq,1495627203,Wyre’s WeChat and Facebook Bot Authenticates Invoices on Ethereum,"US blockchain payments firm Wyre has launched a new bot for Facebook Messenger and WeChat that authenticates invoices through a public blockchain.  In WeChat or Messenger, a supplier sends the transaction details to the Wyre bot, which will generate and email a PDF invoice to all parties. The invoice is then hashed and stamped onto an ethereum blockchain every hour to verify where it came from.  Scamming people with fake invoices is too easy, said Michael Dunworth, CEO and founder of Wyre. Last month for example, tech giants Google and Facebook allegedly fell prey to forged invoices and phishing attacks, losing $100m in the process.  The bot is designed to make sending and receiving invoices easier, so it needed a clear method of authentication, said Dunworth  He explained:  “It’s on our official wallet where you can see the input data of the hashes in the blockchain. We put it into HEX and you can convert that into ASCII, if you look at ethereum, with just the click of the button. That’s just a security measure for clients so they know [the invoice] did go through the Wyre bot. It’s not someone pretending they went through the Wyre bot.”  “Businesses should be using this. It is the most simple, basic use of a blockchain, it just makes complete sense,” he added.  Data privacy  The only information stored on the ledger is the hash of the invoice that the buyer, seller and Wyre can see. No information like names or invoice amounts are registered.  The Wyre bot uses an ethereum blockchain to authenticate the hash every hour as using bitcoin would have been too expensive, Dunworth said, adding:  “[Ethereum] costs 20 cents a transaction or something, whereas if I did that on bitcoin, it’s probably going to cost me $2. If we did it on bitcoin, to make it cost effective, we’d probably have to do it daily and I just prefer it to be hourly.”  The minimum viable product (MPV) of the bot was built in about six weeks and the company is considering other applications such as multi-invoice processing and support for other platforms like WhatsApp or Slack.  “I think using the blockchain to verify, like we’re doing with invoices, is an incredibly simple and underrated use case. I would think almost every single business in the world should have an official blockchain wallet, just like they’ve got an official Twitter account,” Dunworth told CoinDesk.  The bot announcement comes not long after Wyre acquired Chinese blockchain payments startup Remitsy to help its entry into China and facilitate more payments services between the Asian nation and the US. Remitsy will soon be coming under the Wyre branding and is currently migrating customers, Dunworth said.

42399918,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7kz,1495623691,Consensus 2017 Day 2 Recap: Finding Blockchain's Common Ground,"Can regulators and the entrepreneurs who want to use blockchain to upend the markets and sectors they work in find common ground?  The panels of the second day of Consensus 2017, in part, iterated on some of the first day's ideas with a focus on balance and progress, touching on systemic applications such as healthcare, insurance, energy and even central bank currencies.  One idea mentioned nearly across the board was the need to get the regulators involved in the innovation, with the aim of getting support from both sides of the table.  Gathering the table  Monica Singer from South African central securities depository (CSD) Strate stressed the increasing role of authorized institutions in maintaining market stability. She sees her firm's role as one of a negotiator and facilitator, acting as a bridge between the financial industry and the regulators.  Custodianship is still an uncertain area, however, with little cohesion across geographical borders.  Several panelists on the ""Digital Currencies: Are Institutional Investors Ready to Buy?"" panel expressed the concern that, without clear custodianship rules, institutional investors will be held back by the uncertainty. Given the potential ""wall of institutional money"" that hasn't touched the space yet, according to Brian Kelly of fund manager BKCM, this also holds back the value of the sector.  ""The US is rapidly losing its global financial hub status,"" he said.  Progress is being made, however, as others pointed out.  Debbie Bucci, from the Office of the National Coordinator for the US Department of Health and Human Services, discussed her agency's participation in what was one of the first hackathons sponsored by the US government.  Breaking the balance  Yet the disruption that some firms are seeking could, inevitably, upset that balance, some panelists argued.  Speaking on a panel titled ""Working with Central Banks"", Robleh Ali of MIT pushed the point that, for the first time in living memory, payments and banking could be split.  He went on to highlight that bitcoin also got us re-examining another fundamental pillar of our financial system: how is money created?  During the ""Digital Currency’s Future"" panel, Eric Voorhees made it clear that he didn’t think that regulators should get anywhere near bitcoin, and that it has enough challenges as it is.  He went on to say:  ""Imagine if in order to create a website you need to have [know-your-customer], and to create a blog, you need a registered government ID … That kind of regulatory climate is what bitcoin and the crypto world is having to deal with today. The internet is only powerful and important because of how little it was touched by regulators – that’s what I want to happen in crypto, for the very same reason.""  The round of applause that ensued was evidence that, while Consensus 2017 was in part a bridge between regulators, enterprise representatives and blockchain innovators, many in the ecosystem still hold on to the core concepts of decentralized finance.

42399930,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7vo,1495620013,Consensus 2017: The Ups and Downs of Digital Currencies,"Against the backdrop of a climbing cryptocurrency market on Tuesday, two panels at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference focused on both the promise and pitfalls of working with (or investing in) digital currencies and blockchain assets.  During one session, representatives from the trading, investing and legal sectors honed in what is perhaps an obvious pain point: regulation, particularly in New York.  ""We have a Soviet situation here,"" noted Marco Santori, fintech team leader for Cooley LLP.  Santori, who works with companies in the blockchain space, told the crowd that a number of his clients have pulled out of New York due to frustrations with the so-called BitLicense, a regulatory framework launched by the state in mid-2015.  Michael Moro, CEO of New York-based Genesis Global Trading, described the frustration his firm has experienced in trying to add a new token to trade.  ""We asked for permission to trade in September, and here I am still nine months later, still waiting,"" he said.  Santori pointed out that everything was easier when there was just bitcoin. Now, with so many cryptocurrencies entering the market, the environment has become that much more difficult. On that note, Santori went on to point out that consumer protections just are not there yet.  ""Frankly, the policy goal of promoting these innovative spaces far outstrips the consumer protection goal in the token space,"" he said, drawing a round of applause from the audience.  But those regulatory burdens could ultimately drive out more companies, the panelists later noted, including Brian Kelly, CNBC contributor and founder of hedge fund BKCM.  ""I will say that the US is rapidly losing its global financial hub status because of this,"" he argued.  Asset exuberance  During Tuesday's second digital currency-focused panel, five cryptocurrency blockchain reps gathered to discuss the industry – and the current euphoria in the space.  ""The whole space is enjoying the moment,"" offered Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets for Ripple.  But others on the panel see today's environment as more ominous.  ""There is a large amount of irrational exuberance,"" warned Riccardo Spagni, project lead at Monero, pointing out that traders do not have the technical knowledge to understand what they are trading. Instead, they're far more interested in whether they make money, he argued.  Vias went on to say:  ""Every day you wake up and there is a new coin that does the same thing that somebody else is doing right now. While I love the innovation and risk and guts in the space, you have to recognize, most of these things will not be worth what they are worth in the future. You will have a culling of the heard and the strong will survive.""  Others concurred on that last point, including Julian Zawistowski, CEO and founder of Golem.  ""Sooner or later, the market will clear,"" he said.  Correction: A quote in this piece was originally misattributed to Riccardo Spagni. This has been changed.

42399915,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7j1,1495616406,Consensus 2017: Blockchain and Healthcare's People Problem,"Startups and healthcare companies are looking at blockchain as a possible way to give patients greater control over their data – but getting there might not be as easy as it sounds.  The question of giving patients ownership of their medical and healthcare-related data was a central one during a Tuesday panel at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference.  Debbie Bucci – a leading figure in the US Department of Health and Human Service's push into blockchain – explained how there are already policies in place designed to give patients greater access to their health records. But few people take advantage of them, according to Bucci, and the possibilities of what that control means is largely lost on most people.  Bucci noted:  ""Consumers don't really know the power of owning their own information.""  But with that ownership comes risk. As the recent spate of ransomware attacks perpetrated against healthcare institutions demonstrates, that data has value. By taking greater control of their sensitive data, according to Bryan Smith, chief scientist of blockchain healthcare startup PokitDok, consumers then shoulder the risk of keeping it secure.  ""When consumers own the data, there’s a shift in liability to the consumer,"" Smith said.  But the general consensus among the panelists – who also included John Bass, the CEO of Hashed Health; Mike Jacobs, a distinguished engineer at the Healthcare Services division of UnitedHealth Group; Chris Young at Ascension Health; and moderator Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce – was that those kinds of obstacles are worth trying to overcome.  Young, vice president of new virtual market development at Ascension, said the underlying issues center around granularity and prioritization. The solution? Education.  ""If you can give that to them and really let them access it, that’s a game changer,"" he concluded.

42399933,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7up,1495584025,Bitcoin's New Scaling 'Agreement': The Reaction,"A meeting of bitcoin startup executives and miners held this weekend has resulted in the publication of a new proposal for how the open-source project should be upgraded to support additional transaction capacity.  Detailed in a Medium post published by investment firm Digital Currency Group today, the proposal was billed as an agreement that would make two changes toward this stated goal. The proposal was signed by more than 50 companies, and claims to have support from 83% of the network's miners – businesses that operate computers that secure the blockchain and add new transactions to it.  First, it lowered the barrier for the activation of Segregated Witness, the long-stalled proposal put forward by Bitcoin Core developers in December 2015, to 80% of the network's mining power. Second, it stated that the undersigned businesses would agree to activate software that would upgrade bitcoin's block size to 2MB via a process known as a hard fork.  DCG further called on companies, miners, users and developers to join the proposal via a dedicated web form that was provided in the post.  The company wrote:  ""We are also committed to the research and development of technical mechanisms to improve signaling in the bitcoin community, as well as to put in place communication tools, in order to more closely coordinate with ecosystem participants in the design, integration, and deployment of safe solutions that increase bitcoin capacity.""  Abra, Bitclub Network, Bitcoin.com, BitFury, Bitmain, BitPay, Blockchain, Bloq, Circle, RSK Labs and Xapo are said to be providing technical and engineering support to prepare for the upgrades, though their commitment was not further detailed.  Notable, however, is the absence of developers making up the open-source development community Bitcoin Core. Blockstream, a company that funds two such developers, opted not to attend the meeting when it was announced in March, with Blockstream CEO Adam Back formally declining to participate on behalf of the startup.  According to those involved, the proposal will use an idea put forth by RSK Labs developer Sergio Demian Lerner in early April, though it's notable that several developers rejected the proposal in following emails. (The idea has been floated many times before as well.)  Speaking to CoinDesk, Lerner affirmed that the startup would play a role in the process, though he said he ""probably won't write"" the code that is eventually used.  ""Our agreement is to audit that code,"" he said.  No code was released in the announcement, and others were less clear about what technology would underlie the move.  According to those involved, the process by which the measure would be approved involves miners augmenting coinbase transactions in new bitcoin blocks to signal their support, as soft forks are usually deployed. By signaling on ""bit"", miners would be voicing their approval for a process by which SegWit would be activated at the time of a network fork.  ""SegWit can activate immediately and the same bit will say in the future, at X date, a 2 MB hardfork happens, signaling two events with one bit,"" said Jeff Garzik, founder of bitcoin startup and proposal signatory Bloq.  What's different this time?  One of the more complex questions that resulted from the publication centers around just what it means exactly – and if it will really impact bitcoin's technical direction.  Garzik put forth the strongest argument that it marks a significant departure from past proposals, namely because it finds new businesses funding technical efforts that will benefit the non-proprietary code.  ""I think a mistake that every business has made is that they free-rode on Core,"" Garzik said.  Others remarked similarly that the commitment might be real this time. Marshall Long, one of the leaders behind Bitcoin Classic, an early 2016 effort to increase bitcoin's block size, argued that the ""field of communication"" is improved over previous efforts.  In particular, he referenced a 2016 agreement between a subset of miners and developers, colloquially termed ""The Hong Kong Agreement"", which originally committed to a timetable that would see both the activation of the SegWit code upgrade and the development of a 2MB hard fork. Ultimately, both timelines were missed.  ""We've seen this before, so it has a less likely chance of turning out the same way. The recent history, the Hong Kong agreement is so fresh, something will happen good or bad,"" Long told CoinDesk.  Still, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow, whose firm did not sign the proposal, noted that, like with other fork proposals, there is disagreement that it represents a significant enough majority to impact the network's direction.  ""The technical community and a big swath of users have already said that a hard fork is not needed now,"" Mow said, adding:  ""This proposal is just going back and rehashing things that have already been discussed at length.""  Chaincode developer Matt Corallo had a similar view.  ""I’m somewhat disappointed that all of the feedback given by folks who’ve worked on the bitcoin protocol was completely ignored,"" he said in the DCG chat group. ""[I] suggest much more technically realistic ways to accomplish the same goal.""  Who gets what?  Others commented on the somewhat messy sociology behind the positioning, given that bitcoin users have been so firmly entrenched along partisan lines – with those supporting so-called ""off-chain scaling"" solutions on one, and those backing ""on-chain scaling"" solutions that would increase the hard-coded block size on the other.  For example, Bloq economist Paul Storzc, whose startup is supporting the proposal, noted that he wasn't sure exactly what the compromise was.  ""People wanted SegWit on the small block side, but the small block side thought the big block side would also like it because it's getting larger blocks, so it was unclear there would be any sentiment against it,"" he explained.  Still, he noted that the activation of SegWit as part of the deal would be unlikely to win over Bitcoin Core developers. ""It isn't a huge concession to the small blockers to activate SegWit. It was only being withheld to annoy them anyway in the first place,"" he remarked.  Bitcoin miner Chandler Guo noted his belief that, if anything, the compromise is perhaps more out of necessity given frustration over the stagnation of the technology's development, and that in the end, there are perhaps no winners.  In a roundabout analogy, he compared the deal to a ""beautiful girl"" who would finally need to marry an ""ugly man"" due to indecision.  ""The beautiful girl was waiting and waiting, and they have to marry someone, it doesn't matter who. The beautiful girl has to finally marry someone,"" he said.  Will the network fork?  Perhaps the most contentious part of the agreement is the commitment to a bitcoin hard fork within a certain timeframe.  Yifu Guo, the founder of bitcoin mining firm Avalon (now Canaan), professed to skepticism that the timeline would be held. ""I'll believe it when I see it,"" he said. ""It's too fast, they don't have enough adoption.""  Even with the agreement, Guo said, there are technical limitations to how fast such a solution could be tested. Asked if he thought it would be a success, he said: ""I don't believe that.""  Others were also concerned about the six-month timeline as those backing the proposal would have to develop code, ensure that it has widespread agreement, and deploy it all before the deadline.  ""I don’t think it’s very realistic. Six months is not long enough. Let’s put it like that,"" said bitcoin enthusiast Stefan Jespers, who goes by the moniker 'WhalePanda'. He mentioned that it took developers six months to develop SegWit, and that it takes a long time for nodes to upgrade, offering recent bitcoin client versions as examples.  ""You know the expression 'honey badger doesn't care' in bitcoin?"" said Jespers. ""People are going to oppose it, because it seems like they're being forced into it. Even if 80% of the miners support it, then what do the other 20% want to do?""  He added that he feels many developers and users don't support a block size parameter increase, and that their voices were excluded from the agreement.  Action at any cost?  The fact that a range of scaling proposals have been put forth over the last year, with none ultimately reaching full agreement from the bitcoin community, meant there was also a notable skepticism of the proposal.  Still, some argue that it's at least a path forward.  ShapeShift CEO and co-founder Erik Voorhees, one of the companies that signed the agreement, told CoinDesk:  ""I'm almost of the opinion that I don’t care what path is chosen for bitcoin. I just want something to happen. Bitcoin's been in this deadlock for two years. I'm a supporter of SegWit. I’m a supporter of a hard fork to a larger block size.""  There were also strong enthusiasts of the measure due to the perception that fees on the network are escalating with the bitcoin blockchain's increasing use. Here, a variety of perspectives diverged, most of them stemming from disagreements on how economic costs of the network should function and who should pay those costs.  Garzik, for example, stressed the pain that he believes users are feeling, stating the proposal ""actually addresses a problem facing the user community"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""[Bitcoin] Core is refusing to do anything in the short term that will actually increase capacity. If you want to talk about price, talk about transaction fee price.""  Are network and startup needs the same?  Elsewhere, comments underscored a key divide in the argument, whether the bitcoin network should even adapt to the needs of startups.  Paul Puey, CEO and co-founder of wallet provider Airbitz, said he is in ""full support” of the proposal due to the pain his firm has experienced of late, despite the fact that his startup had not signed the pledge at press time. As a wallet operator, its customers and the company itself have been feeling the strain of the higher transaction fees, and it's due to an upgrade that they have no control over.  ""All of those people who think this is okay, that bitcoin doesn't support many transactions in volume. I think they’re horribly wrong,"" Puey said. ""I’m all for pushing forward something at this point.""  Others disagreed, with Blockstream's Ben Gorlick stating that SegWit offers a clear benefit for transaction capacity.  ""What is being used right now is an attempt at a compromise. They're saying it as an excuse to fork. They're saying, let's take this thing that seems certain to everyone and they're creating a false majority,"" he stated.  Will the network fork?  Gorlick's statements also hinted at another side effect of the proposal – the fact that action without broad agreement could risk splitting the bitcoin network in two.  The 'contentious hard fork' aspect, which could result in two chains if not everyone agrees, is partly what's held back previous proposals so far. Some, such as Mow, think that this outcome could hold up this proposal as well.  Others say that it's a risk worth taking.  ""That is a risk. But the risk of bitcoin stagnating because everyone's getting fed up with it is also a risk. The latter is becoming a much bigger problem in my opinion,"" Voorhees said.  Lightning Network creator Joseph Poon said he isn't supporting either side, but that from his past participation in negotiations, he believes the proposal puts the network on a path to a split that could result in two bitcoin blockchains.  Poon told CoinDesk:  ""It looks like the way both sides are communicating, a fork is going to be inevitable. The real fight is going to be who gets to be called 'bitcoin'.""  And, what will happen if it does? In a Consensus 2017 panel yesterday, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said that as he thinks that the market should decide which blockchain is the one that would be called 'bitcoin'. He suggested that BitPay will ultimately choose to support both bitcoins for a time, even if he thinks one will ultimately win out.  In remarks, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert acknowledged that different users of the bitcoin network could go separate ways as a result of the deal, though he stated his belief that this outcome was increasingly likely before the meeting and proposal.  Can two chains survive?  Others said that the economics of the network won't support such an outcome.  ""There will be two bitcoins with two market prices, they will sum up to what they have before,"" Storzc said. ""One will be worth more than the other, and the one that is smaller won't be enough for miners to run profitably.""  While the ethereum blockchain underwent a split, commentators remarked that the unique design of bitcoin – it takes longer for the difficulty to reset, for example – means that this might not happen the same way.  Even if miners with spare hardware were to support a fork, Peter Rizun, developer for the alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Unlimited, expressed his doubts that two chains could continue.  ""The technical problem of keeping the chain alive. Old miners will mine that, but they'll never find the block,"" he said. ""I don't think people realize how long the minority chain will struggle.""  Others continued the familiar refrain that this outcome is unlikely. Economics aside, there may be technical hold-ups to efforts to change bitcoin.  ""I think the people [behind the agreement] pushing for the fork are not really the majority so they won't do it,"" said Ferdinando Ametrano, a professor at Politecnico di Milano.  Ametrano told CoinDesk:  ""In the end, this might be for the better. Bitcoin might be good as it is right now. Core can't get SegWit, and startups can't get 2MB, that just reinforces the idea that bitcoin is really immutable.""  Correction: BitGo was mistakenly included as a signatory.
