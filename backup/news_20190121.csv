According to a report from CoinDesk Korea, the firm's CEO Hyunsuk Choi received a three-year sentence for his role in the crime, as well as for embezzlement. Another member of the team, Park Mo, got two years, according to local news source Blockinpress.  Choi, the court found, made a number of fake accounts on the exchange in January 2018, and, using a trading bot, made millions of false transactions with cryptocurrency and Korean won credit that did not actually exist.  The court – presided over by South Korea's top judge Ahn Seong-joon – also ruled that Choi had transferred bitcoin from the exchange to an external wallet, said CoinDesk Korea.  According to Blockinpress, which added that the crime brought in around $45 million in fees, the judge said:  ""Choi has committed fraud for a countless number of victims for a long period of time ... Futhermore, he holds the financial authorities responsible for failing to keep track of the industry better.""  Choi was reportedly arrested after the sentencing hearing.  In April, South Korean police detained four executives from two cryptocurrency exchanges over alleged embezzlement.

42381478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9RzlV,1548088820,Wyoming Bill Would Clear the Way for Crypto Custody at Banks,"Wyoming may soon become the first state in the U.S. to provide clear banking permissions for cryptocurrencies and digital assets.  A bipartisan group of state legislators introduced SF0125 to the government on Friday, which, if passed, would classify digital assets as property within existing laws. It would also establish ""an opt-in framework for banks to provide custodial services for digital asset property as directed custodians,"" determine standards for such services, clarify how Wyoming courts might classify digital assets and more.  Caitlin Long  , co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, told CoinDesk that the bill is a major step forward for the state, and could prove a boon for crypto startups and users alike.  ""A lot of companies are setting up as New York trust companies … the [Wyoming proposal] is a much better license than a New York Trust license because it’s [aimed at banks] and it’s in a state that has clarified the legal status of digital assets. Those two things are equally important,"" she said. ""There isn’t another state that’s providing that clarity.""  One of the most notable aspects of the bill is the support it has upon its introduction. The leadership of both Wyoming's House and Senate are cosponsoring the bill, which includes members from both the Democratic and Republican parties.  On the list of sponsors are senators Drew Perkins (R.), president of the Senate, Vice President of the Senate Ogden Driskill (R.) and Senate minority leader Chris Rothfuss (D.). Also on board are representatives Steve Harshman (R.), Speaker of the House, and House Majority Whip Tyler Lindholm (R.), alongside a handful of other representatives and senators.  That being said, getting the bill introduced is just the first step.  ""This [bill] was just released, it still has to go through everything,"" Long noted. ""Anything can happen in a legislative process, it’s not done till the governor signs the bill, but it has a lot of momentum behind it and a lot of support.""  She continued to say that just getting the bill to this point was a ""labor of love,"" adding:  ""It truly gives the blockchain industry something I think it needs, which is legal clarity to bring it to the next level, and even the bitcoin purists who would be opposed to intermediate [entities] being in [charge] would take comfort in knowing they now have legal status for their assets.""  There had also been an alternative proposal in the works, Long explained, which would have classified cryptocurrencies similarly to securities and would have forced owners to store such assets through intermediaries.  ""We would have lost direct property rights of [those assets],"" she said. ""There was momentum building behind that proposal … and Wyoming went in a different direction that’s much better for cryptocurrencies.""

While it had no blocks produced from roughly 09:00 UTC to 11:40 UTC, no funds were lost and ""blocks are processed normally and hashrate returned to similar levels as before the incident.""  Update (14:04 UTC, Jan. 21 2019): Beam has now announced: ""The fix was commited on Github. We will be performing additional testing. We will release the binaries in the coming hours. Thanks for your patience.""  Its GitHub page puts the error down to a bug involving ""improper block generation upon cut-through of old-new UTXOs.""  ---  Newly released privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Beam reported this morning that its blockchain is experiencing technical difficulties.  Beam announced the information on its official Twitter account Monday, saying that its network ""stopped at block 25709” and that it was investigating the matter.  Within the last hour, the project tweeted an update saying:    ""Issue identified and fix found. Funds are safe. Commit to GitHub in the coming hour. Binaries and detailed Post-mortem later today.

At its January launch, Beam became the first cryptocurrency based on Mimblewimble – a protocol that makes transactions confidential and virtually untraceable.  Since then, though, Beam has faced some technical issues. On Jan. 9, the team discovered a “critical vulnerability” in its wallet software and asked users to uninstall the wallet app immediately and re-download a patched version from their website.  While the critical bug was fixed, it could have put users’ funds at risk by allowing attackers to modify transactions and subsequently send funds directly into their own wallet, Beam’s developers said at the time.  Last week, a second privacy cryptocurrency based on Mimblewimble – Grin – also went live. While it has seen high interest from cypherpunks, sources told CoinDesk at the time that several VC funds were planning to mine the crypto.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Kelly joined the exchange this month.  While at Abide, Kelly advised clients on regulatory compliance areas such as anti-money laundering rules, the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation.  In total, he comes with over 30 years of experience in compliance and auditing gained at a number of notable financial firms, including Grant Thornton, Barclays Capital and Lehman Brothers.  Coinbase was granted an e-money license to operate in the U.K. and EU from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority in March 2018. Then, in August, the exchange started offering instant deposits and withdrawals denominated in British pounds.  The firm – which most recently raised $300 million at an $8 billion valuation in October 2018– has seen a flurry of management-level personnel changes in recent months. At least nine senior or mid-level employees have left since the funding, and over five have been hired during the period.  It was previously revealed that, since March 2018, the firm has been offering to cover up to $5,000 a year for treatments like egg-freezing in a bid to retain staff – that's in addition to Coinbase’s health insurance options.

Tangem describes its crypto storage product as a ""smart banknote for digital assets."" Designed to be used like a bank card, the product allows off-chain physical transactions to be used, for example, for in-store payments, once cryptos have been loaded onto the device via an NFC-enabled smartphone.  The startup announced the SBI investment Monday, saying that it would help it expand its technology to other areas such as stablecoins, initial coin offerings (ICOs), tokenized asset offerings, digital identity and more.  The news was confirmed by SBI in a separate statement. While it did not disclose an amount, the firm said the funding was made available through its wholly-owned subsidiary SBI Crypto Investment, which invests in digital assets ventures.  SBI said it had invested in Tangem because its “inexpensive” and “robust” wallet product could help boost demand for crypto assets, as well as its own products.  ""The Tangem hardware wallet, which is highly secure and affordable, is an important tool to promote mass adoption of digital assets and blockchain,” said Yoshitaka Kitao, representative director, president & CEO of SBI Holdings. “We believe utilizing Tangem will help stimulate the demand for other blockchain services provided by SBI.""

42381490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rzy5,1548068438,This Former Bitcoin Price Support Is Now Capping Gains,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly gains were wiped out at the weekend at a key moving average that previously offered support.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to highs above $6,750 on Saturday, having weakened the immediate bearish case with a repeated defense of the psychological support level of $3,500 last week.  BTC, however, failed to secure a UTC close above the 21-day MA. More importantly, rejection at that MA hurdle proved costly – BTC fell 3.8 percent to $3,470 yesterday.  So, it could be argued that the MA line, which served as strong support in the two weeks leading up to Jan. 10, has now taken on the role of stiff resistance.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,527 on Bitstamp, representing a 4.30 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, the 21-day MA is seen at $3,732.  The strong pullback from the 21-day MA indicates that the “sell on rise"" mentality is still quite strong. After all, the primary trend is still bearish, as represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA).  The probability of a sustained break below $3,500 remains high while BTC is held below the newfound resistance of the 21-day MA.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC failed at the 21-day MA on Saturday and fell back to $3,500, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 42.00.  As a result, the probability of a drop below $3,500 has increased. That would only bolster the bearish technical setup and open the doors to December lows near $3,100.  However, the bearish case would weaken if BTC secures a UTC close above the 21-month MA of $3,732.  Weekly chart  The long upper shadow (spread between high and close) attached to last week’s candle represents the ""sell on rise"" trader mentality – after a quick rise, a selloff erased the gains.  The primary trend remains bearish as long as BTC is trading below the downward sloping 10-week MA.  View  BTC's pullback from the 21-day MA may embolden the bears to push prices below $3,500. Acceptance below that level would expose the December low of $3,122.  A convincing move above the 21-day MA of $3,732 would weaken the bearish case and open up upside towards $4,000. However, the primary trend is bearish, so forcing a move above the 21-day MA could be a tough task for the bulls.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9RzzL,1548064815,SF Summit Shows BitTorrent Is Boosting Tron's Appeal,"""I was very interested in making fun of it.""  That’s how crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, known around the web as ""BitBoy,"" described how he felt about Tron prior to its acquisition last summer of file-sharing platform BitTorrent.  Now, outside Day 2 of Tron’s niTROn Summit in San Francisco last Friday, BitBoy felt differently: Tron was worth paying attention to.  Sure, the company’s over-the-top marketing exploits (not to mention accusations from crypto luminaries such as Vitalik Buterin of plagiarizing others’ work) were an easy source of derision, BitBoy said. But the BitTorrent move had changed the calculus. It was a sentiment CoinDesk encountered more than once among attendees of the event.  When we spoke with Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun after his opening remarks, project promotion was still front of mind. But with BitTorrent in his company’s toolbox, things are at a new level.  Moving on from memes and hype, Tron has made a bet that by acquiring this long-standing company at the center of an early protocol it can leapfrog the crypto adoption problem. Introducing cryptocurrency to a huge user base – something legacy internet companies have so far been reluctant to do – is Sun’s new vision.  Sun told CoinDesk:  ""BitTorrent is different, because we already have 100 million active users. I think that is the huge challenge for other companies.""  All about users  BitTorrent’s permanence has been impressive, but it remains buggy.  In short, BitTorrent allows lots of users to quickly download files by breaking them into pieces. If everyone downloads different pieces at the same time, they can all get the file close to equally fast. It's able to do this by requiring users to also share back the parts that they’ve already downloaded from the system. That's the crux of its peer-to-peer efficiency.  In that way, users are basically bartering bandwidth with each other. Barter systems work OK, but Tron's BitTorrent thesis is that adding a unit of value, the BitTorrent Token (BTT), will make the system work even better.  That was the general message in the presentation by Justin Knoll, an employee at BitTorrent at the time of the acquisition who is now leading Project Atlas, the name for Tron’s bid to roll out BTT to the masses.  BitTorrent, in Knoll’s view, works somewhat magically. ""You can have unlimited data with no central cost,"" he said. It's not perfect, though. A lot of long-tail content, the stuff that people only demand occasionally, can be hard to find.  The less popular stuff might not have a ""seed"" out there. That is, someone who has a copy of a file available for the network to break into pieces and download.  ""We can do better than this. We can make it so there's actual rational incentives for people to promote to seeders,"" Knoll said. That rational incentive is getting paid by some users for first dibs on downloading.  Because BitTorrent the company makes the most popular user interface for BitTorrent, it has an advantage to introducing the option to use tokens to a large portion of the protocol's user base, Knoll explained.  In fact, despite the fact that BTT is optional, Knoll predicted that downloads should be faster even for users of BitTorrent who don't choose to use the token. That's because there will be more seeds available either way.  On Thursday, Binance released more details about the planned sale of the BTT token. It will sell 6 percent of the BTT supply starting January 28, with a $7.2 million hard cap, according to a Binance spokesperson.  Additionally, holders of TRX will receive airdrops of 10.1 percent of BTT tokens over the next six years. Sun said that Tron holders should expect the first airdrop in mid-February.  Still, many critics of Sun's plan have noted that Mojo Nation previously introduced a distributed file-sharing protocol that used digital cash, and it failed. Sun has a simple answer for why it can work this time around.  With so many more people, Sun said, it's much more likely that a critical mass of users will try it. That’s why Tron’s BTT experiment is worth paying attention to: the job of introducing the complexity of money on the internet falls to an established player, rather than a crypto startup.  Affirmation by association  BitTorrent also allows Tron to associate with a known and established brand. This fits, because Sun cements his credibility through connections.  The conference effectively ended with an onstage Q&A featuring Justin Sun and NBA legend and now venture capitalist Kobe Bryant. The main purpose of that appearance seemed to simply be associating Tron (and Sun himself) with a name that basically everyone knows.  For his part, Bryant didn't say anything that reflected any depth of knowledge about Tron, crypto or the blockchain, but it was the most well-attended part of the whole event, and that seemed to have been the point of including it.  Similarly, each time Sun spoke, he included an anecdote from the man he called his ""mentor,"" Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, the only company in the world that might currently compete with Amazon.  To further this strategy, Tron seems to be establishing its credibility by winning over less-sexy but more substantive partners.  We spoke with eBay and PayPal alum, Sanja Kon, who now serves as vice-president for global partnerships with blockchain payments company UTRUST. ""We are token agnostic and we want to integrate the tokens our buyers want,"" she said.  While Kon is based in London, she traveled to San Francisco because she says UTRUST is seeing demand from holders of its UTK token to integrate Tron.  (As we parted ways with Kon, another entrepreneur approached her and asked if her company's platform could support very large payments, the kind of payments that can pay for yachts. Crypto's still crypto.)  Galia Benartzi, a co-founder of Bancor, spoke at the conference and took a similar position toward Tron as Kon. She said she was there because Bancor is strongly considering making Tron one of the next blockchains it integrates.  Bancor provides automated conversions between tokens, but right now it only works with tokens on Ethereum and EOS. Once Bancor has integrated a new blockchain, it’s easy to add new tokens hosted by that blockchain, but adding a new protocol is not easy.  ""We'll support every blockchain that's interesting,"" Benartzi said. Still, it's a question of how interesting any one is that determines how quickly Bancor will move to do the coding work to add a new one.  Each new blockchain adds additional complexity, because, Benartzi said, ""We have to build the cross-blockchain compatibility."" So each new addition is a significant vote of confidence in that technology.  Tron would also be attractive for Bancor because it's actively encouraging new tokens on the platform. BTT will obviously be one, but many others are also getting launched on Tron’s network.  Another use case that Sun emphasized in our interview was gaming, so it came as no surprise that one of the companies highlighted at the event was the non-fungible-token gaming company Everdragons.  Patrick Rieger, CEO of the German company, explained to CoinDesk that it was founded as an ethereum-based effort. ""Our launch on ethereum fell right into [last June’s] FCoin disaster,"" he told us. (At roughly the same time, Tron’s trx token was leaving ethereum as well.)  Everdragons users panicked that their NFTs might never be useable again if ethereum didn't get faster and cheaper. That's when the company started looking around for a way to bridge to other blockchains.  ""We did not really leave ethereum. We expanded to Tron,"" Rieger said.  Estimating future demand  Some people are hoping for Tron to do well. Others are praying.  As we waited to get in on the second day of the event, we saw an attendee approach the creator of TronWallet, Dio Ianakiara. The attendee said, ""I have just one question.""  It caught CoinDesk's attention. Would the attendee have a substantive question about an entrepreneur providing key technical infrastructure? In short, no. The rank-and-file TRX holder asked, ""How high do you think Tron can go?""  Before Ianakiara answered another attendee turned on the questioner and answered sarcastically, ""Don't you know? To the moon, man!"" The hype (or the desperation) isn't a selling point for every potential partner.  For example, Uphold’s Robin O'Connell, chief revenue officer at the crypto-to-fiat company, told CoinDesk his firm hasn't committed to support payments on trx, which, as of this writing, is the 8th-ranked coin on CoinMarketCap.  ""We'd never list Tron because it's a Top 10 traded currency,” O'Connell said in an interview. “It's more that if there's enough potential demand for Tron payments or ecosystems that are supporting Tron, that's where we would see the opportunity.”  “We're still assessing,” he added, “but our sense from the conference is there's a good bit of demand.""  And obviously if BitTorrent becomes a significant use case, that would become a key source of demand for a company like Uphold. Particularly as BitTorrent seeders seek ways to exit to their local fiat currency.  BTT is a TRC-10 token. ""[The Tron blockchain] is the medium that allows us to connect BitTorrent users that have BTT,"" Knoll said from the stage.  Jonathan Chou, CEO of the decentralized sharing-economy startup Bee Token, was on hand at the event, mostly as an observer. He confirmed Sun's thesis that BitTorrent's user numbers are the difference maker.  ""It's all about the market penetration of awareness,"" Chou told CoinDesk. With so many users, he added:  “That's going to be the biggest dapp on blockchain, period.""

Crypto Garage, a Digital Garage subsidiary focusing on blockchain and crypto tech, announced Monday that it has launched a new platform dubbed SettleNet that would allow app development on Blockstream’s inter-exchange settlement network Liquid, including the issuance of stablecoins.  The initiative, slated to last for a year, is one of the first proof-of-concept trials authorized under a regulatory sandbox program managed by the Japanese government, Crypto Garage said.  The project aims to let participating members – specifically, crypto exchanges licensed in Japan at this stage – test the SettleNet platform to issue the stablecoin and to provide a settlement service between the stablecoin and crypto assets. Blockstream also participated in building the platform.  Crypto Garage said the JPY-pegged stablecoin would trade against Blockstream’s bitcoin-pegged token, Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC), over its Liquid network. Liquid is a bitcoin sidechain project that went live in October. For the trial, transactions will be conducted in limited volume.  Atomic swaps will enable the tokens to be swapped ""simultaneously,"" said Crypto Garage.  The firm continued:  “This will enable rapid, secure and confidential transfer of the crypto assets while eradicating counterparty risk. In addition, SettleNet will provide the regulatory authorities with the functionality to monitor any unlawful trade, including money laundering.""  Digital Garage initially collaborated with Blockstream in November 2017 with an aim of fostering blockchain development in Japan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back had said at the time: “The Japanese market is ready for new business models that blockchain technologies can enable.”  Back in October, Japanese IT giant GMO Internet also announced the plans to issue a yen-pegged stablecoin called GMO Japanese Yen (GJY). The firm said at the time that GJY will be issued to Asian markets in the fiscal year of 2019 via Z.com, its crypto exchange subsidiary.

42381484,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9Rzrn,1548046809,Proof-of-Stake Could Lead to Crypto Banking. Let's Avoid That,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    With last week’s Constantinople delay offering a reminder that ethereum faces challenges in its long roadmap to migrate from a proof-of-work (POW) consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake (POS), it’s easy to miss the fact that elsewhere in crypto-land, POS is already a thing.  A little-discussed ramification is that POS will drive new business and financial models for cryptocurrencies, which will, in turn, give rise to a new regulatory and security challenges.  Viewed through the prism of traditional finance, a consensus model in which owners of cryptocurrency earn block rewards when they stake, or deposit, their holdings to “vote” on ledger validation starts to look a bit like an interest-earning function. And when third parties, such as those that are starting to provide “staking as a service,” do this on behalf of coin-holders who trust them to provide custody and exchange functions, it starts to look like banking.  That assessment would rightly alarm crypto traditionalists. And it’s one reason why some warn against these attempts to improve on the POW model on which bitcoin is founded, arguing that POS will diminish security and incentivize centralization.  But although the Lightning Network and other “Layer 2” solutions may help bitcoin and other POW coins resolve scalability and cost problems, proof of work faces real challenges both in terms of computational efficiency and in its public perception as an environmental threat.  As such, it’s hard to imagine there won’t be continued and growing support for chains using proof of stake and its cousin, delegated proof of stake (DPoS), which draws from notions of representative democracy to increase efficiency at the cost of some centralization.  Already, out of the 19 leading blockchain projects reviewed on CoinDesk’s Crypto-Economics Explorer, three – Cardano, Dash and Qtum -- are using proof of stake and another three – EOS, Lisk and Tron – use DPOS. Four of those six are among the top 15 ranked cryptocurrencies cited by CoinMarketCap.com, collectively accounting for $6 billion in coin value as of Friday afternoon.  If we added ethereum to that group, along with Tezos, another prominent blockchain project using a variation of POS, the total market cap of these leading POS chains would run to $18.8 billion.  That’s still less than a third of bitcoin’s total $64 billion valuation. Nonetheless, this universe of future and current POS chains can’t be ignored. We need to think hard about what POS means for the evolution of a crypto-based financial system.  A business waiting to happen  I hadn’t given this much thought until I read an excellent Twitter thread from Israel-based blockchain entrepreneur Maya Zehavi in which she assessed aspects of a new report from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on regulating crypto assets.  Zehavi made the point  that while ESMA is recommending that crypto exchanges now employ systems of segregated accounts, in the future there will also be a need for “exchanges to explicitly inform clients whether their funds are used for staking purposes” and to “get specific consent.”  It got me thinking of how unavoidably appealing staking-as-a-service is for all the exchanges managing people’s trading in POS coins. There are no clear signs that any are actually doing this with crypto tokens in their custody – and if that is happening without users’ consent, it needs to stop. But the idea of helping their clients earn revenue on their otherwise dormant coins, and charging a fee for doing so, is surely an attractive one for both sides.  A bitcoin utopia in which “everyone is their own bank,” with complete control over their private keys, may well be desirable from a decentralization and security perspective. But millions have shown that they are happy to have an insured third party handle custody for them rather than have sole control over their assets. The success of Coinbase and other such custodial exchanges and wallet providers speaks to this.  Now, add to that the prospect of having that exchange or dedicated custodian manage staking rewards on people’s behalf and it’s easy to see many people going for it.  There’s a fiat equivalent: most of the world’s savings in dollars, euros, yen and all other traditional currencies sit in either interest-bearing bank accounts or are pooled into funds whose portfolios are managed by third parties. People find it both convenient and more effective to pool their monetary power with others and have an outsider invest it for them.  Back to the future  But, hang on a second. Aren’t we just recreating the old banking world with all of its attached system and counterparty risks? Maybe, yes.  As Viktor Bunin, formerly of Token Foundry, points out, if we can envisage staking-as-a-service becoming so popular that pretty much all coins permanently reside with the most trusted of these custodians, constantly earning rewards, then we can also imagine those entities issuing tradable, interest-bearing depositary receipts based on the coins held with them.  Given the unlikelihood that all users’ coins will be withdrawn from that institution at the same time, those receipts would trade at par, which could mean they’re treated as a unit of exchange equivalent to the value of the underlying deposited coins, essentially allowing for off-chain monetary creation.  “Congratulations!” writes Bunin, “We’ve come full circle to reinventing fractional banking! You now have an asset AND a financial instrument that’s a claim on that asset.”  Anyone who’s studied the history of banking, specifically of bank runs, of systemic risk and all the panics that have led to repeated crises in our financial system, and who’s also watched how governments have stepped into the crypto space in the name of protecting consumers, will know that this scenario will inevitably invite another layer of regulation. And for a host of reasons, including for keeping the cost of entry down for breakthrough startups, that can be problematic.  Now’s the time to try to get ahead of this. As with many other ideas that try to wrestle control over security risks away from regulators and put it into users’ hands via blockchain-inspired governance, the way forward may lie in innovators developing decentralized solutions.  Not unlike the work going into decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps that protect users from the counterparty risks with centralized exchanges, so too can developers look at decentralized systems for pooling assets employed in staking services.  One way to think about it is illustrated by a proposal for creating block producer pools run by their own decentralized applications, so that smaller players can participate in EOS’s lucrative reward system for delegated block producers.  Another way to add protection to the system might be to somehow apply multi-sig custody arrangements in staking service agreements, so that clients retain ultimate control while service providers are still empowered to execute staked votes.  As investor Arianna Simpson has documented,  staking-as-a-service is already taking off, with the early players earning steep margins. She notes a natural trajectory by which new competitors will enter the market and narrow the spread, making this more attractive for the wider market.  The time to figure out what this means for the crypto financial system is now.  Ethereum image via CoinDesk archives.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Michael J.
