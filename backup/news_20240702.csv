30308175,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627378,1719961238,PEPE Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $14.7 Million Stack From Binance,"On-chain data shows a PEPE whale has withdrawn a large amount of the memecoin from Binance today, a sign that could be bullish for its price. PEPE Whale Has Made A Large Outflow From Binance In The Past Day According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive Pepe transaction has been spotted on the blockchain during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Q3 Rally Possible As Miner Selloff Finishes, Quant Says The transfer involved the movement of 1,286,733,285,955 tokens on the network, worth more than $14.7 million when the transaction went through. Given this large scale, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for the move. Whales are humongous investors who carry large amounts in their wallets. As they can make huge single-transaction movements like this latest one, they are considered influential beings on the market. Therefore, their moves can be worth keeping an eye on, as they may have implications for the price. Generally, though, it’s hard to say how exactly a move might reflect on the market, but sometimes, the addresses involved can provide some hints. Below are the address details for the latest Pepe whale transaction. As is visible, the sending address for this PEPE transaction was one attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Conversely, the receiver wasn’t affiliated with any centralized platform, suggesting that it was likely an investor’s self-custodial wallet. Transfers that move from exchanges to personal addresses are called “exchange outflows.” Generally, investors make outflows from these platforms when they plan to hold in the long term, so these transfers can potentially carry bullish benefits for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Shiba Inu ‘Underbought,’ While Bitcoin ‘Overbought’ Recently: Santiment The whale may have made this latest transfer out of Binance for a similar purpose. It could also be that these coins were just freshly purchased by this large investor, thus making a move even more positive for the memecoin. However, there also exists a bearish scenario where the whale has taken out their PEPE stack to sell through an over-the-counter (OTC) desk instead. As it’s impossible to say with any certainty which of these scenarios this transaction follows, it only remains to be seen what effects this transfer ends up having on the coin’s price, if any. PEPE Price Pepe had recently recovered towards the $0.0000121 level, but the asset has since seen a plunge of almost 5% as its price is now back at around $0.0000115.

""Yes"" shares in a contract asking whether she will get the nod traded as high as 31 cents in the afternoon New York time, indicating the market saw a 31% chance it will happen, up from 7% earlier in the day. The shares retraced some gains and recently traded at 23 cents.  Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar) if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  Officially, President Joe Biden is still the presumptive Democratic nominee. But many supporters are calling on him to step aside, and some of them want Harris to step up following her boss's doddering performance at last week's debate with former commander-in-chief and almost-certain Republican standard-bearer Donald J. Trump.  ""We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it’s in second place or the top of the ticket,"" Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C, said on television Tuesday.  A Newsweek op-ed by former Congressman Tim Ryan, the first presidential candidate to endorse Biden in 2020, was more blunt: ""Kamala Harris Should Be the Democratic Nominee for President in 2024."" An analysis by The Wall Street Journal called Harris ""Biden’s Likeliest Replacement.""  The trend was similar Tuesday on PredictIt, a more traditional prediction market platform where bets are settled in dollars rather than crypto. ""Yes"" shares for Harris there more than doubled to 35 cents. PredictIt's volume on the question of who will win the Democratic nomination totals $31 million, dwarfed by Polymarket at $75 million.  Under a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket is barred from doing business in the U.S., whereas PredictIt is allowed to operate in the country under a regulatory exemption.  Tuesday was Polymarket's fifth-largest volume day in its four-year history, with $5.7 million in trading, according to Dune Analytics data. June was the first month Polymarket saw more than $100 million in volume.  Its largest contract by far, with $211 million in bets, asks who will win the U.S. presidency in November. Trump remains the favorite, with a 66% chance of victory.

30304526,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627501,1719955822,Bullish Reversal For Bitcoin? Retail Investors Flood Back As New Addresses Reach 4-Month Peak,"Recently, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a consolidation phase, fluctuating between $61,000 and $62,000 after a brief drop to $58,000 on June 24. While retail investors have shown renewed interest alongside institutional counterparts, the market faces a mix of bullish signs and potential headwinds. Retail Investors Return To Bitcoin In a recent social media post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights the resurgence of retail investors, as evidenced by a four-month high in new BTC addresses reaching 432,026, adding to the sentiment that investors are betting on a significant price increase for BTC in the coming months, despite recent price volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Suffers 3rd Straight Weekly Outflows, Becomes 2024’s Worst Performer In a separate post analyzing BTC’s recent price action, Martinez also suggested that the largest cryptocurrency on the market is currently confined within a parallel channel, with a potential rebound to $63,200 or $63,800 if the lower bound at $62,500 holds. In particular, Martinez cites the critical resistance areas of $65,795 and $78,700 as key targets if BTC breaks above them. However, not all news is positive for the Bitcoin market. In the past 72 hours, BTC miners have sold over 2,300 BTC worth approximately $145 million. This selling pressure adds to the US and German governments’ ongoing sell-off of confiscated BTC. Mining Industry Under Pressure The mining industry faces challenges due to lower network fees and reduced block rewards resulting from the Halving event in April. Kaiko Research notes that average network fees have decreased from $3 to $5, a significant drop from around $45 in January. The halving saw block rewards reduce from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, impacting miner revenue. This revenue squeeze has put pressure on miners, eroding profitability while fixed expenses such as energy, wages, and rent remain constant. The decline in network fees has further contributed to the reduction in revenue. Historically, Bitcoin price rallies following Halving events have helped miners compensate for the drop in rewards. However, the price of Bitcoin has remained relatively unchanged since the April 19 software update. Related Reading: 36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market In April, fees briefly surged to nearly $150 due to the increased minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the BTC blockchain. Although this temporarily relieved miners, fees have since returned to average levels. According to Bloomberg, Marathon Digital, one of the largest Bitcoin miners, sold 390 BTC in May and plans to sell more tokens to manage its finances. Kaiko Research warns that the risk of forced selling by miners may persist in the coming months. As a result, the industry is expected to witness consolidation as miners seek to “consolidate assets” and “increase efficiency.” Notable examples include miner Riot Blockchain’s “hostile takeover attempt” of Bitfarms Ltd. and CleanSpark Inc.’s recent agreement to acquire Griid Infrastructure Inc. for $155 million in an all-stock transaction. At the time of writing, BTC is still consolidating within its range at $61,880, down 2% in the 24-hour time frame, wiping out all gains in the past 30 days, as losses in this time frame amount to 9%.

30300996,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627459,1719950459,"Will Bitcoin Beat The Odds And Fly To $300,000 By 2025?","At press time, Bitcoin is within a bullish formation and firm, rejecting attempts for lower lows despite slumping by roughly 20% in June. Though there is hope that prices will trend higher in June, one analyst thinks BTC is walking on a tightrope. For buyers to take over, it means BTC will defy its historical trends observed in the last five years by printing green by September. Will Bitcoin Beat The Odds? Price data aggregated over the past five years paints a concerning picture for Q3 2023. In a post shared by one analyst, historical data shows that Bitcoin often dips in Q3, posting an average return on investment (ROI) of -5.21%. If this sets precedence, then it means that though BTC is firm when writing, the coin will most likely end up in losses below current rates. Related Reading: Dogwifhat Targets New Peaks As WIF Exceeds $2.1 Resistance Level Looking at price charts, it is evident that buyers are in control, primarily because of Q1 2024 gains. Then, prices soared to all-time highs before correcting, dropping to $56,800. Even though this line has not been broken, bulls have been struggling for momentum as bears have been unrelenting, forcing prices lower on numerous occasions. BTC To $300,000? On-chain Activity And Institutional Adoption Rising Despite the historical bearish trend in Q3, some analysts remain optimistic. Considering X, one analyst thinks BTC will fly to as high as $300,000 by 2025 based on the “power law” theory. This prediction is almost 5X from spot rates, an overly optimistic prediction. Under the “power law” theory, the analyst said fundamentals play a crucial role. When a predictable growth pattern for Bitcoin based on its network activity is factored in, then the only way forward, the analyst said, is up. To further support this outlook, the analyst said Bitcoin prices have followed the power law for over a decade. It means the coin’s intrinsic value is independent of market hype. Beyond this, several other metrics support the potential for continued growth. For instance, IntoTheBlock data reveals that the number of active Bitcoin addresses continues to rise, reaching levels not seen since mid-April.

42417821,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0nF,1719948287,"DCG, Top Executives Renew Push to Get New York AG’s Civil Fraud Suit Dropped","Lawyers for Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert and Michael Moro filed responses to New York Attorney General Letitia James' latest effort to support a lawsuit against the crypto company and executives.  The NYAG's office sued DCG and the affiliated executives last year.  Lawyers for cryptocurrency firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) and two of its top executives – CEO and founder Barry Silbert and Soichiro “Michael” Moro, the former CEO of DCG’s wholly-owned trading arm Genesis – have made a final effort to convince a judge to toss out New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James’ civil fraud suit against them.  The court documents filed last Friday are the latest volley in the legal back-and-forth between NYAG and the respondents, who – along with crypto exchange Gemini and the now-bankrupt Genesis – have been accused of defrauding investors by working together to cover up a gaping $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet caused by the wipe-out of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).  In her lawsuit, James alleged that Genesis and DCG made “false assurances” on Twitter that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses from 3AC’s implosion, which were crafted to put investors at ease and prevent them from calling in their open loans. But, instead of actually filling the billion-dollar hole with a cash injection, DCG allegedly just patched it over with a promissory note, pledging to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over ten years at 1% interest. According to James, DCG has “never made a single payment under the Note.”  Genesis and Gemini have settled with NYAG, but DCG, Silbert and Moro have fought the accusations of fraud, calling the suit “meritless.” Each filed a motion to dismiss the case in March, vehemently denying that the promissory note was a sham, arguing that the note was fully vetted and legally binding and that, in addition to the note, DCG transferred hundreds of millions of dollars and assets into Genesis to fill the hole in its balance sheet.  The social media posts about Genesis’ “strong” balance sheet weren’t lies meant to defraud, the lawyers argued, but simply “corporate puffery.”  In her response, James pushed back, arguing that the tweets weren’t “corporate puffery” but instead a “misrepresentation of existing facts” purposely crafted to mislead investors – a violation of New York’s strict anti-fraud law, the Martin Act.  Her response to the motions to dismiss attached a transcript of messages sent by Silbert, Moro and other employees during a late-night strategy meeting after 3AC’s collapse in June 2022.  Good-faith efforts?  In the latest set of court documents, lawyers for DCG agree that the late-night strategy meeting took place, but argue that it’s not evidence of any conspiracy: instead, they say, those communications are evidence of the company’s “lawful, good-faith efforts…to support a subsidiary.”  “DCG did what a responsible parent company should do, offering advice, providing financial support, and, in certain instances, reviewing and commenting on Genesis’s communications,” DCG’s lawyers wrote.  In a June 28, 2022 email attached to Silbert’s filing, Silbert wrote to Moro and other employees:  “It is certainly our hope and intention to help Genesis address the equity hole — hopefully by 6/30. To that end, the Genesis team should be working 24/7 with the DCG and DCGI teams to figure out all possible ways to do so…There are probably lots of different ways to do so, each with their own ramifications that we just need to all understand before we start moving assets around.”  The email, Silbert’s lawyers argue, demonstrates that efforts to fill the billion-dollar hole were genuine.  DCG’s lawyers restated their claim that the promissory note at the heart of the case was an “entirely proper financial transaction…[and] one of the most valuable assets in the Genesis estate, one that will provide an enormous benefit to Genesis’ creditors far beyond what they would have received had DCG not acted so supportively without any obligation to do so.”  The promissory note, DCG’s lawyers say, allowed Genesis to weather the storm caused by 3AC’s collapse – it wasn’t until FTX imploded that Genesis was forced to halt withdrawals.  Lawyers for Silbert similarly agreed that he “discussed ways to support Genesis in the wake of the 3AC default, and ultimately signed the Promissory Note in order to do so” but denied that there was anything fraudulent about his actions.  The fact that Silbert ultimately signed the promissory note, his lawyers say, was evidence of his good faith and continued belief in Genesis’ viability despite its financial woes.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/02/dcg-top-executives-renew-push-to-get-new-york-ags-civil-fraud-suit-dropped,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/793bb6226cbeb3796a9cf6e9cfc6258c7498a5f3-1485x835.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417819,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0j7,1719946012,Welcome to DePIN Summer,"When did I get interested in DePIN? It goes back to SETI, a 2000s-era crowdsourced search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and my own family. We have always found a hobby in setting up airplane antennas and watching the planes on radar for fun. I never thought there would be a decentralized version of this network, where individuals could contribute radar data and be rewarded for these contributions instead of just a hobby. Little did I know that, years later, it would be a worldwide movement called DePIN.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  If you have been here for a few cycles or even since the last bull run, you’ve already heard a lot of broken promises with different buzzword metas and acronyms such as HODL to WAGMI. As most of the last cycles' promises fade away, there’s a new acronym and utility taking front and center stage. This time it stands for something REAL. DePIN. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks.  What is DePIN?  DePIN takes current blockchain tech and transforms how physical infrastructure like IoT devices and machines operate and interact with each other. By using decentralized control, DePIN allows machines to autonomously trade value, offer services and also sustain themselves. The DePIN approach creates a scalable, faster and people-owned infrastructure.  This enables real world assets like vehicles and sensors to function as part of a friendly ecosystem, creating machine composability and value in the form of tokens for all participants. We call this the “Economy of Things.” This DePIN model also reduces dependency on large corporations, cuts capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx) and enhances any system's strength and durability.  If this is your first time hearing about DePIN, let me explain it in more simple terms. Instead of big companies profiting millions off all kinds of your data, imagine you’re rewarded for the data you create or for any extra resource you might have. That could include your GPS location, supplying weather data, extra bandwidth from your internet, flight data or even the extra power your house or GPU generates. This is the same data and resources that in most cases, you have been giving away for free for years and sometimes even decades. DePIN cuts out middlemen and gives the power and data back to the people.  Another exciting concept that's already starting to form within the DePIN space is parallel markets. Take a DePIN like Farmsent on peaq. One part of the network is soil sensors for farmers. They can now put another DePIN like a weather antenna up and get a better weather insurance rate now that they’re supplying up-to-date weather data directly from the farm. Now you have one sector of data connecting to another and creating value for both sides. This leads to better pricing models, a better network, and even bringing communities together who might not have been introduced otherwise.  The Current Landscape of DePIN  What excites me most is that DePIN is breaking traditional sectors and changing how we think about these legacy systems. There’s so many amazing projects being built. Projects like Silencio (also on peaq) allow you to be rewarded for measuring noise pollution from your iPhone. MapMetrics gathers mapping and carbon data. And platforms like TENEO are unlocking access and liquidity with the tokenization of machines like a fleet of Teslas. Combinder gives people access to green microgrids while YOM offers sustainable alternatives by using a network of existing gaming machines instead of building more data centers.  New and exciting sectors are constantly popping up within DePIN, such as agriculture and robotics. Farmsent is transforming the agricultural world through decentralized farming data networks, while XMAQUINA is allowing you to own fractions of all sorts of machines with tokenized robotics solutions. RWA/DePIN hybrid projects like penomo are making investments in renewable energy and allowing for big machines like EV charging stations and solar turbines more accessible to all.  DePIN is more than just a clever acronym or another Web3 meta. It’s the Web3 Bat Signal for a fundamental change in our approach to building, managing, and interacting with physical infrastructure. The projects I've engaged with, the events I've spoken at, and the communities I've helped uplift, all underscore one truth. DePIN is where Web3 gets REAL. It's a complete pivot from speculative vaporware and tribalism to creating real world value and real world progress.  As the founder of DePIN Daily and Growth Lead at peaq, I've seen the influence of an organic, engaged community fighting the good fight of taking our data back. From people making their own devices with Raspberry Pi’s to helping other community members with their setups, everyone is here to build and uplift each other. The chain tribalism and PFP wars have been left behind in 2021. The DePIN community acts as a foundation for builders, founders, and users to exchange ideas, collaborate, and push this DePIN movement forward.  Conclusion  People are frightened and struggling all across the world, from AI taking their jobs to finding and earning passive income to help with bills due to inflation. DePIN can help with this. From owning a fraction share of an AI robot-cafe to earning a few extra bucks a day for sharing your cars data or GPS location, the change starts now. Stepping into DePIN and real world applications, while working at peaq has opened a whole new horizon and has me so excited for the future. Let’s bring blockchain back to what it was meant to do and give power back to the people. DePIN Summer is here.

30297418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627434,1719945002,"Bitcoin Miners Slow Down Selling In July, What This Could Mean For Price","On-chain data shows that selling pressure from Bitcoin miners has recently slowed down. This is significant considering the impact it could have on Bitcoin’s price heading into the third quarter of the year. Bitcoin Miners’ Selling Pressure Has Significantly Declined Referencing data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, crypto analyst Crypto Dan noted that selling pressure from miners has significantly declined for two reasons. One is that the quantity of Bitcoin these miners sent to exchanges to sell has reduced drastically since May. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Major Bullish Signal On 3-Day Chart, Here’s The Target Secondly, the crypto analyst mentioned that the volume of the OTC Desk that miners use for selling has been consumed, suggesting that someone recently bought up all the available Bitcoin supply from these miners. The volume of the OTC Desk is said to have piled up until June 29th, as there was no willing buyer to purchase these crypto tokens. Bitcoin miners greatly contributed to the price crashes the flagship crypto suffered in June. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock showed that these miners sold 30,000 BTC ($2 billion) throughout the month. This put significant selling pressure on Bitcoin, which caused it to drop below $60,000 at some point. As such, the decline in selling pressure presents a bullish development for Bitcoin and could continue the bull run for the flagship crypto. Crypto Dan noted that this development has created “sufficient conditions” to continue the upward rally for Bitcoin in this third quarter of the year. Crypto analyst Willy Woo had also previously predicted that Bitcoin’s price would recover once miners capitulate. With that out of the way, Bitcoin could enjoy an upward trend this month and make massive moves to the upside. BTC’s Uptrend Has Begun Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s uptrend has begun. He claimed that the macro higher low has been confirmed, and Bitcoin is now rallying to the upside. He added that the flagship crypto is developing a macro bull flag, providing a bullish outlook for the crypto token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Place $500 Million In Spot BTC Bids Below Market Price In another X post, the crypto analyst remarked that the goal for Bitcoin following its strong start to July is to build a “foundation from which it will be able to springboard to the Range High area at $71,500 over time.” Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also suggested that Bitcoin’s downtrend is over and a bullish reversal was underway as the flagship crypto makes significant moves to the upside. He also mentioned that he believes that Bitcoin has bottomed out and has found support at $60,000, meaning a decline below that price level anytime soon was unlikely. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,900, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Discover what our analysts have to say about the state of the markets for the first half and what potentially lies ahead in the second half. There appears to be growing angst among investors as the potential for a market correction becomes more apparent as the markets continue to rise. The potential implications of diverging easing policies from the global central banks could be a key theme moving forward. Introduction Welcome to the first post of SA’s The Macro Brief! This official SA Profile will highlight our analysts' latest economic and market analysis to help investors gauge the ever-volatile financial landscape through various recurring series. The economy is the foundation of financial markets, influencing everything from corporate earnings and consumer spending to central bank policy and inflation. Understanding economic trends, policy decisions, and sector activity can be critical when assessing market opportunities and making informed investment decisions. With that said, the second issue of Seeking Alpha’s macro-based series is here! (And with a few changes). It is now called Market and Economic Insights (previously The Macro Brief ). If this is your first time seeing this article series, please take a look at our inaugural issue last month for a more in-depth look at what you can expect. Without further ado… June Commentary As June concludes, marking the year's halfway point, investors naturally take a step back to reevaluate their portfolio holdings, market performance, and economic conditions. U.S. indexes in June largely carried over momentum from prior months, with the NASDAQ nearing a 6% return. AI themes continued to dominate discussions among investors, with a growing worry that market breadth might be something to start worrying about for the second half of 2024. Bond yields pulled back a bit, but still remain up about 50 basis points across the board year-to-date. On the economic front, unemployment continues to creep northward despite seemingly positive figures from the BLS’s non-farm payrolls report. And inflation seems to be plateauing, with the CPI coming in flat for May month-over-month, but still higher than the Fed’s preferred target of 2% annual growth. In this issue, our analysts examine… The state of the markets for the first half and what potentially lies ahead in the second half. The growing angst among investors as the potential for a market correction comes into play as the markets continue to rise. The potential implications of diverging easing policies from the global central banks. June’s Market and Economic Snapshot Seeking Alpha June’s Trending Themes Mid-Year Market Review 3 Predictions For H2 2024 | Bret Jensen “The rally from late 2023 in the market has carried over into 2024, although the bull move up has been extremely top-heavy. NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) has ridden the AI wave to better than a 150% return so far this year and by itself accounts for a third of the rise in the overall market.” First Half Wrap: The AI Boom, Robust Earnings, Auto Sales On Tap | Christine Short “While it has been an action-packed first half, what's been conspicuously absent from the financial front page has been volatility. The VIX Index had just a lone spike above 20 during a short window in April when equities pared early-year gains.” 2024 Q3: Stay Invested In Big Tech But Watch For Weak Breadth | JR Research “As we head into the second half of 2024, there is much chatter about weak underlying market breadth. I've assessed that as well. As a result, market conditions are likely mixed and less clear.” One Down, One To Go | MV Financial “The first six months of the year were perhaps most notable for steadily weaning the bond market off its fantasies of multiple rate cuts.” 2024 Midyear Investment Outlook: Anticipating Rate Cuts | Kristina Hooper “Despite widespread expectations of a global economic slowdown in 2024, growth and inflation have continued to perform above expectations across most major economies.” Investor Anxiety Intensifies Stock Market Crash Looming, But Not For The Reasons Most Analysts Think | Michael Harris “High concentration, low breadth, higher inflation, a prolonged yield curve inversion, and even higher rates are not enough to cause a market crash.” Can The Bull Market Keep On Kicking? Or Is It Growing Tired? The Answer May Surprise You | MarketGauge “While the market has gone up well above expectations in H1 and may be due for a normal pullback or healthy correction, earnings have been stellar, earnings growth well above expectations, and the markets are fully expecting an easing from the Fed…” Sentiment Speaks: As Bears Begin To Hibernate, It's Now Time To Worry About A Bear Market | Avi Gilburt “When people get too bearish and sentiment hits a negative extreme, then everyone who has wanted to sell has sold, and there is only one direction left for the market to take. The same applies when the market gets too bullish.” A Substantial Correction In Stock Prices Is Likely Coming Soon | BullBear Trading “Predictions of a world-changing technology revolution led by AI and robotics, shifting to Intelligence Economics, are causing disruptions in stock pricing.” The Soft Landing Lives, For Now | Claus Vistesen “Markets are still enjoying a soft landing, defined as a world in which inflation is drifting lower, even if still-sticky in key areas, the global economy and labour markets remain unencumbered, and monetary policy is on track to ease modestly.” Inflation Or The Economy - Which Breaks First? | Fear & Greed Trader “It should be clear by now that inflation is still present, and at some point, markets will have to come to grips with reality and all it brings with it.” This Doesn't End Well | Bret Jensen “The huge rally off the lows of the last market swoon that ended late in October has also occurred against the backdrop of a clearly slowing economy. In fact, one could argue that much of the economy is already in recession.” Deglobalization of Central Banks’ Policies What I Expect After The Fed Cuts Rates In 2024 | Robert & Sam Kovacs “In the past century, there are 4 post rate cut markets which should make investors shiver and fear the idea of investing in equities at all.” Powell And The Fed Are More Hawkish Than You Think: Expect Economic Weakness Ahead | Logan Kane “Between the lines, the Fed is likely worried about cutting rates too soon and stoking a bubble with assets already trading above their value relative to fundamentals.” The Fed Can't Stop A Recession | James Foord “History suggests there’s little the Central Bank can do to aid the real economy once the deleveraging cycle starts.” What Does The Bank Of England's Delayed Rate Cut Imply For U.S.? | James Picerno “If the Bank of England’s decision on Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged is a guide, the outlook for the start date for a US rate cut may be further down the line than generally assumed.” Global Central Banks Queue Up Rate Cuts: Is It A Mistake? | Robert Brusca “For two- or three-years central bankers have been exceeding their inflation targets consistently. And yet, central banks are now either executing or considering interest rate cuts for the period ahead.” Conclusion We hope our analysts' insights serve as a valuable financial compass for investors seeking to make informed investment decisions.

30293897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627380,1719939641,Matrixport Co-Founder Says Crypto Market Mirrors Early June: What This Means,"In a recent commentary on X, Daniel Yan, co-founder of Matrixport and CIO at Kryptanium Capital, offered a detailed comparison between the current crypto market dynamics and those observed in early June. His insights are especially relevant as the market approaches several key economic releases that could significantly influence the trajectory of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). History Repeating For The Crypto Market? Yan’s analysis began with an overview of the current market recovery, noting that both BTC and SOL are “grinding at key technical levels nicely now,” suggesting a potential setup for a breakout similar to the situation in early June. During that period, Bitcoin was challenging a major resistance level at $71,500, influenced by positive Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data and weaker-than-expected ADP employment change numbers, which fueled optimism about a potentially dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. Related Reading: Circle Awarded Europe’s First Stablecoin License Under New MiCA Crypto Rules However, Yan drew attention to the volatility that followed, when a stronger than expected Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report reversed the bullish sentiment, causing Bitcoin to plummet from highs of $72,000 to around $58,000 within two weeks. He highlighted this pattern to caution investors about the potential for similar market reactions in the current context. Looking forward, Yan expressed a generally bullish outlook for Q3 2023, citing improving liquidity conditions and the resolution of the Mt. Gox case, which has loomed over the market for years. Yet, he remains wary of the short-term impacts of the upcoming NFP release, scheduled for this Friday. “I’m getting cautious going into the NFP Friday – a similar first half of the pattern may happen,” he warned. Yan also pointed to the CPI release as the next crucial data point, with the Cleveland Fed providing modest estimates for June but less favorable projections for July. He emphasized the impact of summer energy prices on inflation metrics, noting that rising crude oil and gas prices since early June are likely to influence both headline CPI and PCE directly, and core inflation numbers indirectly. “A 0.3% MoM Core CPI expectation is already bad, imagine it realizes worse,” he remarked, underscoring the potential for these figures to exceed expectations to the upside, further complicating the Fed’s inflation management efforts. Related Reading: Buy Crypto Now: Lekker Capital CIO Spotlights Prime Opportunity The immediate focus for Yan and many in the crypto community is Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech tonight at the European Central Bank. His comments are highly anticipated for hints on how the Fed views the current macroeconomic conditions and its potential policy actions in the near term. “Let’s see what he thinks of the current macro situations,” Yan stated, indicating the significant market-moving potential of Powell’s address. Bitcoin Breakout Needs Confirmation Matrixport released a “Chart of the Day” featuring Bitcoin’s price movements from June 2 to July 1, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s recent break from a short-term downtrend. After signaling a bottom on June 25 on their Matrixport Greed & Fear index—a tool often used to predict potential reversals—Bitcoin showed signs of an oversold condition, which typically precedes a price recovery. Indeed, Bitcoin’s price began to rebound tactically over the weekend, overcoming some of the immediate technical hurdles. While the market appears to be setting up for a potential rally, Yan’s analysis and the impending economic updates suggest that investors should brace for possible fluctuations. As these events unfold, the crypto market’s response to economic indicators and central bank communications will be pivotal in shaping its short-term direction. At press time, BTC traded at $62,802.

Previously, the funds experienced heavy outflows when the underlying cryptocurrency declined sharply, for example in April.

Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows the spot funds saw net inflows of $790 million even as the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbled 7%. Leading the way was what's now the largest of the spot ETFs, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), where inflows topped $1 billion, offsetting by itself what continue to be sizable outflows from the high-fee Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  The action stands in contrast to that of April, when the spot funds as a group saw large outflows as bitcoin's price declined 15% that month.  “Boomers are much better holders than some make them out to be,” wrote Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, possibly taking aim at well-followed analyst James Bianco, who has continually tried to make the case that it's weak-handed hot money that's been behind the massive asset gathering of the spot ETFs.  Part of the positive inflow streak in June could also come from enthusiasm tied to the possibility of a spot ether ETF, which regulators and potential issuers have visibly been working on getting approved. While the arrival of a rival spot crypto ETF could pull money from the bitcoin funds, it might also be a positive in that it signals regulators are finally embracing the industry as part of the financial system.

The money-laundering trial reconvenes on July 5.  Tigran Gambaryan's health is deteriorating in jail, his family said.  Nigeria's money laundering trial against Binance and two executives was adjourned until July 5 following the cross-examination on Monday of the first witness from the country's Securities and Exchange Commission.  The court was also made aware that, despite several court orders, the prison where Tigran Gambaryan is being held has not released the medical records from his only visit to hospital, which took place a month ago. Gambaryan's health is deteriorating, according to his family. Justice Emeka Nwite again ordered that the reports should be provided to Gambaryan's lawyers by Friday.  Gambaryan, the crypto exchange's head of financial crime compliance, has been detained in the most populous African nation since February and is being held in Kuje prison alongside the likes of terrorist group Boko Haram. Another executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who also faces the money laundering charges, has since escaped.  ""Tigran’s health continues to deteriorate in detention and he complained of numbness in his foot as well as back pain,"" a statement from the family's spokesperson said. ""He has had double pneumonia and malaria whilst in prison.""  ""As I have stated many times before and as the evidence in court is showing, Tigran has never been a decision-maker at Binance, and there is no justification for his continued detention,"" Yuki Gambaryan, Tigran’s wife, said. ""It is time for the Nigerian authorities to do the right thing and release my innocent husband.""  U.S. members of Congress visited Gambaryan recently and urged the U.S. to take further action.  Binance is also the sole defendant in a tax evasion case that is adjourned until July 12 after charges against Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were dropped.  Binance declined to comment.

30290478,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627396,1719934226,36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market,"The ENS token (Ethereum Name Service) has recently taken center stage in the crypto community, sustaining a 36% rise in in the last week. This steady surge has sparked widespread interest, with some analysts predicting a prolonged bullish trend, while others advise caution. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Jumps 21% As Analysts See $4.5 Price Tag ENS: Price Explosion & Renewed Investor Interest ENS, the native token of the Ethereum Name Service, which translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable wallet addresses, surged by over 2% in the past day. This propelled the token as one of the highest gainers today. ENS briefly surpassed the $33 mark. It is currently trading at $31.89, data from Coingecko shows. This excitement wasn’t limited to spot markets; the derivatives sector also saw a ripple effect. Open interest, which reflects the total value of outstanding futures contracts, reached record highs exceeding $160 million, suggesting a dramatic increase in investor participation and speculation around ENS. Furthermore, the funding rate, which indicates the cost of holding futures contracts, shifted from negative to positive territory. This transition points to rising demand for long positions, where investors bet on the price increasing. A positive funding rate indicates a growing pool of optimistic traders expecting further price hikes for ENS. Technical Analysis: Bullish Signals Daily technical analysis of ENS reveals a recent price rally following a period of mixed trends. The most significant development occurred on June 30th, with a substantial price jump pushing the token to $33.21. This bullish momentum has continued, with the RSI (Relative Strength Index) hovering near 70, indicating a strong uptrend. While a high RSI can suggest potential overbought conditions, it also reflects significant buying pressure. However, some analysts caution against interpreting this short-term rally as a guaranteed path to sustained growth. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and historical price movements don’t necessarily predict future performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Suffers 3rd Straight Weekly Outflows, Becomes 2024’s Worst Performer Long-Term Prospects & Potential Risks Several factors could be contributing to the recent surge in price and activity. The upcoming ENSv2 upgrade, which aims to improve efficiency and scalability, might be fueling investor excitement. Additionally, the growing adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) within the Ethereum ecosystem could be driving demand for user-friendly domain names facilitated by ENS. Despite the current optimism, potential risks remain. The overall health of the cryptocurrency market can significantly impact individual tokens like ENS. A broader market correction could lead to a pullback in ENS price. Additionally, the success of ENS depends on the continued adoption and growth of the Ethereum network and the dApps built upon it.

42417820,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0mD,1719934056,Crypto Exchange Kraken Is Considering Going Nuclear,"Kraken is considering using nuclear energy as a power source for its data centers.  The crypto exchange is looking to partner with energy providers that can supply small modular reactors.  The company is exploring nuclear power options in North America and Europe.  Kraken is considering using nuclear energy to power its data centers, amidst an expected boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) and increased demand for its services, the company’s chief technical officer, Vishnu Patankar, said in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk.  Kraken is not looking to build its own reactors, but is considering partnering with energy providers that can supply nuclear power with small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors can be co-located with data centers and don’t have space or weather constraints, according to Patankar.  “With institutions moving into the crypto asset class and activity moving on-chain, the need for reliable fiat onramps continues to grow,” Kraken’s CTO said. “Bolstering our energy resiliency means we strengthen a direct avenue into the crypto ecosystem, supporting its continued growth.”  The crypto exchange is looking to secure its energy supply given the massive surge in demand from artificial intelligence (AI) and high performance computing (HPC) firms which is changing the landscape in terms of power stability, Patankar said.  Kraken is exploring nuclear power options in North America and Europe.  “Crypto’s round-the-clock and global nature means Kraken needs a constant supply of energy, particularly as we facilitate a larger proportion of global trading volumes,” Patankar said. Due to the 24/7 demands of running a cryptocurrency business and expected mass adoption of crypto over time, Kraken is looking at how it can scale its business in terms of energy supply and latency.  Nuclear backup  Kraken's exploration of the idea comes as more tech companies explore deals with nuclear operators to power data centers needed to meet the demands of artificial intelligence. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the trend is increasingly apparent, with firms including Amazon Web Services seeking to lock in contracts with nuclear plants to power data centers.  Surging demand from power-hungry AI companies has seen bitcoin miners pivot away from crypto mining to supplying infrastructure for these firms. Core Scientific (CORZ) signed a deal with artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave earlier this month.  “A nuclear backup means Kraken can continue to operate even if there was major disruption to local energy supply,” Patankar said, noting that “it adds redundancy and protects our energy resiliency so we can continue to offer round-the-clock products and services to our clients globally.”  Whether running nodes for validators or for transactions, Patankar said Kraken is expecting a big boom in DeFi and because of this the firm’s energy needs could potentially be exponentially higher in the future.  Whilst a final decision has not been made yet, Patankar said Kraken was definitely considering nuclear power as an option as other alternatives such as wind and solar are weather dependent and energy storage also posed a challenge.  A criticism often leveled at the crypto industry is that it is extremely wasteful in terms of energy usage, with proof-of-stake blockchains such as Bitcoin requiring huge amounts of processing power. Nuclear energy also suffers from similar negative perception but for different reasons, however, in this case it might be a more environmentally friendly solution. Any excess energy that is generated by the reactors can be captured and used to power the cooling systems of the data centers.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/02/crypto-exchange-kraken-is-considering-going-nuclear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/772b0cc1f12ae0bbc3fb469e73df0733f56ab751-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417844,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3I5,1719930704,Decentralized Science: A Better Way to Fund and Grow Breakthrough Ideas,"A common trope of those who discredit Web3 is that it’s trying to solve a problem no one has. And, perhaps it’s easy to see it that way when you mostly see celebrities launching meme coins to self-enrich themselves and leaving their fans being the bag holders when the tokens go to zero. Or the animal JPEGs from the last cycle in 2021 that had values as high as six and seven figures. I’ve found myself disillusioned at those things too.  What if that wasn’t the case, though? What if Web3 was at the precipice of one of the most exciting times for building real-world value since the inception of the idea of blockchain? Welcome to Decentralized Science (DeSci).  DeSci is a movement leveraging blockchain technology to create a fair and equitable infrastructure for scientific research. It aims to enhance the processes of funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge through the use of Web3 tools, including tokens, NFTs, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  By fostering an open and incentivized environment, DeSci seeks to empower community-driven collaboration in the scientific field. All the tools we've been using can now be applied in ways that create both societal and monetary value. Maybe the world wouldn’t hate us so much if we could deliver this across verticals but starting with scientific innovation is a good one.  One might be tempted to ask why we need DeSci if we already have the traditional scientific method that’s been delivering value for longer than most of us realize. Well, with just a bit of research, you’ll understand that traditional science really needs an overhaul. The problems lie with publishing, reproducibility, funding, the way IP works and even how the data is stored.  Publishing scientific work is fraught with challenges, starting with the exorbitant fees charged by publishers. These publishers rely on unpaid labor from scientists, reviewers, and editors to generate content, yet charge the public — who indirectly fund this research through taxes — high prices for access. Web3 tools have the potential to address this issue by creating open-access platforms that incorporate legitimacy and incentive mechanisms, effectively bridging this gap. Without naming the guilty publications, I’ll just say it’s all the best ones.  Ensuring reproducibility and replicability is crucial for high-quality scientific discovery. Reproducibility means researchers can consistently achieve the same results, while replicability means different groups can achieve the same outcomes using the same methods. Web3-native tools can embed these principles into scientific research by providing attestations for raw data, computational engines, and application results, all validated by a reliable network. This would avoid problems with important Alzheimer’s research that was allegedly fabricated.  The traditional funding model for scientific research is often inefficient and biased, leading to long delays and a hyper-competitive environment. Web3 introduces new funding models, such as retroactive public goods funding, quadratic funding, DAO governance, and tokenized incentive structures. These models promote a fairer and more efficient distribution of resources. At the moment, in the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds a significant portion of all science in the country, letting these unaccountable institutions decide what is and isn’t legitimate inquiry. Seems like a broken model if you ask me. (Together, the NIH and NSF contribute about $57.5 billion to federal R&D funding, or approximately 33.6% of total federal R&D funding in 2022.)  In traditional science, intellectual property (IP) often gets stuck in universities or goes unused. Web3 offers a solution through digital asset ownership via NFTs, creating transparent value attribution chains that reward researchers and governing bodies. IP-NFTs can also serve as keys to decentralized data repositories and can integrate with DeFi for financialization, nurturing a new research ecosystem. Personally, I can’t wait for NFTs that actually have utility instead of the garbage we’ve been promised by popular projects for years.  Web3 technologies can significantly enhance the accessibility and storage of scientific data. Distributed storage solutions ensure data resilience and availability even in catastrophic events. Systems with proper verifiable credentials can enable secure data replication, redundancy, and censorship resistance, fostering collaboration. Decentralized public data solutions like IPFS, Arweave and Filecoin provide the foundation for open science, allowing researchers to create public goods without access restrictions or fees.  Now, take all of that and tell me there isn’t a time coming where we’ll see a DeSci Summer happen with tokens that will also take off in an unprecedented way. Instead of selling us on the 100th decentralized exchange, or another 3,000X DeFi protocol, investors might start reading white papers to understand where the next valuable company might come from. We’d get the smartest minds working on the hardest problems, instead of the next best tokenomics ponzi. It would mean societal and monetary value at the same time.  Imagine if the next breakthrough medication, akin to Pfizer or Tylenol, could be funded through a decentralized, transparent process? This would not only democratize the funding of critical research, but also ensure that the rewards and recognition are fairly distributed among all contributors. DeSci has the potential to revolutionize scientific research, making it more inclusive, efficient, and innovative, and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements that benefit society as a whole. Maybe if we do this right the world wouldn’t hate Web3 so much.

Celebrity-inspired meme coins spurred a surge in revenue for token launchpad Pump.fun over the past 24 hours, lifting the protocol's revenue above the Ethereum blockchain's for the first time.  Pump.fun racked up $2 million in daily revenue in the time period, pipping Ethereum's $1.91 million and making it the largest revenue generator of any blockchain, according to data on DefiLlama.

42417837,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3Ar,1719929887,Ironblocks' 'Venn' Network Aims to Keep Malicious Transactions From Ever Hitting Blockchains,"Israeli crypto firm Ironblocks is spearheading a new security layer called Venn that will vet blockchain transactions before they're executed, potentially averting multimillion-dollar attacks and hacks.  Venn is a security product: its customers – lending protocols and beyond – will pay a small fee in exchange for what's essentially an extra set of eyes making sure nothing suspicious is happening on their books. But instead of one pair, they'll get many operators on the lookout for fraud, says Ironblocks CEO Or Dadosh.  That's because Venn is set to be a decentralized network much like the blockchains that all DeFi protocols live on top of. It will consist of a series of node operators that work together to reach a consensus. While such operators on Ethereum and other blockchains add transactions to the chain's economic history (the ledger), the ones on Venn will act as a gatekeeper and determine whether proposed transactions are too suspect to get there.  Venn is the latest attempt to address crypto's ever-present crime problem. In any given week, projects big and small lose six-figure sums or more to fraud, theft, economic attacks and other costly capers that drain their customers' crypto. All these transactions happen on the blockchain, where they're irreversible; there's no rewind button to move stolen money back into a victim account.  Venn doesn't add a ""rewind"" button to the blockchain so much as a ""review and revoke"" feature. Transactions being fed into it haven't actually happened yet, Dadosh told CoinDesk. They're on their way to finality – as long as they make it past Venn's vettors, that is.  Though Venn isn't yet live, Dadosh explained in an interview how it will work. Actual crypto users won't necessarily be aware of Venn as they won't have to do anything special to be included in the network. If, however, they're using a protocol that's a customer of Venn, part of their gas fee will pay for their transaction to be checked for malicious activity through Venn.  Most transactions will (presumably) make it through Venn just fine in around 100-200 milliseconds, much faster than the transactor would likely notice. All of this happens in the background and privately, meaning there's no opportunity for bots to front-run trades or employ other controversial MEV strategies. Cleared transactions move on to the main chain for execution.  But if Venn's operators detect something suspicious about a transaction, they'll freeze it before it has a chance to execute. Security teams will be alerted and investigate the matter. Meanwhile, normal transactions will proceed to execution unimpeded.  ""It's about making sure that the assets themselves are protected against malicious transactions,"" Dadosh said, ""ensuring there is no kind of malicious transactions being executed.""  Decentralized network  Venn is scheduled to go to testnet in the coming weeks. The security of the network itself will come from restaking; Venn is a so-called ""actively validated service"" that gets the shared economic security of the EigenLayer ecosystem. Dadosh said Venn has lined up well-known lending protocols as early customers, but demurred when asked which.  The customers, whoever they are, will have a high degree of autonomy in deciding what transactions to feed into Venn. They won't necessarily send every user-initiated action through the security layer, but they could.  Eventually, customers will have the option to add extra security checks on top of the baseline oversight that Venn will apply to all transactions passing through it, Dadosh said. These will be managed and offered by individual operators – the security firms running the nodes.  Within all of this is Ironblocks, the security firm that first conceived of Venn and organized, built and maintains it. That said, Venn won't be an Ironblocks product in the same way that its other security products are. The fees Venn collects go to all of its operators, of which Ironblocks is one.  Read more: Crypto Security Firm Ironblocks Builds 'Firewall' for DeFi Protocols  Eventually, Venn will be managed by a security council that will call the shots on its operations, Dadosh said. When asked if Venn would issue a token – a common (and valuable) tool for crypto networks to distribute power among users – Dadosh said he couldn't talk about it right now. But he said Venn will run a points program that will recognize network usage. Many crypto protocols use points as a precursor to token releases.

These bullish developments could provide the much-needed turnaround for the meme coin, which had a June to forget. SHIB’s Burn Rate Surges By 16,854% Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate spiked by over 16,854% in the last 24 hours, with over 300 million Shiba Inu tokens burned during this period. This is massive for the meme coin, given the positive impact the token burns have on its price. These token burns help decrease SHIB’s circulating supply, which ultimately drives up its price, especially if the demand for the meme coin is on the rise. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 45% Drop For Bitcoin, But Says It Won’t Go Below This Level Interestingly, on-chain data shows that the demand for Shiba Inu is rising, with investors regaining their bullish sentiment towards the meme coin and looking to add to their positions. This is based on data from the Market Intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which shows that the concentration metric has turned bullish, meaning that Shiba Inu whales and investors are adding to their positions. The demand for Shiba Inu is also evident in its spot and derivatives trading volume, which have spiked since the beginning of this month. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that over $191 million in SHIB was traded in the last 24 hours. Additionally, data from Coinglass shows that SHIB’S derivatives trading volume has surged by 170% in the last 24 hours. The increased demand for Shiba Inu is also significant, considering how much the meme coin declined in June due to the Shiba Inu whales who offloaded a considerable amount of their holdings. The meme coin also took a severe hit in June because of its strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. However, Shiba Inu is expected to enjoy a price recovery as the flagship crypto is rebounding nicely. History also suggests that this month will be bullish for the meme coin, with data from Cryptorank showing that SHIB has ended the last two Julys in the green. Shiba Inu Bullish Fundamentals Coinbase Derivatives is already finalizing plans to list the first-ever US-regulated Shiba Inu futures contract. The crypto exchange revealed in its filing to the Commodity Trading Futures Commission (CFTC) that it plans to list SHIB’s future contacts on or after July 15. This move is bullish as it could help expand the meme coin’s adoption, especially among institutional investors. Related Reading: Analysts Says Cardano Has Bottomed And Will Rally To $0.8, But It Must Hold This Level Furthermore, listing a regulated futures market for SHIB could also set the stage for the launch of a Shiba Inu Spot ETF.

42417835,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa39p,1719928800,Bitcoin Could Get Ethereum-Style Restaking as Startup Lombard Raises $16M,"""Restaking"" is all the rage in Ethereum blockchain circles. It allows users to earn interest by leveraging their staked assets to help secure other blockchain apps. Even developers on other ecosystems, like Solana, are trying to replicate Ethereum's restaking popularity.  So it was only a matter of time before restaking made its way to the most valuable blockchain: Bitcoin.  In partnership with Bitcoin staking protocol Babylon, the startup Lombard has raised $16 million to build out Bitcoin-based restaking. In addition to capitalizing on the restaking hype, Lombard is the latest startup to integrate Bitcoin into the wider world of decentralized finance (DeFi) – an industry that so far has mostly been lacking on Bitcoin.  ""Lombard aims to elevate BTC from a store of value into a productive asset which flows into the Web3 economy and drives sustainable growth,"" the company said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  Polychain Capital led Lombard's funding round, joined by BabylonChain, Inc., dao5, Franklin Templeton, Foresight Ventures, Mirana Ventures, Mantle EcoFund and Nomad Capital.  Restaking was introduced on Ethereum with EigenLayer, one of the biggest DeFi success stories in recent memory. EigenLayer rocketed to $18 billion in deposits in under a year by promising users extra interest on assets they'd already ""staked"" to help secure Ethereum.  EigenLayer's ""restaked"" assets get pooled together to secure a web of other crypto protocols that use proof-of-stake security. In essence, EigenLayer and other restaking protocols let upstart blockchain apps bootstrap their security, and they offer investors a new way to leverage their crypto holdings.  Read more: Restaking 101: What Are Restaking, Liquid Restaking and EigenLayer?  Bitcoin restaking  Lombard's dive into restaking will be built on top of Babylon, which lets people use bitcoin to secure other proof-of-stake networks. Paradigm previously led a $70 million funding round into the Bitcoin staking company.  Lombard extends on Babylon's cross-network security tech with the advent of ""liquid bitcoin"" tokens, or LBTC – a kind of tradeable receipt on Babylon deposits that will, according to Lombard, allow users to retain liquidity over the BTC that they've staked to secure other networks.  ""By uniting major ecosystems and DeFi protocols to onboard LBTC, over $1.3 trillion in Bitcoin can be used to lend, borrow and trade, providing new capital opportunities for bitcoin holders, and new capital and users for the ecosystems and their protocols,"" Lombard said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  Ethereum's ETH token started out as the staked asset du jour on EigenLayer. ETH (and ETH derivatives) were considered less likely than most other digital assets to drop suddenly in price – which can harm the security of proof-of-stake networks.  Many of the same attributes that make Ethereum an obvious candidate for restaking also extend to Bitcoin, the oldest blockchain. Bitcoin boasts the largest market value in blockchain—1 BTC was worth $63,000 at press time—and it tends to be less volatile than other crypto assets.  ""Our commitment to Lombard represents a deeper belief in the leverage Bitcoin can have in catalyzing growth across the whole blockchain space,” Olaf Carlson-Wee, the founder of Polychain Capital, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/02/bitcoin-could-get-ethereum-style-restaking-as-startup-lombard-raises-16m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5776d937b286544543be16b1c57291fb1a5fe558-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fresh round of capital will go towards hiring new team members, according to a press release. Participation in the round included SevenX, IOSG Ventures, Spartan Capital, White Star Capital, Kraken Ventures, Amber Group, Protagonist, gumi Cryptos, Christian Angermayer's Samara Asset Group and HTX Ventures.  The announcement comes as RedStone focuses on bringing its oracles to Ethereum’s emerging restaking landscape. In April, RedStone inked a deal with Ether.fi, the largest restaking service on EigenLayer, securing $500 million to help bring RedStone's data oracles to its ecosystem.  “Restaking is one of the areas where we are developing and very attractive for various reasons,” said Jakub Wojciechowski, CEO of RedStone Oracles, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “First, we have a first mover advantage,"" Wojciechowski said. ""A lot of LRTs (liquid restaking tokens, referring to the liquid restaking protocols) started working with us. Second, it is a pretty complex challenge to technically start providing price points, especially for LRTs. We have a very modular and flexible design to cater for that. And in our view, on the business side, it is a very fast, growing and attractive market.”  In addition to providing oracles for restaking protocols, RedStone provides data feeds for Ethereum, zkSync Era, Avalanche, Base, Polygon, Linea, Celo, Optimism, Arbitrum, Fantom, BNB Chain and Blast, according to the press release.

Rosu is a professor in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the idea for Pi Squared came out of his career in academia.  “I've done this research with my students over many, many years,” Rosu told CoinDesk.  The company is also building a “Universal ZK Circuit,” which uses zero-knowledge technology to enable “trustless remote computing, AI and interoperable smart contract for any blockchain or dApp,” Pi Squared wrote in a press release.  “This will be made possible through the creation of a universal and disarmingly small ZK circuit that checks the integrity of mathematical proofs, which will provide verifiable-computing correctness guarantees to all languages and virtual machines (VMs) alike directly from their formal semantics, without any translation to a common language, VM or instruction set architecture (ISA),” according to the company.

42417840,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3Bt,1719926610,Bitcoin's Retreat From $70K Characterized by 'Vol Lethargy',"Deribit's BTC DVOL index, a measure of volatility expectations, has slipped to its lowest since early February.  Continued volatility meltdown alongside price drop suggests an absence of demand for options.  A renewed upswing in BTC's price to $70,000 may lift DVOL.  Seasoned stock traders are likely attuned to the observation that market corrections are typically accompanied by an uptick in metrics like the VIX index, which gauges volatility expectations.  That's not the case in the bitcoin market, however, even though cryptocurrency prices tend to be positively correlated to technology stocks.  For instance, as bitcoin's price has pulled back 10% from over $70,000 in the past four weeks. Deribit's bitcoin volatility index DVOL – an options-derived measure of expected price turbulence over the next 30 days – has declined from an annualized 53% to 42%, reaching the lowest since early February, per charting platform TradingView.  Implied volatility is positively impacted by the demand for options or derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy and a put option confers the right to sell.  The slide in the DVOL amid the price correction suggests a calm market environment in which investors are less inclined to panic or seek out protective puts or hedging bets. Moreover, bitcoin's pullback has been slow and orderly rather than a fast slide, often leading investors to buy options to profit from the volatility boom.  ""It is because since BTC fading off the highs, we’ve been stuck in a range-bound market with low realized volatility,"" David Brickell, head of international distribution at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, told CoinDesk. ""There is a lack of appetite to buy volatility into the summer months, and the structural tends to be overwriters selling vol, so in the absence of real demand, we drop lower.""  Volatility selling is a popular crypto strategy where investors sell or write options in a dull market, lowering implied volatility. The seller receives a premium for promising to compensate the buyer in case of wild price swings. Typically, such strategies involve writing calls on top of spot market holdings.  Per Brickell, a renewed upswing in BTC to levels above $70,000 will likely revive demand for options and boost the DVOL implied volatility index. BTC's price has been positively correlated with the DVOL index throughout this bull cycle.

Sentient's platform will be built on Polygon, representing an expansion of the Ethereum scaler into AI. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal is one of Sentient's core contributors.  The project aims to address concerns about the proliferation of AI whereby the underlying code is concentrated in the hands of a few superpowers like Google or Meta.  Open-source code is that which is shared publicly allowing anyone to use it and is something of a backbone of the blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.  ""By building an open platform for AGI development, we aim to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably and that its development aligns with the interests of humanity as a whole,"" Nailwal said in an emailed announcement on Tuesday.  Sentient will enter the testnet phase this quarter., using the funds from this seed round to develop its platform and attract talent from AI research and blockchain engineering to its team.  The round was co-led by Pantera Capital and Framework Ventures and included participation from multiple other high-profile investors such as Robot Ventures, Delphi, Republic, and Arrington Capital.

The treasury has just over $245 million worth of DOT tokens left for spending, estimated to last for two years at current prices.  Concerns in the ecosystem about the usage of the Treasury are increasing.  Polkadot, one of the crypto industry’s earliest Ethereum rivals, spent $87 million worth of DOT tokens on various activities for the first half of this year, doubling from the pace of the prior six months, community representatives for the blockchain published in a treasury report over the weekend.  The treasury has just over $245 million worth of DOT left for spending, an amount community members estimate will last for two years at current prices. The first-half spending represents a more than 125% jump from the nearly $25 million spent in the second half of 2023.  It's worth noting that Polkadot's treasury is topped up by the inflationary mechanism of the DOT token and that the treasury will grow before net spend is taken into account over the next two years.  ""The whole notion of a 'runway for the on-chain treasury is misleading. The treasury has continuous inflows. It’s never going to run out of funds,"" Web3Foundation CEO Fabian Gompf said on X.  Marketing and outreach activities accounted for the biggest chunk of spending, with over $36 million spent on advertisements, events, meetups, conference hosting, and other initiatives. These efforts were intended to attract new users, developers, and businesses to the ecosystem.  Software development costs were the second-largest money sink, with over $23 million used to build services, such as wallets and toolkits to support developers. Some $15 million was spent on liquidity provision and incentives on Polkadot-based trading platforms.  A detailed breakdown of each transaction has been published on a publicly-viewable spreadsheet.  As such, community members expressed concerns about the large amount of spending on various activities and the possibility of running out of liquidity.  “The Treasury has about 32m DOT (200m USD) in liquid assets available within the next year. At a current net loss of 17m DOT (108m) USD per year, this leaves about 2 years of runway left if the DOTUSD rate stays the same,” the report said.  “The volatile nature of a mostly DOT-denominated treasury makes it hard to predict the future, but concerns in the ecosystem about how the Treasury is used are increasing,” it added.

The technical charts of Altcoins look especially explosive. Sentiment in crypto markets have been battered, and are close to September 2022 lows - just before cryptos made a multi-month run higher. When compared to other asset classes and crypto miners, spot cryptos are also at attractive buy points. Crypto markets look ready for a turn higher, at a time when risk sentiment in the space looks battered. Altcoins in particular, look explosive, and could catch the market by surprise. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is turning higher from support. It looks more likely to be settling in a 58k to 73k range, rather than topping out. Daily Chart: Bitcoin TradingView Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is making the right moves too. It has popped above the cluster of 10 and 20 day moving averages, and if it goes on to take out the 50 day MA (around 3,545 at the time of writing), price would actually be above all its key moving averages - which is a rare development for cryptos now. Daily Chart: Ethereum TradingView I now come to the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum - which is a good proxy for altcoins. Altcoins have broken down from a large distribution pattern, which should send them swiftly lower. However, we can actually see them bunching up and consolidating just below the breakdown level. Daily Chart: Crypto Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum TradingView This tells me the market is finding it difficult to go lower, and is running against the expected outcome from a bearish pattern. If it can swiftly reclaim the above the breakdown area, there would be a high probability of a false breakdown, which can lead to a very explosive move higher. This reminds me of silver ( XAGUSD:CUR ) back in July to October 2022, where price similarly broke down from a bearish distribution pattern. We may observe from the chart below that price did not follow through lower, but instead started bunching up and consolidating. When price reclaimed above the key pivot, the false breakdown was confirmed, and price rose swiftly higher. I think there is a good chance we see this play out in the Altcoin space. Weekly Chart: Silver TradingView Ratios of Bitcoin versus other asset classes are also turning higher at supports, as shown below. Daily Chart: Ratio of Bitcoin to Gold TradingView Daily Chart: Ratio of Bitcoin to Commodities TradingView Daily Chart: Ratio of Bitcoin to Treasury Bonds TradingView Daily Chart: Ratio of Bitcoin to S&P500 TradingView All the ratios above reflect a higher chance that we are seeing Bitcoin in a range, rather than topping out. My preferred vehicle to play this space is in spot cryptos. This is because spot cryptos are very attractive relative to crypto miners. From the ratio of Bitcoin to Bitcoin miners ( WGMI ) below, we may observe the ratio starting to turn higher. It has been making a series of higher lows, which supports the likelihood of a turn here. Daily Chart: Ratio of Bitcoin to Bitcoin Miners TradingView When we look at sentiment in the crypto space, sentiment is pretty battered - not surprising, with popular altcoins like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) down -30% and -45% from their 52 week highs respectively. The CMC Crypto Fear & Greed index shows that sentiment is pretty close to the September 2022 lows, which is when the crypto market first started running higher. CMC Overall, I think sentiment in the crypto market has reset a great deal, removing a lot of froth and exuberance. Spot cryptos look more likely to be in a range, rather than to be topping out. As they are turning higher from the lower end of their ranges, I think this is an attractive area to go long.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702021-cryptos-look-ready-to-turn-higher-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30284410.jpeg

30283443,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627369,1719923416,Dogwifhat Targets New Peaks As WIF Exceeds $2.1 Resistance Level,"Dogwifhat (WIF) has recently achieved a significant milestone by breaking through the $2.1 resistance level, generating bullish sentiment among market analysts. This pivotal breakthrough indicates potential for further upward movement and new highs. Analysts are optimistic about WIF’s prospects, forecasting continued strength and momentum in the market. As WIF surpasses this critical threshold, investor interest is expected to rise, driving further gains and positioning the asset for sustained growth. This article analyzes the recent bullish sentiment among analysts as WIF breaks through the $2.1 resistance level. It also seeks to explore the implications of this breakthrough, including potential future price targets and market behavior. Currently, the market capitalization of WIF is over $2.2 billion, with a trading volume of over $421 million. The cryptocurrency’s price is currently down by 1.68%, trading at roughly $2.26, with its market capitalization down by 1.52%, while its trading volume is up by over 2% in the past day. Analyst Sentiment: Optimism Surrounding WIF On the 4-hour chart, the price of WIF is actively bullish trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As of the time of writing, the price is attempting a retest on the $2.1 mark. Following a retest at this level, WIF is expected to resume its upward movement. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator suggests that WIF might move in a consolidation manner for a while before resuming its upward movement as the signal line appears to be moving below and above the SMA of the indicator. Meanwhile, on the 1-day chart, the price of WIF is still actively trading below the 100-day SMA and is making a pullback toward the $2.1 mark. From the formation of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator, it can be observed that the price of WIF may go bullish as the signal line has made a cross above the SMA of the indicator, and they are both moving out of the oversold zone towards the zero line. Future Scenarios For WIF’s Growth As of right now, WIF’s price is making a pullback to the $2.1 mark. If the price experiences a rejection at this level, it will begin to move upward toward the $3.58 resistance level. Furthermore, a break above this level may trigger WIF to move higher to test the $4.86 resistance level and possibly move on to test other higher levels. However, if the price of WIF breaks below the $2.1 mark, it will continue to decline towards the $1.47 support level. The crypto asset may pose a further decline toward the $0.71 support level and other lower levels if the $1.47 support level is breached.

42417850,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3NF,1719921660,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Bulls Hopeful Entering July as ETFs Record $130M Inflows,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin bulls may have reason to cheer as we enter July following an uninspiring second quarter in which BTC was weighed down by billions in sales and negative sentiment among retail traders. The first day of the month saw U.S.-listed ETFs record nearly $130 million in inflows – the most since early June – after more than $900 million in outflows over the month. Over the last decade, bitcoin has gained by an average of more than 11% in July, with positive returns in seven of the 10 years, data shows. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $62,600, a drop of about 0.15% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is down by around 0.2%.  Professional investors withdrew over $120 million from ether-tracked exchange-traded products in the past two weeks, CoinShares said in a Monday report. Such products recorded $60 million in net outflows in each of the past two weeks, the most since August 2022. Elsewhere, multiasset and bitcoin ETPs recorded inflows at $18 million and $10 million, respectively, suggesting sentiment may be turning. Ether ETFs are close to becoming available for trading in the U.S. after the SEC approved applicants' filings last month. The regulator must also approve their S-1 filings before the products are cleared to trade.  Spot ether ETFs in the U.S. could see net inflows of $5 billion in the first six months, according to crypto exchange Gemini. The flows, when combined with the current Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) assets under management give a total AUM for spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. of $13 billion-$15 billion in the first six months, the report said. Gemini noted that ether’s market value relative to bitcoin remains close to multiyear lows, and the inflows could improve ether's relative standing. “Given the AUM comparable in international ETF markets, robust on-chain dynamics, and differentiating factors such as a thriving stablecoin environment, there is favorable risk-reward of an ETH catch-up trade in the months to come,” Gemini said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin is looking to get past a descending trendline, which characterizes the pullback from record highs.  A breakout here would open up the door for near-term gains.  On-chain analysis shows that $65,000 could prove to be a formidable resistance.

However, the upcoming launch on July 4th remains a pivotal moment. Analysts are closely watching to see if this long-awaited development triggers a surge in Ethereum adoption or if it simply cannibalizes existing Bitcoin ETF investments. Mixed Signals: Regional Divergence And Altcoin Interest While the overall trend points towards caution, there are regional variations in investor sentiment. The United States, for example, defied the global trend and witnessed inflows of $43 million, suggesting continued American interest in the digital asset space. Similarly, inflows into multi-asset and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) indicate a preference for diversification and established players. This highlights the ongoing appeal of a broader exposure to the digital asset landscape, rather than a singular focus on any one cryptocurrency. Interestingly, amidst the Ethereum outflow woes, some altcoins are experiencing a resurgence. Solana and Litecoin, for instance, saw inflows, suggesting that investors are seeking opportunities beyond the top two cryptocurrencies. This diversification could be a sign of a maturing market where investors are conducting a more thorough risk assessment and exploring undervalued gems within the vast digital asset ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Goes Budget-Friendly: Transaction Fees Drop To Lowest Since 2016 Navigating Uncertain Waters The current state of the digital asset market is one of cautious optimism.

42417848,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3MD,1719911973,These Hot Crypto Tokens Beat Bitcoin Gains in Q2. Here's What Drove Prices and What's Next,"BRETT, TON and KAS Shine in a lame quarter for the broader crypto market.  TON's surge stemmed from messaging giant Telegram's involvement, while KAS benefitted from sentiment around its technology stack.  BTC mining stocks, artificial intelligence (AI) and the gaming sector might stand out in the third quarter.  The second quarter saw three tokens – brett (BRETT), Ton Network's TON, and Kaspa's KAS – emerge as shining stars as the crypto market bellwether bitcoin (BTC) wilted, pulling most major digital assets, including ether (ETH), lower.  BRETT, a memecoin native to the Base Chain and inspired by the character of Brett from Boys' Club comic series, more than doubled to 15 cents, becoming the best-performing digital asset among the top 100 coins by market value, according to data tracked by TradingView and CoinMarketCap.  Toncoin {{TON}}, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), a decentralized, layer-1 network popularly known as the TON blockchain, rose 42% to $7.65 and Kaspa blockchain's KAS surged over 35%. Meanwhile, the total crypto market capitalization fell 13.8% to $2.2 trillion.  Here's what may have helped these coins stand out from the broader market malaise.  Meme mania  The BRETT surge was not an isolated event but a part of a broader uptrend in meme coins. Analytics platform DYOR's Dune-based relative strength crypto narrative tracker shows the meme coin sub-sector rose over 45% in three months while others registered losses.  Culture coin mog (MOG) emerged as another top performing asset driven by positive sentiment and a cult-like following on social platforms such as X. MOG market capitalization zoomed from $220 million in early April to over $700 million, briefly putting it among the top hundred tokens by that metric.  The performance is typical of a bullish cycle in which investors rotate profits from bigger coins like bitcoin into smaller tokens like meme coins, fueling a price rise and retail investor FOMO (fear of missing out). In other words, the fate of meme coins is tied to investor risk appetite and credit availability.  BRETT began its meteoric rise in May after Bitcoin began consolidating at record highs near $70,000 and, at one point, saw its market capitalization near the $2 billion mark.  ""The $2.0bn mark is the liquidity wall many of the established meme coins hit before profit-taking and sideways volatility ensue. Of course, for every $1bn higher from there, retail investors will take a lot of momentum and risk-taking (a.k.a Apes) to get these meme coins to the levels of DOGE and SHIB. Let's see what the Degens can make happen later in this Bull Market cycle,"" Kenny Hearn, chief investment officer at SwissOne Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Hearn added that SwissOne's Top 50 smart passive index fund holds six of the largest meme coins in its portfolio following this quarter's rebalance.  TON and Telegram  TON's surge stemmed from its involvement in the cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app Telegram, which boasts 1.56 billion users worldwide and 800 million active users.  ""A toncoin (TON)-based economy is starting to take root in the messaging app Telegram,"" TON's Director of Investments Justin Hyun told CoinDesk in April.  Several catalysts boosted TON's adoption, including Telegram's decision to pivot to TON payments for advertisements and the Open League reward program. TON's network activity also got a boost from integrating tether {{USDT}}, the world's largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, and the debut of Telegram-based game Notcoin's digital token.  TON's daily active addresses rose to nearly 600,000 in June, surpassing Ethereum, the world's largest smart contract blockchain, housing prominent DeFi projects worth several billions of dollars.  ""During Q2, the daily active users (DAUs) for TON experienced a significant surge, even surpassing Ethereum. This growth was attributed to the introduction of mini apps, which are decentralized apps embedded into the Telegram messaging app. Notcoin, one of these apps, gained notable traction as users could 'mine' Notcoin by simply pressing a button within Telegram,"" Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, said in an email to CoinDesk.  ""Other significant catalysts include the launch of USDT on TON, with approximately $550 million USDT currently on the network, positioning it for payments, a key feature of WeChat,"" Talati added, noting Pantera's recent ""largest investment ever"" in TON.  KAS to solve the blockchain trilemma  Per Hearns, KAS's parent proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, Kaspa's attempts to solve the blockchain trilemma helped the token grab investor attention.  The blockchain trilemma refers t to the trade-off between three key aspects of blockchain technology: scalability, decentralization, and security.  Kaspa's GHOSDAG allows transactions to be processed in a more asynchronous, parallel manner, unlike traditional blockchains, which rely on sequential processing. That helps enhance performance and security while retaining the security of the PoW consensus mechanism.  ""It appears this team is on a mission to solving the trilemma (scale, speed, security) through its DAG versus blockchain structure (supporting speed and scalability) while using the security benefits of POW (supporting security). What appears to be a strong ""hodler"" base meaning low free float it would appear the market is very supportive of this leading-edge technology. Again, support over the fundamentals,"" Hearn explained.  KAS token also received a bullish boost from listed bitcoin miner Marathon Digital's announcement that it has started mining KAS to diversify its revenue stream.  What next?  The third quarter has historically been the weakest one, with bitcoin chalking out an average gain of just 5% over the past 13 years versus 60% in both the second and fourth quarters.  There is a risk that incumbent U.S. President Joe Biden's recent poor performance in the presidential debate might prompt Democrats to replace him with a strong candidate against the crypto-friendly rival Donald Trump.  That could keep animal spirits at bay until the Nov. 4 elections. Besides, the Fed and other central banks could heed BIS' advice to avoid premature easing of the monetary policy.  Still, crypto sub-sectors with strong fundamentals could continue to stand out.  ""The long-term game is the key for many projects building quietly in the background and delivering on real use cases,"" Hearn added. ""We note that ONDO, JASMY, and ENS fall into this category of strong fundamentals, user growth.""  Arca's Talati said bitcoin mining stocks, artificial intelligence, gaming and DeFi sectors could witness growth.",POSITIVE,BTC | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | TON,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/02/these-hot-crypto-tokens-beat-bitcoin-gains-in-q2-heres-what-drove-prices-and-whats-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6648c01d4c1fc3ee76388c4129db6e432e0d4fc-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417842,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3Cv,1719911157,Ether Spot ETFs to See Up to $5B of Net Inflows in First Six Months: Gemini,"Gemini says it expects spot ether ETFs to see up to $5 billion of net inflows in the first six months of trading.  Ether remains undervalued relative to bitcoin, and strong inflows into the ETFs could trigger a reversal, the report said.  If the ether/bitcoin ratio were to return to the median of the last three years it could rally almost 20%.  Spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs), once cleared for trading in the U.S., could see net inflows of as much as $5 billion in the first six months, crypto exchange Gemini said in a Monday research report.  The flows, when combined with the current Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) assets under management (AUM) give a total AUM for spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. of $13 billion-$15 billion in the first six months, the report said.  Gemini noted that ether’s market value relative to bitcoin remains close to multiyear lows, and the inflows could improve ether's relative standing.  “Given the AUM comparable in international ETF markets, robust on-chain dynamics, and differentiating factors such as a thriving stablecoin environment, there is favorable risk-reward of an ETH catch-up trade in the months to come,” Gemini said.  Ether spot ETFs are expected to begin trading in the U.S. in the coming months after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved initial filings from issuers in May. Bitcoin spot ETFs were first approved for trading in the U.S. in January of this year.  If the ether/bitcoin ratio were to return to the median value of the past three years, it could rally almost 20% to 0.067, the report noted, adding that a return to the maximum of 0.087 would represent a 55% rally.  Net inflows into spot ether ETFs below $3 billion would be a disappointment given that bitcoin versions received $15 billion of inflows in the first six months, Gemini said. Net inflows above $5 billion, a third of the bitcoin ETF level, would be a strong showing, and anything close to 50% or $7.5 billion would be a “significant upside surprise.”  This positive sentiment echoes comments from Steno Research in a report last week. Steno said ether could hit $6,500 later this year due to strong ETF inflows and other tailwinds.

30274079,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627331,1719908145,Bitcoin Bull Run Tied To Economic Echoes Of The 1930s-1970: Arthur Hayes,"Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, has recently offered a comprehensive analysis in his latest essay, “Zoom Out,” drawing compelling parallels between the economic upheavals of the 1930s-1970s and today’s financial landscape, specifically focusing on the implications for the Bitcoin and crypto bull run. His in-depth examination suggests that historical economic patterns, when properly understood, can provide a blueprint for understanding the potential revival of the Bitcoin and crypto bull run. Understanding Financial Cycles Hayes begins his analysis by exploring the major economic cycles starting from the Great Depression, through the mid-20th century economic booms, and into the stagnant 1970s. He categorizes these transformations into what he terms “Local” and “Global” cycles, central to understanding the broader macroeconomic forces at play. Local Cycles are characterized by intense national focus where economic protectionism and financial repression are prevalent. These cycles often arise from governmental responses to severe economic crises that prioritize national recovery over global cooperation, typically leading to inflationary outcomes due to the devaluation of fiat currencies and increased government spending. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Past $63,000: Top 3 Reasons Global Cycles, in contrast, are marked by periods of economic liberalization, where global trade and investment are encouraged, often leading to deflationary pressures due to increased competition and efficiency in global markets. Hayes carefully examines each cycle’s impact on asset classes, noting that during Local cycles, non-fiat assets like gold have historically performed well due to their nature as hedges against inflation and currency devaluation. Hayes draws a direct parallel between the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 and the economic environment of the 1930s. Just as the economic crises of the early 20th century led to transformative monetary policies, the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent quantitative easing set the stage for the introduction of Bitcoin. Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Will Resume Hayes argues that Bitcoin’s emergence during what he identifies as a renewed Local cycle, characterized by the global recession and significant central bank interventions, mirrors past periods where traditional financial systems were under stress, and alternative assets like gold rose to prominence. Expanding on the analogy between gold in the 1930s and Bitcoin today, Hayes elucidates how gold served as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty and rampant inflation. He posits that Bitcoin, with its decentralized and state-independent nature, is well-suited to serve a similar purpose in today’s volatile economic climate. Related Reading: Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Dump: How Will The $9 Billion Sell-Off Affect BTC’s Price? “Bitcoin operates outside the traditional state systems, and its value proposition becomes particularly evident in times of inflation and financial repression,” Hayes notes. This feature of Bitcoin, he argues, makes it an indispensable asset for those seeking to preserve wealth amidst currency devaluation and fiscal instability. Hayes points out the significant surge in the US budget deficit, projected to reach $1.915 trillion in fiscal 2024, as a modern indicator that parallels the fiscal expansions of past Local cycles. This deficit, significantly higher than in previous years, marking the highest level outside the COVID-19 era, is attributed to increased government spending akin to historical periods of government-induced economic stimuli. Hayes uses these fiscal indicators to suggest that just as past Local cycles led to increased valuation for non-state assets, the current fiscal and monetary policies are likely to enhance the appeal and value of Bitcoin. “Why am I confident that Bitcoin will regain its mojo? Why am I confident that we are in the midst of a new mega-local, nation-state first, inflationary cycle?” Hayes asks rhetorically in his essay. He believes that the same dynamics that drove the value of assets like gold during past economic upheavals are now aligning to bolster the value of Bitcoin. He concludes, “I believe fiscal and monetary conditions are loose and will continue to be loose, and therefore, hodl’ing crypto is the best way to preserve wealth. I am confident that today will rhyme with the 1930s to 1970s, and that means, given I can still freely move from fiat to crypto, I should do so because debasement through the expansion and centralisation of credit allocation through the banking system is coming.” At press time, BTC traded at $62,649.

Seasonal cycles, such as profit-taking around tax season in April and May, and increased demand in December, can influence cryptocurrency prices, leading to predictable changes.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} bulls may have reason to cheer in the coming weeks as possible seasonal cycles boost prices of the largest cryptocurrency after months of declines and rangebound trading.  BTC has traded between $59,000 and $74,000 since April, weighed down by billions in sales, upcoming selling pressure, outflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and peak negative sentiment among retail traders.  But a historically bullish month of July could soon change that. The first day of the month saw U.S.-listed ETFs record nearly $130 million in inflows – their highest since early June after more than $900 million in outflows over the month.  “Bitcoin has a median return of 9.6% in July and tends to bounce back strongly, especially after a negative June (-9.85%),” Singapore-based QCP Capital flagged in a Telegram broadcast Monday.  “Our options desk also saw flows positioning for an upside move last Friday into the month-end, possibly in anticipation of the ETH spot ETF launch. Many signs point to a bullish July,” QCP added.  Over the last decade, bitcoin has gained by an average of more than 11% in July, with 7 out of 10 months showing positive returns, data shows.  Crypto fund Matrixport said in a 2023 report that July returns from 2019 to 2022 have been around 27%, 20%, and 24%, respectively.  Seasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year.

DOGE is consolidating and might eye a fresh increase toward $0.1285 or even $0.1320. DOGE price is struggling to clear the $0.1285 resistance zone. The price is trading near the $0.1240 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish flag pattern forming with resistance at $0.1250 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.1250 and $0.1285 to gain bullish momentum. Dogecoin Price Faces Hurdles After a decent recovery wave, Dogecoin price remained below the $0.1285 resistance zone. DOGE formed a high near $0.1272 and recently started a downside correction like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.1250 support level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1203 swing low to the $0.1272 high. However, the bulls are now active near the $0.1220 zone. Dogecoin is now trading near the $0.1250 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1203 swing low to the $0.1272 high. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.1250 level. There is also a short-term bullish flag pattern forming with resistance at $0.1250 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $0.1285 level. A close above the $0.1285 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1350 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.150. More Downsides In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1250 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1230 level. The next major support is near the $0.1220 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.1220 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1185 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone.

However, with the pioneer cryptocurrency failing to completely beat important resistance points such as $63,500, bearish sentiment continues to dominate the market. Amid this, one crypto analyst has predicted that the Bitcoin crash is far from over, forecasting much lower figures than anticipated. Crypto Analyst Calls Out Possible Bitcoin Crash To $35,000 In a new analysis of the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Alan Santana has predicted a possible price crash in the near future. The analysis, which was posted on the TradingView website, takes into account the past performances of the cryptocurrency, identifying various points such as a maximum pain point. Related Reading: SEC Serves Fresh Lawsuit To Metamask Developer Consensys – What’s The Problem This Time? Santana points out that for Bitcoin, the maximum pain point currently lies between the 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels. This means that the Bitcoin price has far from bottomed, going by this analysis. Since the Fibonacci retracement levels are still so low currently. Based on this, the crypto analyst believes that the price will continue to crash with the maximum pain point sitting around $34,900 and $42,855. Going by this prediction, it means that the Bitcoin price could crash as high as 45% from its current level if it does play out. Interestingly, despite expecting such a massive price crash, the crypto analyst does not believe that the price will fall further. In fact, he points out that the Bitcoin price will never fall below the $30,000 price level ever again. Closing the analysis with some words for investors and traders, the crypto analyst advises, “Update your numbers, update your trades, update everything. These are the new numbers.” Not Everyone Is Bearish While Alan Santana’s prediction is very bearish for the Bitcoin price, not all analysts have gone the negative route. In fact, with the 20% BTC price crash, some crypto analysts believe that the worst is already over and that the pioneer cryptocurrency will see a bounce soon. Related Reading: XRP Price On The Verge Of Breaking Falling Wedge That Could Lead To 4% Increase One of the crypto analysts who predicts a bounce in the price is Doctor Bitcoin, who also posted his analysis on the TradingView website. According to the crypto analyst, this is actually the time buy BTC due to a harmonic pattern that has appeared in the chart, which points to a bullish reversal pattern. For the target, Doctor Bitcoin has predicted a possible rise to $85,000, which would be around a 35% move from the current price point.

30264061,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627262,1719891026,"Bitcoin Q3 Rally Possible As Miner Selloff Finishes, Quant Says","A quant has explained how a rally could be possible for Bitcoin in this third quarter of 2024 as miner selling pressure has disappeared. Bitcoin Miners Appear To Have Stopped Their Selling In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about how the selling pressure concerns from miners have resolved recently. There are two on-chain indicators of focus here. Related Reading: Shiba Inu ‘Underbought,’ While Bitcoin ‘Overbought’ Recently: Santiment The first of these is the “Miner to Exchange Transactions,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total number of transactions that are going from miner-related wallets to exchange-affiliated ones. When the value of this metric is high, it means the miners are making a high number of deposits to exchanges. Generally, the main reason why these chain validators may transfer their coins to these centralized entities is for selling-related purposes. As such, this kind of trend can have potential bearish consequences for the market. Low values of the indicator, on the other hand, could either be neutral or bullish for the asset, as they imply miners are possibly not participating in any selling through these platforms. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Transactions over the past year or so: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Transactions had been rising between late 2023 and end of April of this year. This uptrend in the metric had taken place as the price of the cryptocurrency itself had been going through a rally. It would appear that the miners saw the rally as an exit opportunity, as they gradually upped their selling pressure as the price went towards a new all-time high (ATH). It’s also apparent, however, that since the peak in April, the indicator’s value has observed a very rapid decline. Thus, it’s possible that miners’ appetite for selling has cooled off. Exchanges aren’t the only way miners sell, however, as over-the-counter (OTC) desks are also a popular option among these chain validators. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Total OTC Desk Balance, which is an indicator that keeps track of the non-exchange and non-miner wallets that miners send to when they want to sell. From the graph, it’s visible that the Total OTC Desk Balance had been at relatively high levels just earlier, suggesting that these entities that are likely OTC desks had been holding a large number of coins. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges 18%, But Watch Out For Crowd FOMO In the past couple of days, though, the indicator has seen a sharp decrease, potentially implying that the coins that had piled up in these wallets have now found a buyer. Thus, it would seem that miners have eased off their selling pressure on exchanges and the coins that they had been waiting to sell on OTC desks have also now been absorbed. “Sufficient conditions have been created to continue the upward rally again in the third quarter of 2024,” notes the quant. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown some recovery over the last 24 hours as the asset’s price has now rebounded back above the $63,700 mark.

30261978,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627287,1719887423,Circle Awarded Europe’s First Stablecoin License Under New MiCA Crypto Rules,"Cryptocurrency firm Circle has achieved a significant milestone by securing registration as an electronic money institution (EMI) in France. This move grants Circle a crucial license to operate as a compliant stablecoin issuer under the European Union’s rigorous crypto laws. Circle Breakthrough According to a CNBC report, the approved license positions Circle as the first global stablecoin issuer to achieve compliance with the European Union’s regulatory framework known as Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). This framework, considered a cornerstone in the EU’s approach to governing cryptocurrencies, sets out comprehensive rules and obligations for crypto companies to ensure investor protection and safeguard against market manipulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekend Trading Takes A Siesta: Volumes Plunge To Record Lows Circle’s acceptance into the MiCA regulatory framework means that both its USDC and Euro Coin (EURC) tokens can now be issued within the European Union while meeting the stablecoin regulatory obligations outlined by MiCA. Additionally, Circle is opening up its Circle Mint service, enabling businesses to mint and redeem Circle stablecoins, to customers in France. Expressing his satisfaction with the achievement, Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, emphasized the company’s longstanding commitment to building compliant and well-regulated infrastructure for stablecoins. He stated: Our adherence to MiCA, which represents one of the most comprehensive crypto regulatory regimes in the world, is a huge milestone in bringing digital currency into mainstream scale and acceptance. European Stablecoin Adoption The EU’s MiCA law, which officially came into effect in May 2023, introduced the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency operations. Last week, provisions specifically governing stablecoins were approved, imposing stringent measures on trading volume limitations for certain stablecoins, particularly those denominated in US dollars. As a registered EMI in France, Circle can now extend its services, including the minting and redemption of USDC through Circle Mint, not only to customers in France but also to individuals and businesses across the European Union. This is made possible by the concept of “passporting” outlined in MiCA, which allows crypto businesses to offer services in one EU country and expand into other markets within the bloc. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Eclipse $1 Mark This Bull Run, Predicts Analyst While Circle’s achievement is commendable, it should be noted that additional obligations under MiCA about crypto asset service providers will become applicable by December 30, 2024. Crypto companies will then have until July 2026 to ensure full compliance with MiCA’s requirements. Since its launch in September 2018 by Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase, USDC has gained significant traction and now holds the position of the second-largest stablecoin globally. According to CoinGecko data, USDC’s circulation amounts to $32.4 billion, trailing only Tether’s USDT, which holds the title of the world’s largest stablecoin with a circulation of $112.7 billion.

The report indicates that the Treasury’s assets, spread across multiple chains, have become increasingly complex and challenging to manage effectively. Decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher DeFi Ignas has analyzed the report, highlighting the Treasury’s limited runway of approximately two years at the current burn rate of $87 million every six months. Funding Concerns Mount For Polkadot Polkadot’s expenditure during the first half of 2024 paints a worrying picture. An extensive outreach program accounted for $37 million, aiming to attract new users, developers, and businesses. Additional expenses included $10 million on ads/sponsorships, $4.4 million on influencers, and $4 million on digital ads. Surprisingly, despite such expenditures, Polkadot’s visibility on social media platforms, including “Platform X,” remained notably low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekend Trading Takes A Siesta: Volumes Plunge To Record Lows The Treasury spent a total of $86 million in the past six months, managing $245 million (38 million DOT) in assets, with $188 million (29 million DOT) in liquid form. The burn rate indicates that the Treasury may face bankruptcy in less than two years. Polkadot’s token supply experiences a 10% annual growth, primarily fueling staking rewards. With a $10 billion market cap, stakers receive $1 billion per year, which significantly affects network security costs. However, a proposal to reduce inflation was rejected by 57% of the stakeholders, further compounding the Treasury’s financial challenges. New Governance Model The report reveals that direct fee revenue remains marginal for Polkadot. In 2023-H2, Polkadot generated 300,000 DOT through fees during a short-lived inscription campaign. Under regular conditions, fee revenue stabilizes at around 20,000 DOT per quarter. On the expense side, the report highlights a 2.4x increase in DOT spending compared to 2023-H2. Ambitious proposals and larger ask sizes contributed to this significant spending surge. Although the average DOT price rose, resulting in more value per DOT, concerns about the Treasury’s usage are mounting within the ecosystem. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Eclipse $1 Mark This Bull Run, Predicts Analyst To address these challenges, Polkadot is moving towards a more structured approach. Executive bodies, such as bounties and collectives, are emerging to assume departmental roles within the ecosystem. These bodies are responsible for security, data research, core functionality development, network operation, marketing, and business development activities. The key question now is how to establish effective structures quickly to guide Polkadot toward success. The solution, according to the blockchain’s treasury, is to delegate more responsibility to these executive bodies. These bodies are made up of competent individuals who evaluate new proposals and deliver value. Collectives, similar to subDAOs, have OpenGov capabilities and sub-treasuries to facilitate their work. By leveraging these executive bodies, Polkadot can outsource operational issues and mundane tasks, allowing OpenGov stakeholders to focus on making critical decisions. The effectiveness and performance of the executive bodies are evaluated, and budget allocations are negotiated with OpenGov based on the results. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $6.35, representing a price recovery of nearly 4% in the 24-hour time frame. However, the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market cap is still down 10% over the past month.

Meanwhile, the meme coin took one of the worst hits following the recent avalanche that plagued the crypto market. Bitcoin led altcoins on a downward trend towards the end of June. However, with the flagship crypto reversing and back above $63,000, Dogecoin could also enjoy an impressive recovery from its current price level.

He stated that his indicator had flashed a weekly buy signal for the first time since the meme coin was at $0.05. Additionally, Kevin noted that Dogecoin is about two green weekly candles away from confirming its first weekly golden cross in four years. He claimed that this is something to watch, suggesting that Dogecoin’s rally could be parabolic when this happens. DOGE Could Reach $0.6 On Next Leg Up Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently predicted that Dogecoin could reach $0.6 on its next leg up. He stated that the move towards the breakout target at $0.6533 “may be a matter of time, and prices could be preparing here for a break above.” The crypto analyst seemed confident as he again reaffirmed that a price rally of over 400% to reach this target might already be loading.

He claimed that such a meteoric move was possible based on the meme coin’s historical trend. He noted that the foremost meme coin has always made a larger run in every subsequent bull run, meaning it could enjoy a rally that will overshadow its price move of 22,800% in the 2021 bull run.

This purchase coincides with Bitcoin’s positive start in July, as the cryptocurrency begins to recover recently lost gains. Currently, Bitcoin is trading above $63,000, marking an increase of nearly 3% in the past day. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Correction Over? Here’s The Support Level To Watch Metaplanet’s Expansion Into Bitcoin Earlier today, Metaplanet made headlines by acquiring an additional 20.195 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.2 million, as announced just after market close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This acquisition is part of a larger strategy, previously declared on June 24, which involves significant capital allocation towards Bitcoin through upcoming bond issuances. This latest transaction not only represents its first purchase using the bond process, but has also now brought Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 161.2677 BTC, worth roughly $10.1 million, showcasing a bullish stance on the future of this leading cryptocurrency. The purchase price, averaging $63,427 per Bitcoin, underscores the bold plan to invest in Bitcoin regardless of its fluctuating market conditions. Notably, the implications of such significant investments by publicly traded companies are quite manifold. Firstly, it reinforces the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an investment asset, encouraging other firms to consider similar ventures. For instance, prior to Metaplanet’s plan to start purchasing BTC, Microstrategy has long been doing this bringing its total BTC holdings to over 226k BTC as of today. Secondly, these acquisitions can influence market sentiment, potentially stabilizing prices or even driving price upwards due to reduced market supply. Does BTC’s Current Rebound Signals Further Climb? In tandem with Metaplanet’s investment, the Bitcoin market itself is showing signs of an upturn. The cryptocurrency has recently seen a 2.6% increase, with prices rebounding above the $63,000 threshold. This resurgence is supported by comments from Credible Crypto, a prominent analyst in the space, who points out that the critical $63-64k zone could herald a new bullish phase for Bitcoin if reclaimed effectively. Related Reading: Market Tremors: $10 Billion in Bitcoin Dumped in May Alone, What Does This Signal?
