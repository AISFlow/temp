37735576,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628677,1734393592,"Riot Platforms completes convertible bond offering, raising $594M to buy 667 BTC","Riot Platforms announced today that it had completed its offering of the 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2030 to raise $594.4M. The Bitcoin miner used the additional proceeds from its coupon-convertible bond issue to acquire 667 BTC at $101,135 per token, bringing its total BTC holding to 17,429 BTC. Riot generated a BTC Yield Per Share of 37.2% YTD and 36.7% QTD through the recent Bitcoin acquisition and mining production YTD. Its total Bitcoin holding is currently worth $1.8B at the average market price of $103,873. Riot Platforms closes convertible senior notes offering With the additional proceeds from Riot’s upsized $594 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 667 BTC at an average price of $101,135 per BTC. As a result, Riot has increased its holdings to 17,429 BTC, currently valued at $1.8 billion based on the… pic.twitter.com/t68Uy8nbHU — Riot Platforms, Inc. (@RiotPlatforms) December 16, 2024 According to Riot Platforms, the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes sold in the offering included $69.4 million relating to the partial exercise of the initial purchasers’ option. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were approximately $579.2 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by Riot. The Bitcoin miner disclosed that the 2030 Notes were sold in a private offering only to persons reasonably deemed qualified institutional buyers per the Securities Act. All the net proceeds were swiftly deployed to additional Bitcoin acquisition. According to Stock Titan, successfully completing the convertible notes offering represented a huge capital raise for Riot. The convertible structure provided flexibility for future equity conversion while minimizing immediate dilution. Investors should, however, note that the substantial BTC acquisition exposed Riot to increased crypto volatility, although the low interest rate indicated favorable market conditions. The 2030 maturity period also provided a lengthy runway for the company’s growth strategy. Riot’s capital raise marked one of the most significant fundraising events recently in the crypto mining sector. It signalled strong institutional confidence in the company’s business model and demonstrated Riot’s commitment to future operational expansion. Riot Platforms doubles down on Bitcoin with substantial additional acquisition On December 9th, Riot announced its intention to use all proceeds from the offering to purchase more Bitcoin, and it carried through with its plan by acquiring 667 BTC on December 16th. The company had already used a portion of the offering net proceeds to accumulate over 5K BTC between December 10th and 12th. Riot Platforms increased its BTC holding to 17,429, suggesting plans to expand its Bitcoin reserve significantly and potentially impacting its financial strategy. The Bitcoin mining company acquired and held Bitcoin to enhance stockholder value. Riot reported its BTC Yield KPI indicating a quarter-to-date Yield of 36.7% and a year-to-date Yield of 37.2%. According to Riot Platforms, the BTC Yield KPI could only be used by pro-level investors to supplement their understanding of the company’s decision to fund the purchase of Bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock. Riot emphasized that the BTC Yield KPI was not equivalent to ‘yield’ in the traditional financial context since it could not be used as an operating performance or liquidity measure. InvestingPro analysts anticipated that the recent BTC acquisitions would push Riot’s revenue growth to 32% in 2024. InvestingPro data further showed that the company maintained a strong balance sheet with more cash than debt and a healthy current ratio of 5.86x. Recent stock performance was also strong, with a 16% return over the past week and 23% over six months.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37734922,https://crypto.news/?p=14319964,1734392697,DOGE and PEPE prices dip as meme coin ICO raises $25M in record time,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) prices dip as Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) storms the stage with a record-breaking $25M presale. Table of Contents DOGE progress stalls PEPE hopping into trouble Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale Throughout 2024, crypto enthusiasts have been speculating and passionately debating about the meme coin supercycle and how long it could last. While many meme coins saw price growth as Bitcoin broke past $100,000, the likes of Dogecoin and Pepe have since dipped, with DOGE down 10% on the weekly chart and PEPE down 14%. However, a brand-new meme coin – Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) – has raised $25m in a very short period. This is an incredible achievement that marks WEPE as one of the fastest-growing presales, a clear sign that the meme coin supercycle still has a lot of staying power. DOGE progress stalls From the chart below, DOGE bulls will be keeping an eye on DOGE’s ascending triangle. However, at this point, DOGE has spent over a week dipping towards the green diagonal trend line – and if the price breaks through it, traders and investors will turn their attention to the support levels below. Two psychological price levels stand out due to high wicks emerging from a couple of past daily candles. These are $0.30 and $0.22 – and if the DOGE price falls to $0.22 from its current value, that will be a dip of approximately 44%. Even though we are in a bull market and the meme coin supercycle theory remains plausible, all market cycles involve dips and corrections as well as pumps and other bullish movements. So, although $0.30 might prove a sufficiently strong support level to enable a bounce and bullish continuation, $0.22 is a good level to look at for investors who want to buy DOGE at a heavy discount. In the event of a dip, it’s likely to take some time – perhaps several weeks or a few months – before the DOGE price recovers and goes beyond $0.485. You might also like: PEPU surges 400% 2 days after IEO, viral WEPE to surge next PEPE hopping into trouble PEPE followed Dogecoin’s pump with a delay of a couple of days. Since that time, PEPE traders and investors have shown a lot less confidence in this token’s ability to sustain its higher price – and this is reflected in the high degree of chop in the chart below, as well as a notable tendency for dips to form and activate very quickly. Since DOGE dipped, PEPE has chopped with even more intensity, rather than falling too far down. Looking at Pepe’s trading volume, a much sharper drop-off in volume is seen over the last few days. This means that this intense chop is being driven by very little trading volume – which could be a sign of manipulation driven by algorithms and trading AIs. Taking a bullish perspective, just like DOGE, PEPE is located within an ascending triangle. However, the trendline that forms the support level for that triangle is quite steep – and that generally indicates weaker support and a high likelihood of a large dip if the support level is broken. From there, it’s quite a long way down (almost -35%) to the next strongest support level at $0.000015. Because of the high degree of recent chop, such a bearish move might take some time to reach its target – but it could easily get there before bouncing and moving into a new bullish phase. Overall, DOGE and PEPE are currently showing significant weakness, with a strong possibility of large dips ahead. Fortunately, it’s not all doom and gloom for meme coin traders as a new presale project is showing huge potential. Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale With so much potentially bearish uncertainty swirling through the crypto markets, projects that are achieving massive success under these conditions really stand out. Wall Street Pepe is one such project, and has already raised $25m in the first two weeks of its presale stage. Wall Street Pepe was created to empower degens across the crypto space with the skills and tools they need to get ahead. From alpha calls to key trading insights and strategic advantages, the WEPE army is already one of the fastest-growing meme coin communities. The token also offers staking – and can be staked during the presale stage, with current estimated rewards of 47% PA. Over at 99Bitcoins, a crypto analyst has completed a deep dive into Wall Street Pepe, and found it to be incredibly promising: Very few meme coins are designed to provide their community members with any utility at all – let alone actionable trading advice and the knowledge required to make money from crypto. Another frog meme coin, Pepe Unchained, saw gains of over 600% after its launch last week following a $60M+ presale, and Wall Street Pepe could be set for similar gains.

The failed exchange confirmed this in an announcement today while also updating its claims portal. According to the information on the claim portal , creditors can also receive their bankruptcy payouts in stablecoins. This will be possible for creditors by converting their fiat for digital assets, including stablecoins. FTX Distribution Portal (Source: X) Meanwhile, both BitGo and Kraken have confirmed their partnership. In its announcement, BitGo noted that FTX retail users could reclaim their funds securely via its platform. The firm’s CEO, Mike Belshe, noted that it is proud to support FTX. He said: “With our long-standing reputation as the most secure choice in the industry, we work hard to bring institutional-grade service to both retail and institutional clients, ensuring users the peace of mind they need to manage and grow their assets safely.” As for Kraken , it confirmed the agreement in a blog post, stating it will assist the FTX and its affiliated debtors with distributing their recoveries in supported jurisdictions. The exchange noted that this is not its first rodeo, as it was also involved in the Mt Gox distributions in 2024. While FTX has already chosen two firms to distribute payouts to customers, the Claims Portal shows that the bankrupt exchange intends to select a third. The space for the third distribution partner currently says “ Upcoming Distribution Agent. More information to come soon.” The choice of the two distribution partners is already raising concerns in some quarters. Users in jurisdictions where BitGo and Kraken do not operate are worried about how they will be able to process their claims and get their repayments. FTX picks January 3, 2025, as effective date The announcement of distribution partners marks another major step in repaying the exchange’s creditors. With that decision, FTX has also picked January 3, 2025, as the effective date for its Chapter 11 Reorganization plan. This means that FTX will have to make the initial distributions to its customers within 60 days of that date. Based on the plan approved by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in October, 98% of the FTXE creditors in the convenience class and fall within the convenience class will get their initial distribution within this period. Creditors in this category are scheduled to receive 119% of their allowed claims based on the value of the customers’ crypto holdings as of November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy. All they need to do is meet the distribution requirements. FTX CEO John Ray III described the whole process up to this point as a reflection of the bankruptcy estate’s outstanding work and its efforts to recover assets. He said: “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner.” Meanwhile, creditors in other classes of claims might still have to wait much longer before they can start receiving their repayments. FTX noted that it will announce payment dates for them soon. FTX recovers $35 million from Gate.io While the bankruptcy estate is working on commencing distribution, recovery efforts remain underway, and some are already yielding. After filing an adversary lawsuit against the Gate.io exchange in November to recover $40 million, on-chain transactions show that around $35 million has been returned to the FTX-controlled wallet. This marks another recovery after the exchange received around $14 million from several political action committees and campaign groups a few days ago. However, it remains locked in a dispute over claims with some creditors, such as Three Arrows Capital and Crypto.com. The professionals involved in the bankruptcy proceedings have also been criticized for the amount of money spent on the reorganization plan. Between May and July 2024, the bankruptcy professional fees were $98.5 million , with the financial advisor Alvarez & Marsal and legal counsel Sullivan & Cromwell being the top earners within that period.

However, the year ended with Bitcoin surpassing $100K. Another notable growth is seen with Solana, which drove the meme coin market. Messari data analysts compiled a two-part report on the trends and narratives in the crypto industry in 2024. The report, authored by Messari’s enterprise analysts and experts, explored various themes, including the rise of artificial intelligence in the crypto sector . Messari analysts reflect on 2024 inflationary worries Messari calls 2024 the “climbing wall of worry” because inflation uncertainty left investors wondering if the Fed’s monetary policies would trigger a recession. However, 2024 concludes with Bitcoin surpassing $100K after the crypto market overcame the macro obstacles of a weakening labor market. Along with the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the report underlines AI as the 2024 highlight. The report read in part; “The market is beginning to price in the potential for AI-driven productivity boosts.” Messari also calls 2024 the year of Solana. The report underlined advancements in Solana’s technology and adoption, making it a hub for memecoin trading. In the year, memecoins themselves remained wildly popular, capturing retail interest. Notably, user adoption surged globally, with apps like Phantom and Polymarket onboarding millions. The analysts also discovered that stablecoins have also become essential in emerging markets. Meanwhile, decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) gained traction in industries like energy and telecommunications. The report also touched on regulatory challenges and market volatility. However, the report revealed that the industry showed resilience and innovation. In the macro context, the analysts noted that crypto market trends faced challenges such as lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. They added that government asset sales and Mt.Gox repayments also played a part in the volatility experienced in 2024. Messari highlighted the pressures eased after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The analysts added the president pledged to protect innovation, self-custody, and Bitcoin mining. According to the researchers, these policies signalled a friendly environment for cryptocurrency that emphasized Bitcoin as an innovation driver and strategic asset. Messari analysts discuss crypto sectorial highlights in 2024 The researchers highlighted some sectorial advancements, including the intersection of artificial intelligence and the crypto ecosystem. The analysts reported the intersection exposed the crypto ecosystem to content creation and gaming frontiers. Messari analysts also confirmed that NFTs gained popularity in 2024, especially in enhancing monetization and digital ownership. The analysts predicted that these trends would drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the years ahead. Messari also commented on the introduction of Bitcoin stalking in 2024. They added that Babylon, BTC’s first stalking protocol, enabled holders to stake their assets and earn rewards without giving up control of their assets. In the report, Messari predicted that even as the BTC network changes, BTC programmability and stalking remain nascent. The analysts highlighted the path worth monitoring as layers on BTC and AVSs.They predicted these could unlock the utmost levels of economic security and decentralization. However, the analysts disclosed that in 2024, users often preferred the performance capabilities of networks such as Base and Solana. They added that users overlooked decentralization and security. The researchers warned BTC builders could have difficulty competing against other networks if the trend continued.

37734188,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628632,1734390657,Charles Hoskinson says Cardano is ready to “take over the world”,"Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is doubling down on his mission to transform blockchain governance. In a recent post , he shared that Cardano is on the brink of achieving what he calls a decentralized revolution. Charles explained that the project is nearing its final milestones—approval of a budget system and a community-ratified constitution—steps he believes will make the platform unstoppable. “It’s messy and tough,” he said of governance, “but it’s the only way to include everyone.” For Charlie, this is personal. “I’ll never apologize for being passionate about this outcome. It’s my life’s work.” Cardano’s roadmap has been long and complex, but with these developments, the project is eyeing 2025 as the year it reaches full decentralization. The stakes? Nothing less than taking over the blockchain world. Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork reshapes governance The Chang Hard Fork, launched on September 1, represents a turning point for Cardano. This major upgrade pushed the blockchain closer to its ultimate goal: a fully decentralized governance system. Key features included the introduction of a constitutional committee, improved on-chain voting mechanisms, and the much-anticipated rollout of Plutus v3, which brought more advanced smart contract capabilities. The constitutional committee, acting as an interim governing body, was designed to oversee governance decisions during this transitional phase. It’s temporary, though—once the community approves the ratified constitution, the committee will dissolve. From there, governance will rest entirely in the hands of ADA holders. Charles sees this as a step toward the Voltaire phase, the final stage of Cardano’s development roadmap. Voltaire envisions a blockchain that funds itself through a treasury system and gives ADA holders full control over its evolution. In Charlie’s words, these upgrades are not about short-term price movements but about “ensuring Cardano thrives in the long run.” The Chang upgrade also introduced Delegate Representatives (DReps), allowing ADA holders to vote indirectly through elected representatives. This system encourages wider participation while maintaining efficiency. ADA struggles in a volatile market While Cardano’s governance upgrades grab headlines, ADA’s market performance tells a different story. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.934, down 3.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Despite the current downturn, investor sentiment remains strong. The Fear & Greed Index for ADA sits at 74, signaling greed. Over the past month, ADA has seen gains on 67% of trading days, showing some resilience even amid market uncertainty. Analysts predict ADA will continue to fluctuate, with a trading range of $0.934 to $1.10 expected for December. The average price is projected at $1.02, but much depends on broader market conditions, which is incredibly bullish thanks to incoming US president Donald Trump.

37733975,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319958,1734390603,Ripple Set to Launch RLUSD Stablecoin on December 17,"Ripple is making waves yet again, announcing the launch of its much-anticipated enterprise-grade stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). This stablecoin, designed to raise the bar for compliance, utility, and transparency, will officially go live on December 17, 2024. The wait is over: RLUSD launches globally tomorrow! https://t.co/mYcyyX6Vre — Ripple (@Ripple) December 16, 2024 According to the announcement , RLUSD promises to cater to institutional needs and set new standards for trust and reliability within the stablecoin market. The timing of this launch aligns with increasing calls for regulatory clarity in the United States and beyond. Ripple’s decision to develop RLUSD under the stringent New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) limited purpose trust charter highlights its emphasis on regulatory compliance. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents and is engineered to maintain stability. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emphasized that RLUSD represents years of expertise in seamlessly integrating crypto with the traditional financial system. He furthered: “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide.” With platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA set to host RLUSD initially and additional listings expected soon, the stablecoin’s global rollout is set for rapid traction because of the attention it has garnered. Ripple’s RLUSD: A New Standard for Stablecoins? Ripple’s strategy revolves around creating a stablecoin that meets and exceeds the expectations of financial institutions, regulators, and retail users. Each RLUSD token will be fully collateralized, ensuring stability and liquidity even in volatile markets. To reinforce this commitment, Ripple claimed it would publish third-party attestations of RLUSD’s reserves monthly, ensuring full accountability and fostering trust. From a functional perspective, RLUSD is set to play a critical role in various use cases. Institutions can leverage the stablecoin for instant settlement of cross-border payments, enhanced liquidity management, and seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ripple’s vision also extends to creating a reliable bridge between fiat currencies and the blockchain ecosystem, simplifying on-ramps and off-ramps for users navigating between the two worlds. Furthermore, RLUSD is set to be a cornerstone for collateralizing tokenized real-world assets, such as commodities and securities, on-chain. This innovative approach promises to drive the adoption of blockchain-based finance while maintaining robust compliance measures. Ripple’s Ripple Payments division is also set to incorporate RLUSD into its operations early next year, which could give it global relevance. Ripple Payments has already processed over $70 billion in transaction volume and established near-global coverage, spanning over 90 payout markets. This integration will expand RLUSD’s utility, enabling enterprises to settle international payments efficiently while enjoying blockchain technology’s cost-effectiveness and speed. Expert Leadership and Global Vision Ripple’s ambitious plans for RLUSD are bolstered by the expertise of its advisory board, which the addition of two financial heavyweights has further strengthened. Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former First Vice President and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Despite all the massive preparations surrounding it, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has recently warned of potential supply shortages and price volatility for RLUSD . Despite its 1:1 parity with the dollar, pre-launch speculative activity has driven inflated bids for RLUSD, with one bid valuing 1 RLUSD at 511 XRP—over $1,200. Schwartz downplayed the anomaly, emphasizing that RLUSD’s price would stabilize near $1 once supply increases, and urged against speculation. The RLUSD is launching tomorrow, December 17, as the community awaits one of the year’s biggest launches.

37733974,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319976,1734390486,Ethena Labs Launches USDtb Stablecoin Backed by BlackRock Liquidity Fund,"Ethena Labs has introduced a new stablecoin, USDtb, which is backed by reserves invested in BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The launch was carried out in partnership with Securitize, a leader in the tokenization of real-world assets. Ethena Labs Expands Stablecoin Use Cases: USDtb Considered for CEX Collateral and Tokenization According to the announcement on Monday, USDtb functions similarly to established fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDT, maintaining a 1:1 reserve ratio using cash or cash-equivalent assets. The stablecoin allows unrestricted transfers, offering users flexibility and accessibility. Today we are launching our new stablecoin product, USDtb, backed by @BlackRock 's BUIDL Fund in partnership with @Securitize Read below for full details pic.twitter.com/mSf3mWv3oF — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 16, 2024 A distinguishing feature of USDtb is its scalability, made possible by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which constitutes 90% of USDtb’s reserves. The remaining 10% consists of stablecoins and institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury products, facilitating redemptions and liquidity. This represents the highest allocation to BUIDL among any stablecoin currently on the market. Unlike Ethena’s other stablecoin, USDe, USDtb is an entirely independent product designed to meet diverse user needs and exchange requirements. Its distinct risk profile provides an alternative to USDe while also supporting USDe’s stability in challenging market conditions. Ethena’s Risk Committee recently approved a proposal to use USDtb as a backing asset for USDe . Ethena plans to reallocate assets from USDe to USDtb during negative funding rates to mitigate risks and improve resilience. USDtb leverages LayerZero technology, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers across multiple networks. At launch, USDtb will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum. It will also be bridgeable via Stargate for enhanced interoperability. The stablecoin’s infrastructure has been extensively audited to ensure security and compliance. Leading auditors, including Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov, completed three full audits of the core USDtb smart contracts in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities detected. Additionally, a community-driven audit by Code4rena reported no significant findings. Ethena has partnered with several prominent institutions to support USDtb’s launch. Copper, Zodia, Komainu, and Coinbase Web3 Wallet provide custody solutions. Liquidity providers include Jump, Cumberland, Wintermute, Amber, GSR, and SCB Limited. USDtb is also being evaluated for broader use cases. It is under consideration as margin collateral on centralized exchanges that have partnered with Ethena and for allocation in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. How USDtb’s Launch Expands Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem and Boosts User Choice USDtb has been submitted for Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix, a competition to boost liquidity for tokenized assets. If selected, USDtb could see a significant increase in adoption and utility. Ethena’s proposal includes mechanisms for swapping between USDtb and USDe, potentially improving allocation strategies in response to market conditions. With USDtb’s launch, Ethena Labs aims to expand its stablecoin offerings while providing users with a diversified, secure, and scalable product. CoinGecko recently reported that Ethena’s USDe market capitalization surpassed $4.3 billion as of Nov. 29. CCData’s analysis attributes this growth to increased interest in the Ethena ecosystem, driven by its proposal to introduce revenue sharing for Ethena (ENA) token holders.

37733880,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628663,1734390406,"Dogecoin creator reveals his top five favourite cryptocurrencies, with XRP missing from the list","Billy Markus, the founder of Dogecoin, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, h as recently listed his top five favourite cryptocurrencies. The first on Markus’s list is Dogecoin, which is quite expected since he is one of its creators. DOGE was created as a meme coin but has since gained a lot of adoption and has a large community of users. The digital asset has also been endorsed by celebrities such as Elon Musk. On Dogecoin’s 11th anniversary on 6th December, Markus said that he did not expect the impact from the coin, which he initially conceived as a joke. He stated, ” it is extremely surreal that some silly thing I made in a few hours has had the impact on the world that it has.” Bitcoin, the first digital currency in the world, was also on the list. Markus recognized its historical significance and its position as one of the early players in the crypto industry. Avalanche and Ethereum highlight utility Markus selected Avalanche as the third one because it is fast and scalable, and more people are joining the protocol. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that is based on Ethereum and has been on the rise due to the fact that it allows for the operation of real world applications that are efficient. According to Markus, Ethereum made it to his list because of its performance in the area of smart contracts and dApps. He shared his experience of positive interactions with Ethereum as he engaged in business with NFTs and other projects. Although the high gas fees are still a problem of Ethereum, it is the most versatile and popular coin among other cryptocurrencies. Rounding out the list was Solana, which was hailed for its expanding ecosystem and investment effectiveness. Markus also pointed out that the platform had been used in many projects and has helped build its image as a significant competitor in the market. At the beginning of the year, Markus even challenged Solana and Ethereum communities to a memecoins-themed contest. When asked why he didn’t include XRP in the list of currencies he owns, Markus replied that he doesn’t own any XRP and jokingly said that he might if he receives some as a gift. i own 0 xrp if someone sent me a million dollars worth i would probably like it more — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 16, 2024 Trusting crypto over tradition Besides these choices, Markus recently disclosed that he had a shift in the perception of cryptocurrencies in general. In a recent post on the X, he confessed to liking crypto more than ever before. i’m beginning to appreciate cryptocurrency so much more recently and not simply because of the price increases (though ngl that helps lol) — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 7, 2024 Though prices have gone up, he stressed that there was a more fundamental cause. He believes in code supremacy over humans because, according to him, it is easier to bribe a human than to tamper with well audited code. One follower pointed out that crypto can help with high bank fees, and Markus agreed that banking deserves disruption. According to him, the more one understands conventional finance, the more compelling the case for crypto is. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,000, while Ethereum crossed $4,000. Dogecoin also became the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trading at $0.4 before a slight decline.

One Solana memecoin innovation, Fartcoin, recently captured attention with a staggering 220% rally, proving that altcoins can use humor to drive value. A leading Solana memecoin expert claims to have discovered another hidden gem: RCO Finance (RCOF) . Could this altcoin replicate or even surpass Fartcoin’s trajectory? Fartcoin: The Solana Memecoin That Redefined Viral Success Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) , a flatulence-themed token built on the Solana blockchain, has taken the Solana memecoin world by storm. Breaking its previous records, Fartcoin recently hit an all-time high of $0.52, catapulting its market cap to over $520 million. This explosive growth highlights the unpredictable power of Solana memecoins , which thrive on internet humor and community-driven momentum. Fueled by its absurd origin story, Fartcoin emerged from the Infinite Backrooms, where Solana’s Pump.fun launchpad transformed a whimsical AI-powered idea into a thriving token. With a 69% surge in just 24 hours and a 154% rise over the week, Fartcoin’s gains overshadow even broader crypto market trends. This Solana memecoin has captured attention, partly due to its simplicity and relatability, with slogans like “Hot air rises” becoming rallying cries for its community. As Fartcoin proves, the Solana memecoin market balances humor, speculation, and ROI, offering lessons for projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), which seek to replicate this rise with added utility. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Could Outpace the Solana Memecoin While Fartcoin relied heavily on humor and Solana memecoin hype, RCO Finance combines those elements with utility-driven goals. The project promotes decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption and AI integration, offering financial products that appeal to retail investors and institutional players.

RCOF’s AMM uses advanced algorithms to facilitate easy transactions, reduce human error and emotional decision-making, and lead to more consistent returns for investors. Another significant aspect of RCO Finance is its commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world through real-world asset tokenization. This capability allows users to invest in tokenized RWAs like real estate and commodities directly with their cryptocurrencies, eliminating the need for fiat conversions. This integration broadens investment opportunities and creates liquidity within the platform, making it easier for users to diversify their portfolios across various asset classes. Security remains a paramount concern in the crypto industry, and RCO Finance addresses this by implementing rigorous smart contract audits by SolidProof and offering a non-KYC onboarding process.

Pharma Bro mentioned on the Shkreli Planet podcast that Saylor was drunk on the idea. Shkreli added that the situation was a big bubble that would not end well for the company. The asset management company introduced Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset. Saylor described the digital asset as ‘digital gold’ and mentioned its stability as a store of value. The asset manager’s CEO further mentioned MicroStrategy’s plan to leverage BTC as a hedge against inflation. Michael Saylor also introduced the idea of BTC as a reserve currency for institutions in his Bitcoin playbook. Shkreli pointed out MicroStrategy’s plan to continuously purchase Bitcoin as part of the company’s business model. The asset management company first purchased BTC in 2020 worth $250 million to get 21,454. MicroStrategy made the most recent purchase of BTC worth $1.5 billion on December 15, increasing its holdings by 15,350 coins and bringing its total to 439,000 BTC. Pharma Bro also revealed during the discussion that he was shorting MicroStrategy stocks. Despite this claim, the investor did not reveal the size of his position. Shkreli added that his trade was a bit painful but fun. MicroStrategy stocks have still been rising despite Pharma Bro’s negative sentiment. MSTR has been up 490% this year, allowing the company to join the Nasdaq-100 index. Martin Shkreli says Saylor is not a favorable BTC advocate Shkreli further criticized Saylor’s advocacy for BTC. The investor suggested that the MicroStrategy CEO was not the best advocate for the currency despite being among the loudest. Shkreli also doubted Saylor’s commentary on BTC, citing a lack of credibility. The investor mentioned Saylor’s recent presentation to Microsoft shareholders. The MicroStrategy CEO shared his thoughts with the technology conglomerate on December 1. Saylor suggested that Bitcoin was the next technology wave, and Microsoft could not afford to miss it. The executive of the asset management firm suggested that Microsoft redirect its debt, stock buybacks, cash payouts, and other income sources toward BTC. Saylor further explained that the action could increase the company’s value by trillions while reducing investor and shareholder risks. Microsoft shareholders voted no to the proposal, citing reservations due to the coin’s volatility. However, the company’s board still highlighted that it would monitor developments in the BTC markets. Shkreli discussed the vote turnout, mentioning the 0.5% ‘yes’ vote and describing it as the worst proxy vote he had ever seen. The investor added that the negative outcome made him slightly bearish on BTC. Shkreli speculates on the BTC price outcome Pharma Bro speculated the outcome of BTC prices in relation to MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency acquisitions. In his opinion, the coin’s price should have spiked after the billions of dollars the asset management company has injected into BTC purchases. Shkreli then speculated that the current price showed a bearish BTC sentiment. The investor insisted that his prediction did not mean the coin’s price would plunge. BTC has made notable steps, reaching a new all-time high of $107,104 today. The coin is trading 0.18% lower than the new ATH but over 3% higher than yesterday’s price. Despite the ongoing discussions, Shkreli further mentioned that he expected the U.S. to stockpile only a little BTC. Shkreli highlighted that the next government could undo the progress even if Trump’s government accumulates BTC.

37733973,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319883,1734389669,Bitpanda Secures VARA In-Principle Approval for UAE Expansion,"Bitpanda , a leading European digital asset platform, has reached a significant milestone in its journey toward global expansion by obtaining in-principle approval from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This achievement sets the stage for the company’s operations under the name Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, marking its first foray outside the European market. Dubai’s growing prominence as a digital finance and innovation hub presents a strategic opportunity for Bitpanda to tap into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s burgeoning crypto market. Bitpanda Goes Global! We’re proud to announce that we’ve secured In-Principle-Approval from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in the UAE. This achievement takes us one step closer to offering our full range of services in this fast-growing global hub for digital assets.… pic.twitter.com/09bBm2oJpG — Bitpanda (@Bitpanda_global) December 16, 2024 Bitpanda’s In-Principle Approval: Is UEA Growing Stronger? While this milestone is a critical step, the road to full operational approval involves further measures, including setting up a fully operational office in Dubai, onboarding a regional management team, and implementing VARA-compliant infrastructure to support its services. Eric Demuth, Co-Founder and CEO of Bitpanda, articulated the importance of this achievement, stating: “In Europe, we have established ourselves as the most trusted and regulated digital asset platform. Now, we are scaling this proven model globally, with Dubai and the UAE serving as our strategic launchpad for international expansion.” He continued; “The opportunities are immense, and we are uniquely positioned to seize them as both Europe’s leading crypto broker and a top infrastructure provider in the digital assets space.” VARA’s progressive regulatory framework emphasizes investor protection while fostering innovation, a balance that aligns seamlessly with Bitpanda’s compliance-first ethos. Fabian Reinisch, General Counsel of Bitpanda, also remarked: “Securing VARA’s in-principle approval in under eight months reflects the strength of VARA’s regulatory guidelines and our commitment to innovation and compliance.” With this latest regulatory compliance move, Bitpanda will increase user trust and facilitate sustained growth in the MENA region. Strategic Expansion into a Dynamic Region Bitpanda’s entry into the UAE forms part of its broader strategy to establish a global footprint in the crypto space. The opening of an office at the DMCC Crypto Centre in Dubai earlier this year laid the groundwork for this expansion. Additionally, Bitpanda has forged strategic partnerships with key financial institutions, including The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK) and CoinMENA , a prominent licensed crypto platform in the UAE. Dubai’s reputation as a forward-thinking hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation was a major factor in Bitpanda’s decision to expand into the region. Initiatives like the DMCC Crypto Centre and VARA’s regulatory framework make the UAE a magnet for digital finance innovators. Demuth also expressed confidence in the UAE’s potential, noting: “The UAE’s regulatory framework fosters innovation while prioritizing investor protection. These principles align perfectly with our mission to offer safe and trusted access to digital assets worldwide.” Bitpanda’s expansion has also been described as a strategic move to bridge the gap between Europe’s regulatory rigor and the UAE’s dynamic market. Bitpanda has been proactive in fostering innovation and collaboration as part of its global strategy. Its partnership with Societe Generale Forge , the blockchain subsidiary of Societe Generale, is a notable example. This collaboration focuses on advancing euro-denominated stablecoins, such as EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), as integral components of the global financial ecosystem. Looking ahead, Bitpanda plans to roll out Bitpanda Fusion , a high-volume trading product launched last week for advanced traders. This tool aggregates liquidity from major exchanges, catering to the needs of ambitious crypto traders in the MENA region. With all these moves, Bitpanda is on to something for the UAE and beyond.

The FCA said that Retardio may be offering financial services in the U.K. without the required approval. The notice stated that the Financial Ombudsman Service will not protect investors who deal with the coin in case of a dispute. However, holders do not qualify for protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme as well. The regulator also warned that investors would be unable to get their money back in case the project becomes insolvent. “If things go wrong. This means it’s unlikely you’d get your money back if the firm goes out of business.” FCA. The warning comes after the FCA has been on a crackdown spree of unregulated crypto assets that are targeting consumers in the UK. Even with the warning, the price of Retardio rose by 16%, and the total market capitalization hit $111 million. Earlier, the meme coin had reached almost $240 million. As of this writing, Retardio is currently trading at $0.09011. The Retardio community responded to the news with the appropriate humor on social networks, which only increased the demand for the token. The Bezos Cabal send their regards.

The agency has also recently released a discussion paper that seeks industry input on the regulatory model for the sector. This year alone, the FCA has reportedly increased the size of its crypto team at the UK watchdog to over 100 people. The policy team has also been regarded as the fastest-growing section, which points to the regulator’s efforts to meet the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. FCA also targets Pump.fun Besides Retardio, the FCA recently issued a warning against Pump.fun, which is a memecoin generator on the Solana blockchain. The warning, published on December 3, says that Pump.fun is “not authorized” to provide financial services in the UK. The FCA noted that customers interacting with Pump.fun will not be protected by the Financial Ombudsman Service. The notice advised customers against using the platform and advised them to beware of potential fraud. The Pump.fun platform lets people create and launch tokens, especially memecoins, with no coding skills required. The platform, which was launched in January 2024, has reportedly made over $315.6 million in revenue, according to Dune Analytics. The FCA has recently intensified its supervision over the crypto platforms. In October 2023, it declared over 140 digital asset companies, including Huobi and KuCoin, as unauthorized companies. The regulator is also looking to tighten the rules on public sales of cryptocurrencies. The UK also aims to fully regulate stablecoins and other cryptocurrency activities by the end of 2025. As previously noted by Cryptopolitan, 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency, which is an increase from the 10% in 2022. Also, the average investments in cryptocurrencies per investor increased from £1,595 to £1,842. Currently, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency that is familiar to 78% of the respondents in the UK.

37733887,https://thecoinrise.com/ftx-creditors-to-receive-bankruptcy-payouts-starting-in-january/,1734389140,FTX Creditors to Receive Bankruptcy Payouts Starting in January,"FTX, the now-defunct crypto exchange, is preparing to make amends to its creditors after two years of its shocking collapse. The once-dominant platform has announced that its bankruptcy distribution plan is set to begin as early as January 3, 2025. A recent update revealed that Kraken and BitGo will be in charge of distributing the payouts to the creditors. This marks a major milestone in the recovery efforts, giving creditors hope of reclaiming their lost funds. FTX’s Long Road to Recovery When FTX filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, it left billions of dollars in customer assets in limbo. Allegations of fraud, financial mismanagement, and the collapse of sister firm Alameda Research added to the chaos. For two years, a dedicated team led by FTX Debtors CEO John J. Ray III worked tirelessly to recover as much of the lost assets as possible . Speaking about the progress, Ray said the distribution plan kicking off in January 2025 shows how successful the recovery efforts have been The bankruptcy plan, approved in October 2024, promises that 98% of creditors will receive at least 118% of their claim value in cash. This outcome is rare in bankruptcy cases and signals a significant win for those impacted by FTX’s collapse. Kraken and BitGo: Trusted Names in Crypto Handling Distributions FTX has partnered with the popular Kraken and BitGo to ensure secure and smooth payouts. Kraken, which previously supported payouts for creditors of the collapsed Mt. Gox exchange , brings years of experience and trust. The company highlighted its commitment to transparency in a recent interview. BitGo , a leader in the crypto industry, also emphasized its reputation for safety and reliability. Its CEO, Mike Belshe, emphasized that BitGo focuses on delivering high-quality services to ensure clients feel secure while recovering their assets. These companies will manage the initial distributions within 60 days of the January 3 effective date. Creditors can receive their funds in cash, stablecoins, or other crypto assets. Mixed Reactions to the Distribution Plan While many creditors have approved the recovery plan, only some are satisfied. Sunil Kavuri, representing FTX’s largest creditor group, has criticized paying out cash rather than cryptocurrencies. He argued that distributing crypto assets directly would align better with the platform’s nature and potentially offer higher returns. Despite the criticism, the plan received overwhelming support from creditors, with 94% of the “dotcom customer entitlement claims” group voting in favor. FTX’s collapse became one of the biggest scandals in the crypto industry. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO, was once seen as a visionary but was convicted of fraud. He was sentenced to nearly 25 years in prison in 2023. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research , also received a two-year sentence for her role in the collapse.

37733972,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320029,1734389031,Dogecoin Price Set to Blast Past $3.0 Soon? Here’s Why That’s Likely,"As the Dogecoin (DOGE) price consolidates near $0.40, bullish catalysts for the world’s largest meme coin continue to build in the background, suggesting a new leg higher could be just around the corner. Since slipping below a short-term uptrend, and amid ongoing struggles with resistance in the form of the 21DMA, DOGE remains at risk of a deeper short-term pullback. A retest of its 50DMA around $0.33, which happens to also coincide with a key support zone from back in 2021, could be on the cards. That said, DOGE futures funding rates are currently at reasonably low levels, suggesting any speculative excess that had built up in recent weeks has mostly vanished, reducing near-term sell-off risks. Per coinglass.com , funding rates for leverage futures positions lasted around 0.01%, which is in line with their September-October levels, and went down sharply from the highs above 0.09% reached earlier this month. Dogecoin Price – New Upside Coming? Even if a short-term Dogecoin price dip did come, expect it to be quickly gobbled up by the bulls – headlines related to Elon Musk /Vivek Ramaswamy’s upcoming Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) agencies continue to come thick and fast. And that’s only likely to ramp up when the Trump administration lands in the White House in January. It’s all but guaranteed that DOGE will retain a commanding portion of the meme coin market’s “mind share”. Dogecoin price risks thus remain strongly tilted to the upside. DOGE is undergoing a serious analysis of wasteful and burdensome regulations, and is looking for public feedback! Which are the really bad ones? Please DM us the CFR provision, the relevant text from the regulation, and the adverse consequences of said regulation. — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) December 12, 2024 A retest of the 2021 record highs, at $0.73905 per TradingView data, is the first major resistance level that the bulls will be targeting. But Dogecoin is poised to go a lot higher. A new golden age for crypto beckons with a new pro-crypto US administration and Congress soon to arrive. Chatter relating to the potential establishment of strategic Bitcoin reserves continues to grow all across the world. With crypto adoption set to accelerate and the industry boom in the coming years, Dogecoin will remain the leading meme coin. How High Can Dogecoin Go? The question then becomes how much higher will Dogecoin go versus its 2021 highs. $1? Highly likely. DOGE could investors need to start thinking bigger. A look at the performance of Dogecoin during past cycles could be informative here. Dogecoin has arguably been through three market cycles since its inception in 2014, and the cycles can offer clues. When drawing a Fibonacci extension upwards from the prior bear market low to the prior bear market high, it can be seen that Dogecoin has always rallied well beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci level, exceeding this Fibonacci extension by over 10x during its 2021 rally. The 4.236 Fibonacci extension level from the 2022 bear market lows back to the 2021 highs suggests that Dogecoin should at least hit $3 per token this cycle. But as history has shown, Dogecoin has routinely blown well past this level. Given that context, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a $10 Dogecoin price this cycle. Of course, that would imply a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which might be a bit much to ask. But Dogecoin could definitely 10x from current levels to reach a market cap in the $100s of billions.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

37732830,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374753,1734388483,Australian Court Fines Kraken $8M Over Unauthorized Margin Lending Product,"The Federal Court of Australia has imposed an $8 million fine on Bit Trade, the operator of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken in the country, for offering an unapproved margin lending product to local customers. The penalty follows allegations by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that the firm violated financial regulations by failing to assess customer suitability for the product. Legal Implications The credit facility, which enabled users to leverage borrowed funds as investments backed by digital assets like Bitcoin or national currencies as collateral, was issued without a Target Market Determination (TMD). A TMD ensures that financial offerings are appropriately targeted to consumers based on their needs and circumstances. ASIC argued that Bit Trade offered the product to more than 1,100 Australian clients without this document in place. Between October 2021 and August 2023, 1,163 customers paid over $12 million in fees and interest for the product, with the total number of users likely higher as it remained available until August 2024. Justice John Nicholas, who delivered the penalty decision , emphasized the severity of Bit Trade’s rule-breaking, stating they were “serious and motivated by a desire to maximize revenue.” He criticized the company for not addressing compliance issues until the regulator raised concerns, calling its system “seriously deficient.” The financial watchdog reported that people lost a combined $7.85 million due to the product, with one investor losing nearly $6.3 million. On top of the fine, Bit Trade was ordered to cover ASIC’s legal costs. Regulatory Implications and Industry Reactions ASIC Chair Joe Longo described the ruling as a pivotal decision that shows the importance of TMDs in protecting consumers from harmful financial offerings. Longo stated, “This significant outcome is a reminder for digital asset firms to consider their regulatory compliance obligations.” He added that many virtual currency products fall under existing laws and must be designed and marketed responsibly to safeguard Australian investors. Meanwhile, a Kraken spokesperson expressed disappointment with the court’s ruling, calling for tailored cryptocurrency legislation to address the regulatory uncertainty facing the sector. The company previously criticized the existing rules after the court ruled against Bit Trade in September, stating that the judgment revealed inefficiencies in the country’s crypto regulations. Kraken voiced support for updates to current laws but raised concerns about delays in implementing such changes. The Australian regulator recently began consultations with the crypto industry to refine its approach. The body is seeking input on updates to its digital asset guidance, including clarifying when such assets fall under current rules. Meanwhile, opposition treasury and financial services spokesperson Luke Howarth accused the government of leaving the sector in “regulatory limbo.” He argued that ASIC’s actions risk preempting comprehensive legislative reforms, potentially slowing growth in the Australian crypto market.

37733026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628611,1734388221,Tesla’s decision to ditch Bitcoin might’ve been a great idea in 2021. But does it still hold up today?,"In 2021, Tesla and its owner Elon Musk, the man who once called Bitcoin “a good idea on many levels,” turned their backs on it, citing environmental concerns. At the time, it seemed like the right move for a company preaching sustainability. But now, Bitcoin has crossed over $100,000, and Tesla is sitting on over $1 billion in unrealized crypto gains . So, does Elon’s dramatic Bitcoin breakup still make sense, or is it starting to look like a decision Tesla might regret? Back in 2021, Elon tweeted that Tesla was “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions.” He called out coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, as a major issue. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2021 The crypto market immediately reacted. Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 10% in a few hours. Elon’s influence was undeniable. Bitcoin believers were furious, calling him hypocritical. After all, Elon knew exactly how Bitcoin worked before Tesla jumped in. Critics accused him of using environmental concerns as a cover for Tesla’s strategy to cash out during Bitcoin’s bull run. Whatever the motives, the decision was definitely a turning point for Tesla and its relationship with Bitcoin and for Elon’s relationship with the crypto community. The concerns versus Bitcoin’s growth There was a reason Elon’s environmental argument hit hard in 2021. Reports from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance showed Bitcoin mining used more electricity annually than entire countries like Sweden or Malaysia. Tesla, the poster child for clean energy, couldn’t be associated with an energy-intensive process powered largely by fossil fuels. Fast forward to today and the Bitcoin mining industry has made real progress in adopting renewable energy. An estimated 52% of Bitcoin’s global mining operations now use renewable sources, up from 39% in 2021. That’s a big jump. But even with cleaner energy, Bitcoin’s mining process still guzzles electricity, and its overall environmental footprint remains massive. This keeps Tesla’s sustainability argument alive, even if it’s starting to look outdated. But here’s the twist: while Tesla ditched Bitcoin payments, it never abandoned Bitcoin itself. The company has held onto its crypto stash the entire time. And that gamble has paid off big time. Tesla’s Bitcoin fortune and its strategic moves Shortly after the first purchase, Tesla sold 10% of its Bitcoin, pocketing $101 million in profits. By 2022, Tesla offloaded another 75% of its holdings , netting $936 million. Elon later said these sales were to “test Bitcoin’s liquidity,” but many saw them as well-timed exits during Bitcoin’s bull market. Right now, Tesla still owns 11,630 Bitcoins. Elon hasn’t ruled out accepting crypto payments again, but he’s made it clear Tesla will only do so if mining becomes more sustainable. Financially, it’s hard to argue with the results. Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings have ballooned in value, and the company is thriving elsewhere. Just last week, Tesla stock hit an all-time high of $424.77, fueled by Wall Street optimism, Elon’s political connections, and the global bull run. Elon’s influence and the political wildcard Speaking of politics, Elon’s growing influence in Washington could completely rewrite Tesla’s crypto narrative. After spending $277 million to support Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, the eccentric billionaire is now close friends with the president and is set to lead the Department of Government Efficiency under the incoming administration. This role gives him significant sway over federal regulations, including those related to crypto and autonomous vehicles. A pro-crypto administration means looser regulations and more mainstream adoption, which would benefit both Tesla and its Bitcoin holdings. Analysts see Elon’s political maneuvering as a strategic play to position Tesla for future gains, both through crypto-friendly policies and faster approval processes for Tesla’s EV tech. Either way, this is a great opportunity for the company to jump back in. Trump himself has promised to not do anything that could crash Bitcoin, and Tesla is no longer in a financially precarious position.

37732447,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628625,1734387041,Avalanche (AVAX) regains $50 after Avalanche9000 main net launch,"Avalanche (AVAX) renewed its approach as a L1 chain, after the launch of Avalanche9000. The project moves from its structure of several specialized chains and subnets to a new, fast network. AVAX recovered above $50 after the official launch of Avalanche9000. The new network has been in testing since November 25, and only took weeks to reach the official launch as a new L1. The launch arrives just days after Avalanche secured a $250M funding round from over 40 VC funds with the goal of supporting the updated Avalanche9000 chain. Avalanche9000 is an upgrade that has been in the making for a long time. The changes are based on multiple community proposals, which were implemented in the launch, also known as the Etna upgrade event. After the upgrade, AVAX recovered to $50.21, on the verge of re-joining the top 10 coins and tokens. AVAX was at one point seen as a competitor to Solana, though the chain was left with an older collection of apps. Ahead of the Avalanche9000 upgrade, the chain also saw a boost in its activity. In November, Avalanche produced $1.5M in fees, while previous months ranged under $800K. After the renewed gas structure, Avalanche and its validators will have to adapt to a permanently lower gas income. Tether (USDT) made up more than 25% of activity on Avalanche as a share of total transactions. Circle’s USDT takes around 10% of transactions, pointing toward DEX swaps as the major source of Avalanche income. Trader Joe and Odos swaps make up another 10% of the network’s transactions. Avalanche to offer more accessible launches to Web3 startups Before Avalanche9000, the project carried a complex mix of validator chains, as well as C-Chain, an EVM-compatible network tailored for gaming and Web3. Avalanche was one of the projects to offer curation and advice for new gaming projects. C-Chain ended up supporting high-profile games, while some projects launched their own subnets. After the update, C-Chain will transform into Avalanche9000, though explorers have not yet reflected the name change. With the upgraded L1, Avalanche aims to add projects that will each launch their own network, at a much lower cost. Previously, Avalanche required a significant upfront amount of AVAX to launch a subnet, which led to many projects seeking a more accessible solution. Avalanche9000 will work the same way as C-Chain, but with 96% lower gas fees. All the new L1 will be compatible and offer a seamless experience. The new L1 chains will essentially copy the subnet structure but with much lower initial fees and gas prices. Avalanche already carries $1.62B in DeFi value locked and is one of the chains to carry native Tether (USDT). The network also carries a version of Aave (AAVE), as well as other DEX and DeFi apps. C-Chain worked in a way similar to Ethereum-compatible L2 and achieved bridged inflows from Ethereum. Avalanche was one of the few L1 chains to build a connection to Ethereum. During the early gaming and NFT stage, some of the Avalanche projects even started on Ethereum and migrated at a later date. Avalanche aims to build its own scaling solution Through its experience with C-Chain, Avalanche noted that a single L1 was not sufficient to carry high-traffic apps and general transactions. Unlike Ethereum, Avalanche wanted to scale with its own collection of new compatible side chains. Each chain would have its own rules while being compatible with the main network. Even before the upgrade, chains like Dexalot carried a larger number of transactions and consumed more gas compared to C-net. Avalanche’s team wants to repeat that success and invite more Web3 startups to launch a native L1 at a minimal cost. All L1 will be compatible with MetaMask and Avalanche’s Core wallet. At this point, Avalanche aims to encourage a new wave of product-building. Previously, Avalanche focused on play-to-earn, while also adding several high-traffic DEX like TraderJoe and Pangolin. Apps and gaming projects either had to compete for gas on C-Chain, or make a significant upfront investment to build a subnet.

Most traders expect a positive run based on both assets, citing growing institutional demand and the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. At press time, the total crypto market cap stands at $3.7 trillion, a 2.97% surge in the last 24 hours. BTC And ETH Dominate Inflows In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high above $106K before a slight correction as bulls project higher gains. The asset is up 2.8% today, while weekly numbers soared 5% amid long-term whale acquisitions. On the institutional front, BTC products attracted $2 billion inflows in the last seven days, raising total assets under management (AUM) to $135 billion. Bitcoin’s dominance is largely due to increasing institutional crypto investment. This year, fund flows have hit new highs, resulting in a similar price pattern for the asset. In Q1 2024, Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $73K and soared past $100k following the US Presidential elections. Donald Trump’s anticipated crypto push fuels the recent BTC movement. Talks about a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States have led to whales accumulating more assets. Generally, a jump in Bitcoin price affects the wider market with inflows to altcoins and meme tokens. Fund rotation away from BTC to altcoins can be characterized as the start of the altcoin season. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum leads top crypto gainers with a 2.5% daily inflow alongside rising institutional volumes. The leading altcoin maintains its drive in addition to bullish speculations above $5,000. ETH trades at $4,049 as bulls take its market cap to $487 billion. Ethereum recorded its consecutive seventh week of institutional inflow, which took figures in the last seven days to $1 billion. Overall, the asset’s AUM stands at $20 billion. Impact on The Wider Market Most traders are projecting a wider fund flow to altcoins in the coming months. Although most of these assets are below water, analysts point to the previous cycle and the link between BTC and ETH on these assets. Crypto enthusiast @el_crypto_prof wrote on X. “ You’re facing the biggest Altcoin run in at least 4 years (probably more like 8, as everything reminds me of 2018).

37731860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663029,1734386417,Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned?,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have been selling for around a year now. Here’s how much they have sold so far. Bitcoin Miners Have Shed Over 4% Of Their Holdings In Past Year As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the BTC miners have been in net selling mode for a significant period of time. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “miner reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of coins that the miners as a whole are carrying in their wallets right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Market Heating Up Again: Brace For Impact? When the value of this indicator rises, it means the chain validators are adding a net number of tokens to their combined holdings. Such a trend can be a sign that this cohort is accumulating, which can naturally be bullish for the asset’s price. On the other hand, the metric observing a decline suggests the miners are withdrawing coins from their addresses. The main reason why this group makes such transactions is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on BTC. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner reserve over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin miner reserve has gone through a steady downtrend during this window. There have been some brief periods of deviation, but the overall trajectory has remained toward the downside. Historically, the miners have had a presence as consistent sellers on the network. The reason behind this is the fact that these chain validators have constant running costs in the form of electricity bills, which they pay off by selling their BTC rewards for fiat. Generally, though, despite being regular sellers, miners don’t pose too much of a threat to the price, as their selling tends to be of a scale that can readily be absorbed by the market. That said, the times that they do participate in a major selloff can be to watch out for. During the start of this year, the Bitcoin miners held a total of 1.99 million BTC in their reserve. Today, the same metric stands at 1.90 million BTC, implying the miners have sold 90,000 BTC (about $9.3 billion at the current exchange rate) or 4.74% of their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Above $100,000 As Monthly Inflows Hit $80 Billion This is a notable amount on its own, but when considering the context that this selling has come over some length of time rather than inside a narrow window, the selloff stops being too interesting. “Miners are offloading steadily, but not in large amounts,” notes the analyst. “This suggests they are likely selling to cover operational costs.” As such, it’s possible that Bitcoin wouldn’t feel any major bearish effects from this miner selloff. The miner reserve could still be to keep an eye on in the near future, however, as any sharp changes in the metric could potentially spell a new outcome for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin set a new all-time high beyond the $106,000 mark earlier in the day, but the coin appears to have seen a pullback since then as it’s now trading around $104,000.

37733971,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320013,1734386382,"BlackRock Exec Predicts Massive Ethereum ETF Boom – Is $5,000 ETH Next?","The Ethereum (ETH) price pushed above $4,100 for the first time this year on Monday, as bullish sentiment rose following Bitcoin (BTC)’s renewed push to fresh record levels above $107,000. Optimism that the US will establish some sort of strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025 under the incoming Trump administration is the main talking point right now. Of course, this is helping to lift the entire crypto market, not just Bitcoin. But Ethereum also benefits from highly bullish narratives of its own. Ethereum remains the only crypto other than Bitcoin to have spot ETFs in the US. And ETH ETF volumes and inflows have been ramping up in recent weeks, per data presented by The Block . And this is just the “tip of the iceberg”, a Blackrock executive told Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas last week. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA ) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 Jay Jacobs said that only a very tiny fraction of Blackrock clients currently own either their IBIT Bitcoin ETF , or their ETHA ETH ETF. He added that Blackrock remains focused on bringing new clients to these ETFs, rather than focusing on launching new ETFs tied to other cryptos. Blackrock is one of the most influential firms on Wall Street, so their choice to focus on their BTC and ETH could be a huge boon for Ethereum. “Ethereum is BlackRock’s chosen alt-coins ” is a narrative likely to drive a substantial upside in the Ethereum price in the coming year. Ethereum Price – $5000 Next? The current market environment is perfect for ETH and the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is likely primed to hit $5,000 to print new all-time highs before the year’s end. The Fed is set to cut interest rates later in the week , which, combined with growing optimism about the incoming Trump administration, ought to keep a bid across all major cryptos. But historic patterns also support the idea of fresh upside in the Ethereum price. When Bitcoin breaks into a new phase of price discovery 6-8 months on from its halving, Ethereum typically tends to la by between one to two months. It’s not been over a month since Bitcoin broke to fresh record levels, suggesting the clock is ticking down for Ethereum’s breakout. While a new phase of Ethereum price discovery might not come until January, a retest of all-time highs before the year’s end amid a “Santa rally” is highly likely. Analysis of Ethernet’s short-term technical picture also looks good. Ethereum is in a short-term uptrend and probing for a lasting breakout above $4,100. Once this level decisively breaks, its only a short jump to the 2021 record highs. As chatters grows about a potential $200,000 BTC price later this cycle, talk will soon start rising about an ETH price of $10,000 or more. That makes it a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Better Alternative to Consider? However, while 2.5x gains would be a thing of beauty for most investors, some in the crypto space are hunting gains of 10-20x or more. One of the best ways to generate strong returns like this is to invest in a new meme coin with strong momentum but with a market cap still below $1 billion. One meme coin that the team at cryptonews.com is a big fan of is a fun new gamified cat token called Catslap (SLAP) . This highly promising meme coin has already been able to reach a market cap of over $20 million per DEXTools , but if it continues to gain momentum, could soon hit $100 million.

Since the U.S. presidential election, the value of the cryptocurrency has increased by at least 50 percent. However, the price is currently consolidating at $104,672 – 2.6% higher on Monday. At this price, 1 Bitcoin is equal to 39 ounces of gold. U.S. Strategic BTC Reserve Talk Fuels Rally Further, there is speculation that the Trump administration is making a Bitcoin strategic reserve. This initiative would be modeled after the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President-elect Donald Trump discussed this during a recent public address. The U.S government already owns 200,000 BTC, which is worth over $20 billion. Trump’s administration also intends to apply crypto-friendly measures. Former PayPal executive David Sacks has been hired as a cryptocurrency advisor. Trump is also likely to nominate Paul Atkins, an attorney with a pro-crypto record, for the position of the SEC chair. Other nations have also shown interest in holding Bitcoin reserves . China, the UK, Bhutan, and El Salvador have invested in Bitcoin for national strategies. Japan legislators are pushing for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, Russia is exploring Bitcoin as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. President Vladimir Putin has criticized the dollar’s dominance in global trade. Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, remains skeptical. He recently compared Bitcoin to gold, calling it speculative. The inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq-100 Index has drawn attention as MicroStrategy holds significant Bitcoin reserves . Its shares have surged sixfold this year, reaching a market value of $94 billion. The company’s inclusion in the index could attract more institutional investors. Peter Brandt Bitcoin Analysis and Prediction Veteran trader Peter Brandt’s recent analysis on December 16th shows Bitcoin has broken a new all-time high in the Bitcoin/Gold ratio.

37731803,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628553,1734385855,Bitcoin as a lifeline for Palestine and nations without a central bank,"Bitcoin adoption in Palestine has become a lifeline, offering a secure, decentralized way to send and receive money despite financial restrictions. It helps Palestinians access essential resources like food and medicine, especially during conflicts. This adoption shows communities with financial freedom and stability when there were no Central Banks. Palestine is going through one of its hardest times, especially in Gaza. With over two million people living in harsh conditions, families are struggling to survive without proper access to food, water, or even shelter. Banks aren’t working, hospitals are overwhelmed, and there’s no way for people to send or receive money. Despite all this, “ Bitcoin has become a lifeline” , offering help when no other financial systems can, says Fadi El Salameen at African Bitcoin Conference. Bitcoin is giving hope to Palestinians who cannot access money through banks. Since Bitcoin doesn’t rely on governments or banks, it has become a lifeline for nations without a central bank. People can send and receive money directly without the help of banks. This makes it a more reliable option, especially when traditional systems fail. “When there’s no bank to use, Bitcoin becomes the only way to send or receive help. It’s not just money—it’s survival,” says El Salameen. Palestinians are using Bitcoin to buy essential items like food and medicine. Sometimes, people even use it to help their families escape dangerous situations. Why Bitcoin works for Palestine? This is especially important for Palestine, where financial systems are often blocked or controlled. With Bitcoin, people can transfer money without worrying about restrictions or delays. Mohammed, a local entrepreneur, put it this way: “Bitcoin has no borders, no rules stopping it. For the first time, we can send and receive money freely.” Some Palestinians also use Bitcoin to save money securely during these uncertain times, seeing it as a safer option than traditional currencies. Using Bitcoin can be challenging. Sometimes, high transaction fees make it expensive, especially for smaller amounts. On top of that, many Palestinians are still learning how to use Bitcoin, which shows gradual adoption. Amina, a mother in Gaza, shared her experience: “I didn’t understand Bitcoin at first, but when my brother sent me money to buy food for my kids, I realized how useful it is. Now, I’m teaching others how to use it.” Despite these challenges, people are finding ways to make Bitcoin work for them, and its popularity is growing. Beyond just helping in emergencies, Bitcoin can give Palestinians more financial freedom. It allows people to save, invest, and rebuild their lives without relying on systems that can be blocked or taken away. Khaled, a Bitcoin supporter in Palestine, said: “Bitcoin isn’t just helping us today—it’s helping us dream of a better future.” People and organizations worldwide are also sending Bitcoin directly to those in need, bypassing middlemen and ensuring that help reaches the right hands.

The crypto world is buzzing, with BTFD Coin (BTFD) at the forefront. While Popcat (POPCAT) solidifies its spot among Solana’s top memes, Osaka Protocol (OSAK) stirs excitement with its decentralised NFT plans. But it’s BTFD Coin’s jaw-dropping presale performance and innovative ecosystem that’s got everyone talking. With over $4 million raised and 55 billion coins sold, BTFD Coin’s 12th presale stage is already a hit. Its play-to-earn (P2E) game and staking rewards are live, adding layers of excitement. As the presale progresses towards a listing price of $0.0006, investors are eyeing the massive growth potential. Let’s dive into what makes BTFD Coin the best meme coin presale to buy, while we explore the rising stars, Popcat and Osaka Protocol. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Redefining Meme Coin Success BTFD Coin is proving it’s not just another flash in the pan in a market flooded with meme coins. Built on the ethos of “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD Coin isn’t just a cryptocurrency—it’s a mindset. Its presale, live since November 26, 2024, has garnered massive attention, raising over $4 million and boasting over 5,600 holders already. With 55 billion coins sold at $0.00013 in Stage 12, BTFD’s listing price of $0.0006 suggests a significant ROI for early adopters. Consider this: an investor purchasing $500 worth of BTFD during Stage 12 will bag around 3,846,153 coins. At the listing price of $0.0006, that investment could grow to $2,307—a whopping 361% return. But it’s not just the presale numbers driving the hype. BTFD’s P2E game, currently in beta, offers a tantalising glimpse into its gaming ecosystem. While no rewards are live yet, the full launch promises thrilling gameplay and earning opportunities. Combine that with staking rewards delivering up to 90% APY, and it’s clear why BTFD is a top pick for long-term gains. The BTFD referral programme is another stroke of genius. Share your unique code, and earn 10% off purchases made through your referrals, provided you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. With extra rewards for referrals spending over $50, it’s a win-win setup encouraging community growth. BTFD isn’t just about promises; it’s delivering results. Its maximum supply of 173 billion tokens, Ethereum-based infrastructure, and community-driven approach make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. If you’re looking for the best meme coin presale to buy and hold for the long term, BTFD Coin ticks every box. Popcat (POPCAT): Solana’s Meme King Finds Its Paws Popcat’s journey from obscurity to prominence on the Solana blockchain has been nothing short of remarkable. Trading at $1.21 after a 3% rise today, Popcat’s market cap has surpassed $1.19 billion, cementing its place in the crypto top 100. For a meme coin to achieve this feat within a few months is a testament to its growing popularity. Popcat’s charm lies in its strong community backing and cultural appeal. Its all-time high of $1.56 earlier this year highlighted its potential for price discovery. Analysts are optimistic that reclaiming the $1.40 resistance level could spark another upward trajectory, making Popcat an intriguing choice for investors. Despite its impressive rise, Popcat is not without challenges. Volatility is inherent in meme coins, and Popcat’s price swings reflect that reality. However, its position as one of the best-performing memes on Solana underscores its staying power in a competitive market. While Popcat offers short-term gains for risk-tolerant investors, its utility and roadmap lack the diversity of BTFD’s offerings. Still, it remains a standout in the Solana ecosystem, proving that cat-themed memes can claw their way to the top. Osaka Protocol (OSAK): Decentralisation with a Vision Osaka Protocol is carving its niche with a decentralised NFT project slated for launch in 2024. Trading at $0.0000002523 with a market cap of $189.43 million, OSAK has captured the imagination of decentralisation enthusiasts. Its supply of 750.87 trillion tokens and a 10.04% recent dip highlight its volatility but also signal potential for savvy investors. The buzz around Osaka Protocol isn’t just about its price. Its decentralised NFT project aims to disrupt the art and collectables market, offering a glimpse into a future where ownership and creativity thrive without centralised control. This vision aligns with the broader crypto ethos, appealing to investors seeking more than quick profits. However, OSAK faces an uphill battle. Its low price and high token supply mean it’s still finding its footing in a crowded market. Compared to BTFD’s multifaceted ecosystem, Osaka Protocol’s focus is narrower, making it less versatile as a long-term hold. Yet, for those passionate about decentralisation and NFTs, OSAK is a project worth watching. Conclusion While Popcat and Osaka Protocol each offer unique value, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin presale to buy and hold for the long term. Its presale numbers, innovative ecosystem, and strong community backing create an irresistible package for investors. Imagine being part of a movement that turns dips into opportunities. With BTFD’s staking rewards, P2E game, and referral programme, you’re not just investing in a token; you’re joining a revolution. And with its listing price set to soar, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to ride the wave. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and secure your spot in the next big crypto success story. As market trends and research suggest, BTFD is not just a coin; it’s a mindset for long-term gains.

37731523,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98983,1734385375,Dogecoin Creator Reveals His Top 5 Crypto Picks and There’s No Room For Ripple’s XRP,"Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto online and the creator of Dogecoin , has revealed his five favorite cryptocurrencies in a series of posts on X between the 14th and 15th of December 2024. His picks—Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL)—highlight his unique perspective on innovation and personal connection in the crypto world. https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1868464749178163257 DOGE: A Sentimental Favorite Markus placed Dogecoin at the top of his list, unsurprisingly. DOGE is close to him since he is the creator of the coin or one of the creators. Dogecoin was created in 2013 as the fun virtual currency from the famous doge Internet meme mimicking Bitcoin. It has grown popular among crypto enthusiasts. It has a community-fundamental model, a market capitalization of $60.3 billion, and backing from celebrities such as Elon Musk. Markus’ attachment to DOGE goes beyond its numbers—it’s a project rooted in fun and inclusivity. BTC: The Original and Still Dominant Next, Markus honored Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. He shared his respect for BTC’s pivotal role in the industry. Bitcoin still holds the largest crypto market share, at $1.2 trillion. The daily trading volume for this digital currency is more than $81 billion. Prosecutor Markus is not a maximalist to BTC but respects its legacy as the first cryptocurrency and its impact on the entire market. AVAX: Speed Meets Functionality Avalanche (AVAX) made the list for its cutting-edge speed and scalability. Markus tweeted his appreciation for AVAX’s efficient transactions and rising popularity among dApp developers. With a $20 billion market cap and growing adoption in DeFi, Avalanche has positioned itself as an Ethereum competitor. Its focus on speed and lower costs sets it apart, which Markus highlighted as key reasons for his choice. ETH: The Smart Contract Pioneer Ethereum earned its spot for its contributions to smart contracts and decentralized apps. Markus noted that he’s personally benefited from Ethereum’s ecosystem, particularly through NFTs. Despite high gas fees, Ethereum’s versatility keeps it relevant, with a market cap of over $500 billion and a trading volume of $15 billion daily. SOL: Rapid Growth and Efficiency Markus wrapped up his list with Solana (SOL) , praised for its speed and energy efficiency. Solana’s ecosystem has grown rapidly, and it is supported by a $50 billion market cap and increasing developer interest. Markus also engaged with the Solana community through a meme coin challenge earlier this year. He called Solana’s recent successes impressive, tweeting about the blockchain’s rising impact. No Room for XRP! When asked about XRP ’s absence, Markus offered a candid response. He admitted he doesn’t own any XRP but joked that his opinion could change if someone gifted him some. Markus’ top picks showcase a mix of sentiment, innovation, and practicality. His insights shared directly with the crypto community on X, offer a glimpse into how one of Dogecoin’s key figures evaluates the evolving crypto landscape.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH | SOL | XRP,BTC | DOGE | ETH | SOL | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-creator-reveals-his-top-5-crypto-picks-and-theres-no-room-for-ripples-xrp/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37731627,https://blockworks.co/news/stanford-lab-ai16z-partnership,1734384600,Stanford lab partners with team behind ‘ai16z’ AI agent project,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Eliza Labs, the team behind the ai16z AI agent platform, struck a research partnership deal with Stanford University’s Future of Digital Currency Initiative, Eliza Labs announced this morning. For the past two months, so-called AI agents that generally attach chat bots to memecoins have raced to hundreds of millions in market capitalization, including ai16z. By funding a lab at Stanford, ai16z is trying to do what all successful memecoin-linked projects have to do — keep the joke going. “This is the funniest possible thing,” Shaw, Eliza Labs’ anonymous founder, told me on a call after I said I found the memecoin project and research university pairing amusing. “If I could think of the most entertaining thing that we could do, it would definitely be to start a lab at Stanford.” Eliza Labs is the entity behind ai16z, which is a DAO whose assets are set to be traded by an autonomous AI bot, jokingly named Marc AIndreessen after the real a16z co-founder. The AI version of Marc Andreessen is built using the Eliza framework, which lets agents interact on social media, surf the web and trade tokens. This AI agent technology is buzzy at the moment: ai16z’s GitHub repository has already been forked some 1,400 times. Once the platform is public, AI Marc will create a so-called marketplace of trust where he ranks DAO members based on how good their advice is. Stanford’s Future of Digital Currency Initiative brings a number of Stanford professors together to produce crypto-adjacent research and “promote the success of public and private digital currencies and their many use cases.” The research lab is funded by crypto industry members like Eliza Labs, who must pay either $250,000 for a Tier 1 membership or $75,000 for a Tier 2 membership. Snickerdoodle CEO Jonathan Padilla, a FDCI adviser who co-founded the lab, said Eliza Labs gave Stanford a “larger grant” that exceeded $250,000, though he declined to give an exact number. With its associated ai16z token trading at a market capitalization of over $800 million, Eliza Labs was evidently able to foot the bill. Stanford researchers will develop trust mechanisms for AI agents, which are known to hallucinate at times, and investigate how agents can coordinate with and govern each other. Stanford professors David Mazières and Dan Boneh will lead the lab alongside a cohort of graduate student researchers, Padilla added. “At FDCI, we’ve been working on technology that vastly increases the [computational] power of blockchains. AI16Z/Eliza is at the cutting edge of applying AI agents to financial problems. We are excited at the possibilities of increasing the onchain computational power available to their applications,” Mazières said in a message to Blockworks. Eliza Labs’ Stanford partnership didn’t come cheap, but with the AI agent space currently locked in an arms race for attention, Shaw and the rest of the DAO’s leadership evidently found the partnership worthwhile. The founder also hopes the partnership will produce some good science. “We’re looking for Ph.D’s to blow our minds and expand the realm of what’s possible with the technology that we’re unlocking,” Shaw said.

37730474,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/exclusive-graphite-networks-marko-ratkovic-on-launching-a-trust-driven-blockchain-with-passive-income-for-all-nodes,1734384300,Exclusive: Graphite Network's Marko Ratkovic on Launching a Trust-Driven Blockchain with Passive Income for All Nodes,"While there are countless blockchain innovations, most of them overlook the injustices prevalent in the market and the foundational flaws that hinder mass adoption and user trust. Graphite Network , a recently launched next-generation Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain has broken new ground with its novel approach. With features like passive income for node operators, a reputation-based trust system, and privacy-centric KYC, it sets the bar for how blockchain can operate fairly, target mass adoption, and truly meet the needs of the future. We approached Graphite CTO Marko Ratkovic, who, together with his team, brought to life the blockchain utilizing the cutting-edge Polymer 2.0 algorithm and aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and the decentralized world of Web3. Marko’s journey with Graphite began where most blockchain startups start—focusing on development and building foundational technology. However, the more they explored, the more glaringly evident it became: mass adoption was unattainable with the current market offerings. “Initially, we were focused on building blockchain solutions, but as we moved into low-level protocols and high-load systems, it became impossible to ignore the injustices in the market,” Marko recalls. “Most solutions out there enable illegal operations, obscure the source of funds, consume massive resources, and are wildly inefficient. How can we talk about mass adoption when the foundation is so flawed?” Building a Fairer System with Entry-Point Nodes “One of the greatest injustices in blockchain today is how developers and integrators are sidelined,” Marko says. “Despite being the backbone of these ecosystems, they often rely on external monetization strategies to earn revenue.” Graphite solves this issue with its innovative feature allowing entry-point node operators to earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes. Entry-point (or transport) nodes are specialized nodes that handle transaction routing and network activity without requiring full validator roles. “For the first time, even those who aren’t validators can generate consistent income from blockchain activity,” Marko explains. “It’s a step towards fairness the industry has been crying out for.” Reputation as the Cornerstone of Blockchain Trust For Marko and his team, the realization was clear: the blockchain ecosystem needed a new way of thinking where reputation would be the primary metric that holds users, validators, and integrators accountable. “Reputation is more valuable than money,” Marko says. “We introduced a system where validators can compete with one another. Validators with better reputations—those with higher-quality services—can process more transactions and earn more rewards,” he explains. Since reputation needs to be carefully tracked, the team came up with the idea of KYC. Users’ reputations are represented by the Graphite Trust Score, which incorporates a variety of factors, including the KYC verification level, transaction history, account creation time and activity, holding patterns, the weighted average of the Trust Scores of other addresses this account has transacted with, and any fraud claims. However, the Graphite team didn’t want to impose strict rules on users. “In our blockchain, everyone can set their own interaction preferences—whether to complete KYC, whom to interact with, how to filter transactions, and more. Users deserve the flexibility to make their own decisions,” Marko clarifies. Privacy and Trust Through Advanced KYC Addressing privacy concerns, Graphite’s multi-tiered KYC framework is another standout feature. It starts with a simple social media authentication process and will expand to include additional levels of verification. All KYC interactions occur off-chain, ensuring user data remains private while still meeting the transparency demands of businesses and regulators. “We’re combining privacy with trust,” Marko elaborates. “Using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, we verify user information without accessing or exposing sensitive data. This ensures that users retain control over their information while businesses gain the confidence they need to interact securely.” Graphite also eliminates the need for repetitive KYC processes across platforms. Users complete verification once, and partnered platforms can request specific confirmations—such as age or location—without accessing original documents. “It’s a privacy-first approach,” Marko adds. “And it’s far less invasive than traditional financial systems that often exploit user data.” High-Performance Transactions for Mass Adoption Graphite is designed with mass adoption in mind. Capable of processing up to 1,400 transactions per second (TPS) with confirmation times under 10 seconds, the network is leagues ahead of Ethereum’s 15-20 TPS. Throughput of this magnitude, achieved by the PoA Polymer 2.0 algorithm, ensures predictable fees that remain close to the minimum, making the blockchain accessible to everyday users. “Current Layer-2 networks often depend on Ethereum’s gas fees, which are inconvenient for ordinary users. Graphite is removing that bottleneck,” Marko explains. To further simplify adoption, Graphite is fully EVM-compatible, allowing developers to seamlessly migrate existing Solidity smart contracts. “This doesn't aim at replacing Ethereum,” he clarifies. “It’s about enhancing usability, lowering barriers for developers, and maintaining decentralization.” Bridging TradFi and Web3 Marko points out that TradFi institutions have historically avoided blockchain because of its association with anonymity. To change that, Graphite has built tools to offer clarity for TradFi without compromising on user privacy. “Tools like reputation assessments will help banks and financial institutions interact seamlessly with blockchain technology,” Marko states. With Graphite, financial institutions get the freedom to design smart contracts that meet their specific reputation criteria needs. Marko shares an example: “A bank could create a smart contract to offer loans exclusively to users with a predefined Trust Score, ensuring compliance with regulatory and business requirements. This kind of tailored interaction is something no other blockchain currently offers.” Tagged Addresses & Ticker System Graphite’s innovations don’t stop at privacy and fairness. It has introduced some other unique features geared towards simplifying adoption and ensuring transparency. For example, tagged addresses allow users to label specific wallets. Charitable donations, for instance, can be tagged, ensuring funds are used appropriately. If those funds are misused, it’s immediately visible on the blockchain.Then there’s the ticker system, marked with Graphite’s symbol @G. “This feature brings clarity to the ecosystem,” Marko explains. “For example, if a stablecoin is integrated with our blockchain, its ticker—like USD@G—instantly identifies its network. It’s a simple but powerful way to clear up confusion.” A Vision for the Future Graphite Network's roadmap includes KYC as-a-service that will enable users to complete verification once and apply it across platforms seamlessly. Plans also feature open-source Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending and insurance, leveraging Trust Scores for decentralized credit and community-driven risk management. “We’re building a blockchain ecosystem that’s fair, secure, and accessible to everyone,” Marko concludes. “And we’re not here to promise solutions; we’re here to deliver them.” It’s a bold vision, but if Marko and Graphite have their way, it could be the reset the blockchain industry has been waiting for.

On one side, Chainlink (LINK) is making headlines as analysts predict it’s headed for a bullish breakout. Cronos (CRO) isn’t far behind, with innovative partnerships reshaping its utility. But let’s be real—the star of the show is Qubetics ($TICS), which has raised a jaw-dropping $6.8M in its presale. Qubetics is redefining how crypto fits into everyday life with its groundbreaking multi-chain wallet. Imagine paying for coffee or sending funds across borders without worrying about volatile prices or clunky apps. With 10,000 holders already on board and the token price climbing 10% every week, it’s no wonder people are flocking to this presale. Spoiler alert: by the time the presale wraps, $TICS could deliver a 900% ROI. Let’s dig deeper into why these three projects are creating so much buzz. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Crypto for Everyone The hype around Qubetics is real, and here’s why. This multi-chain, non-custodial multi-chain wallet is about to make crypto as easy as Venmo or Apple Pay. It’s not just a wallet—it’s an all-in-one financial tool for everyday payments. Whether you’re grabbing your morning Starbucks or running an online business, Qubetics promises to streamline your transactions with its smart contract conversion tech. Basically, it’ll convert crypto into fiat instantly at the point of sale, eliminating market volatility stress. Picture this: A small business owner in Ohio wants to accept crypto payments but fears price swings. Qubetics handles the backend magic, ensuring they receive a stable fiat amount . Meanwhile, a digital nomad in Bali can send money to a friend in New York without dealing with hefty fees or transfer delays. Add the fact that it integrates with platforms like Google Pay and iOS systems, and you’ve got a wallet built for modern living. As of today, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 13, with each $TICS token priced at $0.0342. The clock’s ticking, though, as the price jumps 10% weekly. Over 347M tokens are already sold, and with $6.8M raised, the project is gaining serious momentum. By the time it hits exchanges at $0.25, the ROI potential is eye-popping. Early birds? Yeah, they’re smiling right now. Chainlink (LINK): Powering the Future of Smart Contracts Chainlink, the OG of decentralized oracles, is having a moment. If you’ve been following the crypto space, you already know it’s crucial for connecting blockchain smart contracts to real-world data. And now, with analysts predicting a major price surge, LINK is becoming a top contender among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. One of the juiciest developments? Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). It’s a fancy term for something huge: enabling different blockchains to communicate seamlessly. Imagine a future where Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche talk to each other without hiccups. That’s the kind of innovation Chainlink is spearheading. Chainlink also announced new staking features recently, allowing LINK holders to earn passive income while securing the network. Let’s not forget its role in the $7B DeFi industry—projects rely on Chainlink to feed accurate price data to their platforms. As the demand for reliable oracles grows, LINK’s utility (and price) is bound to skyrocket. So, what’s the 2025 outlook? With Chainlink cementing itself as a backbone for DeFi and cross-chain tech, it’s not just a solid investment—it’s a glimpse into crypto’s future. If you’re playing the long game, LINK might just be your golden ticket. Cronos (CRO): The Gateway to Blockchain Utility Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, is quietly carving out its own niche. While Qubetics and Chainlink grab the spotlight, CRO is a sleeper hit that could surprise you in 2025. One thing to love about Cronos? Its focus on real-world applications. Crypto.com has been rolling out initiatives like Visa-backed crypto cards and DeFi protocols, which make crypto accessible to everyday users. They’ve also been actively working on expanding partnerships, particularly in the entertainment and sports sectors. Heard about their FIFA World Cup sponsorship? That’s just the beginning. Another standout feature is the Cronos Chain, a blockchain tailored for decentralized apps (dApps) and NFTs. With projects like Cronos Labs pushing the boundaries of innovation, CRO is positioned as more than just a transaction token—it’s a key player in the Web3 movement. Price-wise, CRO is currently undervalued, making it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 if you’re looking for a bargain with long-term potential. Plus, with the increasing adoption of Crypto.com services, demand for CRO could explode as more users join the ecosystem. Don’t sleep on this one—it’s a quiet powerhouse. Final Thoughts: Which Cryptos Deserve Your Dollars? 2024 is shaping up to be a year of game-changers in the crypto world. If you’re on the hunt for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 , these three projects should definitely be on your radar. Qubetics is the rockstar presale you can’t ignore—it’s already raised $6.8M and has a clear roadmap for simplifying crypto payments. Chainlink continues to dominate the oracle space while setting the stage for a cross-chain future. And Cronos? It’s quietly building an ecosystem that’s all about accessibility and real-world utility. The window of opportunity is open, but it won’t last forever. Whether you’re chasing the presale excitement of Qubetics, the innovation of Chainlink, or the steady growth potential of Cronos, now’s the time to make your move. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Cronos (CRO) as your top picks for massive gains in 2025.

On Monday, the MicroStrategy chairman called the king crypto “cyber Manhattan” during an interview, doubling down on his belief that Bitcoin is the ultimate economic powerhouse. “We’ll just keep buying the top forever,” Saylor declared . “Every day is a good day to buy Bitcoin. I would have bought Manhattan 100 years ago, 200 years ago, every year for the past 300 years. You pay a little more than the last buyer, but it’s always worth it to invest in the economic capital of the free world.” MicroStrategy and its Bitcoin empire MicroStrategy’s obsession with Bitcoin started in 2020, and the company hasn’t slowed down since. On Monday, Saylor revealed that the company added another 15,350 BTC to its stash. This latest purchase brings its total holdings to 439,000 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $46 billion. How does MicroStrategy afford this? By issuing convertible notes to raise cash. It’s incredibly risky by all standards, but Saylor seems unbothered. MicroStrategy is set to join the Nasdaq-100 index on December 23. This makes the company part of one of the most prestigious stock indexes in the U.S. and automatically includes it in the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF, a fund widely traded by institutional investors. There are expectations of it joining the S&P 500 next year. So far today, MicroStrategy shares have jumped over 5% on the back of this optimism. Bitcoin, Wall Street, and a Federal Reserve rate cut Meanwhile, investors are bracing for a Federal Reserve rate cut, which could shake up markets and give Bitcoin another boost. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 96% chance of a 25-basis-point cut during the Fed’s meeting this week. Lower interest rates tend to weaken the dollar and increase money supply—two factors that have historically worked in Bitcoin’s favor. Though it wasn’t the only winner today. Ether hit $4,100, gaining 1%, while the broader crypto market climbed 2.8%, according to the CoinDesk 20 index . Coinbase stock jumped 4%, and Bitcoin’s price hit a new record of $107,229.38, with its year-to-date performance up an astonishing 151%.

FTX Debtors To Pay Back Victims Of Doomed Crypto Exchange According to a December 16 press release from FTX and its affiliated debtors, claimants can expect initial distribution to take effect within 60 days of the effective date. Both crypto firms BitGo and Kraken will collaborate with FTX as part of an agreement with the crypto exchange to assist in distributing recoveries to retail and institutional investors in accordance with the plan. FTX ANNOUNCES EFFECTIVE DATE AND RECORD DATE OF JANUARY 3, 2025 FOR ITS CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION – RTRS — unfolded. (@cryptounfolded) December 16, 2024 “For the past two years, our team of professionals have meticulously and efficiently worked to recover billions of dollars to reach this point,” CEO of FTX debtors John Jay Ray III said in a statement. “The Plan becoming effective in January 2025 and the start of distributions are reflections of the outstanding success of the recovery efforts.” “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors, and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner,” Ray concluded. News of the effective date comes just one month after FTX’s bankruptcy plan was finally approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in October. According to an October 2024 press release from the crypto exchange, the finalized plan will see 98% of FTX creditors receive 119% of their allowed claims realized subject to requirements. “I want to thank all customers and creditors of FTX for their patience throughout this process,” Ray said in a statement at the time, noting that they would be distributing funds to creditors in 200 jurisdictions over the globe. Sam Bankman-Fried & Associates Face The Music Monday’s news hopefully marks the beginning of the end of a two year process for FTX victims following the exchange’s collapse in November 2022. In November 2023, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme that saw investors defrauded of over $8 billion that was spent on venture capital, real estate purchases, and political donations. Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years behind bars this past fall, though has since reduced her sentence thanks to good behavior. Fellow FTX executives Nishad Singh and Gary Wang both received no prison time for their role in the scandal shortly following Ellison’s sentencing. All in all, the FTX scandal will go down as one of the largest financial and crypto fraud s ever perpretrated.

This program, announced by CEO Masayoshi Son together with President-elect Donald Trump plans to bring 100,000 jobs with a focus on developing artificial intelligence and infrastructure. The announcement was made at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump also made emphasis on the commitment of the administration to wooing foreign direct investments to boost the country’s economy. Son spoke positively about the U.S. economy after Trump’s win, and this is in line with SoftBank’s focus on innovation in the country. Funding to propel AI innovation The investment will be made by the Vision Fund and a majority stake in Arm Holdings, a semiconductor company, and other sources. Some of the funds may be fresh capital, but the investment could also encompass prior-announced initiatives, such as SoftBank’s $1.5 billion financing of OpenAI , the creator of ChatGPT. Such a large investment belief that SoftBank sees the United States as a center for technological innovation. Son pointed to the company’s emerging optimism about the nation’s economic prospects, which backs the new administration’s emphasis on new technologies. The investment is expected to focus on artificial intelligence and other technologies in the United States. The president noted that the initiative is crucial for maintaining the US as a technological leader in the modern world. This is also in line with Japan’s attempt to cement its economic ties with the US despite existing trade tensions in the new administration. According to Stanford University’s AI Index, the United States is the most advanced country in AI, with the best research, private investment, and responsible development compared to China. The report reveals that private funding for AI in the US was $67.2 billion in the last year, while in China, it was $7.8 billion. Also, the United States remains a leader in producing scholarly articles on ethical applications of AI in business. It also recognizes that China has made a significant increase in the development of AI, as evidenced by its leading role in patent applications and increased research output. However, the United States is still leading owing to the development of infrastructure, legalized system, and power diplomacy.

Speaking on CNBC's The Exchange, Torsten Slok, partner and chief economist at Apollo Global Management, offered a contrarian view: The Fed may not only have to keep interest rates steady but also raise them again next year. Slok pointed to stronger-than-expected economic data as a key factor that could influence the Fed’s decisions. According to the Atlanta Fed, U.S. GDP grew 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024 and is projected to reach 3.3% in the fourth quarter. That growth far exceeds the Congressional Budget Office’s forecast for a sustainable 2% growth rate and suggests the economy remains strong despite previous rate hikes. Inflation data also supports Slok’s view. The November consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3%, while other measures, such as the Atlanta Fed’s permanent CPI and the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, are ranging between 3% and 4%. These levels are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target and underscore ongoing inflationary pressures. “Despite the Fed raising interest rates since March 2022, we are still seeing strong economic growth and sticky inflation,” Slok said. “This suggests that monetary policy may not be as restrictive as some think.” Slok also pointed to potential policy changes under the Trump administration as factors that could contribute to inflationary pressures if he is re-elected in 2024. Proposed measures such as lower corporate taxes for domestic producers, tighter immigration controls and adjustments to customs duties could provide upward thrust to both inflation and economic growth. Related News: One of the Biggest Altcoins Announces Its Largest Update Ever - Here Are the Details “These policies could push inflation higher in 2025 and make it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts,” Slok said. The discussion also touched on how financial conditions, supported by rising stock and crypto markets, could complicate the Fed’s task. Slok attributed some of that optimism to “election-fueled euphoria,” but warned that loose financial conditions could increase the risks of overheating. “When you look at emerging markets, strong growth and stubborn inflation, it’s hard to argue that cutting interest rates is the right move,” he added. Slok’s outlook challenges the common view that the Fed could cut rates as early as mid-2025. Instead, it highlights the risk of higher interest rates, especially if inflation is more persistent or policy changes under a new administration further increase price pressures. “When we look at the data, everything points to the possibility that the Fed may have to raise rates again next year,” Slok said. “It will be very important for policymakers to ignore theoretical models and focus on real-world dynamics.” *This is not investment advice.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-loves-usa-muskusa-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-as-bonk-and-shib-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
26417,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=190809,1734381466,ISO 20022 Compliant Crypto Coins in 2024,"The ISO 20022 crypto-list is a collection of compliant digital coins and tokens that satisfy the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 20022. Many cryptocurrencies will be integrated into this new financial system as ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies. There is much speculation that these cryptocurrencies will soar in price once the standard is implemented. Digital Token Identifiers (DTIs) are identifier numbers or symbols representing digital currencies. The main problem with transacting in digital currencies is that they don’t have identifiers that banks can use to differentiate token transactions. For example, a bank program could easily tell the difference between “USD” and “AUD,” but this is more difficult for “Bitcoin” and “Bitcoin Cash.” ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is a non-governmental global organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO develops international standards for industrial, commercial, and proprietary use. If an ISO standard is established, virtually all financial institutions worldwide adopt it. An ISO code for Bitcoin ( BTC ) could facilitate global mainstream adoption more than any other action. This guide explains some of the basics of ISO 20022 and provides a list of cryptocurrencies compliant with ISO 20022. What are ISO Standards? Understanding the intricacies of ISO standards is crucial for businesses, professionals, and stakeholders in various industries.

ISO 20022 is an international protocol that provides a secure and standardized way of exchanging financial messages between organizations within the payment industry. The protocol will replace the 50-year-old SWIFT financial messaging system, which banks and other financial institutions use to facilitate global payments. The standard addresses the need of financial services organizations looking to create a globally accepted messaging language. The language allows them to implement their business processes and collaborate with their partners utilizing one universal platform. Financial institutions such as banks, crypto companies, and stock brokers can benefit from ISO 20022. It enables efficient and effective communication across multiple departments and organizations, reducing costs associated with numerous communication systems. In addition, achieving interoperability between existing protocols while still having the ability to support specific financial business processes makes ISO 20022 an excellent choice for any company involved in financial services. Why is the ISO 20022 Crucial? Financial institutions have always had to consider technological advances to keep up with the competition. In the new “ISO 20022” standard, cryptos could be assigned ISO codes if they comply with ISO 20022. This could lead to adoption by centralized banks and enable cross-border crypto payments through centralized financial institutions. As we move toward a new quantum financial system, any third party, including cryptocurrencies, wishing to engage with them must be able to use the ISO 20022 format. The standard presents an essential test for the ability of institutions of all sizes to adapt and embrace innovative solutions. ISO 20022 is more advanced than the traditional legacy formats banks use in that it supports more significant data volumes and faster processing rates. As a result, it is ideal for quick payments, daily liquidity management, compliance checks, and fraud detection and prevention. Overall, ISO 20022 presents an opportunity and challenge for companies wishing to stay ahead of their peers regarding technology. Considerations for migrating to ISO 20022 ISO 20022 migration journey Crypto companies must consider several factors when migrating to the ISO 20022 protocol.

They include having the necessary processes and systems to process this information. Compliance with ISO 20022 There has yet to be an official certification authority for ISO 20022 compliance. The ISO 20022 Compliance Checklist provided by the ISO 20022 Registration Authority (RA) and Technical Support Group (TSG) is a guidance document for implementers, adopters, and consumers of ISO 20022 messages. It helps them assess their adherence to the standard and ensure organizations account for the key aspects of ISO 20022 compliance. Compliance Checklist This checklist outlines various elements to consider when implementing ISO 20022, such as message structure, data types, message flows, and message versions. The list will help organizations align their implementations with the standard and enhance interoperability. Here is a list of the key aspects of the checklist, along with a brief description of each: Use of official ISO 20022 Message Definitions: The messages must use the official ISO 20022 message definitions published by ISO and available on the ISO 20022 website. ISO 20022 Business Transaction: This refers to the business process or transaction the message intends to support. The ISO 20022 standard defines a set of business transactions, and messages should be used according to these definitions. Messages must be valid ISO 20022 Message Instances: The messages must conform to the structure and content rules defined by the ISO 20022 standard. Messages must respect the ISO 20022 Constraints: These refer to the constraints defined by the ISO 20022 standard, such as maximum length, data type, and allowed values for specific fields. Messages must use registered code values: The codes used in messages must come from the code lists registered and maintained by ISO. Use of the Business Application Header: The Business Application Header is included in all ISO 20022 messages. It contains information about the message, such as its type, sender, and receiver. Use of Supplementary Data Extensions: Supplementary Data extensions allow for additional information in messages not covered by the standard message definitions. These extensions must follow the rules defined by ISO. While compliance with the checklist does not grant an official certification, it is a valuable tool for self-assessment and ensuring conformity with ISO 20022. Implementers and adopters can use the checklist to verify that they have adequately addressed the essential aspects of ISO 20022 implementation, reducing the risk of misinterpretation or non-compliance. Additionally, industry-specific organizations and regulatory bodies may develop their guidelines or requirements for ISO 20022 adoption within their domains. Organizations must consider these specific requirements in addition to the general guidance provided by the ISO 20022 Compliance Checklist. Benefits of Compliance Compliance with ISO 20022 can offer several benefits for the crypto industry. Here are some of the advantages: Standardization and Interoperability: ISO 20022 provides a globally accepted standard for messaging in cross-border payments, including cryptocurrencies. By complying, cryptocurrencies can ensure interoperability and seamless communication between financial systems and institutions. Standardization allows more efficient and secure transfer of funds across different networks, facilitating increased adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into existing financial infrastructure.

This can improve the perception of cryptocurrencies and increase trust among regulators and traditional market participants. Integration with Central Banks and Financial Institutions: Compliance allows global central banks and financial institutions to use cryptocurrencies in centralized settings. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple (XRP), XDC, Stellar Lumens (XLM), Iota, and Algorand, are already ISO 20022 compliant. Compliance increases the chances of these cryptocurrencies being considered for digital reserve currencies or inclusion in centralized payment systems established by central banks. Such integration can provide greater liquidity, increased transaction volumes, and wider acceptance of these cryptocurrencies. Streamlined Cross-Border Payments: ISO 20022 aims to optimize and streamline cross-border payment systems. By complying with this standard, cryptocurrencies can benefit from faster and more cost-effective payment processing, reducing friction and enhancing the efficiency of international transactions. This can make cryptocurrencies more attractive for cross-border commerce and remittances, opening up new use cases and increasing their utility. Improved Trust and Transparency: ISO 20022 compliance can enhance trust and transparency within the crypto industry. The standard provides a structured format for payment messages, improving clarity and reducing the risk of errors or misinterpretation. Clear and standardized messaging promotes transparency, reduces fraud risks, and strengthens the overall security of crypto transactions. It is important to note that the impact of ISO 20022 compliance on the crypto industry is still evolving, and the full extent of the benefits will become clearer as ISO 20022 adoption progresses. List of ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies A crypto that complies with the ISO 20022 standard could be approved by a centralized bank that enables crypto payments. ISO-standardized crypto identifiers are going to change the way crypto is used. If ISO issues an official code for crypto, such as Bitcoin or Ether ( ETH ), that crypto will enter the database tables of top financial services like Visa and MasterCard. For cryptos to be classified as legitimate currencies by ISO, they must comply with new standards in global financial systems and have an ISO code that doesn’t conflict with existing codes. These nine (9) coins and tokens have been certified as ISO 20022-compliant: Quant ( QNT ) Quant (QNT) is a blockchain project aiming to revolutionize how multiple blockchains and traditional financial systems interoperate.

BlockDudes, however, has been the driving force behind the meticulous implementation process, ensuring a seamless transition. This milestone follows Verge’s distinction as not being categorized as a security, a monumental leap forward for cryptocurrency. Verge’s mission as an open-source, community-driven digital currency revolves around bridging the divide between the crypto sphere and traditional financial systems. Verge remains resolute in upholding the core tenets of public ledger currencies, echoing the principles set forth by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. ISO 20022 standards were not initially tailored for the intricacies of cryptocurrencies, making XVG’s compliance even more remarkable. This decision is poised to broaden XVG’s horizons and amplify its presence within the global financial landscape. The announcement portrays this achievement as a defining moment in Verge’s evolutionary journey, setting the stage for the future of digital currencies. How is ISO 20022 changing in 2024? The ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, used for high-value and international payments, will undergo significant transformations in 2024. A notable change is the implementation of the Swift Transaction Manager (TM), which will progressively enhance data integrity rules. New rules for bypass and aborts are slated for introduction in 2024 and 2025. Moreover, corporate readiness for ISO 20022 is anticipated to reach a crucial stage by 2024. For instance, the Bank of England plans to transition its Real-Time Gross Settlement System and high-value payment messages to ISO 20022 in the summer of 2024. These modifications are part of a larger shift towards a complete industry transition to ISO 20022, expected to conclude by November 2025. This transition aims to adopt a universally shared language that offers valuable enhanced data. SWIFT implementation of the standard The coexistence of SWIFT and ISO 20022 for cross-border payments and reporting (CBPR+) began on March 20, 2023, initiating a significant phase in the global payments industry. During the coexistence period, extending until November 2025, SWIFT will support MT (Message Type) and ISO 20022, allowing financial institutions to migrate to the new standard at their preferred pace. This development represents an essential milestone in adopting ISO 20022, as it allows for a smooth transition period and accommodates the varying readiness of different institutions. SWIFT, the global provider of secure financial messaging services, will offer continued support throughout this coexistence phase, facilitating the integration of ISO 20022 and its structured data within the financial community. Furthermore, SWIFT actively assists real-time gross settlement systems (RTGSs) in implementing ISO 20022 for domestic payments. Several major market infrastructures, such as Australia’s RITS, Canada’s LYNX, Europe’s EURO 1 and T2, and New Zealand’s ESAS, migrated to ISO 20022 on March 20, 2023. Other RTGSs worldwide are also preparing to adopt the standard and will go live in the coming months and years. Adopting the standard by SWIFT and RTGSs allows for greater harmonization and standardization in cross-border and domestic payment systems. It introduces structured data, offering enhanced transparency, improved processing efficiency, and better analytics capabilities. Ultimately, the successful coexistence of SWIFT and ISO 20022 paves the way for enhanced cross-border payment experiences and opens up new possibilities for the global payments industry. How will ISO 20022 implementation impact different players in the industry? Implementing ISO 20022 within the financial sector can substantially affect stakeholders, including financial institutions, corporations, market infrastructures, and technology providers. These impacts can be advantageous and demanding, contingent upon specific circumstances and each participant’s readiness. Here’s a breakdown of how different industry players may be influenced: Financial Entities (Banks, Payment Service Providers, etc.): Operational Streamlining: ISO 20022 can bolster operational efficiency by offering a uniform messaging format, diminishing manual intervention and transaction errors. Data Enhancement: Financial entities gain access to more extensive and well-structured data, which bolsters risk management, fraud detection, and customer service.

The impact of ISO 20022 implementation hinges on the preparedness and adaptability of each participant within the financial industry. While it offers myriad advantages in terms of efficiency and data richness, the transition can be demanding, necessitating technological investments and business process alterations. Effective incorporation of ISO 20022 positions organizations to better address the financial landscape’s evolving demands and regulatory requisites. What impact will ISO 20022 have around the world? The ISO 20022 standard will completely change the financial landscape and improve international money transfers. Europe transitioned to ISO 20022 towards the end of 2022, and the US implemented it in 2023. Cryptos that update their systems to comply with this new ISO standard will likely appreciate if they are chosen for payments by banks. Over 70 countries, including Switzerland, China, India, and Japan, have adopted ISO 20022 in their payment systems. With over 200 payment types in scope, it will harmonize formats and data components from different payment methods that could not previously work together. The ISO standard will apply to domestic, real-time, high-value, and cross-border payments. Image Source: Red Compass What banks must do to stay ahead of the competition SWIFT’s technological shift from MT to ISO 20022 will be complete. Banks must upgrade their messaging interfaces and test them before November 2022 to ensure they are compatible with the new payment communication standard. Banks are under competitive strain to migrate to this new standard as the overall migration of the payment industry toward immediate payments makes their existing goods and services vulnerable. Because this standard is a more modernized and versatile standard than conventional legacy formats, it requires significantly greater data volume processing. As a result, bank systems and databases will need to be capable of handling these larger volumes at quicker speeds for real-time payments, daily liquidity management, compliance checks, and fraud detection and prevention. It’s critical to allow enough time for testing so that syntax and formatting information is accurate, and the data’s migration into all linked payment and clearing systems. Testing should ideally be completed by the second quarter of 2022 at the latest. Banks must inform their corporate customers about the additional data that may be accessible and how it will be utilized. In addition, those clients should be completely informed and involved in end-to-end testing. Below is the timeline for ISO 20022 migration. Image Source: Compact High-Value Payments (HVPs) on ISO 20022 To establish a road map to standardization for high-value payments and real-time gross settlement (RTGS), the SWIFT, global central banks and market infrastructures have established the HVPS+ market practice task group. “By unifying messaging standards across HPVs, participants in the payment system will be able to benefit from efficiencies and lay the groundwork for new services.” Michael Knorr, Wells Fargo Bank’s Head of Payments & Liquidity Management for Financial Institutions. To stay on top of these high-value payment systems, you’ll need a solution to keep track of them. HVP systems are crucial to international finance, so monitoring these significant value transfers with the appropriate monitoring and performance management solution is critical. RTGS is changing the global financial landscape Image Source: Compact Challenges of ISO 20022 Implementing the standard can present several challenges for financial institutions. Here are some of the critical challenges associated with ISO 20022 implementation: Standard complexity: It is a comprehensive standard with rules and specifications. Financial institutions must understand the intricacies of ISO 20022 as a new business standard and ensure compliance with the required rules, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML), fraud, and compliance checks. Addressing differences in market infrastructures: While various payment schemes may adopt the standard, there can be differences in the implementation guidelines for different market infrastructures. Financial institutions must navigate and address these variations to ensure interoperability and compliance across different payment systems. Upgrading legacy systems: Many financial institutions still rely on legacy systems that may not be capable of processing or supporting the new format. Upgrading or replacing these aging systems is often necessary to leverage the opportunities presented by ISO 20022. This process involves significant budgeting and coordination with stakeholders and partners. Establishing the right migration timeline: Its adoption deadlines vary across different markets and jurisdictions. Financial institutions operating across borders must carefully plan their migration strategy, considering their organizations’ diverse deadlines and potential complexities. Managing the pressure to change: Migration is just one of the transformation projects financial institutions may undertake simultaneously. Combined with regulatory deadlines, there can be intense pressure to implement changes quickly. However, rushed implementations may result in suboptimal solutions. Financial institutions must balance the need for timely compliance with the long-term strategic goals of their organization. Implementing new data management: Its messages can be more extensive than previous messaging formats, potentially resulting in a significant increase in data volume. In the standards, every character in a financial message must be 100% correct and adhere to the prescribed format. The validation process occurs at various stages along the communication channel, both on the sending and receiving ends. Even a minor error, such as a missing colon, can have significant consequences. A strong migration plan should exhibit the following characteristics to address these challenges: Clearly-defined long-term strategy: The migration plan should align with the organization’s long-term goals and objectives, considering the potential benefits and opportunities that it can offer. Comprehensive impact analysis: Financial institutions should conduct a thorough assessment of the impact of ISO 20022 implementation on their systems, processes, and stakeholders. This analysis will help identify potential risks and challenges that need to be addressed. Robust and systematic project management: Effective project management is crucial for successfully implementing ISO 20022. Financial institutions should establish clear governance structures, allocate appropriate resources, and follow a structured approach to manage migration. Effective internal communications: Communication is key throughout the ISO 20022 implementation process. Financial institutions must ensure that all relevant stakeholders, including internal teams, external partners, and clients, are well-informed about the migration plan, its timeline, and its expected impact on their operations. Future-proof technology and testing solution: To ensure a smooth transition, financial institutions should invest in technology solutions that support ISO 20022 messaging and offer scalability, flexibility, and compatibility with future developments. Rigorous testing is essential to verify the interoperability and functionality of systems before and after migration. CON: ISO 20022 Compliance is Antithetical The foundational ethos of cryptocurrency was to forge a path distinct from traditional banks and the overarching financial sector. Rooted in the aftermath of the late 2000s financial turmoil, Bitcoin emerged as the progenitor of this new digital currency landscape. The public sought an alternative in the form of peer-to-peer electronic cash systems with efficient transaction capabilities — a service also provided by banks and touted as a major advantage. Yet, for many, the drawbacks of centralized banking outweighed the benefits. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were thus innovated to offer peer-to-peer transactional functionality independent of central banks and their authoritative regulations. The core of this innovation was self-governance and decentralization. In this light, integrating ISO 20022 standards seems contradictory, steering away from the original vision of cryptocurrencies. By aligning with a global standard, the fundamental philosophy of the cryptocurrency movement risks being compromised despite any claims of neutrality from the standards organization. The New Quantum Financial System (QFS) and Its Alignment with ISO 20022 The New Quantum Financial System (QFS) is a theoretical global monetary system leveraging quantum computing, quantum-secure blockchain encryption, and quantum cryptography. The QFS finds a natural ally in ISO 20022 for several compelling reasons: Seamless Standardization: Integrating ISO 20022 within the QFS framework is essential for ensuring compatibility with existing and future financial networks. This standardization is a cornerstone for the QFS, enabling it to integrate smoothly with the global financial infrastructure. Rich Data for Advanced Processing: The detailed and structured nature of ISO 20022’s data format complements the sophisticated data processing capabilities of the QFS. This feature enhances accuracy and depth in financial analytics and decision-making processes. Expanding Global Footprint: ISO 20022 adoption is growing across international financial systems, and its incorporation into the QFS significantly broadens the system’s global interoperability. This integration is crucial for the QFS to function effectively across diverse financial landscapes worldwide. Adaptability for the Future: The flexible and extensible nature of ISO 20022 makes it well-suited for evolving technological landscapes. For a forward-thinking system like the QFS, adopting a standard that can adapt to future changes is vital for maintaining long-term operational efficiency and relevance. The Combined Impact on Future Finance The fusion of ISO 20022 with the Quantum Financial System represents more than technical compatibility; it signals a strategic move towards a unified, efficient, and transparent global financial ecosystem. As we progress towards a future where digitalization and advanced technologies become increasingly prevalent, the collaboration between QFS and ISO 20022 is poised to be instrumental in shaping a streamlined and sophisticated landscape for financial transactions and communications. Conclusion The ISO 20022 was developed by the “ Registration Management Group ,” which comprises 37 of the world’s largest financial players, including Ripple (XRP). Ripple’s vice president claims that Ripple already complies with ISO 20022 and, together with RippleNet, will be the first crypto company ready for the new global financial standard. The ISO 20022 protocol will revolutionize the way we make payments. With its secure and reliable features, it will help financial institutions around the world improve efficiency and reduce fraud. As implementation began in 2023, different players in the industry must start preparing for a seamless transition to take advantage of the potential benefits of this new protocol. With the ability to process data-rich payments, the ISO 20022 protocol will revolutionize the payment industry worldwide. Keeping up with new technologies, legal changes, and the introduction of new international payment standards is difficult. With ISO migration just around the corner, organizations can turn data into knowledge to ensure worldwide payment systems run safely and effectively. In 2025, ISO will be the global standard for high- or large-value payment systems in all reserve currencies and is projected to handle 80% of all transactions, including 87% of transaction value globally.

37729911,https://blockworks.co/news/2025-crypto-industry-predictions,1734381000,Taking stock of crypto predictions for 2025,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . 2025 is fast approaching and industry commentators are busy offering their two satoshis on what’s to come. With price predictions aplenty as bitcoin posts new all-time highs, we’ll stray away from those this time. One stock price expectation : Per Bitwise, Coinbase (~$324 Monday midday) will hit $700 as it surpasses Charles Schwab as “the most valuable brokerage in the world.” The investment firm correctly predicted MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100 index (announced Friday night) and believes COIN will join the S&P 500 next year. BLOK portfolio manager Dan Weiskopf told me he thinks MSTR’s ascent to that index in 2025 might be “a reach.” Still, it’s only a matter of time, he says. Weiskopf and the Amplify ETFs team detailed a “fun hypothetical” (should BTC move north of $200k) that MSTR could one day have a larger weighting in the S&P 500 than Bank of America. Moving on, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush wrote that President-elect Trump’s appointments — Howard Lutnick , David Sacks , Paul Atkins , etc. — signal “the start of a policy framework that positions bitcoin as a strategic asset.” What they really mean: the national bitcoin reserve Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming floated earlier this year. When asked about a US crypto reserve materializing, Trump himself told market prognosticator Jim Cramer, “Yeah, I think so.” He added: “We’re going to do something great with crypto. …Others are embracing it and we want to be the head.” With more companies holding BTC , bitcoin yielding strategies could become “a new corporate finance norm,” the CoinShares team posed . More on the regulations/policy front: Bitwise is forecasting the US Department of Labor to relax its guidance against crypto in 401(k) plans in 2025. This would fit the flood-of-new-buyers narrative spurred by crypto-friendly regulation, with some pension funds and RIAs already making moves. A repeal of SAB 121 (a bipartisan effort blocked by President Joe Biden) might not even be necessary in 2025. Ava Labs deputy general counsel Wee Ming Choon told me he believes that particular bulletin will be an easy one for a new SEC administration to rescind (more thoughts from Choon are coming in a future Forward Guidance edition). Let’s conclude with a shared prediction from Bitwise and VanEck: The tokenized RWA space will surpass the $50 billion mark. Securitize’s Eric Ervin said during a panel I moderated at Permissionless in October that he thinks BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL, backed by US Treasurys, could grow to $50b on its own in the next few years.

37728898,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374778,1734380160,"BTC at $180K, ETH to $6K, and More: Here’s VanEck’s Top Crypto Predictions for 2025","The crypto market has been on a bullish streak in the last quarter of this year, thanks to Donald Trump’s recent victory in the United States presidential election. American investment management firm VanEck has shared ten predictions that could raise the crypto market’s valuation in the coming year. Bullish Crypto Predictions From VanEck VanEck’s first prediction focused on leading assets that would experience meteoric price growth next year. For example, BTC would attain $180,000, ETH would cross $6,000, SOL would surpass $500, and SUI would exceed $10. The firm’s next prediction showed factors that could drive some of these price projections. With Trump’s bullish stance, VanEck expects the U.S. to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Following Trump’s selection of a crypto-friendly chairman for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), applications for multiple crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) will likely be approved. Additionally, Ethereum ETPs will feature staking , a function restricted under the Joe Biden administration. Highlighting another factor that could aid BTC’s price growth, VanEck stated in another prediction that Bitcoin-based layer-2 networks will reach 100,000 BTC in total value locked (TVL). If this speculation comes true, it would be a 600% surge from this year’s TVL record. The completion of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade from earlier this year allowed for increased blob activity. VanEck predicted that the Ethereum blob space will garner $1 billion in fees as more L2 rollups and “high-fee use cases” come to the limelight. The stablecoin market has a daily traded volume of around $100 billion. VanEck projects this value to soar to as high as $300 billion by the end of next year. The firm explained that “this surge will be driven by adoption in global commerce, remittances, and integration with major tech and payment networks.” DeFi and NFT Predictions VanEck expanded its prediction to include artificial intelligence (AI). The firm stated that one million new AI agents will surface next year and be used in decentralized finance (DeFi), social media, gaming, and consumer applications. Regarding DeFi, VanEck expects decentralized exchanges (DEX) to hit a peak of $4 trillion in traded volume and $200 billion in TVL. This surge would be fueled by AI-focused projects, “consumer-facing dApps, and tokenized assets.” Another DeFi-focused prediction from VanEck projects dApp tokens, which will narrow the performance gap with L1 crypto assets. The investment company is optimistic that new projects themed around AI and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) will drive growth. The NFT market is not left out of the company’s projection. VanEck predicts that the NFT traded volume will reclaim $30 billion next year. Growing projects like Pudgy Penguins and Milady will drive this surge. VanEck also predicted a surge in tokenized securities in the coming year. Although the market soared from $6 billion to $12 billion this year, the company expects this value to soar to as high as $50 billion next year.

Sudeng (HIPPO), a community-driven token on the SUI blockchain, has faced a challenging month, with its price tumbling 49%. Meanwhile, Bonk (BONK), the dog-themed Solana token, is making a comeback after turning a major resistance level into support, bolstered by its viral #LetsBONK campaign. But the real headline-grabber is BTFD Coin ($BTFD), a rising star that’s already raised over $4 million in its presale, positioning itself as one of the best meme coins to buy this month . Meme coins have evolved beyond their humorous origins, offering a mix of community power, innovation, and financial potential. BTFD Coin exemplifies this evolution with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and a strong presale performance. Alongside Sudeng and Bonk, these three coins highlight the diverse opportunities in the meme coin space this month. Let’s dive into what makes each of them unique. BTFD Coin: A Bullish Leader in the Meme Coin Market What if you could combine the fun of a meme coin with the practicality of staking and gaming rewards? That’s the promise of BTFD Coin ($BTFD), a token that’s built on the mantra, “Own the Dip.” With its growing community of 5,600 holders, this coin is rapidly gaining traction as a must-watch investment. The presale numbers are impressive: BTFD has already raised over $4 million across 12 stages, with its price rising from $0.000004 to the current $0.00013. For investors jumping in now, there’s still massive potential, as the coin is set to list at $0.0006. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment at the current stage would buy you approximately 7.69 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at launch, that investment could grow to $4,614—a 4.6x return. BTFD’s ecosystem is another reason it’s making waves. Its beta version of a P2E game is already live, showcasing its commitment to creating a fun and rewarding experience for users. Then there’s the staking programme, offering a jaw-dropping 90% APY. What truly sets BTFD apart is its ability to engage and excite its community. With only four presale stages left, the clock is ticking for investors to secure their spot before the price skyrockets. For these reasons, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins to buy this month. Bonk: Turning Resistance into Support with a Viral Burn Campaign Bonk (BONK) is a dog-themed meme coin that gained fame as the first Solana-based token “for the people, by the people.” While the coin recently experienced a 13.15% drop over the past month, its trading volume surged by 14% in the last 24 hours, reaching $307.34 million. Analysts believe this renewed interest stems from Bonk’s ability to flip a critical resistance level into support. Earlier in November, Bonk hit its all-time high, but profit-taking led to a steep correction. However, according to analyst CryptoBull, the token has now stabilised, turning its previous resistance into a support level. This stability is paving the way for a potential recovery, especially with the #LetsBONK campaign gaining momentum. The #LetsBONK initiative is not just clever marketing—it’s a deflationary mechanism designed to increase scarcity and drive long-term value. For every share of the hashtag, 1,000 tokens are burned, and for each new follower across Bonk’s social platforms, 10,000 tokens are torched. With a goal of burning 1 trillion BONK tokens by December 24, this campaign is boosting Bonk’s viral appeal while reducing its circulating supply. Sudeng: A Tough Month but Promising Long-Term Potential Sudeng (HIPPO) is a fan-created meme coin on the SUI blockchain that celebrates Su Deng, the “cutest hippo in the world.” Despite its whimsical branding and philanthropic efforts, the token has faced significant challenges recently, with its price dropping 49.49% to $0.01227 over the past month. While this drop might deter some investors, Sudeng’s long-term prospects offer hope. Analysts predict that HIPPO could reach a maximum of $0.85 by 2025 and as high as $6.50 by 2030. The project’s commitment to donating a portion of its profits to global wildlife causes, starting with Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo, adds a layer of social responsibility that resonates with ethically-minded investors. Under new community-driven management, Sudeng is working to rebuild trust and momentum. Its philanthropic mission, combined with its cute and relatable branding, makes it a token with significant potential for a turnaround. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the top choice among the best meme coins to buy this month. Its $4 million presale success, coupled with features like 90% APY staking rewards and a live P2E game, makes it a standout investment in the evolving meme coin market. While Bonk’s viral burn campaign and Sudeng’s long-term potential offer unique opportunities, BTFD’s combination of fun, innovation, and financial rewards makes it the clear leader. With a few presale stages left and the listing price set to climb, now is the perfect time to own the dip with BTFD Coin. Don’t miss out— join the bull run and secure your spot in one of the most promising meme coins on the market today.

37730182,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52316,1734380147,"Floki Inu Faces a Tough Month, BONE Breaks Out, and BTFD Coin Becomes the Star Among the Best Meme Coins to Buy This Weekend","The meme coin market is a rollercoaster ride, with fortunes shifting rapidly based on market sentiment and project developments. This weekend, three standout projects are capturing attention for very different reasons. Floki Inu (FLOKI) has faced a challenging month with a 9.47% dip, testing the loyalty of its strong community. On the flip side, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) has broken out with a 24.86% monthly surge, driven by renewed interest in the ShibaSwap ecosystem. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is making headlines as a rising star in the presale space, raising over $4 million and solidifying its status as one of the best meme coins to buy this weekend. Meme coins are no longer just about viral moments or celebrity endorsements. Many are evolving to include staking rewards, governance features, and even gaming ecosystems. BTFD Coin exemplifies this next wave of meme coins, with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and a vibrant community of over 5,600 holders. FLOKI, BONE, and BTFD Coin represent the dynamic nature of the meme coin market, each offering unique opportunities and challenges. BTFD Coin: The Perfect Dip to Own What if there was a meme coin that combined the fun of community-driven investing with serious returns? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin offers. Its tagline, “ Own the Dip ,” isn’t just catchy—it’s a call to action for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in a crowded market. BTFD’s presale performance has been nothing short of stellar. Starting at a price of $0.000004, it has now reached $0.00013 in its 12th stage, with over $4 million raised and 55 billion coins sold. With a total of 16 presale stages, there’s still time for investors to grab the coin before it lists at $0.0006. For example, a $3,000 investment at the current stage secures approximately 23.08 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at launch, that investment could grow to $13,848—a return of more than 4.6x. This is why BTFD Coin is making waves as one of the best meme coins to buy this weekend . Beyond the numbers, BTFD is building a unique ecosystem. Its beta version of a P2E game is already live, offering a glimpse of its potential. The 90% APY staking reward is another game-changer. That’s the kind of passive income that turns heads, especially for investors looking for financial freedom. BTFD also thrives on its community power, with over 5,600 holders rallying behind the project. Its engaging referral programme rewards users for spreading the word, further fuelling its rapid growth. As meme coins continue to evolve, BTFD is setting the standard for blending fun, functionality, and financial rewards. Floki Inu: A Tough Month but a Resilient Community Floki Inu (FLOKI), a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu and born out of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, has carved a niche for itself with its strong following. Trading at $0.0002278, FLOKI has faced a 9.47% dip in the past month, reflecting a tough period for the project. While FLOKI’s price has struggled, its ecosystem remains active. The coin’s utility as the core of the Floki Ecosystem, which includes FlokiFi Locker and the Valhalla P2E metaverse, gives it a foundation for growth. However, FLOKI’s technological advancements have been steady rather than revolutionary, putting it at a disadvantage compared to more innovative competitors. Still, FLOKI continues to appeal to meme coin enthusiasts. Its community-driven approach and strong branding keep it relevant in the market. For those who believe in the long-term potential of the Floki Ecosystem, this dip might represent a buying opportunity. Despite its challenges, FLOKI remains a contender among the best meme coins to buy this weekend, especially for investors who value community power and meme appeal. Bone ShibaSwap: Breaking Out with a 24% Surge Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), the governance token of the ShibaSwap decentralised exchange (DEX), has had an impressive month, surging by 24.86% to trade at $0.5988. Part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, BONE empowers the Shib Army by allowing holders to vote on proposals and access future NFTs. The recent price surge highlights renewed interest in the ShibaSwap platform. BONE’s utility as a reward token for staking SHIB and LEASH has attracted investors looking to benefit from the token’s governance and staking capabilities. The token’s 0.45% increase in the past day indicates steady demand, although its 10.36% drop over the past week suggests short-term volatility. BONE’s role as the “middle link” in the Shiba ecosystem underscores its importance. Its ability to connect various elements of the ecosystem and provide rewards makes it an attractive option for Shib Army members. As the ShibaSwap platform evolves, BONE’s value is likely to grow, cementing its place as one of the best meme coins for long-term believers in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting pick among the best meme coins to buy this weekend. Its $4 million presale success, combined with features like 90% APY staking rewards and a live beta P2E game, positions it as a leader in the evolving meme coin landscape. While BONE’s strong performance and FLOKI’s loyal community offer unique opportunities, BTFD’s blend of innovation, community power, and financial rewards makes it the star of the show. With only four presale stages left and the listing price set to jump, this is the perfect dip to invest in BTFD Coin. Don’t miss your chance to join the bull run and secure your position in one of the most promising meme coins on the market.

37729087,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628499,1734379805,"America’s strong economy makes high interest rates likely for 2025, but not in Europe","America’s booming economy is making high interest rates a sure bet for 2025. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing for steep cuts as its economic struggles deepen. The Federal Reserve’s policy divergence from the European Central Bank (ECB) is widening the interest rate gap, and the fallout is hitting hard, especially in global markets. This growing divide threatens President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to revive U.S. exports, while also stirring old tensions between Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The U.S. dollar has surged 5% against the euro this year. Market analysts expect this rate gap to jump past two percentage points in 2025, driving the dollar higher. Trump, notorious for his disdain for a strong dollar during his first term, may once again lash out at the Fed. The rate gap: A growing headache The disparity between the U.S. and Europe isn’t new. During Trump’s first presidency, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes widened the gap while the ECB kept rates below zero. He blamed the Fed for hurting trade, claiming high rates inflated the dollar. Now, both central banks are loosening policies, but Europe’s urgency far outweighs America’s. The ECB is cutting rates to boost its sluggish economy, which has been grappling with low growth since the pandemic. In contrast, America’s economic resilience has tempered expectations for Fed rate cuts. Strong consumer demand and energy independence are keeping the U.S. ahead. Fixed-rate mortgages have shielded homeowners, softening the impact of tighter monetary policy. “Europe is looking weaker by the day,” KPMG’s chief economist Diane Swonk said . The ECB is anxious to cut rates as the region faces a perfect storm of economic problems. Post-pandemic inflation and an energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine have hamstrung Europe. Dependence on Russian energy sources and slow recovery efforts are weighing on growth, putting Europe at a clear disadvantage. America’s strength complicates Trump’s trade plans America’s surprising economic strength is defying earlier predictions. Late last year, analysts expected U.S. growth to hover around 1% in 2024. Now, stronger-than-expected performance has forced them to recalibrate. By 2025, the Fed is expected to deliver fewer rate cuts than previously anticipated. This resilience comes with complications for Trump, who has pledged to slap tariffs on trade partners, including Europe and China. Higher tariffs could fuel inflation and force the Fed to maintain higher interest rates. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the dollar’s performance, has already climbed over 6% this year. The dollar’s strength makes U.S. goods less competitive abroad, which could derail Trump’s export ambitions. Unlike Europe, which has struggled to find footing since the pandemic, America has maintained a pace of growth above pre-COVID trends. Productivity in the U.S. has surged. Immigration post-pandemic has helped businesses meet consumer demand. But Trump’s vow to restrict immigration could disrupt these gains. The neutral interest rate — the level where monetary policy neither boosts nor slows the economy — has risen in the U.S. Analysts believe this structural shift will keep rates higher for longer. On Wall Street, some traders believe the dollar’s valuation has reached unsustainable levels. Predictions point to a weakening dollar later in 2025. But for now, the strong dollar is a double-edged sword. It hurts exports but cushions inflation shocks from tariffs. What’s next for interest rates? The Fed is expected to cut rates by just 0.25% this month. Markets anticipate only three rate cuts in 2025, while Europe could see substantially more. Trump’s policies could worsen this divide. His approach to tariffs may increase inflationary pressures, forcing the Fed to hold rates steady. Europe’s troubles make the ECB’s position more precarious. Its reliance on rate cuts to stabilize the economy contrasts with America’s ability to power through tight monetary conditions. Economists see little improvement for Europe in 2025. Growth prospects remain grim, with no major signs of recovery on the horizon. The ECB’s struggle is compounded by the energy crisis. Post-Ukraine war disruptions continue to weigh heavily on the region’s industrial output. In comparison, America’s energy independence has insulated it from similar shocks, giving the Fed more flexibility.

XRP XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month alone, it surged 212.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. However, the past week saw a downturn with a 7.32% decline, indicating short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. Traders are watching these levels closely, as movements could signal significant shifts in market sentiment. Ethereum Ethereum’s price has shown mixed movements recently. Over the past week, ETH has decreased by 2.68%. However, in the last month, it has climbed by 27.26%. Over the past six months, the price has increased by 10.87%. This indicates substantial growth over the longer term despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3643 and $4233. The 10-day simple moving average is $3873.26, and the 100-day SMA is $3883.85. The relative strength index stands at 55.00, suggesting neutral market sentiment. The stochastic oscillator is at 72.74, indicating that the asset is approaching overbought conditions. The MACD level is -1.149, which may signal a bearish trend. The nearest resistance level is at $4458. If ETH rises to this point from its current price, it would be an increase of about 13%. Breaking above this could lead to the second resistance at $5047, a rise of approximately 28%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3279, a decrease of about 17%. The second support level is at $2689, representing a drop of around 32%. These levels are important for traders watching for potential breakouts or reversals.

37728133,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313020,1734378684,Vana Mainnet Goes Live With VANA To Power Data as a New Asset Class in Global AI Economy,"December 16, 2024 – Georgetown, Cayman Islands During the testnet phase, over 1.3 million users contributed more than 6.5 million data points to train user-owned AI models. On mainnet, DataDAOs will leverage the VANA token to enable users to collectively own, monetize and govern their personal data for a stake in the booming AI economy. Vana , the pioneering network for user-owned data, today announced the launch of its mainnet and native VANA token. The launch marks a significant milestone in breaking through the data wall that’s limiting AI development while preserving privacy and giving users a stake in the value their data generates. Developed by Open Data Labs – a San Francisco-based research and technology company born out of the MIT Media Lab – the Vana network is an EVM-compatible blockchain that enables users to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing that data to be used for AI model training through privacy-preserving technologies. The mainnet launch follows Vana’s successful testnet phase, which saw over 1.3 million users contributing over 6.5 million data points to DataDAOs, processing approximately 1.7 million transactions daily. The testnet demonstrated that programmable data ownership is not just possible – but critical at this point in AI development, according to Anna Kazlauskas, CEO of Open Data Labs and inventor of Vana. Kazlauskas said, “Today’s mainnet launch marks a fundamental shift in how data is owned and monetized in the AI era. “Users have always legally owned their data, but platforms have captured all the economic value – and most users don’t even realize their data is legally theirs. “Vana lays the groundwork for a new kind of data economy – one where users can benefit from the AI models they help create and where developers can finally access the cross-platform datasets needed to build truly powerful AI. “Property rights were the foundation that enabled modern economies to flourish – and in today’s digital economy, programmable data rights are the foundation for the next generation of AI.” The key features of the Vana mainnet will include the following. Trustless validation through secure data ingress and trusted execution nodes Granular permissioning, allowing users complete control over their data usage Onchain data provenance tracking how contributed data is applied DLPs (data liquidity pools) enabling collective data pooling, governance and monetization via DataDAOs Proof-of-contribution mechanism ensuring fair rewards for data quality Staking VANA to DataDAOs through Data Hub With the network’s proof-of-contribution system, users can earn by contributing their data to DataDAOs – receiving dataset-specific tokens that grant governance rights while maintaining control over how their data are used. These data tokens can be traded for VANA, the network’s native currency. The top DataDAOs also receive DataDAO rewards . Beyond data contributions, users can earn additional tokens by running nodes, validating transactions and staking to DataDAOs. With a total supply of 120 million tokens, VANA will serve as the foundation for the network’s economic model, enabling the following. Governance over network parameters and data usage Staking to secure the network and validate data contributions Incentivization of high-quality data submissions from data contributors Revenue sharing from AI model development and data usage Among the DataDAOs building on Vana are DNA DAO, addressing privacy concerns around genetic data ownership, and an expansion of the successful Reddit Data DAO, which has already demonstrated the potential of community-owned data pools. Read more about DataDAOs on Vana here . The mainnet launch comes at a crucial time when AI development faces increasing data scarcity, while users seek greater control over their digital footprint. Vana’s solution enables individuals to participate in and benefit from the AI economy while maintaining sovereignty over their data. As AI hits a data wall and more platforms monetize user data without sharing any upside with users, users deserve to own a stake in the future of AI. Art Abal, CEO of Vana Foundation, said, “The current way we buy and sell private data in Web 2.0 is broken. Our data is extracted and held for ransom by a few platforms and data-brokers. “They decide how much our data is worth, and the technology it creates. No more. “This is just the beginning of a future where we can decide our data’s worth and decide what technology it creates. This is the data revolution.” Users can start staking VANA on Data Hub here . For more information, users can visit the website , read our documentation , follow us on X or launch a new DataDAO . About Vana Vana is the first decentralized network for user-owned data, unlocking data as a new digital asset class. The Vana network consists of an EVM-compatible blockchain, secure personal server environment and set of native contracts designed for the trustless and secure exchange of user-owned data via DataDAOs. The network empowers users to maintain control over their data while participating in the growing AI economy by pooling their data with others and earning rewards for their contributions.

37728348,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628473,1734378611,Former Friends star Lisa Kudrow criticizes Tom Hanks’ movie “Here” as an endorsement for AI,"Former Friends actress Lisa Kudrow has ridiculed Tom Hanks’ recent movie, “Here,” which uses AI, describing it as an endorsement for AI due to its de-aging technology, which made Hanks look decades younger. This comes as the use of AI in the arts and entertainment industry has divided opinion with some stakeholders calling the technology the deathbed of creativity and a blow to employees in the sector who risk losing jobs to the technology. Proponents of AI however feel it plays a complementary role and enhances creativity. Lisa Kudrow thinks the movie indicates the crisis the industry faces Tom Hanks’ movie , “Here,” makes extensive use of Metaphysic Live, an AI-driven tool that is used to de-age and face-swap actors. In a discussion on the implications of aging with Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast , Kudrow highlighted that the movie is an indication of the challenges the film industry faces. “They shot it, and they could actually shoot the scene and then look at the playback of them as younger, and it’s ready for them to see,” said Kudrow. “All I got from [the film] was, this is an endorsement for AI and oh, my God. It’s not like, ‘Oh, it’s going to ruin everything’, but what will be left? Forget actors, what about up-and-coming actors? They’ll just be licensing and recycling.” Kudrow. The movie, which was directed by Robert Zemeckis, reunites Hanks with his Forrest Gump co-star Robin Wright, as a married couple who are part of a series of characters occupying a single location whose history is told over time. The movie makes use of Metaphysic Live, driving derision from Kudrow. During the discussion, the former Friends star alludes to the near-simultaneous facility of AI tools to show the results via immediate playback. “Set that completely aside, what work will there be for human beings? Then what? There’ll be some kind of living stipend for people, [as] you won’t have to work? How can it possibly be enough?” questioned Kudrow. Metaphysic, the company behind Metaphysic Live announced in 2023 that it had agreed with CAA, a talent agency to “develop generative AI tools and services,” which Zemeckis endorsed. “Having tested every flavor of face replacement and de-aging technology available today, Metaphysic are clearly the global leader in feature-quality AI content,” said Zemeckis. Proponents of AI hail de-aging technology Production visual effects supervisor for the movie “Here,” Kevin Baillie hailed the de-aging AI-driven technology. “It is incredible to see Metaphysic’s AI-generated content flawlessly integrated into a shot live on set. The actors can even use the technology as a ‘youth mirror’ – testing out acting choices for their younger selves in real-time.” According to The Guardian, Metaphysic was previously responsible for the AI-generated replica of late actor Ian Holm that appeared in Alien: Romulus. However, the use of AI in the film industry has attracted attention, sparking debates among stakeholders from writers, actors, and behind-the-scenes crew. Fears over the unchecked use of AI technology were part of the reasons for protests by writers and actors. Protections were included as a critical element in the resolution for both writers and actors although complaints remain as to how strong these protections are against what Stranger star Matthew Modine described as “the AI tsunami crashing upon the shores of the entertainment industry.” Hanks himself made headlines in May last year after discussing how AI would make him continue acting even after his demise. “Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are by way of AI or deepfake technology. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but performances can go on and on and on and on.” Hanks. “Outside the understanding of AI and deepfake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me and me alone. And it’s going to have some degree of lifelike quality. That’s certainly an artistic challenge but it’s also a legal one,” added Hanks then. According to an earlier Variety report, “Here” is one of the 20 movies battling for one of the 10 spots on the Oscars shortlist for best visual effects. It is also one of the three movies that employed the de-aging or synthetic human effects with the help of AI-driven tools. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” has previously made the Oscars shortlist while having machine-learning technology as part of the process to de-aged Harrison Ford.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE.

The project originally said that 63% of all WLFI would be sold to the public, but according to its current whitepaper – or “goldpaper”– World Liberty Financial appears to have lowered that to 35%. With World Liberty Financial yet to publicly launch, it’s still not 100% clear what services the platform will provide. World Liberty Financial says it’s the “only DeFi platform inspired by Donald J. Trump” and aims to lead a “financial revolution by dismantling the stranglehold of traditional financial institutions and putting the power back where it belongs: in your hands.” Data from Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan shows that the TRON DAO received 2 billion tokens from its investment in WLFI, making Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun and the DAO the largest holders. With the purchase, Sun also became an advisor to the project.

According to a new announcement from the Arthur Hayes-backed crypto protocol, the new stablecoin, USDtb, will be Ethena’s second stablecoin offering, following the project’s flagship stablecoin USDe. USDtb differs from other stablecoins in that it will be backed by a fund backed by one of the world’s largest and most trusted asset managers, BlackRock. In October of this year, multiple reports tied BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with the idea of using BUIDL, the crypto asset related to the firm’s tokenized mutual fund, as collateral for trading derivatives contracts. BUIDL, which launched in March of this year, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token built on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain that offers “blue-chip” yields.

37727865,https://crypto.news/?p=14319957,1734378051,"DOGEN is gearing up for 25,000% returns, outshining XRP and DOGE gains","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DOGEN gains momentum as projections suggest 25,000% returns, surpassing XRP and Dogecoin’s performance. Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for alpha investors Dogecoin: The meme coin turning into a crypto contender XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for secure transactions Conclusion Anticipation is mounting around DOGEN , a rising star in the cryptocurrency world, with projections hinting at staggering returns of up to 25,000%. This potential leap could eclipse the impressive gains of established tokens like XRP and Dogecoin. What’s driving this enthusiastic outlook, and could DOGEN be poised to reshape the crypto landscape? DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for alpha investors Unlock inner alpha with DOGEN, the meme token crafted for those who demand success and refuse to settle. DOGEN embodies the winning lifestyle—luxury cars, financial freedom, and a bold attitude. This is the token for leaders, not followers. HODL like a champion, dominate the market DOGEN is set to soar, with a projected 700% presale growth—and that’s only the beginning. As meme tokens continue to dominate this altcoin season, DOGEN offers the chance for early adopters to secure massive returns. Join now, and lead the pack while others play catch-up. Missed the rise of WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the newest star in Solana’s meme token universe, following the meteoric success of BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Currently undervalued, DOGEN is positioned to rewrite the playbook for meme coin success in this bull run. A movement with real value DOGEN isn’t just hype—it’s a community-driven project designed for long-term success. With exclusive perks, exciting campaigns, and a laser-focused team, DOGEN is creating a powerful network of alpha investors who aim to dominate the market. Its multi-level referral program is unmatched: users earn 7% from every token their direct referrals buy, with even more rewards as their network grows. DOGEN offers not just profits but the chance to be part of a lasting movement. Dogecoin: The meme coin turning into a crypto contender Dogecoin (DOGE) , launched in 2013, is a cryptocurrency inspired by the Shiba Inu meme. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit and adds 10,000 new coins every minute. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative, it gained massive popularity in 2021. Social media influence, particularly from Elon Musk, propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin highlights the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its technology allows for fast transactions, and its active community continues to drive its relevance. The coin’s potential lies in its widespread acceptance and the enthusiasm of its supporters. XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for secure transactions XRP is a digital currency supported by the XRP Ledger. It offers fast, low-cost, and secure transactions without a central authority. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to develop the ecosystem further, placing 55 billion in escrow for controlled release. XRP enables seamless payment transfers across different currencies, making it a promising technology. Its decentralized nature and resistance to censorship or counterfeiting add to its appeal. Without the need for a bank account for settlements, XRP opens global financial access. These features contribute to its potential attractiveness in the current market cycle. Conclusion In the current bull run, established coins like DOGE and XRP show less short-term potential. DOGEN, crafted for those seeking luxury and success, is poised for 700% growth by the end of its presale, with the possibility of thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

37727715,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313010,1734377857,Eliza Labs and Stanford University’s FDCI To Explore AI Agents Impact on Digital Currency Systems,"December 16, 2024 – Palo Alto, California This partnership establishes the first AI x Web 3.0 lab at Stanford University’s ‘Future of Digital Currency Initiative.’ Stanford University’s FDCI (Future of Digital Currency Initiative) and Eliza Labs , creators of the open-source Eliza agent framework, today announced a groundbreaking research partnership to explore how autonomous AI agents will transform digital currency systems. The collaboration, set to begin in Q1 2025, brings together Stanford’s expertise in digital currency research with Eliza Labs’ cutting-edge capabilities in autonomous agent development. Leveraging Eliza Labs’ open-source Eliza framework for autonomous agent development, the partnership will tackle fundamental questions about how AI agents can establish trust, coordinate actions and make decisions within decentralized financial systems. This research comes at a critical moment as autonomous agents increasingly influence economic systems and financial services – with the Eliza framework providing a proven foundation for developing reliable and scalable agent-based systems. Professors Dan Boneh and David Mazières, who will oversee the research fellowship program, said, “This collaboration represents a unique opportunity to shape how AI agents will interact within digital economies. “By combining FDCI’s established infrastructure with Eliza Labs’ expertise in multi-agent systems, we’re positioning ourselves at the forefront of this transformative technology.” Shaw Walters, founder of Eliza Labs, said, “We are incredibly excited to partner with Stanford’s [FDCI] – one of the most prestigious programs for digital currency research – to explore how AI agents can reshape the future of financial systems. “Together, we’re combining Stanford’s academic rigor with our widely used Eliza AI agent framework to drive trust and governance in decentralized economies.” The research program will unfold across three phases throughout 2025, focusing on three core areas. Agent trust mechanisms – Developing new frameworks for how autonomous agents establish and verify trust within digital currency networks, building upon Eliza Labs’ existing agent trust architecture. Multi-agent economic systems – Investigating how agents interact and coordinate in economic contexts. Decentralized agent governance – Creating new protocols for managing autonomous agent communities. The initiative will produce open-source frameworks, simulation platforms and practical applications in automated market-making systems and decentralized financial services. Early-stage findings and developments will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and industry presentations. The partnership is actively seeking select industry collaborators, offering early access to emerging technologies and direct involvement in shaping research directions. For venture firms and blockchain infrastructure partners, this represents an opportunity to position themselves at the forefront of agent technology development while accessing emerging technical talent in the field. Research outcomes will include novel trust frameworks for autonomous agents, scalable multi-agent coordination protocols and formal models for agent governance in decentralized systems. These developments aim to establish foundational standards for agent interaction in digital economies. About Eliza Labs Eliza Labs is at the forefront of developing next-generation autonomous agent systems. Founded in 2024, Eliza Labs is the creator of the Eliza agent framework, an open-source platform designed to revolutionize the way autonomous AI agents are created, deployed and managed. The Eliza framework enables powerful multi-agent simulations, empowering developers, researchers and businesses to build advanced AI systems.

The Monad Foundation will oversee key activities to expand the protocol’s ecosystem. Its focus includes facilitating validator-led governance, supporting community-led improvement proposals, and providing resources such as developer documentation. Additionally, the Foundation will engage in ecosystem development, marketing, and advisory services to encourage the adoption of the Monad blockchain. There have been many rumors, but the forming of the foundation is leading to more speculation that a token launch is coming. Introducing the Monad Foundation.

Governance on decentralized blockchains often relies on validators, who make decisions about network upgrades or rule changes. The Monad Foundation’s involvement aims to make these processes transparent and community-driven. The Foundation’s leadership includes Keone Hon and Eunice Giarta. Several team members from Monad Labs, particularly those working in business development, ecosystem growth, community engagement, marketing, and developer relations, will transition to the Monad Foundation.

37727970,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628526,1734377439,Aave turns into the #1 app for total value locked after multi-chain expansion,"Aave (AAVE) turned into the decentralized app with the largest value locked after attention shifted to DeFi. The app added liquidity from a total of 13 chains, after expanding to some of the most active networks. Aave turned into the app with the most significant value locked in its lending vaults. The protocol grew through expansion on the most active networks, adding a total of 13 chains. The main store of value still depends on Ethereum. Aave V3 is still the most active version, but the protocol is close to the leading position for all its chains. Most notably, Aave V3 launched on Arbitrum and Optimism, which turned into some of its most active markets. Despite the legacy status of Polygon , there have been calls to abandon the chain and use other sources of liquidity. The vault structure of Aave allows it to carry $20.42B in total value locked. The lending app is only surpassed by LidoDAO, which depends on staked ETH. However, Aave is a more active manager of a wider portfolio of coins and tokens. The value locked on Aave reflects its balance of loans and collaterals. The app is also practically aggregating from all other DeFi pools while aiming to mitigate risk with overly conservative collaterals. The bull market from October onward was also immediately reflected in Aave’s monthly earnings. After a weak month in September, Aave posted more than $2.95M in October earnings, and $4.24M in November. In December to date, the app posted $2.85M in earnings. Aave grows after accepting a wider list of assets Due to its intuitive lending vaults, Aave surpassed both Maker and the new Sky Ecosystem, as well as Ethena, EtherFi, and other smaller passive income protocols. The value of Aave lies in accepting a wider selection of assets. From November onward, Aave onboarded a mix of coins and tokens, with a predominance of USDC. One of the new additions was USDS, the new Sky Ecosystem token. Aave continues to accept WETH and WBTC and even tested adding Ethena’s USDe as collateral. Aave also accepted KelpDAO’s rsETH , leading to an expansion of the supply. Some of the Aave lending pools are providing additional activity for liquid re-staking tokens. Aave expanded the inflows of a widening portfolio of assets, with a dominance of USDC and the addition of Ethena’s USDe. | Source: Dune Analytics As a result of Aave’s growth, the native AAVE token rallied from outside the top 100 of assets to the top 30. AAVE traded at $385.95, still expecting its short-term rally to $400. One of the milestones for AAVE is to repeat its all-time highs above $600, and then continue with price discovery. In the past months, Aave reconsidered its GHO mint and burn policy. The token, which rose to a supply above 180M, went through several burns and is back below 156M . Despite this, the rest of the Aave ecosystem is growing, with multiple purpose-built vaults. Aave is one of the main sources of passive income, accepting coins, tokens, and stablecoins from multiple ecosystems. Aave also gained exposure after being used to create a vault for Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial. The fund acquired a total of 6.13M AAVE, valued at $2.32M . Aave V4 creates additional buzz One of the growth drivers for Aave is the talk of V4, a new approach to vaults. Aave is also waiting for the full implementation of its Umbrella upgrades, which will include token buybacks and burns. Overall, searches for ‘Aave’ also increased in December, coinciding with the price rally. Aave V4 will introduce liquidity hubs, which will list a wider collection of assets. The DeFi app will also require a single smart account to interact with liquidity and pools on multiple chains. Most of the Aave V4 features may take years to build but are still adding to the hype in the short term. Aave V4 will aim to offer multiple lending strategies, either with regular crypto assets or with real-world tokenized assets (RWAs).

The focus of these discussions is on integrating these institutions with SDEX, SMARDEX’s utility token, which captures revenue for its holders with every update of the SMARDEX ecosystem. SDEX is a pivotal utility token within SMARDEX , designed to reward holders through a unique revenue-sharing model. This token benefits from the ecosystem’s growth, as every enhancement or update within SMARDEX generates revenue that is distributed among SDEX holders, providing an additional incentive for institutions to engage with the ecosystem. In January, SMARDEX.io plans to introduce USDN, its decentralized synthetic dollar. USDN aims to offer a stable, decentralized financial instrument that operates entirely on-chain, providing a transparent and secure alternative to traditional stablecoins for these financial entities. This move is expected to enhance the adoption of DeFi tools by offering a stable value with a revolutionary rebasing mechanism distributing yield directly in holders’ wallets. “This strategic partnerships are about more than just onboarding; it’s about redefining how traditional finance interacts with DeFi,” stated a SMARDEX spokesperson. “By integrating with SDEX and later with USDN, we’re setting the stage for a new financial paradigm where traditional institutions can leverage the benefits of decentralization.” These collaborations aim to not only increase the utility and demand for SDEX but also to introduce USDN as a practical tool for financial stability, opening up new avenues for asset management and investment in the DeFi space. For more information about SMARDEX, SDEX, and the upcoming USDN, please visit SMARDEX.io. About SMARDEX SMARDEX is pioneering the integration of traditional finance into DeFi with its innovative ecosystem. SDEX, its utility token, plays a central role by capturing and redistributing revenue, while the upcoming USDN will further solidify SMARDEX’s commitment to providing stable and decentralized financial solutions.

37727070,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374777,1734376553,Important Binance Trading Update Concerning Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and Other Meme Coins: Details,"TL;DR The exchange will increase collateral ratios for six altcoins, including PNUT, starting December 17. The squirrel-themed meme coin surged in value after its initial Binance listing and sparked widespread interest due to its backing from prominent people like Elon Musk. The Involved Assets The world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange will update the collateral ratio for numerous altcoins under Portfolio Margin from December 17 . The effort will be completed within approximately one hour and affect the following assets: Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), 1MBABYDOGE (1MBABYDOGE), Eigenlayer (EIGEN), Reserve Rights (RSR), Movement (MOVE), and Magic Eden (ME). The collateral ratios of the aforementioned tokens will be raised by 10% each. PNUT’s ratio will be increased from 35% to 45%, while all others will be lifted from 10% to 20%. “Collateral ratio will affect the Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR). Users should monitor uniMMR closely to avoid any potential liquidation or losses that may result from the change of collateral ratio,” the company warned. The collateral ratio represents the amount of assets required to secure a loan or maintain an open position. It is usually expressed as a percentage and compares the value of the collateral to the borrowed capital. A higher ratio provides greater assurance to the lender, increasing the chances of recovering funds even if the market heads south. Binance and PNUT The exchange initially embraced the squirrel-themed meme coin in mid-November, listing it with a seed tag. The move was one of the factors fueling a massive price increase for the asset. A few days later, the firm doubled down on its support, adding the trading pairs PNUT/BRL and PNUT/EUR to its Binance Spot program. To the uninitiated ones, Peanut the Squirrel saw the light of day at the start of November. It is inspired by a pet squirrel named Peanut, which reportedly bit a Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) worker during a seizure operation and was later euthanized to test for rabies. Its death sparked significant controversy, with many arguing that the action was unnecessary, as the animal had been living indoors for years without any signs of illness. Among the critics was Elon Musk, who called the move a “government overreach” and claimed that “Donald Trump would save the squirrels.” The huge interest in PNUT (along with other elements) drove a significant price surge, allowing some early investors to make millions by strategically timing their entries and exits.

Aave (AAVE) just surged 21%, solidifying its dominance in DeFi and reminding everyone why it’s still a heavyweight. Meanwhile, SUI hit a fresh all-time high, though analysts are tossing around some bearish vibes. These moves have investors scrambling to figure out which projects will crush it in January and deliver massive ROI. The buzzwords? Innovation, utility, and that all-important community backing. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) . This underdog isn’t just looking to compete—it’s here to solve the headaches that’ve held crypto back. Think clunky wallets, wild price swings, and payment systems that feel stuck in the stone age. At $0.0342 in its Presale Phase 13, with a mind-blowing 900% ROI on the table post-presale, Qubetics is turning heads. With over $6.8M raised and 347M tokens sold, this might just be your ticket to the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Your Crypto Wallet, Reimagined Here’s the thing about Qubetics: it’s not just another token—it’s a full-blown solution. Picture this: You’re at a local coffee shop, and your wallet converts your Ethereum to dollars faster than you can say “extra shot of espresso.” That’s the power of Qubetics’ smart contract conversion tech. It auto-swaps crypto to fiat at the point of sale, making crypto transactions seamless and shielding users from price volatility. But it’s not just for coffee runs. Let’s say you’re running a small business. With Qubetics’ integrations into Apple Pay, Google Pay, and even traditional banks, you can accept crypto payments as easily as a credit card. No middlemen, no massive fees. Cross-border transactions ? Practically instant. Whether you’re a freelancer working with clients abroad or a retailer shipping internationally, Qubetics has your back. And here’s the kicker: there’s no better time to jump in. At $0.0342 per token during Presale Phase 13, prices are set to rise 10% with each phase. After the presale wraps up, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25—a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics might just be your golden ticket. Aave (AAVE): The DeFi Powerhouse DeFi isn’t slowing down, and Aave’s proving why it’s still the top dog. With a 21% surge recently, AAVE is flexing its muscles and reminding everyone why it dominates the decentralized lending space. For those new to the game, Aave lets users lend and borrow crypto without needing to deal with middlemen or pesky paperwork. Just good old-fashioned peer-to-peer finance, powered by blockchain. What’s driving the hype right now? Aave’s been expanding its ecosystem, adding new features, and partnering with other big players in DeFi. Its recent Layer-2 expansion is making transactions cheaper and faster, which is a big deal for users who’ve been burned by high gas fees. Plus, with staking rewards and its governance token gaining traction, Aave’s cementing itself as a DeFi staple. But here’s the thing: Aave’s not just a tech play. It’s a confidence play. With institutional investors jumping in and retail traders doubling down, it’s clear the market sees Aave as a safe bet for steady gains. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, AAVE’s a solid choice for anyone who wants a piece of the DeFi action. SUI (SUI): The New Kid With Big Ambitions SUI’s making noise, and for good reason. This layer-1 blockchain just hit a historic high, capturing the attention of traders everywhere. Built for speed and scalability, SUI’s carving out its niche as the go-to platform for dApps and Web3 innovations. With transaction fees so low they might as well be free, SUI’s giving Ethereum and other giants a run for their money. Here’s where it gets interesting: SUI’s growth isn’t just hype. Its developer ecosystem is thriving, with new projects launching left and right. But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Analysts are warning about potential corrections after its recent surge, which could spook short-term traders. Still, for long-term believers, this dip might be the perfect entry point. Think of it like this: SUI’s the scrappy up-and-comer that’s out to prove itself. With its focus on real-world utility and a growing community, it’s got the potential to make big waves. If you’re eyeing the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, SUI’s one to keep on your radar—just don’t let the bearish chatter scare you off. The Final Word: Who Will Dominate December? So, who’s stealing the show this month? Honestly, all three contenders bring something unique to the table. Qubetics ($TICS) is solving real-world problems and offering jaw-dropping ROI potential. Aave (AAVE) is doubling down on its DeFi dominance, making it a safe and steady pick. And SUI? It’s the ambitious newcomer with a growing ecosystem and serious upside. But let’s keep it real: timing is everything. With Qubetics’ presale in full swing and prices set to rise, early investors stand to gain big. Aave’s steady climb makes it a no-brainer for those seeking stability, while SUI’s potential for long-term growth could make it a dark horse winner. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Aave (AAVE), and SUI (SUI) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t wait too long—January’s ROI leaders are already shaping up, and you’ll want to be ahead of the game.

As I write, three December airdrops have affirmed that thesis: the token prices of both Magic Eden’s ME and Remilia’s CULT dropped roughly 30% over the ten days after they debuted. Movement Network’s MOVE token, meanwhile, spiked briefly before dumping back to its issuance price. But we have seen one shining exception to the trend. On November 29, Hyperliquid, a decentralized exchange running on its own blockchain, decided to make me a liar. Their airdrop of 31% of their native token supply to users wasn’t just the largest ever , with a face value of $4.3 billion dollars. It also appears to have reached a community of real users who are committed to the ecosystem long-term: both the price of the HYPE token and the TVL locked in the DEX have skyrocketed since the airdrop. There are lots of reasons for this, starting with a great product with innovative features, and tokenomic design truly aligned at every turn towards benefitting users, rather than insiders. That was possible because Hyperliquid didn’t take huge outside capital from venture capitalists looking for short-term liquid gains. That enabled one of the purest launches we’ve seen in crypto since Bitcoin itself, from a team that clearly understands the biggest wins come when we’re all in it together.

Yet, court documents showed that 94% of creditors with claims against the crypto exchange voted “Yes” to the plan. This group comprises nearly $7 billion in claims, according to the reorganization plan. Bankruptcy administrator John J. Ray III commended his interim team for recovering about $16 billion in assets and cash for FTX creditors. Ray took over as CEO in late 2022, replacing Sam Bankman-Fried. Companies under the FTX umbrella, such as Alameda Research, also collapsed, and several of Bankman-Fried’s top associates signed plea deals with federal prosecutors in exchange for lighter sentences . By November 2023, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud. Under CEO Ray’s leadership, the defunct crypto exchange has worked to reconstruct the remnants of Bankman-Fried’s one-time crypto empire. For the past two years, our team of professionals have meticulously and efficiently worked to recover billions of dollars to reach this point. The Plan becoming effective in January 2025 and the start of distributions are reflections of the outstanding success of the recovery efforts. John J.

Data suggests that 5.8 billion previously idle DOGE tokens were recently moved. The surge comes after a sluggish week where the meme coin lost nearly 6%, missing out on Bitcoin’s recent gains. Increased token circulation and reduced exchange net flows suggest growing speculative activity and holding behavior among investors. Dogecoin sees increased investor activity Dogecoin price has spiked by 2% in the last 24 hours as Bitcoin records a 4% increase over the same period. According to CoinGecko, the meme coin is maintaining a 24-hour price range between $0.39 and $0.41. The rise comes after DOGE lost close to 6% in the past week despite Bitcoin’s stellar rally. What seems to be the positive trigger for Dogecoin price is increased token circulation over the past day. According to the Santiment chart shared by on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, 5.8 billion DOGE were added to circulation. 5.8 billion idle #Dogecoin $DOGE tokens have come to life, changing hands in the past 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/4gSkVhAAcO — Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2024 The millions of Dogecoin tokens were previously idle tokens that recently became active as they were transferred. This kind of movement, particularly from long-held tokens, can signal either profit-taking or repositioning by large holders or whales. Notably, as we see a spike in circulation alongside a price surge, it could also mean increased speculative activity. Dogecoin could join the Bitcoin price rally a little late We also looked at Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) to get more cues on its price movement. The RSI is in the neutral zone at press time, which means it is neither overbought nor oversold. Since November, the RSI has been moving downward from the overbought territory indicating that the price cooled off over the month. However, the RSI is now indicating a slight reversal upward, which could signal some buying momentum in the coming days. Coinglass data also reveal a holding behavior. DOGE/USD 1-day price chart The net exchange flows on December 16 is -$67.35 million, indicating more DOGE was withdrawn than deposited into exchanges. The negative net flows could also reduce the selling pressure or at least stabilize the price. Considering DOGE was not part of the $100K Bitcoin rally and did not experience a similar ripple effect on the meme coin price. Amid a sluggish DOGE price performance, co-creator Billy Markus defended DOGE’s original purpose.

Announced today, the highly anticipated upgrade introduces extensive technical improvements designed to reduce costs and attract more developers to the ecosystem. The update, also known as the Etna update, has been in development for months and includes seven key improvement proposals. These changes aim to reduce transaction fees, simplify validator processes, and improve the ability to create customized blockchains or subnets on Avalanche. “Avalanche9000 is a critical step in our mission to bring developers into the Avalanche ecosystem and enable them to build private blockchains using subnets,” Avalanche leaders previously said. Related News: BREAKING: Here are Date and Details on FTX Refunds That May Affect the Cryptocurrency Market Among the implemented recommendations, two stand out in terms of their potential impact: ACP-77: This introduces a new type of validator node that is cheaper to operate. The change is expected to lower the barrier for individuals and organizations to launch their own Avalanche-based subnets and encourage wider adoption of the blockchain’s infrastructure. ACP-125: This proposal significantly reduces the base fee on Avalanche’s C-chain, the network’s primary smart contract chain. The fee has been reduced from 25 nAVAX (approximately $0.00000098) to just 1 nAVAX ($0.00000004), making computation and interaction with smart contracts on the platform much more convenient. Avalanche operates three main chains: C-chain for smart contracts, P-chain for staking and validator transactions, and X-chain for transferring and receiving funds. The changes to C-chain are expected to increase its competitiveness as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The Avalanche Foundation hopes the update will attract developers to build on its platform and take advantage of the flexibility of subnetworks, which function as independent blockchains powered by Avalanche’s technology. Also called “Layer-1s,” the subnetworks allow developers to customize networks for specific applications, industries, or use cases. *This is not investment advice.

37726774,https://finbold.com/?p=220004,1734376019,2 cryptocurrencies to reach a $25 billion market cap in 2025,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a record high above $106,000 , driven by President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a surge in institutional demand. The global cryptocurrency market has rebounded sharply from its sluggish start to the month, as hotter-than-expected consumer inflation data fueled optimism for a third consecutive U.S. Fed rate cut. With the FOMC’s next decision scheduled for December 18, uncertainty lingers over inflationary pressures and the Federal Reserve’s path forward. Yet, amid this economic volatility, certain digital assets are showing strong momentum and positioning themselves to achieve the coveted $25 billion market cap milestone. Sui Network (SUI) Sui Network ( SUI ) currently holds a market cap of $13.9 billion, and to reach a $25 billion market cap, it would need an additional $11.1 billion in value, a target that appears increasingly achievable given its rapid growth and market momentum. SUI’s current market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The token has surged 521% year-to-date and 175% in Q4, consistently outperforming most altcoins. On-chain and derivatives data from CoinGlass further reinforce this bullish outlook. Sui’s derivatives trading volume soared 69.57% to $2.83 billion, while long/short ratios exceeding 1.4 on platforms like Binance and OKX reflect a strong bias toward long positions among traders. SUI derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass Additionally, open interest remains robust at $820 million, signaling sustained confidence from both retail and institutional investors. Ecosystem growth and partnerships Sui’s ecosystem expansion has been another critical driver of its performance. Recent partnerships with Franklin Templeton and Babylon Labs have unlocked Bitcoin liquidity and enhanced its DeFi and Web3 capabilities, attracting new participants to its network. Wallet integrations with Phantom and Backpack have further boosted accessibility and adoption, strengthening Sui’s position in the broader market. Analysts have pointed to Sui’s price action as mirroring Solana’s ( SOL ) 2021 breakout when SOL rallied from single digits to an all-time high of $259. Sui’s current consolidation after surpassing its March high resembles Solana’s pre-surge pattern, suggesting Sui could be on the verge of a similar parabolic move. Adding to the optimism, Bitcoin’s historic surge to $106,000 has lifted sentiment across the crypto market, funneling capital into high-performing assets like Su With strong technical momentum, increasing adoption, and Bitcoin’s rally providing a favorable market backdrop, Sui appears well-positioned to reach a $25 billion market cap by 2025. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Currently holding a market cap of $12.87 billion, Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) would need to add approximately $12 billion to hit the $25 billion mark, a target that appears increasingly achievable based on its strong technical outlook and rising market confidence. XLM’s current market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The weekly chart analysis reveals that XLM is nearing a critical breakout from its long-term downtrend that dates back to 2017. Historically, such breakouts have led to significant price surges, and with XLM already delivering a substantial gain from its low of $0.12, momentum is clearly shifting in favor of bulls. Stellar (1W) When I shared it at $0.12, we’ve now achieved 300% profit. 📈 Targets: 1️⃣ $1.20 2️⃣ $3 The technical outlook is completely positive. The real rally will start once the long-term downtrend from 2017 is broken. #XLM $XLM #Stellar #Ripple pic.twitter.com/w7qC31NPI5 — @CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) December 16, 2024 A confirmed breakout above this resistance could propel the price to $1.20 in the short term and as high as $3 in the longer term, following patterns seen in prior cycles. Derivatives data indicates a bullish dominance Further reinforcing this bullish trajectory, XLM’s derivatives data shows rising market interest. Trading volume surged 68.92% to $643.21M, and open interest climbed 3.52% to $219.44M, signaling growing commitments from traders. Long positions dominate across platforms like Binance and OKX, with long/short ratios of 2.11 and 1.41, respectively, indicating a strong market bias toward upward movement. Another critical factor for XLM’s growth is its correlation with Ripple ( XRP ), which has historically influenced Stellar’s performance. As Ripple gains traction with key developments like the RLUSD launch, a potential surge to $5 or beyond for XRP could serve as a major catalyst for XLM. With strong technical indicators and market catalysts aligning, Stellar has the potential to rebound above $1 and push toward a $25 billion market cap by 2025. That said, both Sui and Stellar are well-positioned to potentially achieve the $25 billion market cap milestone, fueled by robust ecosystem growth, strategic partnerships, and rising adoption across their respective networks. However, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, traders and investors must exercise caution, keeping a close eye on evolving trends, technical indicators, and key developments to navigate potential risks effectively.

At time of writing, BTC is trading above $107,000, up nearly 10% in the last week and over 150% year-to-date. President-elect Donald Trump, the first vocally pro-digital asset commander-in-chief of the US who has referred to himself as the “crypto president,” was spotted over the weekend accumulating several altcoins. According to data from crypto intelligence platform Arkham , the treasury for Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project, has acquired at least $50 million worth of crypto assets, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Chainlink ( LINK ) and Aave . Arkham’s data also shows that Donald Trump’s personal wallets currently hold over $12 million in altcoins, though most of it appears to be memecoins sent to him for promotional purposes. In an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Trump also appeared to still be open to the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. Said Trump, “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else… but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG told Reuters that Trump’s comments have likely foiled hopes for a correction in BTC. “We’re in blue sky territory here… The next figure the market will be looking for is $110,000. The pullback that a lot of people were waiting for just didn’t happen, because now we’ve got this news.” Pseudonymous crypto analyst TechDev shared a chart with his 489,000 followers on the social media platform X suggesting that Bitcoin is about halfway through a parabolic advance toward the $180,000 mark.

37726783,https://thecoinrise.com/uk-fca-unveils-discussion-paper-on-crypto-regulation/,1734375837,UK FCA Unveils Discussion Paper on Crypto Regulation,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom (U.K.) has taken an important step in the regulation of the growing crypto industry. The FCA has released a discussion paper on its proposed rules for cryptocurrencies. This action shows that the U.K. government wants to create a strong regulatory framework for digital assets. UK FCA to Prohibit Public Offers of Crypto In Potential Regulation One of the main ideas in the paper is to ban public sales of cryptocurrencies. This would mean that regular investors might only be able to buy most crypto assets if they meet certain exceptions. The FCA worries about the high risks of crypto investments, which often lack clarity and can be very unstable. As such, the regulator hopes to reduce the risks for everyday investors by implementing stricter rules. Meanwhile, the discussion paper asks industry stakeholders to share their views on important parts of the upcoming crypto regulations. Key topics include market rules and the disclosure requirements for crypto assets. It also addresses the need for a strong system to prevent market abuse. Notably, the FCA’s approach shows a global trend toward stricter rules for cryptocurrency. Some people in the industry might think these changes are too limiting, others believe they are important for making the sector more trustworthy and for gaining the confidence of both institutional and retail investors. Stablecoin and Staking Regulation in the UK In November, the United Kingdom announced its plans to introduce new rules for the cryptocurrency industry by early next year. The FCA also plans to complete its crypto regulation rules by 2026. This step aims to help the UK keep up with other countries in the digital asset market . As reported by TheCoinRise, Tulip Siddiq, the U.K.’s economic secretary to the Treasury, shared the government plans for the cryptocurrency market. Siddiq stated that the new rules will focus on important areas like stablecoin and staking services. Notably, the proposed framework will support the UK’s goal of encouraging innovation. Also, the introduction of this legislation is expected to have a significant impact on the country. Companies operating in crypto will adapt to the new rules and ensure compliance to continue their operations. This may involve revising business practices and implementing new security measures.

While Bitcoin has created a new peak above $106,000 earlier today, Ethereum’s price still sits below $4,000 with a current trading price of $3,943, marking a modest 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. However, despite this slow pace, some analysts see signs of strength and potential growth for Ethereum in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Battles Bearish Retail Sentiment Amid Surging ETF Demand Retest Before The Major Rally One notable analyst, CryptoBullet, shared his insights on X, drawing comparisons between the current market environment and Ethereum’s January 2021 rally. “Second consecutive weekly candle closed above the resistance,” the analyst observed. “The shape of the candle and overall environment reminds me of January 2021. We might wick to $3,700 this week, but it will be bought back up quickly. Don’t ignore this ETH strength.” CryptoBulllet further emphasized that Ethereum’s ability to hold its position above key resistance levels is a strong indicator of bullish momentum, suggesting that a significant price movement could be on the horizon. $ETH 1W update Second consecutive weekly candle closed above the Resistance 👌😁 The shape of the candle and overall environment reminds me of January 2021 We might wick to $3700 this week but it will be bought back up quickly 📈 Don’t ignore this #ETH strength! https://t.co/rIamWMSAb6 pic.twitter.com/29bs5aTUd3 — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) December 16, 2024 Titan of Crypto, another renowned analyst in the community echoed this optimism, noting Ethereum’s highest weekly candle close since 2021 as a major milestone. “Ethereum New ATH Incoming. ETH just achieved its highest weekly candle close since 2021, a major milestone,” he wrote. “A successful retest could propel it to its previous ATH and beyond.” These observations indicate growing confidence among market participants that Ethereum could soon reclaim its all-time high of $4,878, last achieved in November 2021. Ethereum Traders Faces Liquidation Despite these bullish projections, Ethereum’s recent price action has not been favorable for all market participants. According to data from Coinglass, 123,021 traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours, resulting in a total of $396.41 million in liquidations across the crypto market. Ethereum accounted for approximately $53.12 million of these liquidations, with long positions taking the larger hit at $28.4 million, while short positions saw liquidations worth $24.69 million. Notably, liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to insufficient funds to cover losses. In the case of Ethereum, the higher volume of liquidations, particularly among long positions, reflects a level of over-leverage among traders betting on the asset’s upward momentum.

37727165,https://blockworks.co/news/aave-governance-mulls-polygon-exit,1734375600,Aave governance mulls an exit from Polygon,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Aave wants to break up with Polygon, while Lido already has . Four days ago, a governance proposal floated the possibility of bridging $1.3 billion worth of idle stablecoins on the Polygon PoS bridge toward Aave’s lending competitor Morpho. The stablecoins would then be rehypothecated onto protocols like Sky, Angle and Robert Leshner’s Superstate. This “Blast-like” strategy would unlock an estimated $70 million in annual yield for “ecosystem incentives” that Polygon is currently leaving on the sidewalk. I say Blast-like because unlike the Blast L2, Polygon users would actually have to trust a bridge, plus they wouldn’t benefit from any yield rewards (at least not directly). In response, Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) founder Marc Zeller published seven hours ago a rather aggressive governance proposal seeking to adjust the risk parameters loan-to-value (LTV) for all assets on Aave Polygon, to 0%. The reason for the breakup? Zeller cites reasons of risk involved with “bridge vulnerabilities,” invoking a list of historical bridge hacks such as Ronin , BNB bridge , Wormhole and more. Zeller’s proposal would also adjust the reserve factor for all Aave assets to 85% to disincentivize deposits, cancel its upcoming Umbrella safety module deployment, migrate Aave’s v3 governance to another L2 chain, and freeze all its reserves on Polygon. Above all, the proposal seeks to create a co-incentive program with other L2 chains, making it attractive for Aave users on Polygon to migrate liquidity elsewhere (perhaps the Avalanche C-Chain ?). Suffice to say, this would in effect kill the existence of Aave on Polygon, which is currently the top protocol by TVL ( $662 million ) on the sidechain. From Aave’s perspective, Polygon’s revenues are pocket change. On a month-to-date basis, Polygon’s revenues to Aave account for a mere 3.8% ($305k) of its total revenues. The million-dollar question here is: How would Aave have responded had Polygon chosen to deploy its bridged stablecoins to aUSDC on Aave? “The Polygon community has only put forth a pre-PIP (preliminary proposal) at this stage, and the topic is still in the very early phases of discussion,” a Polygon spokesperson told Blockworks. “Getting feedback from all stakeholders is essential, and we encourage continued conversation to ensure these proposals are fully discussed and evaluated.” Updated Dec. 16, 2024 at 3:10 pm ET: Added statement from Polygon.

Ray III, Chief Executive Officer of the FTX Debtors noted: “For the past two years, our team of professionals have meticulously and efficiently worked to recover billions of dollars to reach this point.” “The Plan becoming effective in January 2025 and the start of distributions are reflections of the outstanding success of the recovery efforts. We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors, and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner,” he added. Kraken and BitGo To Assist In Recoveries FTX also disclosed that it has entered into agreements with two companies to assist in distributing recoveries to both retail and institutional customers and other creditors in supported jurisdictions. The crypto exchanges Kraken and BitGo will facilitate recoveries to eligible creditors. Customers and creditors with allowed claims will receive payments either in cash or stablecoins, depending on individual preferences and jurisdictional guidelines. Notably, Kraken has previously assisted in similar cases, including creditor payouts related to the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. Kraken expressed, “We are proud to support this distribution process, leveraging our experience in asset recovery and distribution.” BitGo emphasized its commitment to security in handling assets during the repayment process.

Token holding can grow small investments into millions if the crypto appreciates over time. In one example, a Bitcoin investor bought $3000 worth of BTC at US 15 cents in 2010 , held and sold the crypto three years later at over $800 a token making millions. Holding AAVE, MAD, and Monsta Mash (MASH) could yield similar results in a few years. Let's deep dive into the potential long-term rewards for each of the three cryptos. Monsta Mash ($MASH) Monsta Mash could be the best thing that happens to some crypto investors, presenting a second chance to buyers who missed big opportunities like BTC and ETH. As a new project, the value of tokens bought at a low presale price will appreciate over time, offsetting the impacts of fluctuating prices. The potential for long-term growth for $MASH tokens is tied to its use case scenario, low entry price, and external conditions like a favorable market environment. $MASH is the utility token that manages transactions and services in The Cryptids-Monsta Mash gaming system. The expansion of the gaming platform will directly impact the demand and therefore price of $MASH tokens. At a presale price of $0.0018 and a growing demand in the virtual gaming arena, the price of $MASH is expected to rise with a $2 bull’s eye in 2025. In the right market conditions, $MASH could be valued at $5 in 2026 and reach $20 before 2030. The first price increase will take effect in phase three of the live presale when tokens start selling for $0.00365. The rising number of whale investors accumulating $MASH tokens at the current price testifies to the high confidence in its foreseeable gains. A significant part of phase two has gone to large wallets, by this time 67% is sold out and the remaining portion is selling quickly. To sweeten the deal, long positions benefit from the high interest offered by the Mash Yields staking platform . Staked tokens will earn passive gains at 8% to 19% APY. The new Community Game Adventure Cryptids Adventure 2 Bot , brought a new buzz after it went live on Monday. Winners take home $1,000 USDT, $500 USDT, or $250 USDT. Grab the opportunity for massive ROI with $MASH AAVE & MAD AAVE has grown rapidly in the past month gaining 126.7%, a recent parabolic growth sent its price to $391 today from $200 at the beginning of the month. Its 30.20% weekly gains outperformed the global market which is down 1.5%. On-chain metrics signal rising whale accumulation, a common sign of crypto bracing for long-term investments. Its increased TVL and active addresses have also grown showing a stirred-up market. MAD slightly pulled back after setting a new att-time high of $0.00007062 on November 22nd. The crypto has traded in the narrow range between $0.00005 and $0.00006 in the last 4 days. Although the daily price has dropped by 6.7%, MAN has outperformed its peers with a monthly growth of 424.0%. Analysis by Coindex projects that MAD will reach a high price of $0.00017 by December 31 and possibly $ 0.000242 in 2025 if the ongoing parabolic trend holds. The buying pressure is up as the fear and greed index indicates extreme greed at 83 Conclusion For AAVE, MAD, and $MASH, the buying pressure is up as the coins present a bullish outlook. Whale accumulation, an indicator of pending rallies and long-term holding has increased for the three cryptos. Monsta Mash presale shows a buying rush and increased whale activity. The fast-expanding virtual gaming industry will likely see Monsta Mash receive massive adoption. Investors who hold their positions longer might cash in rewards of over 2000X by 2026.

According to the developers, this stablecoin is designed to complement the protocol’s platform’s native stablecoin, the USDe token, and balance its performance in bearish crypto market conditions. USDtb is pegged to the US dollar and holds 90% of its reserves in BUIDL, a tokenized money market fund issued by asset management giant BlackRock in partnership with Securitize. Ethena founder Guy Young highlighted the innovation behind USDtb, saying: “Given the rapidly growing demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to offer users a new product that offered a completely different risk profile to USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem.” Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces New Altcoin Listing During Massive Bull Rally Ethena has attracted nearly $6 billion in user funding since going public earlier this year. The company’s native token, USDe, maintains its $1 price by implementing what it describes as a unique investment strategy: shorting perpetual swaps on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) while increasing funding rates. This approach has yielded impressive returns during bull markets (currently 27% annually), but has struggled in bearish conditions due to persistently negative funding rates. To address these risks, USDtb will serve as a balancing mechanism. During periods when funding rates are negative, Ethena will close underlying derivative positions in USDe and redirect assets to USDtb to mitigate losses. The team also plans to position USDtb as collateral for margin trading on centralized exchanges in the future. *This is not investment advice.

37725398,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374768,1734373305,Ripple CTO David Schwartz Warns Against RLUSD FOMO Amid Launch Speculation,"The stablecoin market has experienced remarkable growth in 2024, driven by rising cryptocurrency adoption and a surge in institutional participation. All eyes are now on Ripple’s newly approved stablecoin, Ripple USD, a.k.a. RLUSD. But Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, addressed concerns over potential price anomalies for the asset as it prepares to launch. Speculative Hype Around RLUSD Unnecessary In a detailed statement on X, Schwartz explained that while Ripple USD (RLUSD) is designed to maintain a stable $1 peg, there could be temporary price fluctuations due to supply shortages during the initial launch phase. His comments were prompted by reports of RLUSD displaying an exorbitant price of $1,200 per unit on the Xaman trading platform, which stirred concerns within the crypto community. Schwartz clarified that such inflated prices likely stem from speculative behavior or individuals seeking the “honor” of acquiring the first fraction of RLUSD on decentralized exchanges. However, he stated that these aberrations are unsustainable and will likely be corrected quickly by arbitrage activities, restoring the stablecoin to its intended $1 value. The exec urged potential buyers to avoid succumbing to FOMO’s warning that RLUSD is not a speculative opportunity but a tool for stability in cross-border payments. He stressed that the essence of a stablecoin is price stability, and any deviations from the peg, especially at launch, should not be misinterpreted as lasting trends. “Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that RLUSD received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and would soon debut, primarily targeting institutional players. RLUSD will play a crucial role in Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions, working alongside XRP to enhance liquidity and efficiency for global transactions. New Players in Stablecoin Space With a total market value of $211 billion, the stablecoin market is rapidly expanding as adoption grows. The San Francisco-based company is entering a space dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, which have market caps exceeding $140 billion and $42 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Ripple, however, sees an opportunity in the competition as it looks to position itself as a credible player capable of carving out market share. Schwartz, for one, had earlier predicted the stablecoin sector could exceed $2 trillion in value by 2028. The market’s potential has also attracted major fintech players like PayPal and Robinhood .

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

Retardio, a viral Solana ( SOL ) meme coin project, may be providing or promoting financial services without regulatory permission, the FCA announced in a Dec. 16 update. Engaging with the meme coin disqualifies investors from using the Financial Ombudsman Service, the FCA’s complaint resolution channel. Retardio buyers are also excluded from protections offered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. “This means it’s unlikely you’d get your money back if the firm goes out of business,” according to the FCA notice.

In just weeks, his investment has gained 50%, and now he plans to buy a few hundred dollars every month if the price continues to rise. Johnson’s story isn’t unique. First-time buyers are piling into the market, drawn by the hype and the fear of missing out. Across the Atlantic, Mikko Rintala, a 50-year-old software engineer in Finland, took a different approach. “ I don’t like Trump ,” Rintala said, “ but I figured his win would shake up the economy. Bitcoin felt like a hedge against that. ” Rintala invested $1,000 in Bitcoin and Ripple, calling it his “ lottery ticket ” against economic uncertainty. Trump’s influence on crypto goes beyond promises. His close ties with Elon Musk—known for his ability to swing crypto prices with a single tweet—have also added fuel to Bitcoin’s fire. Crypto bulls are betting that Elon’s support, paired with Trump’s policies, will keep the momentum alive. For four years at least. Mainstream adoption fuels the rally Years of skepticism have eroded as institutional adoption grows, and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit the market. November was a record-breaking month, with U.S.-based crypto ETFs pulling in $7.2 billion. Hank Martinez, a 43-year-old tech worker in California, was one such skeptic. “ I used to tell my family that crypto was a scam ,” Martinez said. “B ut then I kept hearing about it during the election, and Trump’s talk of a ‘crypto czar’ made me rethink .” Martinez started small, Googling whether he could buy a fraction of Bitcoin. After opening a Crypto.com account, he’s now watching his investment grow and laughing at his own doubts. “ I’m all in now ,” he said. The frenzy isn’t just limited to tech workers or software engineers. It’s trickling into unexpected demographics. Bob Candelaria, a 44-year-old truck driver from Nashville, was inspired to invest after seeing UFC fighter Jon Jones wearing a Crypto.com shirt. “ If Jon Jones can rep crypto, why not me? ” Candelaria said. He spent a few hundred dollars on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, and now he studies crypto trends between his trucking routes. “ If you can breathe, you can buy crypto, ” he said. Crypto.com has become a favorite platform for new investors, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s surge and making the buying process seamless. This accessibility is pulling in people who previously thought crypto was too complicated or risky. According to the Pew Research Center, 17% of Americans now own some form of cryptocurrency, with younger men leading the charge. Bitcoin’s rollercoaster reputation hasn’t scared off new buyers though. Its comeback from scandals like the FTX collapse and the bear market during the 2020 pandemic has convinced many that Bitcoin really is here to stay.

37725304,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-dissent-decentralization-debate,1734372000,"Ethereum’s culture clash: Dissent, decentralization and progress","This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The Ethereum community is at a cultural crossroads as heated reactions to prominent contributor Max Resnick’s departure reveal deeper tensions around governance and dissent. Resnick’s critiques of Ethereum’s governance and scalability approach drew overwhelmingly negative reactions, including accusations of being a “Solana plant” and other ad hominem attacks. These responses highlight broader issues in Ethereum’s social layer and decision-making processes. Maximalism in Ethereum Ethereum maximalism has begun to mirror some of the less constructive traits of Bitcoin maximalism. Arguments abound that dissent is increasingly silenced, with critics labeled as outsiders or opponents. Resnick’s critiques, while highlighting real challenges, were met with hostility. His communication style, often perceived as antagonistic, alienated key contributors. Some in the community view his departure as a net positive, reinforcing shared values and emphasizing that dissent must be constructive to avoid divisiveness. This dynamic isn’t unique to Resnick. Figures like Jon Charbonneau have also challenged the idea of decentralization as an abstract ideal , arguing it can stifle productive debate in practice. In his “Ethereum’s North Star” blog post, Charbonneau wrote, “If decentralization is the only goal, then why not decrease the block gas limit, lower the blob count and increase the slot times? Too often, shouting ‘aha that’s sacrificing decentralization!’ is just used to shut down fruitful debate.” Charbonneau emphasized the need for Ethereum to define its unique purpose. He urged the community to align on long-term principles and avoid decision-making driven by short-term dynamics. The social layer: Strength or weakness? Ethereum’s reliance on social consensus has long been celebrated as a decentralized alternative to formal governance. However, this approach has drawbacks. Decision-making often appears dominated by loud, influential voices on platforms like Twitter, even if Ethereum’s core development process operates transparently and engages diverse stakeholders. Core developers follow a consensus-driven process, building in public to ensure decisions reflect broad input. This process resists formal capture, but risks stagnation if dissenting voices are excluded. Resnick contributed regularly to Eth Research, sharing insights on scalability and governance, but he did not participate in ACD calls or engage significantly on Ethereum Magicians. Lessons from Bitcoin Bitcoin’s rise, including its run to $100k , was not driven solely by maximalism. It stemmed from sustained advocacy efforts that engaged governments, institutions and the public to build a strong socioeconomic narrative. By contrast, Ethereum has largely avoided real-world advocacy, focusing instead on maintaining its decentralized ethos. Ethereum’s future depends on balancing conviction and inclusivity. The community must recognize that technical progress alone is insufficient — a robust cultural foundation is equally critical. Purity tests and unchecked maximalism risk stifling innovation and debate, making it essential to introduce mechanisms that foster open dialogue without compromising decentralization. Ethereum’s greatest strength lies in its adaptability. By addressing cultural challenges head-on, the community can retain valuable contributors and ensure Ethereum’s leadership as a decentralized, inclusive ecosystem.

The funding milestone comes just a week after the presale went live. Source: Lightchain AI channel on Telegram According to the Litechain AI website , The company aims to address the growing demand for scalable and decentralized AI systems as reliance on AI models increases. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization, Lightchain AI seeks to offer a solution that improves scalability, privacy, and fairness in AI development. Decentralized AI and Core Innovations Lightchain AI’s infrastructure relies on three key innovations: Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) Transparent AI Framework The PoI consensus model uses AI to validate transactions, assigning modular tasks—such as training machine learning models or running inference operations—to participating nodes based on their computational power. Nodes are rewarded with LCAI tokens for their contributions, with cryptographic proofs ensuring accuracy without exposing sensitive data. The AIVM allows developers to deploy AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain, integrating advanced computational capabilities to create data-driven applications. Meanwhile, the Transparent AI Framework ensures that AI decisions can be audited and explained, promoting trust and accountability. Lightchain AI’s platform aims to overcome challenges like scalability, energy efficiency, and data privacy while enabling AI applications to solve real-world problems securely and transparently. Presale Progress and Next Steps The presale for Lightchain AI’s native token, LCAI , is in its sixth stage. At this stage, the token is priced at $0.003, with the price set to increase to $0.003375 in the next phase.

37724594,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312945,1734371715,"Singapore Leading World in Crypto Adoption, With 40% of Investors Holding Digital Assets: Report","The richest country in Southeast Asia has reportedly become the global leader in crypto adoption. Citing data from consultancy Henley & Partners, Bloomberg reports that Singapore is beating all other countries in embracing cryptocurrencies with the necessary infrastructure and rules the nation built for the digital asset industry. Singapore now has about 30 payments firms, including US-based Coinbase and Ripple and Hong Kong-based Futu that are licensed to provide digital token services by the central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which is also experimenting with a digital Singapore dollar. The city-state is also implementing tax incentive schemes for crypto while other Asian nations, including powerhouses China and India, are moving slowly out of the abundance of caution. Bloomberg says the Gen-Z and Baby Boomers also increasingly accept that crypto transactions can become mainstream following the US approval of crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The result of the crypto exchange Independent Reserve’s survey earlier this year likewise shows that about 40% of Singaporean investors own crypto. The report says Singapore will likely benefit from its bet on digital assets as Donald Trump’s successful bid to return to the White House promises an era that will support the crypto rally. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) breached the six-digit mark following Trump’s win in the November presidential election. Bitcoin is trading for $105,281 at time of writing.

FTX and its affiliated debtors announced that their Chapter 11 Reorganization Plan, approved by the Court, will become effective on January 3, 2025. This date is also the record date for the Initial Distribution to permitted claimants in the Eligible Classes of the Plan. The first distribution is expected to occur within 60 days of the plan’s launch, while participation will be contingent on meeting know-your-customer (KYC) and other distribution requirements. John J.

The fact that the plan will go into effect in January 2025 and distributions will begin is a reflection of the extraordinary success of the recovery efforts,” he said. Ray encouraged beneficiaries to complete the necessary steps to ensure they receive their distributions on time. FTX has partnered with two established cryptocurrency service providers to streamline the distribution process: BitGo: A globally regulated custodian that has been providing institutional-grade trading, clearing, and custody services since 2013.

To ensure clients receive funds when distribution starts, they can complete the necessary steps through FTX Debtors’ Customer Portal ( https://claims.ftx.com ) and select “Kraken.” We were founded over 13 years ago based on the belief that for crypto to flourish it was imperative to build an exchange people can trust. This was prompted by our founder Jesse Powell’s experience helping Mt. Gox recover from a hack in 2011. The lack of controls and security standards witnessed prompted him to co-found crypto’s first truly secure and professional exchange. Ever since, security and client service have been the cornerstones of everything we do. We have a long track record of setting industry standards and demonstrating industry leadership by volunteering our resources to recover lost funds. To prove we back client account holdings with in-kind, fully reserved assets, we pioneered the Proof of Reserves process in 2014 and have committed to undertaking it regularly since January 2022.

37724201,https://finbold.com/?p=219993,1734370910,"‘Prepare your exit strategy,’ warns crypto trader as ‘we are close to the top’","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) is back surging above the $100,000 mark and altcoins consolidate above strong support levels, a crypto trader has warned his followers that the market’s top is close and urges people to prepare their exit strategy. Bitcoin made a new all-time high this Monday, attracting more retail investors with the fear of missing out ( FOMO ). However, as retail starts increasing its BTC exposure, savvy traders and investors prepare their exit strategy as the top approaches. In particular, the 356,000-follower trading and investing X persona, cevo , sent a warning to his followers on December 16. “We are close to the top, he said in a controversial post that later received other comments. “The most gains with alts will be realized in this last phase. Prepare your exit strategy,” cevo concluded. Other crypto analysts and commentators jumped in the thread, most disagreeing with the investor who then defended his stance. “When I said to prepare for the altseason, I got the same stupid comments because it was too early to buy it could go down much more. You need to have a plan or you’ll become a community member. Either way I’m not planning to spend another bear market with you guys” – cevo Bitcoin (BTC) price analysis and exit strategy As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,800, a record high for the leading cryptocurrency, amid bullish speculations. With this recent price action, BTC is up 146% year-to-date and 17.81% in the last 30 days. Bitcoin (BTC) year-to-date and monthly price chart. Source: Finbold Interestingly, as Finbold reported, this is just $23,200 below the exit strategy a Bitcoin trader shared on May 26. According to Wolf , $130,000 per BTC marks a key level for his exit strategy, and he is planning to start selling to retail at these prices. From the current $106,800, this represents a 21% remaining surge, waiting to trigger the plan shared seven months ago. Notably, Bitcoin was trading at $67,770 by Wolf ’s posting time, representing a 100% potential gain for the position trader. Exit strategy for altcoin traders Meanwhile, altcoins may offer a better growth potential from this point, as cevo highlighted in his warning. According to him, altcoins will print the most significant gains in the last phase of the bull cycle. If his analysis is correct, this last phase could happen soon as the crypto market nears its top. Nevertheless, many analysts seem to disagree with cevo , still foreseeing more upside potential for “utility altcoins.” Alex Svanevik, for example, believes we are about to enter the “ mother of all bull markets ” in 2025. Another one, Alex Becker, predicts solid “utility altcoins” could “ easily and surely ” do from ten to 30-fold returns this cycle. All things considered, crypto traders should indeed have a well structured and planned exit strategy for when the time comes. Starting to realize profits at relevant gains is crucial while speculating in this unpredictable market. Yet, it should be done cautiously and without selling everything at once, to navigate any further surge. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Just recently, Trump in an interview with CNBC revealed plans of ‘doing something great with crypto’ while he also emphasized on leading the domain, leaving behind countries like China. When asked if he plans to build a crypto reserve similar to oil reserves, Trump said: “Yeah, I think so”. Notably, China, UK, Bhutan and El Salvador are the other countries with a significant amount of bitcoins. Other countries have also been considering cryptocurrency strategic reserves. Countries Exploring Alternatives Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin had stated that the U.S. is weakening the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency by using it for political purposes, leading many countries to seek alternatives like cryptocurrencies. There are critics as well, as Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone shared “I think we still need to be cautious on a BTC strategic reserve, and at least consider that this is not likely to happen anytime soon.” Bitcoin has surged more than 50% since the Nov. 5 election that saw a pro-crypto victory. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion. Trump has also nominated the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to head the SEC. Bitcoin Hits Another Milestone! Bitcoin has hit another massive milestone in its splendid Q4, 2024, rally as its Energy Value metric has hit $100,000. Bitcoin Energy Value SMA jumped today to almost $100,500. Raw metric for the chart almost hit $105,000, as demonstrated by Edwards. Capriole Investments’ Charles Edwards had predicted Bitcoin Energy Value to reach $100,000 by 2025 back in early March 2020. Besides, Investors are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates this week during its two-day policy meeting, which will conclude Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool currently forecasts a 96% chance of a 25-basis-point cut. That would likely be bullish for the Bitcoin price.

37724061,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374803,1734370696,Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late,"TL;DR Analysts forecast a potential rally for XRP, with price targets ranging from $2.72 to $8.76. Conversely, key metrics, including active accounts and transactions, have declined, signaling reduced network activity and potential demand, which could hinder XRP’s upward momentum. Where Is XRP Headed Next? The cryptocurrency market has been booming in the past month, with Ripple’s XRP among the top performers. Its price exploded by approximately 120% for that period, briefly becoming the third-biggest digital asset. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko In the past few weeks, though, XRP experienced severe volatility, with its valuation plunging below $2 and later spiking above $2.50. Currently, it is worth around $2.36, which represents a 2.5% decline on a 24-hour scale. Numerous market observers think XRP could be poised for another major rally soon. The X user JAVON MARKS predicted a potential price explosion based on the asset’s performance on a 4-hour scale. Dark Defender chipped in on December 15, analyzing the same time frame. The strategist highlighted the price push above $2.50, maintaining that the asset might be headed to $2.72. Additionally, Dark Defender set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets, outlining $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as major support zones. X user Bark made a bullish forecast, too, seeing XRP jumping to a new all-time high of $5. Such a spike would require the token’s market cap to cross $265 billion. A few months ago, an increase of that type seemed unlikely given the fact that XRP was worth less than $0.60, while its capitalization stood at around $30 billion. However, things look quite different now, and we have yet to see whether the bull run will continue in the near future . XRP Metrics on a Downfall Despite the optimistic predictions, some important indicators suggest that the bulls may take a blow soon. The latest data shows that the number of XRP payments from one account to another, active accounts, executed XRP transactions, and newly activated accounts have sharply declined in the past 24 hours. Fewer users joining the ecosystem can lead to reduced buying pressure, potentially lowering the demand for the asset and negatively affecting its price. Additionally, a decrease in executed transactions indicates lower utility for XRP. This reduction in activity might discourage speculative investors, further weakening demand.

37724049,https://crypto.news/?p=14319919,1734370600,Bitcoin hits new record high with surge to $107k,"Bitcoin has smashed past another record level with a surge to a new all-time above $107,000. After reclaiming the psychological $100,000 level, Bitcoin ( BTC ) strengthened further, reaching highs of $107,172 on U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. The flagship digital asset rose to this new ATH as the world’s largest corporate holder of BTC purchased another $1.5 billion worth of the asset. Bitcoin broke to above $104 on December 5, 2024. However, profit-taking saw it dip to lows of $97,044, where it struggled for upward momentum over the next nine days. On December 15, 2024, bulls pushed the price above its previous high as the market reacted to positive comments from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. You might also like: CZ highlights how governments are leaning towards BTC strategic reserves BTC’s spike to above $107k happened as MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 BTC to bring its total holdings to 439,000. As BTC price jumped to its new ATH, the shares of MicroStrategy also rose – beginning with a 6.5% uptick in pre-market trading. Bitcoin’s rally, which analysts predict could extend further, also marked another significant milestone. In a post on X , veteran trader Peter Brandt highlighted the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio reaching a new ATH of 39. At this level, it takes 39 ounces of gold to buy one BTC. Brandt suggested the next resistance could be at 89, indicating continued strengthening of Bitcoin against the precious metal. Gold traded at $2,670.3 per ounce at the time of writing. Elsewhere, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have witnessed net inflow for five consecutive days. The market recorded total inflows of $2.17 billion between December 9 and 13. With a crypto-friendly Trump administration set to take over in the U.S., catalysts such as spot ETFs and increased regulatory clarity are driving bullish sentiment, with the next target for BTC at $110,000.

This could trigger a significant price upswing, making them smart crypto buys for potential investors. 1Fuel is another crypto purchase with potential high returns that investors can consider. The new coin is on presale and may soon yield about 200x. 1Fuel's potential high yield makes it appealing to investors, and many are hoping to benefit from joining its presale early. Smart money moves towards 1Fuel as new altcoin shows promising outlook Crypto investors and analysts are optimistic about 1Fuel's potential, with the new token showing strong indicators as a promising investment opportunity. Analysts say entering the 1Fuel presale is a potentially rewarding investment that could bring high returns. The presale is currently in its second stage and has sold about 22% of its 63 million token allocation for this stage. Potential investors will be better off joining the 1Fuel presale now before it moves to the next stage at a higher value. The 1Fuel project transcends mere hype and presale buzz. It's a project with solid utility and necessary backings and would change the status quo in DeFi. 1Fuel will improve accessibility to DeFi and ensure better profitability for participants. The crypto solution will have groundbreaking functions that resolve common challenges users face. 1Fuel looks prepared for market success, and early investors would gain the most from its potential boom. Ethereum targets $5K with major price drivers in its favor Investors are optimistic about Ethereum's outlook, as it looks well-positioned to breach the $5000 milestone. Ethereum is supported by major factors like improved on-chain activities, a rise in dApp usage, fee burning mechanism, and increasing institutional demands. These factors could drive Ethereum to new price milestones, making the top altcoin a crypto purchase with potential high returns. Ethereum trades at $3875 at press time, following a bearish run that has lasted over seven days. However, investors are still bullish about Ethereum, as major indicators point towards an imminent turnaround. Ethereum is expected to return to the $4K price zone soon. Analysts predict this will happen when the general market’s sentiment improves, which could be in the coming days. Ethereum will likely make its current resistance level its support zone by Q1, as it looks to break beyond the point soon. Once it breaks the $4k resistance, the altcoin is expected to rally toward its $4891.70 all-time high, yielding good returns for investors. Ethereum may eventually hit $5k around Q2 2025; so far, the major price drivers remain in its favor. Cardano eyes major price upswing in Q1 2025 Cardano is one of the smart crypto buys investors should consider ahead of 2025. The altcoin is eyeing a promising start to the new year, and analysts expect it to regain momentum soon. Despite its downtrend, Cardano investors remain strong, helping the altcoin defend its current price. Cardano faces strong resistance around $1.10 and $1.30. A breakout from these points could trigger a bull rally towards $3.00. If buy actions drop around this point, Cardano could fall to its support level around $0.80 to $1.03. Experts say a decline to the nearest support is a good purchase opportunity for potential investors. However, it's not good for current Cardano holders. Cardano’s possible price spring upswing depends on market sentiment. If the sentiment is bullish, buyers will buy more, and Cardano will pump. If not, Cardano investors may have to endure the dip period, while potential investors can enter by identifying the best entry point. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano eye significant price upswing but first have to overcome current resistance. Unlike them, 1Fuel is enjoying a smooth ride on presale. The new token looks set to yield high returns, and investors will find early entry highly rewarding. 1Fuel is still a presale token, offering you the best opportunity to get in before the price spikes upon launch in 2025.

37723992,https://crypto.news/?p=14319908,1734370488,Ripple’s RLUSD scheduled for Dec. 17 launch,"Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin will become available on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain starting Tuesday, December 17. Digital payment behemoth Ripple ( XRP ) has declared Dec. 17 as the debut date for its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD in the Americas, the U.K., the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific markets. RLUSD’s launch follows last week’s final regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. NYDFS’s greenlight moved the stablecoin from its test phase to a broad rollout across several platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, Bitso, Bullish, Mercado, and CoinMENA. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the XRP company intentionally launched its RLUSD stablecoin “under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter,” globally considered the regulatory gold standard. As the U.S. moves toward clearer regulations, we expect to see greater adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD, which offer real utility and are backed by years of trust and expertise in the industry. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO Stablecoins serve as an essential liquidity and transaction bridge between digital asset markets and traditional finance. They provide a stable-price blockchain asset leveraged for settlement in both web3-native and real-world contexts. Institutions tap stablecoins for cheaper cross-border transactions, prompted by a worldwide shift toward regulatory clarity and policy standardization for the industry. U.S. policymakers in the Federal Senate and Wyoming State House mulled stablecoin frameworks. While U.S. stablecoin rules may benefit RLUSD, the tokens will be unavailable in its early days, or even months. The startup has yet to secure the required licenses and approval mandated by the E.U.’s MiCA. Launching in the U.S. could pit XRP’s operator against stablecoin titans in the $200 billion sector. Tether leads the industry with its $140 billion market cap ( USDT ), and ( USDC ) issued by Circle boasts an existing presence of U.S. platforms like Coinbase. You might also like: Wyoming seeks developers for state-backed stablecoin Ripple CTO DVID Schwartz cautioned investors about RLUSD demand-driven price volatility. Schwartz said there may be supply shortages in the days following the launch. “Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin. This is not an opportunity to get rich,” Schwartz warned speculators willing to splurge $1,200 for a bite of RLUSD’s supply, hoping to get gains. The company also named two new stablecoin advisory board members in former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, and Kenneth Montgomery, former COO of Boston’s Federal Reserve Bank.

Chainlink ( LINK ), the biggest oracle in the blockchain industry, rose to $30.17, up over 270% from its lowest point in September. The coin soared due to several tailwinds that could drive further gains in the near term. For example, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance selected Chainlink as its oracle provider and acquired 78,387 LINK tokens valued at over $2.3 million. Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ), the popular layer-1 network, selected Chainlink as the provider of its oracles as it seeks to boost its Decentralized Finance and Real World Asset tokenization adoption. Further, Chainlink is collaborating with Swift Society, one of the world’s most significant payment networks.

Additionally, data shows that more Chainlink investors are moving their tokens to self-custody as the number of tokens on exchanges has dropped to 255.8 million. Token outflows from exchanges are typically a sign of reduced selling pressure. Data by IntoTheBlock shows that the total addresses holding the LINK token has risen sharply in the past few weeks.

Chainlink has also moved above the overshoot level of the Murrey Math Lines and is trading above the 50-week and 25-week moving averages. The Relative Strength Index is also pointing upwards.

Price Completes Head And Shoulder Pattern, Suggesting Crash To $2.2 Is Imminent","Crypto analyst TradinSides has suggested that it might be time for investors to start closing their XRP long positions. This came as the analyst revealed a bearish pattern, which showed that the XRP price could witness a significant crash. XRP Price Could Crash As Head And Shoulder Pattern Forms In a TradingView post, TradinSides predicted that XRP could crash as the price could form the Head and Shoulders pattern, driving the crypto to $2.2 or below. The analyst stated that this price correction could happen if some bullish fundamentals don’t happen for the altcoin as expected. The fundamentals that TradinSides cited include the RLUSD stablecoin and the upcoming XRP ETFs. Related Reading: Extremely Bullish 88-Day Structure Appears On Bitcoin Price Chart After Hitting $105,000 ATH While these fundamentals present a bullish outlook for the XRP price, the crypto analyst stated that XRP still stands under heavy selling pressure due to the SEC’s decision to appeal the Ripple case ruling, which is impacting demand and market sentiment. TradinSides alluded to SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s reappointment and how it could ultimately impact the Ripple case and the XRP price. The analyst noted that Crenshaw’s reappointment is set for December 18. However, if Crenshaw’s renomination fails, Donald Trump could nominate a new Commissioner. Crenshaw’s renomination is significant as the SEC must file its opening brief in the appeal case on January 15. If she is reappointed, she could vote in favor of the Commission filing its opening brief since she has been known to take an anti-crypto stance on several occasions. The crypto analyst believes the altcoin could face selling pressure if the SEC pursues the appeal. On the other hand, if the SEC withdraws its appeal, TradinSides predicts that the Commission could also withdraw its appeal. This would lead the agency to approve the pending XRP ETF applications, which could drive demand up. If this doesn’t happen, the crypto analyst predicts that the Head and Shoulders pattern could drive the XRP price to $2.2. The State Of Things In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender provided an update on the current XRP price action. He stated that the 4-hour time frame confirms the break for XRP. The analyst added that the daily time frame will be confirmed above $2.52. Once XRP breaks above that level, Dark Defender predicts that the altcoin will then rally to $2.72.

37723864,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393836,1734370235,"Pepe Coin Millionaire Identifies the ‘Next PEPE’ That Could Turn $300 Into $30,000 in Just 8 Weeks","The post Pepe Coin Millionaire Identifies the ‘Next PEPE’ That Could Turn $300 Into $30,000 in Just 8 Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News PEPE’s ascent caught the market’s interest, but the hunt for the next spectacular prospect started immediately. Rexas Finance (RXS), the next breakout token that might cause a comparable metamorphosis, claims a self-identified Pepe Coin millionaire. Rexas Finance is not only another cryptocurrency fighting for attention in an overabundance of supply. This project is interesting for investment since it combines real-world usefulness with viral development potential. Thanks to its creative strategy, fast-expanding community, and strong presale performance, Rexas Finance is ready to copy—and maybe surpass—the kind of returns observed with Pepe Coin. Why Did Pepe Coin (PEPE) Turn Out so Successful? Pepe’s meme currency nature helped it to become an overnight hit. Using the well-known Pepe the Frog meme, the crypto immediately attracted a large audience. Attracted by the buzz and the possibility of quick profits, investors hopped onto the bandwagon. PEPE grew remarkably within weeks, giving returns of 10,000% or more to its early adopters. Though Pepe Coin’s growth was indisputable, viral marketing and community attitude drove almost all of its ascent. It was a speculative investment lacking any actual value or use. Investors are searching for the next great token that promises enormous gains and provides sustainable value as the excitement over PEPE starts to wane. Rexas Finance helps with this. Rexas Finance (RXS), The Next “PEPE” Combining the stability and usefulness of a novel initiative with the viral appeal of meme coins, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself in the congested crypto scene. Unlike Pepe Coin, which depended just on hype, Rexas Finance is based on a strong foundation of utility and invention. With tokens costing $0.15, Rexas Finance is in Stage 10 of its presale right now. The presale has been an absolute triumph with 342 million tokens sold and over $27,016,329 raised. Early investors have an instant chance for profits, with the next stage pricing projected to rise to $0.175. RXS is a perfect contender for quick expansion since its momentum guarantees a good post-launch performance. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself in part by emphasizing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This innovative method lets fractionalized traditional assets, including real estate, artwork, and goods, trade on the blockchain. By democratizing access to these assets, Rexas Finance is creating new investment prospects for a worldwide client. Unlike speculative meme coins, RXS provides actual value that might propel long-term acceptance and expansion. Security and openness are important in the crypto industry; Rexas Finance excels in these areas. The initiative has had a CertiK audit—a gold standard for smart contract assessments. This degree of research increases investor confidence hence RXS is a safer investment than many speculative coins. Also, two of the most reliable sources for monitoring crypto performance, CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, have lately included Rexas Finance. These postings have raised the project’s profile greatly and drawn an expanding pool of investors. How Might RXS Turn $300 into $30,000? Presale success, rising demand, and utility-driven approach combined by Rexas Finance set it especially for rapid expansion. Here is how a small investment may yield enormous returns: Built-in Presale Gains: RXS presents a clear road to riches even before its official release at its present $0.15 presale pricing. Early investors will find quick gains since the listing price is estimated to be $0.20. Strong presale performance and community support provide tokens with great price increases following launch. With the level of interest in RXS, a 100x return within the first few months is quite reasonable. Beyond its surge, Rexas Finance’s emphasis on actual asset tokenization guarantees ongoing importance. The token’s value might rise exponentially as acceptance increases, providing the kind of returns seen with Pepe Coin. Furthermore, the market is increasingly preferring projects with practical uses. Tokens like RXS are probably going to outperform simply speculative assets as regulatory scrutiny intensifies and investors become more discriminating. Why is Rexas Finance The Next PEPE? The market for cryptocurrencies depends on spotting the next great prospect; all the indicators point to Rexas Finance as the token to watch.

The Lido Finance team announced on December 16 that it plans to discontinue all operations on Polygon following a DAO forum discussion and a community vote approving the move. According to the team, the decision to end Lido’s support on Polygon was made by Lido DAO ( LDO ) token holders, with the initial proposal forwarded by Shard Labs in 2021. You might also like: Grayscale launches Lido DAO and Optimism Trust Lido cited several challenges influencing the decision, including limited user adoption and shifting dynamics in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Additionally, Polygon’s transition to zkEVM has contributed to a decline in liquid staking activity. The Lido community’s governance resolutions looking to refocus on Ethereum ( ETH ) is also part of the reason for the sunsetting of the Polygon services. The discontinuation of staking on Polygon begins on December 16, 2024, after which no new staking will be allowed via the Polygon interface. A six-month transition period, running from December 16, 2024, to June 16, 2025, will allow users to unstake their Polygon ( MATIC ). “It is highly advised to unstake stMATIC prior to June 16, 2025 to ensure a smooth unstaking experience using the Lido on Polygon UI.” Lido Finance team on X Between January 15 and January 22, 2025, Lido on Polygon operations will temporarily pause, during which withdrawals will be unavailable.

37723734,https://finbold.com/?p=219987,1734369976,"Here’s when Chainlink (LINK) will reach $40, according to analyst","Chainlink ( LINK ) continues its bullish momentum, with analysts highlighting a clear path toward $40 in the short term. Notably, an analysis by TradingShot , a prominent technical analysis firm, highlights the strength of LINK’s current uptrend within a well-defined ‘Channel Up’ pattern. This channel began after LINK bottomed out in June 2023, marking the start of a sustained bullish trend that is yet to be broken. Golden Cross and MACD signal further gains One of the critical drivers behind LINK’s current rally is the formation of a Golden Cross on its daily chart, where the 50-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average. This bullish signal mirrors the October 2023 Golden Cross, which preceded a 361.5% price surge. Analysts believe this setup positions LINK for another substantial rally. Chainlink price chart. Source: TradingShot / TradingView Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) indicator on the weekly chart is showing a bullish crossover, echoing its behavior during the October 2023 rally. This confluence of signals strengthens the likelihood of LINK reaching $40 in the short term as long as LINK sustains its trajectory within the Channel Up pattern. A higher target on the horizon While the immediate focus is on the $40 level, TradingShot highlights a longer-term price target of $53, derived from the 4.382 Fibonacci extension level . This target aligns with Chainlink’s broader bullish cycle, suggesting continued upside if the current momentum holds. AI models further support these projections, predicting that LINK could trade between $30 and $35 by the end of 2024. This outlook is strengthened by LINK’s expanding role in decentralized and traditional finance, growing investor confidence, and strong technical indicators, as reported by Finbold. Fundamental growth drivers: Ecosystem expansion and adoption Chainlink’s growth is underpinned by strong fundamental drivers, including rising institutional demand, as highlighted by Donald Trump -backed World Liberty’s $2 million purchase of LINK, which coincided with a 20% price increase. The network’s expanding ecosystem adoption, driven by the integration of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) into platforms like the Ronin Ecosystem and Lista DAO, signals its growing utility in gaming and DeFi sectors. Additionally, Chainlink’s expanding partnerships, such as its collaboration with Emirates NBD Banking Group, further strengthen its credibility as a leading blockchain infrastructure provider. Beyond DeFi, Chainlink’s reach now extends into traditional finance, with European fintech firm 21X integrating its infrastructure to enable tokenized securities. This development strengthens Chainlink’s growing significance in highly regulated financial markets, With continued advancements in staking and protocol capabilities, Chainlink remains a key player in the blockchain space, solidifying its journey toward higher adoption and a potential $50 billion market cap in 2025.

37723733,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27760,1734369864,UK to Ban Public Crypto Offers in Incisive New Regulatory Climate,"FCA’s Big Move: Banning Public Crypto Offers In one fell swoop, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced new directives that would ban public crypto offerings from unregulated entities. It published its proposals on December 16 that extend earlier restrictions, underlining commitments to investor protection and market integrity. What the New Directives Entail The latest paper from the FCA, Discussion Paper DP24/4, articulates some key measures in mitigating the risks within the crypto industry. Among the key proposals are: A ban on crypto promotions by unauthorised entities. Enhanced internal controls to prevent harm to investors. Increased sharing of information between licensed platforms to identify and deter market abuse. These measures will protect consumers while ensuring a regulatory environment that is fair and transparent for crypto markets. A Historical Perspective on Regulatory Changes Since 2020, the FCA has overseen compliance with anti-money laundering laws for crypto firms. In 2022, a ban was issued on the promotion of services by unregistered crypto entities to UK residents. The newly proposed rules extend that, focusing on public crypto offers and enhancing protections against market manipulation and fraud. In a furtherance of this objective, the FCA seeks to introduce the tougher controls on retail investments in cryptocurrencies, which have recently grown in risk and fraud concerns across the digital asset market. Stakeholder Feedback: A Gateway to Finalization The FCA is inviting crypto firms and stakeholders to submit comments as part of its effort toward ensuring that the regulations it has proposed work effectively. The consultation looks at the following: entry mechanisms for crypto companies entering the UK market. More effective disclosure to be had to enhance transparency. Mechanisms for identifying and mitigating fraud and market abuse. This collaborative approach reflects the FCA’s intent to balance innovation with investor security in the evolving crypto landscape. Consumer Protection a Priority One of the key policies of the proposed law is to ensure that investors have proper information on which to make informed decisions. Through controls on crypto promotions and more effective oversight, the FCA also plans to protect consumers from potential harms, thereby increasing confidence in the marketplace. Timeline for Implementation The proposed regulations will be open to public comments until March 2025. The feedback provided will help formulate a policy framework expected to come into effect by 2026. These moves mark a pivotal moment in the development of the UK’s crypto market, bringing much-needed accountability, clarity, and effective consumer protection in an industry that is expanding rapidly.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/uk-ban-public-crypto-offers-incisive-new-regulatory/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Investors are searching for such crypto investment options right now. FXGuys ($FXG), the new forex trading platform, continues to draw the attention of these investors to its presale, having already raised $3 million. With its innovative features, investors are confident of making at least a 100x ROI. This influx into FXGuys has overshadowed the excitement caused by Ripple’s (XRP) 225% price increase and Cardano’s (ADA) 91% price increase in the past month. Let’s take a deeper dive into what is driving investor confidence in this DeFi token! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Ripple’s XRP Set For a Brief Price Correction Amidst Stablecoin Developments Ripple Labs received approval from the NYDFS to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on December 10, 2024. This caused Ripple’s XRP to break its resistance level at $1.90 and record a short upward trajectory. Though the market upswing has raised XRP’s price to $2.33 , analyst Ali Martinez believes that the Ripple-backed token might see a brief price correction. Crypto expert Vincent Van Code shares a similar sentiment, explaining that this development alone cannot sustain an XRP price pump as it was simply speculative. He expects the real pump to begin when the AMM/LP is set up on the Ripple chain. Thus, XRP is expected to briefly retrace to $2.06 before breaking out to $2.45 later in 2025. Cardano Also Takes a Hit From the General Crypto Slump Cardano’s ADA has dipped by 8.4% in the past week. ADA’s price dropped to $1.09 from a peak of $1.20, and ADA’s market cap also fell from $40 billion to $38.25 billion. This price dip follows from the general crypto price correction after a November 2024 market boom. ADA’s slump in price, therefore, can be explained to be due to the coin crossing into the overbought zone, which then caused price exhaustion. As a result, traders subsequently began taking profit. The projections for ADA’s future price are still conservative. The Cardano token is expected to remain around $1.40 for the next month. FXGuys is Set to Revolutionize Forex Trading Say goodbye to the lack of transparency, horrible customer support, and outrageous fees and commissions plaguing traditional forex trading firms. FXGuys combines the perks of TradFi with DeFi to create the first-of-its-kind decentralized prop firm. The FXGuys Trader Funding program allows talented traders without capital to get $200,000 starting capital to trade various assets. These assets include crypto, FX, commodities, and indices. Furthermore, successful traders enjoy a generous 80:20 profit split in their favor. The trader’s percentage increases as they scale their earnings. Another important FXGuys offering is its Trade2Earn program, where investors benefit from trading consistently. $FXG tokens are awarded to each trader for each trade made, regardless of the outcome. The tokens accumulated can then be used to offset subscription fees and challenge fees on the platform. Another major appeal is its no-KYC policy. This makes transactions on the FX Guys platform seamless, with traders able to get on board and start trading in an instant. It also protects investor privacy and anonymity. Finally, traders can be assured of the safety of their assets as the platform passed its audit by two tier-one security companies, SolidProof and Soken. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Purchase $FXG, The Next Big DeFi Token! $FXG is selling for $0.04 and is still in Stage 2 of its public presale. We believe the profit potential on $FXG is much greater than that of XRP and ADA. Investors at this stage can earn a 25% profit when the presale progresses to Stage 3. Upon launch at $0.10, Stage 2 investors will gain a 150% profit. That is only the beginning, as there is enough utility and interest to propel the coin to a 1,100x price pump. Additionally, token holders can participate in community governance. They get to vote and decide on key issues pertaining to the ecosystem. $FXG holders can also earn passive income by staking their tokens for rewards. Finally, platform fees, subscription payments, and funding challenges can be paid with $FXG tokens. Cardano (ADA) and Ripple(XRP) pale in comparison to $FXG.

With its unstoppable growth in tech, media, and renewable energy, the Golden State is proving itself an economic powerhouse. Meanwhile, Germany, weighed down by political instability, sluggish industrial output, and a shrinking workforce, is slipping. By late 2024 or early 2025, California is expected to surpass Germany’s GDP. California’s GDP hit $3.7 trillion in 2023 and grew by 3.7%. In 2024, growth slowed slightly to 2.8% in the second quarter, but the state still held strong. Germany’s, on the other hand, shrank by 0.2% in 2024, and the outlook isn’t promising. Forecasts show a weak recovery with only 0.2% growth expected in 2025. California dominates with tech and job growth California’s economic strength lies in its ability to innovate and adapt. The state is home to giants like Alphabet, Apple, and Visa, companies that are not just surviving but thriving. Together, these companies saw a 34% revenue jump in 2023, with projections pointing to an additional 8% rise this year. They turn $100 of sales into $49 of profit—a level of efficiency Germany’s biggest companies can’t match. Job growth in California has been another standout factor. The state created an average of 16,500 jobs per month in 2024, up from 12,900 per month in 2023. This steady climb has brought unemployment to 5.3% as of August 2024. For context, the U.S. national unemployment rate is 3.5%, but the gap between California and the national rate is narrowing, showing the state’s resilience in tough times. Compare this to Germany, where employment is declining. Workforce reductions have hit consumer spending hard, dragging down the broader economy. San Francisco alone accounts for 78% of California’s market capitalization, a sharp increase from 70% five years ago. Companies in the Bay Area are expected to grow sales by 14% in 2024. Oakland, home to the state’s third-largest port, has also seen impressive growth, outpacing Los Angeles and Long Beach in monthly expansion rates. Germany faces political and economic turmoil Germany’s struggles go beyond economic numbers. The country is battling political instability after Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government collapsed. Early elections are set for February 2025, and until then, Germany will operate on a provisional budget. This temporary measure limits spending to legally required commitments, such as unemployment benefits, child support, and ongoing construction projects. Without a functional government, Germany’s ability to address its economic problems is severely limited. The war in Ukraine has further exposed Germany’s vulnerabilities. Rising energy costs and disrupted supply chains have battered the country’s industrial output. Key sectors like healthcare, consumer goods, and industrial products have shown minimal growth. Over the last three years, these industries saw market value increases of only 40%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. For comparison, California’s top sectors—tech hardware, media, and software—grew by 184%, 54%, and 58% in the same period. Critics who predicted a business exodus from California during the COVID-19 pandemic have been proven wrong. The state’s innovation hubs are thriving. San Francisco alone has 62% more listed companies today than it did in 2018. Data from Bloomberg shows that California’s top 10 companies increased employment by 10% while boosting market valuations.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Backed by a prop firm, $FXG’s potential to deliver considerable returns over time fueled this decision. Read on as we explore $FXG’s high-profit potential, which makes it a suitable addition to SOL and PNUT investors’ portfolios! Solana’s Rallies to $230 as Market Participants Set Expectations on Spot ETF Solana, a layer-1 blockchain coin, is in the spotlight again after SOL, its native token, bounced back to $230. SOL has weathered a harsh storm over the year, diving to critical price levels and recovering soon after. On December 10, 2024, SOL rallied from a low of $203 , which it fell to days prior, to a high of $230, a 13% increase. Many have attributed its recovery to the possible approval of a Solana Spot Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) during the coming administration. In an X post on December 11, Ryan Rasmussen, an X user, quoted Bitwise’s Solana forecast if an ETF is approved. He said that the acceptance of a SOL ETF will boost its adoption and make Solana more accessible to potential investors. Also, Gary Gensler’s resignation from the US SEC as the organization’s Chairman has incited hope for a more favorable regulatory approach, which could benefit crypto coins like SOL. Over the last 24 hours, SOL rose 6.77% to $228 . PNUT Moves Up Despite Market Instability In spite of the recent market fluctuations, PNUT’s price increased by 20% within 24 hours. The token’s upside movement illustrates how specific cryptocurrencies can thrive even in a stormy market situation. On December 11, US-based exchange Coinbase announced that it was adding PNUT to its long roster of meme coin offerings. This listing announcement sparked the surge in PNUT’s price as interest in the meme coin spiked. Specifically, the news caused a 100% increase in PNUT’s price to $0.96, a significant upside from recent lows. The token’s weekly chart shows a stable trend, having registered a 50% gain over this period. With factors like its imminent listing on Coinbase and positive technical indicators, PNUT may be on the verge of a monumental rally.

Dogecoin is at the top of his list, which might seem like an unexpected choice, but it is a well-thought-out pick. Dogecoin Takes Center Stage in The Raoul Pal Watchlist Known for its fun beginnings and strong community support, Dogecoin has drawn Pal’s attention as a token with real potential in this market cycle. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.3964 and has seen moderate short-term gains. Dogecoin’s market cap now stands at $58.44 billion, with an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $3.19 billion. While Dogecoin takes center stage, Pal’s watchlist also includes six other cryptocurrencies, each offering distinct opportunities for growth in this bullish phase. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, continues to dominate the market. Pal views it as a critical player, benefiting from its growing adoption as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Others include Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), which Pal called his “main game”, Sui(SUI), and another memecoin Smoking Chicken Fish. Pal’s diversification highlights his belief in balancing stability with opportunities for outsized gains during the bull market. DOGE: A Serious Coin With a Meme Heart In a recent post on X, Dogecoin founder Billy Markus suggested the idea of a national Digecoin reserve, stating, “Why not a national Dogecoin reserve tho?” Markus’s suggestion of a national Digecoin reserve was not random. It responded to the discussions about Donald Trump’s potential plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve for the United States government. Dogecoin, born as an internet joke in 2013, has grown into the sixth-largest virtual asset. Though it trailed behind Bitcoin’s value, Dogecoin remains a solid cultural icon. The dog-themed digital coin gained traction thanks to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who publicly championed it as a potential payment solution. Musk’s influence has undeniably fueled Dogecoin’s rise, transforming it from a niche coin to a legitimate player in the digital asset space. Analysts predicted it might even surpass its all-time high in 2021, driven by its strong community and growing utility. Crypto’s Unexpected Surprises Are Yet to Come The concept of a national Dogecoin reserve reflects how virtual assets gain cultural and financial importance. Bitcoin is already emerging as a potential global reserve asset, and Dogecoin has transformed from a meme into a crypto asset with a growing purpose. Billy Markus’s tweet about a Dogecoin reserve is likely just a playful reference to Dogecoin’s unlikely journey. However, in the unpredictable world of digital assets, a meme-based coin like Dogecoin might one day have a more serious role to play.

It is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents. Ripple ensures transparency by committing to monthly, third-party audits of its reserve assets. The stablecoin’s compliance credentials are bolstered by its launch under the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) limited-purpose trust company charter. NYDFS approval is a big deal for the stablecoin , and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse described it as the “premier regulatory standard worldwide.” According to Ripple’s official press release , Garlinghouse emphasized the strategic importance of regulatory clarity.

It also bridges the gap between traditional fiat currencies and the crypto ecosystem, streamlining both on-ramping and off-ramping processes. Additionally, RLUSD can be used for collateralizing tokenized real-world assets like commodities and securities. Available on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain, RLUSD provides flexibility and scalability to address diverse financial needs. Ripple Payments, a key service in Ripple’s portfolio, will incorporate RLUSD into its global payment solutions early next year. Ripple revealed in its press release that this addition could enhance Ripple Payments’ $70 billion annual transaction volume and extend its reach across 90+ payout markets. Expert Oversight of RLUSD Ripple has assembled an exceptional advisory board to guide RLUSD’s growth. Joining the board are Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former First Vice President and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. These seasoned financial leaders join existing advisors such as Sheila Bair, former FDIC Chair, and Chris Larsen, Ripple’s co-founder. XRP Rising Again Following the announcement, XRP experienced a notable surge. The asset is now trading at $2.56, up 5.7% from yesterday.

Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, is set to launch for trading on Tuesday (December 17), after receiving approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) earlier this month. Ripple’s plans to use RLUSD and XRP in cross-border payment solutions for institutional clients hint at a bright future for both the company and the cryptocurrency. With Ripple’s strong institutional backing and the approval of RLUSD, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends as the stablecoin market continues to expand. Ripple’s integration of XRP for gas fees in RLUSD transactions has also raised expectations for the cryptocurrency’s value. In terms of market sentiment, XRP has been gaining increasing attention from retail investors. A surge in Google search trends reflects growing interest in the cryptocurrency, which could lead to further price appreciation. What’s Next For XRP Price? Analysts are closely watching XRP’s price chart, examining a bullish pattern known as a bull flag, which historically breaks to the upside. This pattern suggests a price target of $4.50 or higher for XRP, with some experts predicting the cryptocurrency could reach $3.50 to $4.50 by the end of the year. Following the positive news, XRP has risen by 3 percent in the past 24 hours, trading above the $2.50 mark.

Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform, is speculated to climb to an impressive $8,000, driven by its robust ecosystem and upcoming upgrades. Meme-based Pepe Coin, known for its community-driven appeal, has investors eyeing a potential rise to $0.0002. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI , a trailblazer in AI-integrated blockchain technology, is making waves with its presale price of $0.003 and projections of reaching $2. This article explores the factors behind these bold predictions, analyzing market trends and developments that could turn these milestones into reality. Ethereum’s road to $8000: What’s driving the momentum? There are several key factors driving the momentum behind Ethereum’s potential rise to $8,000. The first is its widespread adoption and use as a preferred platform for building decentralized applications (DApps). Additionally, the upcoming major network upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, is expected to greatly improve scalability and transaction speeds, making it even more attractive to developers and users alike. Another factor is the increasing interest and investment from institutional players in the cryptocurrency space, further solidifying Ethereum’s position as a leading player in the market. With these developments in mind, it’s no surprise that experts predict an impressive price surge for Ethereum in the near future. Furthermore, with new use cases emerging every day and a growing global community, Ethereum’s potential for growth seems limitless. As more industries recognize the value of blockchain technology, the demand for Ethereum is likely to increase, driving its price upwards. Pepe coin a meme becomes a serious contender At first glance, Pepe Coin may seem like just another meme-inspired cryptocurrency. However, its unique appeal and strong community following have made it a serious contender in the market. With a focus on creating a decentralized marketplace for collectible digital assets, Pepe Coin has gained traction among collectors and investors alike. Moreover, recent partnerships with major companies and artists have further boosted its credibility and potential for growth. As more mainstream attention shifts towards NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and digital art, Pepe Coin’s value is expected to rise significantly. While $0.0002 may seem like a small figure, it represents an impressive increase from its current price of less than $0.0001. Lightchain AI combines the best of blockchain and AI Lightchain AI is making waves in the blockchain and AI space with its cutting-edge solutions and ambitious vision. Starting at a presale price of $0.003, Lightchain AI has captured the attention of investors and tech enthusiasts alike, with bold projections of reaching $2. This transformative project leverages unique features such as Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) to redefine the potential of decentralized systems. As Lightchain AI bridges the gap between AI and blockchain, its journey to $2 symbolizes a perfect blend of innovation and opportunity in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. You might also like: How Lightchain AI combines AI solutions with blockchain tech Timeline for achieving these milestones short-term vs. long-term potential While these price predictions may seem far-fetched to some, it’s important to consider both short-term and long-term factors that could drive the growth of these assets. In the short term, market trends and developments such as network upgrades, partnerships, and industry recognition can have a significant impact on prices. However, in the long term, broader adoption and integration into mainstream industries will be crucial for achieving these milestones. It’s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile by nature and their prices are subject to many unpredictable factors. Therefore, while these projections may excite investors, it’s important to approach them with caution and thorough research. Why Lightchain AI offers the most explosive return opportunity Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the potential of both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. With its smart solutions and partnerships with major companies, it has attracted attention from both the tech and investment communities. As more industries recognize the value of AI-integrated blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI’s growth potential is unparalleled. Starting at a presale price of $0.003 , investors have the chance to get in on the ground floor of a project that has already generated significant buzz in the market. This combination of uniqueness, partnerships, and early-stage investment potential makes Lightchain AI an attractive option for those seeking explosive returns. Overall, Lightchain AI’s journey from $0.003 to $2 symbolizes the limitless possibilities of combining two transformative technologies in one project. Whether it’s short-term or long-term, Lightchain AI has the potential to make a significant impact on the cryptocurrency landscape and provide an exciting opportunity for investors. Preparing for the next big crypto moves The potential rise of Ethereum to $8,000 and Pepe Coin’s journey to $0.0002 may seem like bold predictions, but they represent the ever-evolving and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. With constant innovation, increasing adoption, and a growing global community, these milestones are well within reach. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI’s quest for $2 represents an exciting opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with immense potential.

37723322,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628317,1734368360,Aave contributor proposes abandoning Polygon amid its ‘risky’ bridge proposal,"The Aave community is caught between a rock and a hard place after contributor group Aave Chan advocated withholding lending services from Polygon’s poS chain. This is in response to another Polygon community request to use over $1 billion in bridge assets for yield generation. Marc Zeller, founder of Aave Chan, proposed slowing down Aave’s lending processes to protect it from potential future security issues. His proposal called for strict steps to mitigate risks in Aave lending markets on Polygon’s PoS network. These included establishing a 0% loan-to-value for all assets and raising the reserve factor to 85%, discouraging future deposits, or banning customers from borrowing against their collateral. Marc Zeller asserted , “The adjustments are in response to an upcoming proposal that will significantly impact the risk profiles of bridged assets within the Polygon network.” Aave is Polygon’s largest decentralized app in terms of total value locked, with over $466 million in PoS deposits. This demonstrates that it is a major blow to Polygon; what does this imply for the two entities? Aave Chan’s proposal to the Aave community Marc Zeller requested that risk parameters be adjusted for versions 2 and 3 of the Aave protocols on the Polygon PoS chain to cub risks associated with employing bridging stablecoins and create a return if Polygon’s proposal is accepted. Allez Labs, in collaboration with DeFi protocols Morpho and Yearn, presented the proposal that is responsible for Aave’s contemplation of withdrawal. They composed a Pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal that requires approximately $1.3 billion in stablecoin reserves from the Polygon PoS bridge to be deployed into various lending protocols for yield-earning strategies. Marc Zeller, on the other hand, is opposed to the plan. He emphasized the potential risks of rehypothecating user deposits from the canonical bridge. He explained his observation that the practice could pose significant security risks for the bridge and expose the deposits to potential bad debt when invested in liquidity pools within DeFi or lending protocols. Also, Marc Zeller claimed that Polygon’s yield generation strategy could be more risky than the safer strategies employed by other chains, such as depositing ETH in liquid staking protocols or DAI in MakerDAO’s savings rate module, as these yields are not subject to bad debt. The proposal has sparked a dispute within the Polygon community The proposal suggests a very gradual deployment of bridge liquidity for USDC, USDT, and DAI into a corresponding ERC-4626 vault. All vault reserves are to be stored in Maker’s sUSDS, the canonical yield-bearing container for the Maker ecosystem, on DAI. Source: Aave proposal The Polygon community is assured that it will be able to use the bridge liquidity dashboard and APIs to see the bridge’s liquidity, daily flows and transactions, and other measures. In the absence of native yield-bearing wrappers, Morpho Vaults are to serve as the standard source of yield for USDC and USDT. Also, they are to serve as primary yield sources for the bridge collateral curated by Allez Labs. In addition, all risk-taking choices for raising market capitalizations and establishing new markets are to be subject to a 72-hour time lock. The Polygon Protocol Council is to retain veto power via the guardian function. On the other hand, Allez is to do a risk analysis on the assets and publish their recommendations on the forum. Then, all yield generated is to be directed to a new Polygon Ecosystem Incentives program managed by Yearn. Yearn plans to create 3 Polygon Ecosystem Vaults for USDC, USDT, and DAI whose deposits will be deployed across Polygon PoS and AggLayer DeFi. In addition, the yield earned from the Morpho Markets and sUSDS strategy is to be used to reward depositors of these new Polygon Ecosystem Yearn Vaults. Morpho is a competitor of Aave; could this be a way of getting the entity out of the picture? The community’s take A user said , “Let’s get this straight: You want stablecoin holders who trust Polygon with their assets to bear many layers of risk and then transfer the reward for that risk to… a different set of stakeholders?” He added, “Stablecoin holders seek to minimize risk. You’d create a large honeypot of these risk-averse holders’ assets and give them zero reward for it? And you still expect them to use the chain? This is a ridiculous proposal and I hope it is voted down for the sake of the Polygon ecosystem. ” Another user said , “I am strongly in support of the direction this Pre-PIP proposes, and the conversation that I hope will come out of it in the coming PPGCs.” Although the majority of individuals are opposed to risky projects, which is why the community has rejected several proposals, the proposal is still in progress, as they continue to provide responses to those who are hesitant.

This rising interest and confidence in the altcoin have led to substantial investment in the past few hours. Ripple Whales Add 920 million XRP tokens Today, December 16, 2024, whale transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that crypto whales have moved 920 million XRP tokens, worth $2.2 billion, from Binance. However, this notable XRP transfer occurred in two separate transactions: one during the Asian trading session and one at the opening of the US market. Source: X (previously Twitter) Besides this transaction, whales and long-term holders have also withdrawn a substantial amount of XRP from exchanges over the past week, as reported by CoinPedia on December 15, 2024. XRP Price Prediction for December 17 These withdrawals from exchanges come as the XRP price is on the verge of breaking out from a bullish price action pattern. According to expert technical analysis, XRP has broken out from a bullish flag and pole pattern on the daily time frame. This occurred after a prolonged period of price consolidation in a narrow range. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XRP closes a daily candle above the $2.63 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 72% to reach the $4.50 level in the future. With the recent breakout, rising investor interest, and substantial accumulation, it could be easier for XRP to reach the predicted level in the coming days. Why XRP Price is Increasing? Additionally, this rising interest might be the potential reason behind XRP’s recent upside momentum. At press time, XRP is trading near $2.58 and has witnessed a price surge of over 6.25% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 80%, indicating heightened participation from investors and traders.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-whale-withdraws-2-2-billion-xrp-eyes-on-4-5/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to a recent discussion paper released on December 16, the financial watchdog plans to outlaw public crypto offerings by non-regulated entities. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released a discussion paper (not law!), which sets out a crypto regulatory roadmap and an initial steer on how the FCA may regulate crypto & crypto asset public offerings (ICOs) A brief overview, link to paper & brief analysis below pic.twitter.com/8awdyTB2vZ — Andre Omietanski (@punk6052) December 16, 2024 UK Suggests Public Discussion on Cryptocurrencies The FCA’s proposed restrictions aim to protect consumers and ensure that crypto-related promotions are regulated and compliant with financial laws. The FCA invites public and crypto industry feedback regarding its newly proposed crypto regulations. The consultations are open until March 2025. The measures are part of a broader strategy to create a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework by 2026. To prevent market abuse, the FCA has suggested that authorized firms share information and implement stringent controls to detect suspicious activities. “We are also suggesting certain firms, like authorized crypto trading platforms, share information with each other to help stop suspected market abuse.” FCA Statement The regulator has also taken action against platforms operating without proper authorization. On December 3, the FCA restricted access to Pump.fun , warning that the platform might offer financial services without approval and pose significant risks to UK users. Current Crypto Legislation in the UK The upcoming legislation expands on the FCA’s earlier rules introduced in 2023, which prohibited unregistered crypto entities from marketing or promoting their services to UK citizens. Since 2020, the FCA has been actively monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations in the crypto sector. In addition to the FCA’s warning, a recent report highlighted that the UK is among the top countries for crypto scams and failed projects , accounting for 7% of global crypto scams between January 2022 and October 2024. This report stressed that rapid market growth in regions like the UK often creates opportunities for fraudulent schemes, underlining the importance of strict regulatory measures to protect investors. The UK government views these new crypto regulations as essential for creating a safer environment for investors. According to the FCA, these rules are designed to “set out proposals for firms to introduce strong controls that prevent harm.” The post UK’s FCA Proposes Strict Crypto Regulations to Combat Market Risks appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/fca-calls-for-feedback-on-plans-to-enhance-uk-crypto-market-transparency/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37722701.jpeg

On mainnet, DataDAOs will leverage the $VANA token to enable users to collectively own, monetize and govern their personal data for a stake in the booming AI economy. MONDAY, DECEMBER 16 2024 — Vana , the pioneering network for user-owned data, today announced the launch of its mainnet and native $VANA token. The launch marks a significant milestone in breaking through the data wall that’s limiting AI development while preserving privacy and giving users a stake in the value their data generates. Developed by Open Data Labs — a San Francisco-based research and technology company born out of the MIT Media Lab — the Vana network is an EVM-compatible blockchain that enables users to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing that data to be used for AI model training through privacy-preserving technologies. The mainnet launch follows Vana’s successful testnet phase, which saw over 1.3 million users contributing over 6.5m data points to DataDAOs, processing approximately 1.7 million transactions daily. The testnet demonstrated that programmable data ownership is not just possible, but critical at this point in AI development, says Anna Kazlauskas, CEO of Open Data Labs and inventor of Vana : “Today’s mainnet launch marks a fundamental shift in how data is owned and monetized in the AI era. Users have always legally owned their data, but platforms have captured all the economic value — and most users don’t even realize their data is legally theirs! “Vana lays the groundwork for a new kind of data economy – one where users can benefit from the AI models they help create, and where developers can finally access the cross-platform datasets needed to build truly powerful AI. Property rights were the foundation that enabled modern economies to flourish – and in today’s digital economy, programmable data rights are the foundation for the next generation of AI.” The key features of the Vana mainnet will include: Trustless Validation through secure data ingress and trusted execution nodes Granular Permissioning allowing users complete control over their data usage Onchain Data Provenance tracking how contributed data is applied Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) enabling collective data pooling, governance and monetization via DataDAOs Proof of Contributio n mechanism ensuring fair rewards for data quality Staking $VANA to DataDAOs through Data Hub With the network’s proof-of-contribution system, users can earn by contributing their data to DataDAOs – receiving dataset-specific tokens that grant governance rights while maintaining control over how their data are used. These data tokens can be traded for $VANA, the network’s native currency. The top DataDAOs also receive DataDAO rewards . Beyond data contributions, users can earn additional tokens by running nodes, validating transactions, and staking to DataDAOs. With a total supply of 120 million tokens, $VANA will serve as the foundation for the network’s economic model, enabling: Governance over network parameters and data usage Staking to secure the network and validate data contributions Incentivization of high-quality data submissions from data contributors Revenue Sharing from AI model development and data usage Among the DataDAOs building on Vana are DNA DAO, addressing privacy concerns around genetic data ownership, and an expansion of the successful Reddit Data DAO, which has already demonstrated the potential of community-owned data pools.

Vana’s solution enables individuals to participate in and benefit from the AI economy while maintaining sovereignty over their data.

He stressed early supply bottlenecks and speculative enthusiasm as key factors likely to cause any short-lived spike. Schwartz then warned investors against seeing the much-hyped token as an opportunity to bag life-changing profits. Why RLUSD May Be Priced At More Than $1 David Schwartz said in a lengthy Dec. 15 X post that he anticipates high volatility for RLUSD immediately after its debut, with a handful of huge orders for the stablecoin as some buyers are willing to pay way over the $1 price target. Schwartz indicated that some of these initial pre-market bids for the RLUSD stablecoin, which is currently unreleased, artificially inflated its value before its official launch. The statement came after a crypto community member spotted RLUSD being priced at 511 XRP (around $1,231) per unit on the Xaman trading platform, way above its intended $1 peg. “There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD,” the Ripple CTO wrote. In Xaman t’s showing the price to be a $1,200 RLUSD conversion to XRP. Is this the instant over night price adjustment the XRP community has been waiting for… Will the price of XRP adjust to the value OF 1 RLUSD or is this a glitch until it goes “LIVE”? https://t.co/kzYZ18fVGD — Digital Assets Daily (@AssetsDaily) December 11, 2024 According to Schwartz, the bid looked as though excited buyers wanted to claim “the honor” of purchasing the first units of RLUSD to get to the market. However, he said such inflated valuations would be short-lived, assuring that “the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn’t, something is very seriously wrong.” Wen RLUSD Launch? In August, Ripple announced that it had started testing its new stablecoin on XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum mainnet. Once RLUSD is launched, Ripple intends to utilize both RLUSD and the XRP cryptocurrency to provide cross-border payment solutions to its global customers. As ZyCrypto reported , the stablecoin received its final greenlit from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on Dec. 11. But Ripple is yet to announce when RLUSD will be officially released to the market. Schwartz explained the market forces at play, highlighting the role of arbitragers in swiftly stabilizing RLUSD’s price. Arbitrages are expected to quickly normalize RLUSD’s value by selling at inflated prices and purchasing at or below $1, equalizing supply and demand. In conclusion, Schwartz reminded buyers of a stablecoin’s primary purpose: to have a “stable price”, not to be a speculative asset for making quick profits. “Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich,” he quipped. That being said, XRP rocketed to a seven-year high earlier this month, hitting $2.74 — the highest price since January 2018.

On mainnet, DataDAOs will leverage the $VANA token to enable users to collectively own, monetize and govern their personal data for a stake in the booming AI economy. MONDAY, DECEMBER 16 2024 — Vana , the pioneering network for user-owned data, today announced the launch of its mainnet and native $VANA token. The launch marks a significant milestone in breaking through the data wall that’s limiting AI development while preserving privacy and giving users a stake in the value their data generates. Developed by Open Data Labs — a San Francisco-based research and technology company born out of the MIT Media Lab — the Vana network is an EVM-compatible blockchain that enables users to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing that data to be used for AI model training through privacy-preserving technologies. The mainnet launch follows Vana’s successful testnet phase, which saw over 1.3 million users contributing over 6.5m data points to DataDAOs, processing approximately 1.7 million transactions daily. The testnet demonstrated that programmable data ownership is not just possible, but critical at this point in AI development, says Anna Kazlauskas, CEO of Open Data Labs and inventor of Vana : “Today’s mainnet launch marks a fundamental shift in how data is owned and monetized in the AI era. Users have always legally owned their data, but platforms have captured all the economic value — and most users don’t even realize their data is legally theirs! “Vana lays the groundwork for a new kind of data economy – one where users can benefit from the AI models they help create, and where developers can finally access the cross-platform datasets needed to build truly powerful AI. Property rights were the foundation that enabled modern economies to flourish – and in today’s digital economy, programmable data rights are the foundation for the next generation of AI.” The key features of the Vana mainnet will include: Trustless Validation through secure data ingress and trusted execution nodes Granular Permissioning allowing users complete control over their data usage Onchain Data Provenance tracking how contributed data is applied Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) enabling collective data pooling, governance and monetization via DataDAOs Proof of Contributio n mechanism ensuring fair rewards for data quality Staking $VANA to DataDAOs through Data Hub With the network’s proof-of-contribution system, users can earn by contributing their data to DataDAOs – receiving dataset-specific tokens that grant governance rights while maintaining control over how their data are used. These data tokens can be traded for $VANA, the network’s native currency. The top DataDAOs also receive DataDAO rewards . Beyond data contributions, users can earn additional tokens by running nodes, validating transactions, and staking to DataDAOs. With a total supply of 120 million tokens, $VANA will serve as the foundation for the network’s economic model, enabling: Governance over network parameters and data usage Staking to secure the network and validate data contributions Incentivization of high-quality data submissions from data contributors Revenue Sharing from AI model development and data usage Among the DataDAOs building on Vana are DNA DAO, addressing privacy concerns around genetic data ownership, and an expansion of the successful Reddit Data DAO, which has already demonstrated the potential of community-owned data pools.

Vana’s solution enables individuals to participate in and benefit from the AI economy while maintaining sovereignty over their data. As AI hits a data wall and more platforms monetize user data without sharing any upside with users, users deserve to own a stake in the future of AI, says Art Abal, CEO of Vana Foundation: “The current way we buy and sell private data in Web2 is broken. Our data is extracted and held for ransom by a few platforms and data-brokers. They decide how much our data is worth, and the technology it creates. No more.

37722700,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319878,1734366904,Kidnapping Saudi Royal for Bitcoin Ransom: TikTok Star Avoids Jail,"Catherine Colivas, an Australian woman, pleaded guilty to kidnapping an unnamed Saudi Arabian royal in February last year as part of a Bitcoin scam that netted $40,000. However, she avoided jail time for her role in the scheme. Catherine Colivas Pleads Guilty To Saudi Arabian Royalty Scam The 24-year-old TikTok influencer previously pleaded guilty to kidnapping, extortion, recklessly causing injury, theft, and gun possession. Still, she walked away from her sentencing on December 16 with just a community corrections order. This is the equivalent to community service in the United States. A woman who regularly posts videos online of her glamorous lifestyle allegedly kidnapped a man in Moorabbin and held him at knifepoint. Full story: https://t.co/kw7eWXQL5I pic.twitter.com/zsHLASeoQI — Herald Sun (@theheraldsun) July 6, 2023 Prosecutors allege that Colivas met with a 23-year-old member of the Saudi Arabian royal family in February of last year for drinks. When he offered to drive her home, he was jumped by three men and driven off against his will. According to news.com.au , the prince was bound with zip ties and threatened to have his fingers cut off should he have failed to pay a $20,000 ransom. The captive royal, who reportedly traded digital assets, then transferred $40,000 to his kidnappers’ accounts. The attackers proceeded to drive the unnamed victim back home, where they stole several luxury items before releasing the prince. Colivas was facing a maximum of 25 years behind bars. However, she got a lesser sentence thanks in part to her weakened mental condition and poor upbringing. Per CoinMarketCap, one Bitcoin on the date of the crime was valued at $23,147. According to Bitcoin calculator Bitbo, the stolen $40,000 worth of the token would now equate to $145,271. Bitcoin Sets Price Records News of the high-profile case and Colivas’ subsequent sentencing comes amid a Bitcoin boom that has seen the token experience a surge following the election of incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump, who launched his family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, earlier this year, has been an outspoken advocate for digital assets . The former reality television has pledged to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory approach to the blockchain sector when he returns to the Oval Office next month. The Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency has soared in light of the anticipated more balanced regulatory atmosphere. Bitcoin reached a record high of over $106,000 in the past 24 hours alone.

Lookonchain revealed that the PEPE whale fetched an extraordinary return on investment. After being dormant for 600 days, the entity transferred all 2.1 trillion PEPE tokens, which are worth around $52 million, to a new address. What makes this move interesting is the initial investment: the whale spent a mere 0.0135 ETH (approximately $27 at the time) to acquire the tokens. This translates to an incredible 1,900,000x return. This transfer raises questions about the whale’s next move, whether it’s a sign of profit-taking or a strategic reshuffling of assets. PEPE, based on the beloved internet meme Pepe the Frog, has emerged as a star performer in the crypto market. The price dropped briefly after Binance delisted certain trading pairs, but, zooming out, the meme coin has surged by 1,500% over the past year alone. Despite lacking tangible use cases, meme coins like PEPE continue to mint new millionaires. In a notable example from May’s meme coin mania tied to the GameStop revival, an investor transformed a $3,000 stake into a mind-blowing $46 million – a 15,718x return. Several meme coins, including the ones that are politically and culturally inspired tokens, have also yielded life-changing returns for opportunistic traders. MAGA (TRUMP), a meme coin linked to US President-elect Donald Trump, saw a massive price resurgence in July following an attempted assassination on the presidential candidate. Lookonchain found that one savvy trader, who bought 1.08 MAGA tokens late last year, potentially sold their holdings for nearly $8 million – a jaw-dropping profit from a minimal investment. Nevertheless, meme coins remain highly volatile and risky assets, so investors should be wary when allocating funds into them.

The top crypto asset is now up more than 149% in a year and 16.5% higher over a 30-day time frame. The price jump came amid speculation that President-elect Donald Trump could issue an executive order establishing Bitcoin as a reserve asset on his first day of office on January 20. “There’s potential to use a day-one executive order to purchase Bitcoin,” Strike CEO Jack Mallers said during a recent interview , adding that while it’s unlikely to be the size and scale of a staggering 1 million coins, it would be a massive position. Notably, crypto-friendly senator Cynthia Lummis already introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024 in July, proposing that the Treasury and Federal Reserve buy 200,000 BTC per year for at least five years, accumulating a whopping 1 million Bitcoin. The BTC stockpile would be held for roughly 20 years, thus pulling 5% of the alpha crypto’s total supply from circulation. Saylor’s Bullish Reaction Reacting to Bitcoin’s fresh all-time high price mark, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor posted an AI-generated image of himself as an astronaut who landed on the moon and planted an orange flag with a BTC logo. “I will see you on the moon. #Bitcoin,” Saylor stated . Members of the BTC community responded to Saylor’s tweet positively, voicing their excitement and bullish fervor. “Moon mission confirmed. See you there, captain. #Bitcoin,” one wrote . MicroStrategy has been purchasing Bitcoin since 2020. Saylor, the orchestrator of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy, believes the world’s largest crypto by market cap is the best long-term investment. The Tyson, Virginia-based firm now holds 423,650 BTC — worth about $43.8 billion at the current price, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . Saylor has proclaimed that the firm won’t stop buying anytime soon, saying he’s “confident” he’ll still buy Bitcoin at $1 million .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/see-you-on-the-moon-michael-saylor-says-as-bitcoin-sets-new-record-high-above-106000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE.

37721897,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628331,1734365981,Ripple to launch RLUSD stablecoin tomorrow,"Ripple has finally announced that the launch of its highly-anticipated stablecoin RLUSD is all set for tomorrow. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared that the NYDFS-approved stablecoin will initially be accessible on Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA. Reportedly, the company plans to expand RLUSD’s reach to other platforms like Bitso, Bullish, and Bitstamp in the weeks to come. Meanwhile, starting next year, Ripple Payments will integrate the stablecoin into its enterprise operations, enabling global payment solutions for its corporate clients. Ripple says RLUSD is designed to support instant settlement for cross-border payments, improve liquidity in remittances, and provide a bridge between fiat and crypto. CEO Brad Garlinghouse described RLUSD as “a real step forward for crypto utility.” RLUSD will operate on both the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain. This dual-blockchain approach means the stablecoin will be versatile enough for use by banks, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and payment platforms. The stablecoin’s reserves will reportedly be audited monthly by a third party. Institutional investors are placing significant pre-launch bids, showing confidence in Ripple’s ability to execute. Ripple, though, has warned that the early days of RLUSD trading may see volatility as supply adjusts to demand. They also cautioned investors against giving into FOMO (fear of missing out). Meanwhile, Ripple’s feud with the SEC is still not over. As known, the agency claims XRP was sold as an unregistered security, a move Ripple strongly denies. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on exchanges did not. Ripple was fined $125 million for the institutional sales, far less than the $2 billion initially sought by the SEC. Ripple’s leadership framed the ruling as a partial victory, though the SEC quickly filed an appeal. The SEC’s appeal is now before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, where it argues that the July ruling conflicts with Supreme Court precedents.

This launch marks Ripple’s entry into the highly competitive $203 billion stablecoin market. The U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin will be issued on both the Ethereum blockchain and the XRP Ledger. Initially, it will be listed on select global exchanges, with plans for further expansion. However, RLUSD will not be available on Coinbase at launch. Ripple made the announcement on Monday. Ripple also revealed key appointments to its RLUSD advisory board, including a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan is all set to join the RLUSD advisory board.. Ripple Payments has processed $70 billion across 90 markets worldwide. “Part of the impetus for us wanting to launch a stablecoin is the growth we’ve seen specifically in cross border payments. As we’ve been using stablecoins more and more in our flows, that really piqued our interest that we should have our own native stablecoin that can be more cost effective and more operationally efficient to use,” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, told CNBC. RLUSD For Business: RLUSD also aims to revolutionize business payments by providing a compliant, efficient stablecoin solution. It enables payment service providers to access new markets, offers remittance and money transfer providers seamless cross-border settlements with easy fiat and crypto on/off ramps, and helps centralized exchanges boost trading volume with a trusted, transparent stablecoin.

37721801,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26541,1734365959,How Open Source Casino Software Can Enhance Flexibility and Innovation in iGaming,"If you’re a fan of online casinos, you’ve probably noticed how some games seem to be pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. From VR blackjack tables to blockchain-powered slots, the world of iGaming is evolving faster than ever. But have you ever wondered what’s behind all these innovations? Well, it might just be open-source casino software . This under-the-radar technology is slowly but surely shaking up the casino world, and in this article, we’re going to show you exactly how it’s doing that. What’s Open Source Software Anyway? In simple terms, open-source software is any software that has its source code available for free for anyone. Everybody can view, modify, and distribute it. In contrast to traditional proprietary software (like the software casinos usually pay a lot of money for), open-source software allows developers to tweak it however they want. This means more flexibility and freedom to innovate! If you’ve ever heard of Linux , WordPress , or Mozilla Firefox , you’re already familiar with open-source software. In the same way these platforms have transformed web development, a lot of casino software today is doing the same for the online gambling industry. New Ways of Operation in iGaming Open-source software is a game-changer in the iGaming industry. Traditionally, casinos relied on big software providers like Microgaming or NetEnt , which offered complete platforms with limited customization options. This meant casinos had little room for innovation. However, with open-source software, developers now have access to the entire codebase and can build platforms exactly as needed, from custom game engines to player management interfaces. For example, a small online casino operator could use an open-source platform like Odin and modify it to create a completely unique user experience. In 2023 , around 40% of new online casinos chose open-source solutions to avoid the rigid limitations of proprietary software. These platforms are also more cost-effective , removing expensive licensing fees. Open-source gambling website software also allows faster integration of new technologies like blockchain or cryptocurrencies , giving casinos a competitive edge. Platforms like OpenCasino allow developers to integrate multi-currency support and real-time player tracking, expanding into global markets. Open-source solutions provide flexibility and scalability, helping even smaller operators innovate and stay competitive in the rapidly growing iGaming industry. Key Benefits So why is this such a big deal? Let’s break it down: 1. More Flexibility Open-source casino software gives developers the freedom to customize and adapt their platforms to meet the specific needs of their business and players. For instance, let’s say a casino wants to introduce a new type of slot game with a unique bonus feature—open-source software makes that possible without having to wait for a big company to release it. You can create a game that feels tailored to your audience. One great example of this flexibility is the platform OpenCasino —a community-driven project where developers share code and build upon each other’s work. This open-source nature means a casino can add a custom jackpot system or unique bonus rounds without the restrictions typically found in proprietary software. 2. Lower Costs Anyone who has run an online casino knows that licensing fees for proprietary software can quickly add up. Big software providers charge casinos a pretty penny for access to their platforms, sometimes demanding a fixed monthly fee or a percentage of revenue. This can be tough for smaller operators to manage. Open-source casino software, on the other hand, is free to use . You only pay for the development and customization that you need. This drastically lowers initial costs, allowing small or new operators to enter the market without a huge financial burden. 3. Fosters Innovation When everyone has access to the same code, innovation goes through the roof. Open-source software creates a community-driven ecosystem where developers contribute new features, improvements, and ideas. This constant flow of new ideas pushes the industry forward, giving players fresh experiences all the time. For instance, Evolution Gaming , known for its live dealer games , started experimenting with VR (virtual reality) casinos in 2020. Using an open-source framework, they could quickly integrate new tech and test it in a live environment—pushing the envelope for what’s possible in a live casino setting. Another great example of innovation comes from CryptoGames . By using open-source software, CryptoGames integrates blockchain technology into their platform, allowing players to enjoy provably fair games . This level of transparency—where players can check the fairness of every game—would have been much harder (and expensive) to implement without open-source software. Real-World Applications Open-source casino software is revolutionizing the iGaming industry by offering greater flexibility and customization. For example, Odin Casino Engine allows operators to build fully customizable platforms, from games to payment systems, without being locked into a single provider. This has become increasingly popular, with 30% of new casinos in 2023 choosing open-source solutions for better flexibility. OpenCasino is another key player, offering multi-currency support, real-time player tracking, and seamless game integration, helping operators tailor the gaming experience. It has also been credited with increasing customer retention by 25% . Meanwhile, CryptoGames uses open-source tech to integrate blockchain, allowing for provably fair and decentralized games, which appeals to the growing cryptocurrency gambling market , projected to reach $28.9 billion in 2024. Open-source platforms foster innovation, enabling casinos to quickly adapt to new technologies, such as integrating Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions . As the industry evolves, the demand for open-source solutions is likely to grow, with operators seeking more control and customization. Platforms like Odin , OpenCasino , and CryptoGames are leading the charge in this transformation. To learn more about open-source solutions and their impact, visit https://cpa-partners.top/gambling . Bright Future So, what does the future hold for open-source software in the iGaming industry? As technology continues to evolve, we expect virtual reality (VR) , artificial intelligence (AI) , and blockchain to become more integrated into open-source casino platforms. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize the gaming experience , offering players immersive VR casinos or AI-driven games that adapt to their preferences. As the demand for mobile-friendly and cross-platform gaming continues to rise (with mobile gambling revenue projected to reach $159.6 billion by 2024 ), open-source software will play a crucial role in helping casinos provide seamless experiences on any device. Open-source solutions are flexible enough to adapt to the constantly shifting landscape of the gaming world, making them ideal for the future of iGaming. Conclusion New software is opening up new possibilities for the iGaming industry, enabling greater flexibility, fostering innovation, and cutting costs. It allows casinos to customize their platforms, experiment with new technologies, and provide players with fresh, exciting experiences. As the industry continues to evolve, open-source solutions will likely play an even bigger role in shaping the future of online gambling. So, whether you’re a casino operator looking for a more flexible solution or just a gamer who loves trying out new, innovative experiences, open-source casino software is something you should definitely keep an eye on. The future of iGaming is here, and it’s open-source!",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/how-open-source-casino-software-can-enhance-flexibility-and-innovation-in-igaming/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Cardano ( ADA ), the popular layer-1 cryptocurrency, is trading at $1.06, down nearly 20% from its highest level this year. The pullback followed a rally that pushed the coin to a multi-year high of $1.327 in November during the crypto bull run. This decline mirrors the performance of other cryptocurrencies, like Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Binance Coin ( BNB ), which have also retreated from their year-to-date highs. Cardano’s drop coincided with a decline in the total value locked (TVL) within its decentralized finance ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama , Cardano protocols now hold over $597 million in total assets, down from last month’s high of nearly $700 million. The largest protocols in its ecosystem include Liqwid, Minswap, Indigo, and Splash Protocol.

Meanwhile, open interest in the futures market has continued to decline. However, several catalysts may push Cardano’s price higher in the short term. For instance, rising crypto demand—highlighted by Bitcoin’s surge past $106,000—could support ADA. Additionally, Cardano may benefit from a potential spot ADA ETF listing as early as 2025. In the near term, the coin could also experience a boost from the “Santa Claus rally,” a phenomenon where asset prices tend to rise ahead of Christmas Day. Cardano price has formed a rare chart pattern Cardano price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ADA price staged a strong comeback in November after Donald Trump won the election . It has since slowly formed a bullish pennant chart pattern, consisting of a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. This pattern is nearing its confluence point, suggesting that a bullish breakout could occur. Cardano has also formed a golden cross pattern, where the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages have made a bullish crossover. As a result, Cardano is likely to see a strong bullish breakout in the coming days. If this happens, the coin could rise to $1.325, its highest point this year, representing a 23% increase from its current level. A drop below the support at $1.00, however, would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Although this was good news for the project, the price didn’t meet analysts’ expectations. An overview of the 30-day chart shows PEPE increased by 29.2%, which is disappointing. At the moment, the token is 12.7% down from its ATH. As a meme coin, Pepe’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment. Failing to maintain its ATH paints a picture of little to no community support. Without the backing of crypto enthusiasts, analysts anticipate Pepe price stagnation on the charts. Investors looking for gains during this bull are advised to purchase 1Fuel, as it isn’t wholly dependent on sentiment. 1Fuel has functionality such as its privacy feature, which Pepe lacks. It is currently on presale and has the potential to outperform Pepe. Dogecoin ‘s lost bark: Meme coin’s underperformance raises questions about its future Being the top dog, analysts predicted that Dogecoin would skyrocket towards the end of the year. However, the token has failed to meet these expectations. DOGE is 44.4% below its ATH of $0.7316, recorded on May 8, 2021. The price has been steady in the last 30 days on cryptocurrencies exchanges, with a slight 0.3% decline. Seeing red on the Dogecoin chart is surprising to many, as the original meme coin is often expected to lead during a bull market rally. Does this indicate that the market no longer supports Dogecoin? The short answer is ‘No.’ The market is currently consolidating, which tends to impact cryptocurrencies like DOGE that lack significant utility With DOGE being sluggish, it’s best to invest elsewhere. 1Fuel, which is currently in presale, serves as the best investment vehicle as it offers real-world utility. 1Fuel ignites interest: How its privacy features Are revolutionizing DeFi The cryptocurrency market is growing steadily. New tokens are introduced daily, but most are hype-driven rather than practical. To change financial services, blockchain tokens must have real-world value. Additionally, these tokens must provide solutions to the technological hurdles within the sector. 1Fuel is coming to rewrite the rules and introduce a whole new level of functionality. The project will create a cryptocurrency wallet that automates complex operations while ensuring top-tier security and privacy. This will allow users to interact with digital assets more confidently and comfortably. It is friendly to both new and seasoned traders. Holding 1Fuel tokens earns you a 30% staking reward. This converts investment into an ongoing revenue source. Second, there would be a peer-to-peer exchange. This function removes the middleman, allowing users to trade directly with other users. Finally, 1Fuel takes things to the next level by offering debit cards. This allows users to effortlessly spend from their cryptocurrency wallet in the real world. At the moment, 1Fuel is in its second presale stage. The first stage was a huge success as the tokens were sold out in record time. This momentum has been passed on to the second stage, as 1Fuel has sold over 13% of the tokens allocated to this stage. This is the ideal time to purchase 1Fuel as a token costs $0.012. Conclusion Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin have failed to meet market expectations. However, 1Fuel’s approach has set it on the right path for massive growth. At $0.012/token, the presale offers 1FUEL at a cheap price. Buy and watch your investment soar when 1FUEL hits the top cryptocurrency exchanges!

37721742,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628173,1734365410,Hyperliquid attract $1 billion USDC net inflow in 3 weeks,"Blockchain network Hyperliquid has recorded over $1 billion in net inflow of USDC stablecoin since its airdrop on November 29. According to data from SpotOnChain, the number of USDC within the network deposit bridge doubled over the last 17 days, increasing to $2.09 billion USDC. The massive inflow of stablecoins into the L1 network, which is also a decentralized perpetual swap trading platform with its own L1 network, highlights the massive trading activity since its token generation event (TGE). Hyperliquid cumulative USDC flows (Source: SpotOnChain ) Unlike many decentralized exchanges, Hyperliquid has distinguished itself with its order book solution, which is similar to centralized exchanges. This makes it possible to eliminate the risk of high slippage, a major issue that has plagued DEXs, which usually rely on automated market makers and liquidity providers. Interestingly, Hyperliquid’s significant growth in three weeks has made it one of the largest decentralized perpetual trading platforms in terms of total value locked (TVL) and trading volume. According to Defillama , the network TVL increased by more than 1000% in the past month to make it second-highest among all DEX platforms with $2.78 billion, only behind Uniswap, which has $6.8 billion and ahead of Solana-based Raydium. The network recorded the third-highest TVL changes behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in the last seven days. Beyond its TVL, trading activity on the platform has also been explosive. Hyperliquid recently surpassed $10 billion in 24-hour trading volume and reached an all-time high open interest of $4.3 billion. However, it has come under some criticism from some quarters, with many noting that its activity is not verifiable as it does not have an API. HYPE token reaches new ATH after 700% gains in 30 days Meanwhile, the high volume of activity on Hyperliquid has caused its HYPE token to soar in value significantly. The token, worth around $4 at the time of the airdrop, has now been up more than 700% and trading at $26.12. Its current value follows a brief period at an all-time high of $27.25 when Bitcoin climbed to $106,000. Despite the retracement, HYPE is still up 16% in the last 24 hours and looks poised to see further growth. Unsurprisingly, whales within the crypto ecosystem have made significant profits trading within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. According to Spotonchain , one wallet attributed to popular crypto trader GCR has made over $12.58 million in profit on Hyperliquid after a 397% gain. The wallet used 3.16 million USDC to acquire HYPE, HFUN, and PURR while allocating 53.7% of the funds to HYPE tokens. However, trading on the network has been mixed. Another whale, 0x9b4, lost $4.11 million, a 39% loss trading tokens on the platform. The trader’s portfolio is currently worth only $282,000, with 91.1% allocation to HFUN, 6.7% to FLASK, and 2.2% to FATCAT. What is driving Hyperliquid growth? The massive trading activity on the Hyperliquid network and its token performance are mostly due to the positive sentiment surrounding the project. Compared to the most recent airdrops, Hyperliquid’s decision to allocate 31% of the token supply to users for the first airdrop has been viewed as very generous and a sign of its community-first approach. This has translated into increased mindshare for the project within the crypto community, with many stakeholders promoting it. The HYPE token rally has also allowed many users to make millions off the airdrops, boosting its profile and value. Meanwhile, the likelihood of future airdrops also attracts more users to the network. Hyperliquid tokenomics shows that 38.88% of its supply has been set aside for future emissions, leading many to believe that there will be other airdrops and that activity on the network has increased significantly. This contrasts with most crypto projects, where airdrop events usually lead to declining activity and prices.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A veteran trader predicts Bitcoin at $150K and Ethereum at $5K by summer, spotlighting 5 altcoins primed for big gains. The crypto market is on the cusp of a seismic shift as a veteran trader predicts Bitcoin’s surge to $150,000 and Ethereum’s climb to $5,000 by summer. These ambitious projections come alongside a focus on five altcoins that could mirror this bullish momentum. From unique meme coins like Catzilla to established players like Solana and Uniswap, these assets are set to capitalize on the anticipated market upswing, drawing the attention of savvy investors eager for substantial returns. Catzilla: The roaring meme coin set to shake the crypto world The meme coin arena is brimming with fresh contenders, but Catzilla is carving out a unique niche with unmatched potential. Drawing inspiration from icons like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) , and PEPE, Catzilla combines meme-worthy fun with robust growth strategies. Its standout feature? A bold narrative of a colossal, Godzilla-like cat tearing through cities—a nod to Japanese kaiju culture that fuels its viral appeal. But Catzilla isn’t just about the memes. It merges gaming, storytelling, and crypto, capturing the attention of anime enthusiasts, gamers, and meme coin investors alike. This chaotic yet clever branding positions Catzilla as more than just a passing trend — it’s a movement. You might also like: Catzilla coin: Traders draw parallels to PNUT’s recent success Built for longevity, not just hype While many meme coins burn out quickly, Catzilla aims for sustainability with an ambitious ROI target of 700%. Its presale, structured across 14 stages, gradually increases token prices, offering early investors a golden opportunity. This tiered approach builds excitement and ensures a steady influx of support from the community. Triple value proposition: Gameplay, mission, and community Catzilla isn’t just another token—it’s an experience. With its action-packed game mechanics, players can earn rewards while diving into a world of epic kaiju battles. At its core, Catzilla champions a mission to create a decentralized, inclusive ecosystem, uniting its vibrant community of cat lovers, crypto enthusiasts, and anime fans. Join the Catzilla uprising As a symbol of resistance against greed and manipulation in the crypto world, Catzilla embodies a rebellious spirit that resonates with its audience. Its playful yet purpose-driven mission seeks to restore the original ethos of meme coins: fun, community-driven, and transparent. Uniswap poised for a bullish breakout amid altcoin season hype Uniswap’s price has surged over 100% in the past month, signaling strong upward momentum. Despite a slight pullback of around 8% this week, UNI remains above key support levels. The Relative Strength Index is 46.28, suggesting there’s room for growth. With the nearest resistance at $23.88, breaking through could propel the price toward the next target of $30.92. This represents a potential gain of over 40% from current levels. As the crypto market gears up for a new altcoin season, Uniswap’s decentralized exchange platform positions it favorably to capture market interest and possibly lead the next rally. Solana poised for growth amid altcoin season anticipation Solana (SOL) has been trading between $219.27 and $251.07. The coin recently saw a monthly price increase of 4.66% and a substantial six-month rise of 53.02%. With an RSI near the neutral mark, Solana is neither overbought nor oversold. The slight negative MACD suggests potential upward movement. If SOL breaks the nearest resistance at $264, it could target the next level at $296, representing a possible gain of around 20%. The simple moving averages show consolidation, with the 10-day at $220.35 and the 100-day at $224.51. The anticipated altcoin season might propel Solana’s price even higher. Raydium poised for growth amidst altcoin season hype Raydium’s price ranges between $4.64 and $5.33, showing steady movement. The nearest resistance level is at $5.68; breaking this could lead to a rise toward $6.38. The nearest support is at $4.30, providing a safety net. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $5.29 and $5.38, suggesting consolidation. The RSI stands at 46.62, indicating neutral momentum. In the past six months, RAY’s price has increased by 234.18%, reflecting significant growth. If the altcoin season gains momentum, RAY might continue its upward trend. However, market indicators show mixed signals, so monitoring the price action is essential. Cronos poised for breakout as altcoin season nears Over the past week, Cronos (CRO) dipped by over 13%, but monthly gains are close to 17%, and the past six months show an impressive 86% growth. The price is currently between $0.1725 and $0.2311. Technical indicators like RSI at 43.58 and Stochastic at 17.62 suggest the coin is oversold. The nearest resistance is at $0.2616. If CRO breaks this level, it could move towards the next resistance at $0.3202, offering potential gains of over 40%. With altcoin season approaching and a global crypto bull run expected, CRO has strong potential to rise significantly. Conclusion As the crypto market braces for a potential breakout, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s projected milestones could set the stage for altcoin dominance. Tokens like Catzilla, with its engaging narrative and robust ROI potential, and established assets like Uniswap, Solana, Raydium, and Cronos, are uniquely positioned to benefit from the anticipated bullish trends. Whether someone is seeking meme coin thrills or the stability of seasoned altcoins, this lineup offers diverse opportunities to ride the wave of crypto’s next big rally.

37722697,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319850,1734365142,Grayscale Faces $21 Billion Exodus as Spot Bitcoin ETFs Flourish,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has recorded $21 billion in outflows since its launch on January 11, according to the data posted by Farside . Currently, it is the only U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a negative net investment flow. Despite GBTC’s challenges, the overall spot Bitcoin ETF market has flourished, attracting more than $35.5 billion in investments in under a year. This stark contrast highlights the growing demand for Bitcoin exposure through other regulated ETFs, even as GBTC struggles to keep pace. GBTC Outflows Are Larger Than Other ETFs’ Inflows According to Farside data, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has suffered daily outflows averaging $89.9 million over the past 11 months. It amounts to $21.045 billion in losses since its launch in January 2024. 𝗕𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗶𝗻 𝗘𝗧𝗙 𝗙𝗹𝗼𝘄 (𝗨𝗦$ 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻) – 2024-12-13 TOTAL NET FLOW: 428.9 IBIT: 393 FBTC: 60 BITB: 33.2 ARKB: 28.4 BTCO: 0 EZBC: 0 BRRR: 0 HODL: 8.6 BTCW: 7 GBTC: -105.8 BTC: 4.5 For all the data & disclaimers visit: https://t.co/Wg6Qpn0Pqw — Farside Investors (@FarsideUK) December 14, 2024 Meanwhile, nine other spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in the U.S. have secured $20.737 billion in positive net investments. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF have contributed to this growth, alongside offerings from Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, WisdomTree, and even Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF. Despite these successes, the combined inflows of these funds still fall short of offsetting the massive outflows from GBTC. GBTC ETF outflows overshadow nine other Bitcoin ETFs BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a key player reshaping the market. This fund has emerged as a dominant force. It attracted an impressive $35.883 billion in inflows, with an average daily intake of $153.3 million since its launch. The overall investor confidence in BlackRock’s offering has pushed the total spot Bitcoin ETF market to exceed $35.5 billion in investments within a year. Grayscale’s GBTC ETF current struggles are particularly striking, given its pivotal role in pioneering the Bitcoin ETFs . The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11, marking a major regulatory shift after years of rejecting similar applications. The change was primarily compelled by a court ruling in favor of Grayscale in 2023 , a victory many thought would solidify its position in the market. BREAKING: There it is, @Grayscale wins their lawsuit against the SEC. DC Circuit court of appeals is vacating SEC's denial of $GBTC 's conversion into an ETF. pic.twitter.com/gqFvMpmfnm — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 29, 2023 However, the fund’s rapid outflows suggest otherwise. Investor confidence appears to have shifted elsewhere. The challenges extend beyond Bitcoin. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) now mirrors the struggles of its Bitcoin counterpart. Farside data details that the ETHE fund has recorded losses exceeding $3.5 billion since its launch in July 2024. This contrasts sharply with the positive inflows seen across other spot Ether ETFs, where BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) lead the market with $3.2 billion and $1.4 billion in investments, respectively. Grayscale Pursues Multi-Crypto Fund Approval Amidst Bitcoin ETF Outflows As Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust and Ethereum funds continue to face major outflows, the crypto asset manager is exploring new opportunities, which include a reported focus on a broader, multi-crypto offering . On October 14, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed a request on behalf of Grayscale to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This over-the-counter trading fund currently holds a diversified portfolio. It includes major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, and Avalanche. This move marks a significant step for Grayscale. The company already manages several funds: GBTC Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) Ethereum Trust (ETHE) Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) By launching a multi-token ETF, Grayscale aims to cater to the growing investor demand for diversified crypto exposure. It offers a broader range of assets in a single fund. However, its success will largely depend on whether it can restore trust among investors disillusioned by the poor performance of its previous funds.

To ensure transparency, an independent auditing firm will conduct monthly certifications of RLUSD’s reserve assets, which will be published for public review. The launch puts Ripple in direct competition with other stablecoin issuers, including Tether, Circle, and Ethena, as well as fintech giant PayPal, which recently launched its own stablecoin. With a supply of over $140 billion, Tether remains the market leader in the stablecoin space. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the company’s regulatory approach in his statement, stating that RLUSD was developed under the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) limited purpose trust company statute. “Ripple made a conscious choice early on to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS regulation, which is widely recognized as the leading regulatory standard worldwide,” Garlinghouse said. “As the U.S. moves toward clearer regulation, we expect to see increased adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD.” RLUSD will run on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains at launch, with plans to expand its reach to additional blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in the future. *This is not investment advice.

42416823,e6d23097-aa04-4fc8-a641-4c546c930871,1734364967,2024 Was the Year of Breaking Through,"I will remember 2024 as the year blockchain broke through. The transformations started early and just kept coming. What’s astounding to me is that at no time during this year did the overall direction or the market change. The only thing that happened was constant acceleration.    At the end of 2023, we already knew that 2024 was looking likely to turn out well. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MICA) act was going to come into effect. This created a legal framework for crypto-assets, real-world assets and stablecoins in Europe. We were already seeing business turn up across the region in anticipation of this transformation.    And then as we entered 2024, the hits just kept on coming. The first Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision to officially approve the Bitcoin ETF came 10 days into the year, followed by Ethereum in May. By the middle of the year, the conversation shifted from one of two cool things happening to a more general vision of global regulatory convergence: everywhere around the world, crypto, digital assets and stablecoins are becoming legally accessible to individuals and enterprises.    As if things were not going well enough, a string of regulatory and legal successes in the U.S. was capped off by an election that, among many other things, has sealed the direction and fate of this industry. It is not an exaggeration to say that on the morning of Nov. 6, the world of blockchain looked vastly different.    What was a gradual shift towards regulatory approvals, public blockchains and legalized digital assets has become a sprint. Most importantly, permissioned blockchains, tokenized deposits and other aspects of the blockchain ecosystem that existed solely because they were seen as more acceptable to regulators than public blockchains have all lost their market value and position. Clients that were cautious in October now suddenly worry that they are losing an intensely competitive race.    Two months ago, the U.S. was a laggard in global regulatory convergence. Today, the prospects are that the U.S. will accelerate significantly and, possibly, leave other parts of the world behind in a rapid path towards acceptance and scaling of digital assets. Early cabinet picks and appointments in Trump’s administration announced already, show a strong pro-crypto and digital assets bias, though none of these will take effect until 2025.    Furthermore, on Nov. 26, a federal appeals court rejected efforts by the Treasury Department to sanction Tornado Cash, a piece of privacy software used to make anonymous payments. The Treasury alleges that this technology was used to launder money for North Korea. Advocates for crypto technology did not dispute that but argued that the Treasury should go after individuals or entities responsible rather than a particular piece of software, especially one that operates on a decentralized network with no specific owner or operator. The U.S. and Europe are still pursuing cases against individuals who are deemed responsible.    Privacy technology is going to be especially important in driving future adoption of blockchain technology among enterprises and institutions. Tornado Cash was never an attractive option for business users, as it intertwined two different concepts: privacy and anonymity. Business users are not looking for anonymous payments and transfers, but they do, however, need to keep details from their competition. A favorable court ruling on privacy generally will make business users feel more comfortable leveraging privacy technologies on-chain.    It would be great to end the story of 2024 here. A happy ending. But there are storm clouds on the horizon and there’s no sense in ignoring them. The blockchain industry has traditionally always delivered, often around the holidays, a series of “gifts” for the industry’s critics. Usually this is in the form of spectacular frauds, thefts, or business collapses.    This year, though we haven’t yet had the kind of collapse that will push politics off the table at holiday gatherings, we do seem to be speed-running the traditional crypto business cycle.    If you’ve been following pump.fun, you will have seen the casino-like atmosphere that’s taken hold. People have been chaining themselves to toilets and inventing memes to create tradeable tokens and make money. It’s all (sometimes) very funny until someone loses their child’s college fund.    Don’t let a few clouds on the horizon spoil the good end of year vibes. 2024 was an exceptional year for blockchain. We didn’t change direction, but we started moving a lot faster. 2025 will see revolution by acceleration and plenty of sunshine.

RLUSD will be initially listed on several exchanges and crypto platforms including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax and CoinMENA, the company said in a press release, with further listings on Bitso, Bullish, Bitstamp, Mercado Bitcoin and Independent Reserve, Zero Hash and others in the coming weeks.  The company also announced two additions to its stablecoin advisory board: Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former first vice president and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The pair join board members announced in October including Sheila Bair, former chair of FDIC, and Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman and co-founder of Ripple.  The launch follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's announcement last week that RLUSD sealed ""final approval"" from the New York Department of Financial Services, paving the way for rolling out the stablecoin for the public from its test phase. RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds and cash equivalents and aims to keep a steady price at $1.  With RLUSD, Ripple aims to compete for a piece in the rapidly growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether's $140 billion USDT and Circle's $40 billion USDC tokens. Stablecoins are a key piece of infrastructure bridging digital asset markets and traditional finance, serving as liquidity for trading, vehicle for blockchain-based transactions and increasingly as a payment method across borders. Traditional financial institutions such as banks and payment companies including PayPal, Visa and Societe Generale have also entered the stablecoin space as regulators around the world put rules and guidelines in place for the asset class, bringing much-desired regulatory clarity.  “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement. ""As the U.S. moves toward clearer regulations, we expect to see greater adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD, which offer real utility and are backed by years of trust and expertise in the industry.""  RLUSD will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK and Middle East regions via its distribution and exchange partners, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple, said in an interview with CoinDesk. He was CEO of Standard Custody & Trust, a company acquired by Ripple earlier this year that holds a New York Trust license.  The token won't be accessible in the E.U. in the beginning as Ripple does not hold the necessary license under the bloc's MiCAR regulations, but the company is ""actively exploring"" ways to enter the bloc's market, he added.  RLUSD volatility warning  RLUSD, which aims to hold a $1 price, may see an unusual price volatility due to early demand from traders and limited supply.  ""There may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes,"" David Schwartz, chief technology officer at Ripple, warned in an X post. He said that some traders ""are willing to pay"" as much as $1,200 token price to buy a fraction of RLUSD.  ""Please don't FOMO into a stablecoin,"" he added. ""This is not an opportunity to get rich.""",POSITIVE,XRP,FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | XRP,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/16/ripple-to-roll-out-rlusd-stablecoin-on-dec-17-adds-former-central-bankers-to-advisory-board,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ac05e480cdc38e64f6cccbbfec7ba237da454e8-4636x2608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37721113,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662801,1734364801,Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K?,"Bitcoin has shattered its all-time high, reaching $106,500 just a few hours ago, setting the stage for an even bigger move. After trading in a sideways range within an ascending triangle for weeks, the price finally broke through the crucial $103,600 resistance level established on December 5. This breakout has sparked renewed excitement, with traders and investors now eyeing Bitcoin’s next potential targets. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Top analyst Jelle shared his insights on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s breakout from the ascending triangle is a clear bullish signal. According to his technical analysis, the pattern indicates significant upside potential, with Jelle setting a $130,000 price target for BTC in the coming weeks. He noted that the breakout marks a shift in market sentiment, paving the way for sustained momentum as Bitcoin continues its climb. This milestone solidifies Bitcoin’s dominant position in the crypto market as the leading asset, attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors. Now, the focus turns to whether BTC can maintain its bullish momentum and how quickly it might reach the $130,000 target. The market awaits the next move, with analysts emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin holding above its previous resistance to sustain this historic rally. Bitcoin Price Remains Strong Bitcoin has been consolidating around the $100,000 mark since late November, creating a tense atmosphere among investors who are now speculating about a potential correction. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price action remains firmly bullish, with consistent support above key levels, suggesting that the uptrend is far from over. The consolidation phase, while uneventful on the surface, often sets the stage for significant moves. Top analyst Jelle recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting that Bitcoin has broken out of an ascending triangle formation—a bullish continuation pattern that signals further upside potential. Following this breakout, Bitcoin has re-entered price discovery, pushing beyond its previous all-time high and igniting fresh excitement among market participants. Jelle has set an ambitious $130,000 target for Bitcoin, emphasizing that the breakout could accelerate the asset’s momentum in the coming weeks. As Bitcoin’s rally progresses, the broader market dynamics are likely to shift, with altcoins historically following BTC’s lead during bull runs. Analysts and investors anticipate that once Bitcoin resumes its climb, the altcoin market will respond with its own significant gains, marking the start of another euphoric phase for the crypto space.

Testing Fresh Supply Into Price Discovery Bitcoin is trading at $105,100 after reaching a new all-time high at $106,533 earlier today. The price broke above the critical $102,200 resistance, a level that had previously capped upward movements. This breakout has reignited bullish momentum, signaling that Bitcoin could be on track for even higher prices. For the rally to sustain, the $102,200 level must now act as support, providing a solid foundation for the next leg up. If Bitcoin holds above this level, traders anticipate continuing toward higher targets, with $110,000 and beyond within reach. However, market volatility remains a concern. A loss of the psychological $100,000 mark could signal underlying weakness, leading to a potential correction. In such a scenario, BTC might retrace to test lower demand zones, possibly around $95,000, before finding renewed support. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? Despite the risks, Bitcoin’s bullish structure remains intact as long as key levels hold. The breakout above $102,200 highlights strong buying interest, and many analysts believe this could be the start of an extended rally. However, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can maintain its momentum or if it will face a short-term pullback. For now, the market is closely watching for Bitcoin’s next move.

PNUT is one such coin that has gained maximum traction by over 1000% within a few days of its launch. If you’ve missed the profit-making opportunity through the PNUT, here’s the next memecoin that is going to revolutionize. Header, a quirky and entertaining meme coin built on the unpredictable nature of chickens, has officially hatched on Solana. Flap, flutter, and get ready to soar into the wild nest of cryptocurrencies with Header! It is about to launch and will skyrocket by over 1000% in a few days. Headerworld Launches the Quirky HEADER The Header meme coin is launched on the idea that chickens are the ultimate metaphor for success. Chickens represent huge opportunities as they hustle and survive on Earth and even on Mars! In a parallel universe, President-elect Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk entered into a bizarre yet memorable conversation. The light-hearted conversation spiraled into a meme, and fans demanded a meme token. And there marks the birth of HEADER. The meme originates from Trump’s recent advocacy for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. His promise to transform the US into a market leader and Musk’s aid has caught the community’s attention. Inspired by these influential figures’ support for the crypto space, HEADER is here to make history! Memecoin Market The $133.3 billion meme coin market has seen a rollercoaster ride, with the top tokens plummeting. Popular meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), dogwifcat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI) have experienced notable declines. Meanwhile, the Solana-based Pnut, the Squirrel (PNUT), took center stage, rallying by over 2000% since its launch. PNUT’s Remarkable Journey Amidst the overarching downtrend in the crypto market in general, and memecoins in particular, PNUT bucked the trend, marking notable gains. The token was launched at the onset of November 2024, inspired by a pet squirrel named Peanut. While the squirrel’s euthanasia for a rabies test caused controversy, Musk called it the “government overreach” and called out Trump to save the squirrels. Later, Musk’s reference to a cryptic Squirrel meme took PNUT to an astonishing jump. How will these high-profile leaders’ involvement in HEADER influence the token?! HEADER: The Beginning of a New Trend The HEADER token relies on Trump’s deal to make everything great and Musk’s aim of taking everything to Mars. Unlike other meme coins, HEADER leverages the unmatched combination of Trump's deal-making prowess and Musk's vision for space conquest. This unusual blend of personalities highlights the project's ambitious targets, setting it apart from the rest of the memecoin space. Tokenomics and Presale: Empowering a New Era of Innovation HEADER is committed to making a lasting impact, with a staggering 1 trillion token supply and 0% tax. The community is excited with the news of a 40% token presale, priced at an unbeatable 0.0000000075 SOL. To participate, investors must purchase a minimum of 0.05 SOL worth of tokens. The presale aims to raise a minimum of 300 SOL (soft cap) and a maximum of 3000 SOL (hard cap). Interestingly, the team has allocated 46% of tokens for DEX listing, liquidity, and community airdrop, ensuring a strong foundation for the project's growth. In addition, a 10% is scheduled for the marketing, events, and listing. And finally, the team will retain a 4%. Moreover, in a surprise twist, a mystery event will be unveiled when the hard cap is reached. Header Coin’s Use Cases The Header token is launched to redefine the blockchain space with its innovative use cases, leveraging the Solana network. The ecosystem provides unparalleled speed and utility to the holders. Being a community-powered coin, HEADER boasts a vivacious online culture. The dedicated community of supporters and developers collaborate to drive adoption and enhance its utility, creating a rich and dynamic ecosystem that continues to evolve and grow. Conclusion While new memecoins are launched daily, the HEADER token is set to leave its mark in the sphere with its unique blend of humor, innovation, and ambition. With its impressive tokenomics, engaging community, and commitment to crossing the boundaries, HEADER is set to redefine how we think about memecoins.

The network has been prepping for these changes for months, with new features that will cut the costs for sending transactions, operating validators and building applications on the network.  Leaders at Avalanche have previously told CoinDesk that part of the goal with the upgrade is to attract developers to Avalanche and encourage them to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets, or “L1s"".     The upgrade, also referred to as the Etna upgrade, consisted of seven improvement proposals. The two biggest changes that were implemented were known as ACP-77 and ACP-125.   ACP-77 is a proposal that introduces a new type of validator, so users can launch their own subnets. These new nodes are less costly to operate, with the aim of therefore bringing in more people to spin them up and create their own Avalanche-based networks.    ACP-125 lowers the base fee on Avalanche’s main network that runs smart contracts, known as the C-chain, from 25 nAVAX (about $0.00000098) to 1 nAVAX ($0.00000004.) The goal is to make it cheaper to compute on that network. One nAVAX equals one-billionth of one AVAX. (Avalanche has two other main chains:the P-chain, where users can stake AVAX and operate validators; and the X-chain, which is used for sending and receiving funds.)    The Avalanche Foundation announced that ahead of the upgrade, it raised $250 million in a token sale, led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital.

37721037,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628219,1734364236,Binance accused of IP theft over PNUT token by Peanut the Squirrel owner,"Mark Longo, owner of the Peanut the Squirrel brand, has issued a cease-and-desist letter to cryptocurrency exchange Binance, accusing the platform of trademark infringement in relation to its PNUT-themed memecoin. In a filing shared on X by Longo, the owner claims Binance unlawfully used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness to promote the PNUT crypto coin without authorization. According to the complaint from his legal team, Longo has operated under the PNUT brand since 2017, focusing on educational outreach and animal welfare. The cease-and-desist letter demands that Binance immediately halt all use of the PNUT marks and mascot imagery. If the exchange does not comply, Longo’s attorneys will reportedly push for it to pay fines of up to $150,000 per infringement. Source: CoinMarketCap The PNUT token initially gained traction after being listed on Binance but has since seen fluctuating performance. At press time, per CoinMarketCap data, PNUT’s price has declined by about 9% from its value 24 hours ago and about 19% in the last 30 days. Longo disputes PNUT token branding Longo’s legal team alleges that Binance used the terms “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL” and “PNUT,” as well as a copyrighted image of Longo’s squirrel mascot, without permission. The branding associated with the PNUT memecoin reportedly mimics Longo’s mascot, creating confusion among consumers and falsely suggesting Longo’s endorsement. Source: Squirrel_Dad via X The PNUT token launched in early November, gaining rapid popularity amid a controversial backstory. The memecoin draws inspiration from a pet squirrel named Peanut, who became the center of public outrage after being euthanized by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) during a rabies-testing operation. Binance has not yet publicly responded to the allegations outlined in Longo’s cease-and-desist letter. Peanut had reportedly lived indoors for years and exhibited no signs of the disease, leading critics, including Elon Musk and President-elect Trump, to denounce the incident as unnecessary. The uproar surrounding Peanut’s death quickly garnered massive attention online, with Musk provocatively commenting that “Donald Trump would save the squirrels.” The controversy, coupled with the token’s viral appeal, spurred significant interest in PNUT. Early adopters of the token saw meteoric gains as the coin’s price surged during its initial market bull run. Battle with the crypto community Despite its success, Longo has accused the PNUT community of exploiting his story for financial gain. In a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), Longo stated, “ The $PNUT community USED MY STORY, MY SQUIRREL, AND MY LIKENESS TO MAKE MILLIONS! ” He also claimed the PNUT community raised $50,000 in donations on his behalf but misappropriated the funds. Furthermore, he says he received no substantial support despite the token’s financial success. It’s insane! He asks insane amounts of money to people, and Mark if you are reading this, do not deny please because that will just make it ugly! The community token @OGpeanut_sol gave you money, as a support donation to the cause of Peanut! You think you can just do this and… — Dennis ‘The Crypto Lion King’ (@TheL1onK1ngCryp) November 25, 2024 In response to the controversy, Longo launched his own token, JUSTICE, on the Solana blockchain. He described JUSTICE as the only legitimate tribute to Peanut and another squirrel named Fred, aiming to reclaim his story. A few weeks after JUSTICE was launched, news surfaced about insider trading, and analysts raised concerns about a potential 80% of its supply being controlled by “insiders.” As seen in several replies to the cease and desist filing post on X, the community threatened to sue Lango for the “farms and rugs.” he’s supposedly involved in, citing memecoins such as Justice for Peanut, a token that performed rather poorly since its inception. Should I sue you too, you shameless liar? The FBI should shoot you dead and let you go to heaven with your squirrels. pic.twitter.com/SgfZw7ogzw — 六子 | 搞笑小猫.sol🦄🀄 (@0x_CryptoFury) December 16, 2024 One user explained how PNUT came into the market to “bring attention” to Lango’s cause, and without it, not many would have been aware of his story. Community-driven memecoin tokens thrive on viral stories, memes, or cultural references to attract widespread attention and investor enthusiasm. They typically rely on decentralized networks, with branding and marketing often shaped by the community rather than a centralized authority. Longo’s lawsuit could be dismissed if the PNUT token’s creators argue that their branding constitutes fair use or parody, common defenses in the memecoin space. Additionally, due to the decentralized nature of the token, Binance may argue that it merely facilitated the trading of the asset rather than creating or endorsing it.

How the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Help National Debt ProblemFor context, the model assumes that by 2025, the U.S. Treasury starts acquiring 1 million Bitcoin over a five-year period at an average price of $250,000 per BTC. This is in line with Senator Cynthia Lummis' proposal. https://twitter.com/matthew_sigel/status/1862573243795714242Sigel also assumes that the national debt will grow at 5% annually—a reduction compared to the past decade's 8% compounded growth rate—reaching approximately $119.3 trillion by 2049. Additionally, he estimates Bitcoin's price to grow at 25% annually, much lower than its historical 50% 10-year compound annual growth rate. Under these assumptions, the value of the Bitcoin reserve by 2049 would reach $52.9 trillion, equivalent to 44.4% of the projected national debt. This analysis has fueled further discussions. Some questioned whether a 25% annual growth rate for Bitcoin is realistic over 25 years. Sigel pointed out Bitcoin's historical performance but suggested lowering the projection to 20% CAGR, which would still result in the reserve holding 30% of federal debt. He further stated that even if debt growth increased to 10% annually, Bitcoin's 25% CAGR would still lead to the reserve accounting for about 15% of U.S. debt. Bitcoin Reserve Discussions Gaining MomentumNotably, the proposal for a Bitcoin reserve has gained traction among U.S. policymakers. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill earlier this year proposing the U.S. government acquire 1 million Bitcoin, or roughly 5% of Bitcoin's total supply, to stabilize its fiscal position. Lummis has argued that Bitcoin's finite supply and consistent appreciation make it an ideal asset to counter rising deficits. She compared this plan to the Louisiana Purchase, describing it as an important moment for U.S. economic security. The bill is under consideration for bipartisan debate. While some lawmakers recognize Bitcoin's potential as a long-term reserve asset, others are skeptical about its volatility. However, Lummis is optimistic. Forthcoming president Donald Trump himself has voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve, describing it as part of his broader plan to make the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. Meanwhile, at the state level, Pennsylvania has already introduced a bill to allocate 10% of the state's fund to a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Similarly, Texas lawmakers have also proposed the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1867256781254373611Globally, countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as a national reserve asset. Bhutan has continued to purchase and distribute Bitcoin. Also, a Russian lawmaker has presented the idea of the country adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/16/vaneck-research-head-details-how-a-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-could-help-the-us-debt-problem/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vaneck-research-head-details-how-a-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-could-help-the-us-debt-problem,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This highlights improving investor sentiment toward the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. The Market: Zooming Out According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , overall, digital asset investment products saw $3.2 billion in inflows last week. This was the 10th consecutive week of positive momentum, bringing total inflows this year to a whopping $44.5 billion – over four times higher than any previous year. ETPs have seen weekly trading volumes averaging $21 billion, making up 30% of Bitcoin trading on trusted exchanges. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume across all investment types on trusted exchanges averaged $8.3 billion this year, twice that of the FTSE 100. Interestingly, Bitcoin investment products contributed $2 billion to the weekly inflows, reaching $11.5 billion since the US election. Amidst recent price surges, short Bitcoin products gained $14.6 million, although assets under management (AuM) for this category remain modest at $130 million. XRP Sees Renewed Interest After Ethereum, XRP was the biggest winner among the altcoins, seeing inflows of $145 million as hopes rose for a US-listed ETF. Another factor that could have catalyzed this trend was the imminent debut of Ripple’s newly NYDFS-approved stablecoin RLUSD. Next up was Litecoin, with $2.2 million in inflows over the past week, followed by Cardano with $1.9 million and Solana with $1.7 million. Additionally, Binance and Chainlink attracted $0.7 million in inflows each. On the other hand, multi-asset products faced yet another setback, with $31 million in outflows during the same period. Meanwhile, there was a positive trend across regions, with inflows recorded in all areas. The US topped the list with $3.14 billion in inflows. Next up were Switzerland with $35.6 million and Germany with $32.9 million over the past week. Brazil also saw strong inflows of $24.7 million, with Hong Kong, Canada, and Australia adding $9.7 million, $4.9 million, and $3.8 million, respectively. In contrast, Sweden faced outflows of $19 million.

37722696,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319861,1734363735,"Bitcoin Suisse Predicts BTC Will Trade Above $180,000 in 2025","Bitcoin ( BTC ) could reach new all-time highs in 2025, trading above $180,000, according to Bitcoin Suisse , a Swiss financial services provider specialising in cryptocurrencies. This forecast was made in Bitcoin Suisse’s “Crypto Outlook 2025” and is based on a confluence of factors, including improving macroeconomic conditions, the emergence of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin in 2025: Macro Trends and Institutional Adoption Are Key Drivers In 2025, Bitcoin Suisse expects a “soft landing” for the global economy, characterized by easing inflation, stable financial conditions, and a shift toward supply-side economic policies. This environment is expected to favor risky assets such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin Suisse Predictions for 2025 Prediction #1 Macro conditions will fundamentally ease and support a soft landing. pic.twitter.com/ZSiUxf453Q — Bitcoin Suisse (@BitcoinSuisseAG) December 16, 2024 The report also highlights growing momentum for Bitcoin adoption as a strategic reserve asset in the US and other countries. Initiatives such as the Lummis Bitcoin Act , which proposes the acquisition of 1 million Bitcoin by the US government, could significantly boost demand. Only around 5% of Bitcoin supply remains to be mined. Source: Bitcoin Suisse’s Crypto Outlook 2025 US states are also increasingly exploring Bitcoin investments, with Florida and Pennsylvania “ambitious” acquiring it directly while Michigan and Wisconsin opt for a more cautious approach through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and trusts. This growing public and private sector adoption further solidifies Bitcoin’s role in treasury management, the report said. Companies are increasingly integrating cryptocurrencies into their operations. Source: Bitcoin Suisse’s Crypto Outlook 2025 Bitcoin Suisse analysts also noted that Bitcoin’s neutrality is attracting global interest, particularly from nations such as Russia and China . These countries see Bitcoin as a solution to financial challenges, both as a hedge against potential US dollar instability and as a solution to pressing financial obstacles (sanctions). Institutional Flows Fuel Bitcoin’s Rise The report further emphasized the need for a hard monetary anchor like Bitcoin, especially given the significant loss of purchasing power in major fiat currencies since 2000. It also pointed out the crucial role Bitcoin could play in addressing mounting sovereign debt challenges. With US federal debt soaring, the report suggested that Bitcoin’s compound annual growth rate could offer governments a powerful tool to offset debt. In addition, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has attracted institutional capital, contributing to price stability and higher valuations. Bitcoin Suisse predicts continued institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs in 2025, further driving up the BTC price . Altcoins Take Center Stage in 2025 Bitcoin Suisse’s 2025 outlook also presents a bullish outlook for altcoins, especially in the first half of 2025. Bitcoin Suisse predicts that altcoin season will peak in the first half of 2025, with the total altcoin market capitalization potentially increasing by 5x. Market cap projections for BTC, ETH, and altcoins. Source: Bitcoin Suisse’s Crypto Outlook 2025 This surge is expected to occur as Bitcoin approaches its cycle peak valuation, leading to capital rotation into altcoins. This pattern aligns with historical market cycles where altcoins outperform during the final phases of Bitcoin’s bull run. The analysts expect Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) to be key outperformers during this period, maintaining relative strength against Bitcoin due to their increasing importance in the crypto ecosystem. ETH and SOL are predicted to outperform, maintaining strength against BTC. Source: Bitcoin Suisse’s Crypto Outlook 2025 Staking ETFs and Rollups: Ethereum’s 2025 Outlook Additionally, the report predicts that Ether staking ETFs will attract significant institutional capital, potentially exceeding the market cap adjusted flows of Bitcoin ETFs. This is anticipated once regulatory hurdles surrounding staking yields in ETFs are cleared under the new US administration. The bank expects Ethereum’s monetary policy to remain stable in 2025, with no changes to the issuance rate of staking rewards. Despite discussions about adjusting Ethereum’s issuance to address concerns about excessive staking ratios, the Bitcoin Suisse analysts believe that maintaining a predictable monetary policy will enhance ETH’s appeal as a store of value. Bitcoin Suisse also predicts that by 2025, major financial institutions will launch their own “rollups” on Ethereum – solutions that increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput and reduce costs while inheriting Ethereum’s security. Firedancer and Beyond: Solana’s Path to Dominance in 2025 Bitcoin Suisse also expects Solana to solidify its position as “as premiere general purpose smart contract platform” (GPSCP) in 2025. This is attributed to several key developments, such as the Firedancer upgrade which should improve network robustness by introducing a multi-client system. Additionally, Solana is focused on fundamental improvements, addressing areas like state growth mitigation, state contention handling, and enhanced scalability and security. “While we don’t expect to see all these improvements fully realized in 2025, the partial shift from a “move fast and break things” approach to more focus on strategic fundamental improvements involving independent teams makes us confident on the sustainable success of Solana as a premiere GPSCP,” the analysts wrote in the report, adding: “This will manifest in Solana maintaining its place as a platform of choice for DeFi and DePIN founders, and becoming more attractive for institutional tokenized asset issuers, which is crucial for fully realizing the potential of a permissionless, global state machine synchronized at the speed of light.” Overall, the report paints a positive picture for altcoins, highlighting their growth potential as regulatory clarity improves and institutional adoption increases: “The convergence of Bitcoin’s peak valuations, Ethereum’s expansion, and the anticipated capital rotation into altcoins underpins the case for a deep altcoin season in H1 2025. This period will present significant opportunities for outsized returns, with select assets poised for exponential growth.” The post Bitcoin Suisse Predicts BTC Will Trade Above $180,000 in 2025 appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-suisse-predicts-btc-will-trade-above-180k-in-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37722696.jpeg
37720529,https://crypto.news/?p=14319881,1734363489,Riot upsized Bitcoin holdings by $69m,"Major Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms added $69 million worth of the world’s leading cryptocurrency to its holdings. According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings , Riot Platforms bought 667 Bitcoin ( BTC ), increasing its total crypto holdings to 17,429 BTC. Riot acquired this tranche at an average price of $101,135 per coin, bringing the total value of its Bitcoin balance to nearly $2 billion at the December 16 peak price of $106,000. The company began mining Bitcoin in 2018 at its Oklahoma facility after shifting its corporate focus. Inspired by MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor’s “sell shares, buy BTC” strategy, Riot expanded its approach to include Bitcoin purchases and share buybacks, further growing its crypto reserves.

Despite ongoing debates surrounding the Saylor-instigated practice, BTC miners like Riot and other corporations have increasingly offered share rights to raise capital for Bitcoin purchases, albeit less aggressively than MicroStrategy. Riot recently closed a $594 million convertible bond sale, channeling the proceeds to finance more BTC buys.

Table of Contents Breaking barriers, but not expectation: Pepe’s journey to meeting the hype Dogecoin’s lost bark: Meme coin’s underperformance raises questions about its future 1Fuel ignites interest: How its privacy features Are revolutionizing DeFi Conclusion It’s no longer news that the bull run has begun, with several cryptocurrencies experiencing new highs. Despite this surge, big names such as Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have underperformed, failing to meet analysts’ expectations. Holders of the tokens are beginning to jump ship in search of a project with great profit potential. According to the top crypto analyst, 1Fuel has the most potential among other altcoins. The token is in the second presale stage, and metrics show signs of exponential growth. Aside from impressive presale numbers, the privacy features have also generated interest in the DeFi world. Combining both aspects, analysts expect the token to increase by 500% or more. You might also like: Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem expands while 1FUEL changes DeFi wallets Breaking barriers, but not expectation: Pepe ‘s journey to meeting the hype On December 9, 2024, PEPE achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00002803. Although this was good news for the project, the price didn’t meet analysts’ expectations. An overview of the 30-day chart shows PEPE increased by 29.2%, which is disappointing. At the moment, the token is 12.7% down from its ATH. As a meme coin, Pepe’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment. Failing to maintain its ATH paints a picture of little to no community support. Without the backing of crypto enthusiasts, analysts anticipate Pepe price stagnation on the charts. Investors looking for gains during this bull are advised to purchase 1Fuel, as it isn’t wholly dependent on sentiment. 1Fuel has functionality such as its privacy feature, which Pepe lacks. It is currently on presale and has the potential to outperform Pepe. Dogecoin ‘s lost bark: Meme coin’s underperformance raises questions about its future Being the top dog, analysts predicted that Dogecoin would skyrocket towards the end of the year. However, the token has failed to meet these expectations. DOGE is 44.4% below its ATH of $0.7316, recorded on May 8, 2021. The price has been steady in the last 30 days on cryptocurrency exchanges, with a slight 0.3% decline. Seeing red on the Dogecoin chart is surprising to many, as the original meme coin is often expected to lead during a bull market rally. Does this indicate that the market no longer supports Dogecoin? The short answer is ‘No.’ The market is currently consolidating, which tends to impact cryptocurrencies like DOGE that lack significant utility With DOGE being sluggish, it’s best to invest elsewhere. 1Fuel, which is currently in presale, serves as the best investment vehicle as it offers real-world utility. 1Fuel ignites interest: How its privacy features Are revolutionizing DeFi The cryptocurrency market is growing steadily. New tokens are introduced daily, but most are hype-driven rather than practical. To change financial services, blockchain tokens must have real-world value. Additionally, these tokens must provide solutions to the technological hurdles within the sector. 1Fuel is coming to rewrite the rules and introduce a whole new level of functionality. The project will create a cryptocurrency wallet that automates complex operations while ensuring top-tier security and privacy. This will allow users to interact with digital assets more confidently and comfortably. It is friendly to both new and seasoned traders. Holding 1Fuel tokens earns users a 30% staking reward. This converts investment into an ongoing revenue source. Second, there would be a peer-to-peer exchange. This function removes the middleman, allowing users to trade directly with other users. Finally, 1Fuel takes things to the next level by offering debit cards. This allows users to effortlessly spend from their cryptocurrency wallet in the real world. At the moment, 1Fuel is in its second presale stage. The first stage was a huge success as the tokens were sold out in record time. This momentum has been passed on to the second stage, as 1Fuel has sold over 13% of the tokens allocated to this stage. This is the ideal time to purchase 1Fuel as a token costs $0.012. Conclusion Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin have failed to meet market expectations. However, 1Fuel’s approach has set it on the right path for massive growth. At $0.012/token, the presale offers 1FUEL at a cheap price. Buy and watch an investment soar when 1FUEL hits the top cryptocurrency exchanges!

In a new interview with Fox Business, longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano says that as long as the US government keeps the money printers on, the top crypto asset by market cap will continue to rally. “I think that Bitcoin is going to continue to go up as long as the government keeps printing money. So at the same time that Trump has been elected and has stepped into the White House, saying that he’s going to be the ‘first Bitcoin president’ – which obviously is very bullish for the asset class – you also see that the national debt is exploding in the last 100 days or so.” According to Pompliano, investors and institutions are increasingly using the flagship digital asset as a store of value and as a means of countering inflation, noting that the US national debt is “out of control.” “If you overlay [the rising national debt and BTC’s price], they’re like married together forever because ultimately what I think is happening is people [are] realizing the national debt leads to debasement of the currency and so if Bitcoin is a store of value, they are hiding from dollars and they’re going into Bitcoin… I mean we were adding $1 trillion every 100 days or so [to the debt], which obviously is out of control… You have tons of financial institutions and corporations who are saying, ‘Well hold on a second, let’s go buy a lot of Bitcoin.’ So you have a finite asset with tons of demand coming in and that’s leading to higher prices.” Bitcoin is trading for $104,607 at time of writing, a 3.01% increase during the last 24 hours while the US national debt is currently at $36.13 trillion , according to the US Treasury Department.

While community-driven tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to dominate headlines with their viral appeal, projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are paving the way for real-world innovation. With the Lightchain AI Presale now live, this platform is set to blend blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle practical challenges across industries. [Join the Lightchain AI Presale today!] Shiba Inu has gained fame for its accessibility and strong community backing, but the crypto landscape is shifting beyond memes to focus on utility and transformative potential. Lightchain AI represents this new wave of innovation, aiming to deliver impactful solutions that go beyond hype. The question now is: Can Shiba Inu’s community-driven buzz compete with the groundbreaking advancements Lightchain AI is bringing to the table? Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Meme Token’s Rise to Fame The Origin Story Shiba Inu entered the crypto scene in 2020 as a direct competitor to Dogecoin (DOGE). Self-described as the “Dogecoin Killer,” SHIB leveraged its meme-inspired branding and grassroots marketing to quickly build a loyal following. The Shiba Inu ecosystem now includes projects like ShibaSwap (a decentralized exchange), NFTs, and the promise of Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution aimed at increasing scalability. The Appeal of Shiba Inu Accessibility: Like Dogecoin, SHIB’s low price per token allows everyday investors to hold millions of coins, fostering a sense of ownership and community. Community Power: SHIB’s success is largely driven by its passionate fanbase, known as the Shib Army , which has propelled the token to global fame. Evolving Ecosystem: With plans for Shibarium and utility tokens like BONE and LEASH , Shiba Inu is attempting to expand beyond its meme origins. The Challenges SHIB Faces Lack of Real-World Utility: While SHIB has made strides in DeFi and NFTs, it still struggles to find applications beyond its ecosystem. Volatility and Speculation: SHIB’s price movements are often tied to market hype rather than fundamental value. Scalability Issues: Despite promises of Shibarium, the Shiba Inu ecosystem relies heavily on Ethereum, which faces its own scalability challenges. Lightchain AI: Where Blockchain Meets Real-World Impact Lightchain AI enters the blockchain space with a bold mission to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. By combining the power of these two transformative technologies, Lightchain AI focuses on solving real-world problems and delivering innovative solutions to complex challenges. Their efforts are set to redefine how industries tackle critical issues in healthcare, such as improving data security and patient outcomes, finance, by enhancing transaction transparency and fraud prevention, supply chain, through optimized tracking and efficiency, and many other sectors. Lightchain AI envisions a future where AI-driven blockchain solutions empower industries to operate smarter, faster, and more securely. Real-World Use Cases: Lightchain AI’s Edge While Shiba Inu thrives on community engagement and meme culture, Lightchain AI brings tangible benefits to multiple industries: 1. Healthcare AI-Powered Diagnostics: Lightchain AI enables faster and more accurate medical diagnostics by leveraging machine learning models on its AIVM. Predictive Healthcare Models: Hospitals and healthcare providers can use AI to forecast patient needs, reducing costs and improving outcomes. 2. Supply Chain Transparency Real-Time Tracking: With blockchain-backed AI, Lightchain AI enhances supply chain visibility, ensuring accountability and reducing inefficiencies. Fraud Prevention: AI algorithms on Lightchain AI’s platform detect anomalies in supply chains, preventing fraud and loss. 3. Finance DeFi Optimization: Lightchain AI brings advanced analytics to decentralized finance, improving yield farming, risk assessment, and trading algorithms. Fraud Detection: Its AI-driven mechanisms flag suspicious transactions, ensuring a safer financial ecosystem. 4. Dynamic NFTs Interactive Digital Assets: Unlike static NFTs, Lightchain AI enables NFTs that evolve based on user interaction or real-world data, offering new possibilities in gaming and art. Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Compete With Lightchain AI’s Real-World Use Cases? While Shiba Inu continues to ride the wave of community-driven hype, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world impact and utility sets it apart. With its innovative use cases in industries like healthcare, supply chain management, finance, and NFTs, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a leader in merging blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. However, this doesn’t mean that SHIB and Lightchain AI are direct competitors. Both projects have their strengths and cater to different audiences. While SHIB may appeal to those looking for a fun and accessible entry point into crypto, Lightchain AI attracts investors interested in innovative solutions with tangible benefits. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, there is room for both Shiba Inu and Lightchain AI to thrive. As the landscape continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how these two projects continue to make their mark and drive innovation in the industry. So, whether you’re a passionate Shib Army member or a tech-savvy investor, keep an eye on both SHIB and Lightchain AI as they continue their journeys towards success. Let’s see who comes out on top! Shiba Inu’s Efforts to Expand Utility Shiba Inu is not without its own ambitions. The development of Shibarium, its Layer 2 solution, aims to: Reduce Gas Fees: By scaling its ecosystem, Shibarium could lower transaction costs for DeFi and NFT projects. Encourage Adoption: A more scalable network could attract developers to build dApps within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Improve Speed: Shibarium promises faster transaction confirmation times, potentially making SHIB more practical for everyday use. However, these efforts are still in progress, and it remains to be seen whether Shibarium can compete with platforms like Lightchain AI, which are designed for scalability and real-world use from the ground up. Community vs. Utility: Who Wins? Shiba Inu: The Power of Buzz Strength: SHIB’s community-driven approach makes it a cultural phenomenon, capable of rallying massive support. Weakness: Its lack of utility beyond its ecosystem may limit its long-term viability. Lightchain AI: The Power of Innovation Strength: With real-world applications across industries, Lightchain AI provides tangible value beyond speculative trading. Weakness: As a newer platform, it faces the challenge of building a community as strong as Shiba Inu’s. Lightchain AI Presale Is Live!

37720411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628204,1734362741,Pepe (PEPE) gets the most support from large retail holders,"Meme tokens can hint at their reliability based on a metric of larger retail wallets. The presence of holders with more than $1,000 in assets signals the formation of a community, with more potential for long-term holding. Meme tokens vary in their prevalence of holders. Some assets are weighed down by insider holdings. Others are spread to many wallets, which only hold insignificant amounts. A metric of wallets with a balance of more than $1,000 was a notable indicator of a token’s cult status. Among all meme assets, Pepe (PEPE) had the biggest prevalence of this type of mid-range retail wallet. The token also has a relatively long history, in addition to the meme’s Internet presence. Murad Mahmudov, who separates tokens into groups – for trading and for holding, noted Pepe (PEPE) was the leader, followed by DogWifHat (WIF) and SPX6900 (SPX). Holders with $1K+ can be a useful metric to determine conviction of a Memecoin community Bigger number = MORE MOTIVATED SOLDIERS with skin in the game Comparing some of the popular Memes: pic.twitter.com/Qi4UEXC4Yj — Murad 💹🧲 (@MustStopMurad) December 15, 2024 Meme tokens gained influence and mindshare quickly in 2024, and analysts aimed to gauge which tokens were more reliable. PEPE has been much more widely distributed since its launch, surpassing even very vocal communities with a culture of holding for the long term. PEPE aims to hold onto a higher price range In the past few days, PEPE showed signs of losing holders, while usually, the token onboarded dozens of new holders each day. One of the reasons may be the presence of small, but connected wallets, which were then sold off to create panic. At the same time, a notable whale wallet took more PEPE off Binance and stored it along with APU tokens. Despite claims that PEPE is widely distributed, there are signs of wallet clusters. The recent whale buyer is part of a cluster holding 2.62% of the PEPE supply. Pepe (PEPE) is widely distributed, but there are still clusters of connected wallets, linked by smart contracts. | Source: Bubblemaps Other whales have shown readiness to hold, as in the case of the address ranked #32 based on its holdings. The whale’s wallet is not connected to any clusters or smart contracts. For now, Wintermute has decreased its holdings of PEPE down to 242 B tokens valued at $6.8M. Wintermute is one of the most active meme market makers, but it has a different selection of assets compared to the influencer list of memes. Wintermute focuses on POPCAT, CAT, and BONK, and has recently added CHILLGUY, MOODENG, PONKE, and GOAT. PEPE recently traded near an all-time high of $0.000027, later sinking to $0.000023. Recently, the asset broke above a valuation of $10B, becoming the third-largest meme token by market capitalization. Despite the active growth of memes, only 10 assets have broken above a market capitalization of $1B, while a market cap of around $500M is seen as a grey zone, where tokens can either make it or fail. Currently, some of the top memes selected by Murad Mahmudov are still in the $500M range, awaiting more listings and an eventual breakout. The top influencer warned meme tokens are at risk of rotation, but holders may outperform by picking the right cult tokens. Meme tokens lose narrative ground Meme tokens are currently losing mindshare, as investors and social media shift to DeFi. Stars like Moodeng (MOODENG) are coming down after a series of high-profile listings, while also revealing part of their gains were due to connected wallets and market manipulation. One of the reasons is that the attention is shifting to new types of meme tokens, namely those tied to AI agents. Another day, another ATH for AI mindshare. 51% for all narratives. pic.twitter.com/UQiRevhqvC — Kaito AI 🌊 (@_kaitoai) December 16, 2024 AI meme tokens already expanded to $4.3B in market capitalization, though still a small share of the overall meme market. Recently, Messari pointed out GOAT could become the meme of 2024, while another AI-related token, FARTCOIN, still trades at $0.77, near peak valuation. The meme space as a whole decreased its total market capitalization to under $120B. Most tokens remain flat and trade sideways. The big exceptions include SPX, GIGA, and AI16Z, boosted by their cult status and interest in AI memes.

Accordingly, Mark Longo, the owner of Peanut the Squirrel, claimed that cryptocurrency exchange Binance used his “PNUT” trademark and character image without permission. Mark Longo said in a statement that he sent Binance a cease and desist letter through his law firm, claiming that Binance was using a number of his intellectual properties without permission, including the PNUT trademark and an image of a squirrel wearing a cowboy hat. Longo also noted that he has used the PNUT brand for education and animal welfare initiatives since 2017. Longo said the PNUT trademark and Peanut the Squirrel image are a core element of his brand, not just a simple design. Longo’s legal team has filed a cease and desist letter requesting Binance to cease use of his intellectual property. Longo's team also noted that global platforms like Binance should be careful to respect copyrights and trademarks, especially in the digital world. Binance has not yet officially responded to the allegations. If Binance does not respond or resolve the dispute, Longo stated that he may take the matter further and take legal action.

With BTFD presale raising over $3.9 million in record time, and industry veterans like Notcoin (NOT) and Book of Meme (BOME) continuing to captivate investors, the meme coin sector is hotter than ever. These coins are reshaping how we think about alternative investments. Among these, BTFD Coin has captured the crypto community’s attention with its unique ecosystem and impressive presale performance. Let’s explore why this project is a must-watch and how its momentum compares to Notcoin and Book of Meme. BTFD Coin: The Bull Market’s New Star BTFD Coin’s presale is the talk of the town, and for good reason. Currently, in its 12th stage, it’s raised over $3.9 million by selling more than 55 billion tokens to 5,400+ investors . The presale price is locked at $0.00013 , offering an incredible entry point before the price hits $0.0006 at launch. This momentum showcases the sheer excitement surrounding this project. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s built on a community-driven philosophy that transforms market dips into opportunities. The project’s ecosystem offers a trifecta of features: staking rewards, a Play2Earn (P2E) game, and robust meme coin utility. Let’s start with its P2E game. The Beta version is live, offering an immersive experience where players join the Bulls Squad and tackle levels with unique challenges. While no rewards are available in this beta phase, the excitement is palpable. Picture a game where your in-game success translates to financial growth—BTFD is poised to revolutionise crypto gaming. For long-term holders, staking rewards are an enticing feature. Investors can lock their BTFD tokens and earn up to 90% APY. Imagine staking your coins and watching them grow exponentially—this is BTFD’s way of rewarding its early adopters. Staking also fosters ecosystem stability, making it a win-win for everyone involved. The BTFD referral programme adds another layer of appeal. Users who share their unique referral code can earn 10% of the value of referred purchases, while their referrals receive a 10% token bonus for transactions above $50. It’s a simple yet effective way to grow your holdings while building the community. When it comes to tokenomics, BTFD is laser-focused on sustainability and growth. With 48% of its supply allocated for presale, 18% for staking, and 17% for gaming rewards, every element is designed to create a robust ecosystem that benefits its investors. Notcoin (NOT): The Meme Coin for Everyday Users Notcoin (NOT) has long been a staple of the meme coin universe. Its unique tap-to-earn model on Telegram has transformed how users engage with crypto. Imagine earning tokens just by chatting with friends—that’s the simplicity and charm of NOT. What makes NOT stand out is its accessibility. With 40 million global users, the coin has bridged the gap between crypto enthusiasts and novices. Its ‘Explore’ missions allow users to earn passive income, making it an excellent entry point for newcomers. NOT isn’t just about accessibility; it’s about functionality too. The coin’s ecosystem is designed to foster engagement, offering users real-world usability while retaining the playful spirit of meme coins. Whether it’s creating Telegram groups or participating in community-driven initiatives, NOT exemplifies how cryptocurrency can integrate seamlessly into daily life. While BTFD appeals to investors looking to capitalise on presale opportunities, NOT has carved out a niche as a people’s coin—reliable, user-friendly, and fun. Book of Meme (BOME): Art Meets Cryptocurrency Book of Meme (BOME) is a meme coin with a twist. Founded by artist Darkfarms, BOME blends the creative world of art with the fast-paced dynamics of crypto. It’s this unique positioning that has garnered a loyal following in the meme coin space. BOME’s standout feature is its integration with decentralised storage and high-risk trading. These elements provide a dual benefit: investors get to engage in creative, meme-driven content while participating in an ecosystem designed for high rewards. The project’s focus on decentralisation ensures transparency and security, aligning with the core principles of blockchain. The Book of Meme community plays a significant role in its success. Enthusiastic supporters, often referred to as the ‘BOME Army,’ drive visibility and adoption through social media campaigns and meme competitions. This grassroots approach has helped BOME establish itself as a go-to investment for those who value creativity alongside financial potential. For seasoned investors and newcomers alike, BOME represents the convergence of culture and crypto. It’s a project that proves meme coins can be more than just jokes; they can be catalysts for innovation. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out While NOT and BOME have earned their places in the meme coin ecosystem, BTFD’s presale offers an unparalleled opportunity to get in early. Its innovative features, robust tokenomics, and community-driven focus make it one of the best meme coin presales to invest in December 2024. By participating in the BTFD presale, investors can secure their tokens at a fraction of their potential value. With staking rewards, a cutting-edge P2E game, and a referral programme that incentivises growth, BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. How to Buy BTFD Coins Set up your bullish wallet: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet and secure your private key. Load your wallet with BNB or ETH: These are the accepted currencies for purchasing BTFD. Connect your wallet: Visit the BTFD official site and link your wallet. Buy BTFD: Choose your preferred currency, enter the amount, and confirm the transaction. Receive your BTFD: After the presale, claim your tokens and stake them for rewards. Stay updated: Monitor your holdings and enjoy the benefits of being an early adopter. Conclusion In the world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. Based on market trends and community engagement, BTFD meme coin presale is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. With its innovative ecosystem and focus on rewarding early investors, it’s a standout project in the meme coin space. While NOT and BOME continue to thrive, BTFD offers the unique chance to join a movement poised for exponential growth.

Leading digital asset manager CoinShares disclosed this in its latest report, providing insights into crypto-backed investment vehicles. According to the report , crypto investment products recorded an astounding $3.23 billion in inflows last week. 10th Consecutive Inflows with Bitcoin Leading the Charge This marked the 10th consecutive week of positive flows into crypto investment products. Consequently, the total year-to-date (YTD) flows soared to a jaw-dropping $44.5 billion, four times the figure recorded in previous years. In addition, the asset under management (AUM) across all crypto investment products stands at $167.41 billion. Expectedly, Bitcoin-backed investment products received the most inflows, accounting for $2 billion of the total weekly inflows. Since the U.S. election, Bitcoin has significantly boosted total inflows into crypto investment products, attracting about $11.5 billion. Per the data, Bitcoin's month-to-date (MTD) inflow stands at $4.67 billion, with YTD inflows of $38.58 billion. With the latest inflow of $2 billion in the past week, Bitcoin’s AUM soared to $135.02 billion.Ethereum Registers Seventh Consecutive Weekly Inflows Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its seventh consecutive weekly inflow last week after investment vehicles tied to ETH registered $1.09 billion in inflows. These products have attracted $3.7 billion in investments within the past seven weeks. The MTD flows into Ethereum products stand at approximately $2.25 billion, while YTD inflows have soared to $4.45 billion.XRP and Other Assets Weekly Inflows Interestingly, XRP also saw strong institutional interest over the past week, as its weekly inflows hit $145 million. CoinShares attributed this surge to growing anticipation for a U.S.-listed spot-based ETF tied to the asset.As reported earlier, several asset managers, including WisdomTree and Bitwise, have officially applied with the SEC to launch XRP ETFs in the United States. Although the SEC has not acknowledged any of the applications exclusively focused on XRP, speculation indicates that the agency will approve at least one of these filings under a new SEC leadership. Other crypto assets with positive inflows in the past week include Short Bitcoin ($14.6 million), Polkadot ($3.7 million), Litecoin ($2.2 million), Cardano ($1.9 million), Solana (SOL), BNB ($700,000), and Chainlink ($700,000). Conversely, multi-asset investment products ended the past week in outflows totaling $31 million, according to data from CoinShares. Regional Flows In terms of regional flows, the United States accounts for $3.13 billion of the total inflows recorded in the past week.

42389780,7969e1bb-fdaa-40c3-929b-c12c386fc6d0,1734361786,Paul Veradittakit: 8 Predictions For Crypto in 2025,"Every year, bulls and bears use short-term case studies to forecast crypto armageddon or exponential growth. And every year, neither group is right.    Some notable events this year: Ethereum’s Dencun Upgrade, the U.S. election, crypto ETFs, Wyoming's DUNA, the wBTC controversy, Robinhood’s Well’s notice, Hyperliquid’s near $2 billion airdrop, Bitcoin hitting $100,000, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s January resignation announcement.    2024 was a year with no major market shocks. And, though it didn’t bring in an explosion of new capital, it proved that a growing number of companies in the crypto ecosystem are sustainable. Bitcoin is worth $1.9 trillion and all other cryptos are worth $1.6 trillion. The market cap of all crypto has doubled since the start of 2024.    The diversification of crypto has strengthened its ability to react to shocks. Payments, DeFi, gaming, ZK, infrastructure, consumer, and more, are all growing sub-sections. Each of these now have their own funding ecosystems, their own markets, their own incentives, and their own bottlenecks.    This year, at Pantera, we’ve invested in companies that target these ecosystem-specific problems. Crypto gaming companies face issues adopting Web3 data analysis tools, so we invested in Helika, a gaming analysis platform. Web3 AI products often face adoption challenges because of the fragmentation of the AI stack, so Sahara AI aims to create an all-in-one platform to allow permissionless contribution while keeping a seamless Web2-like user experience.    Intent infrastructure is messy and orderflow is fragmented, so Everclear standardizes the process by connecting all stakeholders. zkVM’s are complicated to integrate, so Nexus uses modularity in order to cater to customers who want only parts of their hyper-scalable layer. Building consumer apps faces the issue of attracting users, so we made our largest ever investment in TON, the blockchain that directly plugs into Telegram’s 950 million monthly active users.    We enter 2025 on tailwinds of possible regulatory clarity, continued mainstream interest, and rising crypto prices. Even after a bit of a summer slump this year, crypto users are entering the new year with strong optimism (or “greed”).  Review of 2024 Predictions:    Before we dive into 2025 predictions, let’s take a look back at how I did predicting 2024. I’ll score myself with 1 being the least accurate and 5 being the most accurate.  The resurgence of Bitcoin and “DeFi Summer 2.0.” Accuracy: 4/5  Tokenized social experiences for new consumer use cases. Accuracy: 2/5  An increase in TradFi-DeFi “bridges” such as stablecoins and mirrored assets. Accuracy: 5/5  The cross-pollination of modular blockchains and Zero Knowledge Proofs. Accuracy: 4/5  More computationally intensive applications moving on-chain, such as AI and DePIN. Accuracy: 2/5  Consolidation of public blockchain ecosystems and a “Hub-and-Spoke” model for app-chains. Accuracy: 2/5  2025 Predictions  This year, I enlisted the help of investors on the Pantera team. I’ve split my predictions into two categories: rising trends and new ideas.  Rising Trends:    By year-end, RWAs (excluding stablecoins) will account for 30% of on chain TVL (15% today) RWAs on-chain has increased over 60% this year, to $13.7 billion. Around 70% of RWAs are private credit and the majority of the rest are in T-Bills and commodities. Inflows from these categories are accelerating, and 2025 may see the introduction of more complex RWAs.    Firstly, private credit is accelerating because of improving infrastructure. Figure accounts for almost all of this, increasing by almost $4 billion worth of assets in 2024. As more companies enter this space, there is increasing ease to use private credit as a means to move money into crypto.    Secondly, there are trillions of dollars worth of T-Bills and commodities off-chain. There is only $2.67 billion worth of T-Bills on-chain, and their ability to generate yield (as opposed to stablecoins, which allow the ones who mint the coin to capture the interest), makes it a more attractive alternative to stablecoins. Blackrock’s BUIDL T-Bill fund only has $500 million on-chain, as opposed to the tens of billions of government bills it owns off-chain. Now that DeFi infrastructure has thoroughly embraced stablecoins and T-Bill RWAs (integrating them into DeFi pools, lending markets, and perps), the friction to adopt them has drastically decreased. The same goes for commodities.    Finally, the current extent of RWAs is limited to these basic products. The infrastructure to mint and maintain the RWA protocols has drastically simplified and operators have a much better understanding of the risks and appropriate mitigations that come with on-chain operations. There are specialized companies that manage wallets, minting mechanisms, sybil sensing, crypto neo-banks, and more, meaning it may finally be possible and feasible to introduce stocks, ETFs, bonds, and other more complex financial products on-chain. These trends will only accelerate the use of RWA’s heading into 2025.  Paul Veradittakit is a speaker at Consensus Hong Kong Feb 18-20, 2025.  Bitcoin-Fi Last year, my prediction of Bitcoin finance was strong but didn’t reach the 1-2% of all Bitcoins TVL mark. This year, pushed by Bitcoin-native finance protocols that do not require bridging (like Babylon), high returns, high Bitcoin prices, and increased appetite for more BTC assets (runes, Ordinals, BRC20), 1% of Bitcoins will participate in Bitcoin-Fi.    Fintechs become crypto gateways TON, Venmo, Paypal, Whatsapp have seen crypto growth because of their neutrality. They are gateways where users can interact with crypto, but do not push specific apps or protocols; in effect, they can act as simplified entryways into crypto. They attract different users; TON for its existing 950 million Telegram users, Venmo and Paypal for their respective 500 million payments users, and Whatsapp for its 2.95 billion monthly active users.    Felix, which operates on Whatsapp, allows instant money transfers via a message, to be either digitally transferred or can be picked up in cash at partner locations (like 7-Eleven). Under the hood, they use stablecoins and Bitso on Stellar. Users can now buy crypto on Metamask using Venmo, Stripe acquired Bridge (a stablecoin company), and Robinhood acquired Bitstamp (a crypto exchange).    Whether intentionally or because of their ability to support third-party apps, every fintech will become a crypto gateway. Fintechs will grow in prevalence and may perhaps rival smaller centralized exchanges in crypto holdings.    Unichain becomes leading L2 by transaction volume Uniswap has a TVL of almost $6.5b, 50-80k transactions per day, and volume of $1-4 billion daily. Arbitrum has ~$1.4 billion of transaction volume a day (a third of which is Uniswap) and Base has ~$1.5 billion of volume a day (a fourth of which is Uniswap).    If Unichain captures just half of Uniswap’s volume, it would easily surpass the largest L2s to become the leading L2 by transaction volume.    NFT resurgence but in a application specific way NFTs were meant as a tool in crypto - not a means to an end. NFT’s are being used as a utility in on-chain gaming, AI (to trade ownership of models), identity, and consumer apps.    Blackbird is a restaurant rewards app that integrates NFTs into customer identification in their platform of connecting Web3 into dining. By integrating the open, liquid, and identifiable blockchain with restaurants, they can provide consumer behavior data to restaurants, and easily create/mint subscriptions, memberships, and discounts for customers.    Sofamon creates web3 bitmoji’s (which are NFTs), called wearables, unlocking the financial layer of the emoji market. They recognize the increasing relevance of IP on chain and embrace collaboration with top KOL’s and K-pop stars, for example, to fight digital counterfeiting. Story Protocol, which recently raised $80 million at a $2.25 billion valuation, has the broader goal of tokenizing the world’s IP, putting originality back as the centerpiece of creative exploration and creators. IWC (the Swiss luxury watch brand) has a membership NFT that buys access to an exclusive community and events.    NFTs can be integrated to ID transactions, transfers, ownership, memberships, but can also be used to represent and value assets, leading to monetary, possibly speculative growth. This flexibility is what brings NFTs power. The use-cases will only increase.    Restaking launches In 2025, restaking protocols like Eigenlayer, Symbiotic, and Karak will finally launch their mainnets which would pay operators from AVS and slashing. It seems that through this year, restaking lost relevance.    Restaking draws power as more networks use it. If protocols use infra that is powered by a particular restaking protocol, it derives value from that connection, even if it is not direct. It is by this power that protocols can lose relevance but still hold huge valuations. We believe restaking is still a multi billion dollar market and as more apps become appchains, they harness restaking protocols, or other protocols that are built on restaking protocols.  New Ideas:   zkTLS bringing offchain data on-chain zkTLS uses zero knowledge proofs to prove the validity of data from the Web2 world. This new technology has yet to be fully implemented, but when it (hopefully) does this year, it will bring in new types of data.    For example, zkTLS can be used to prove that data came from a certain website to others. Currently, there is no way to do this. This tech takes advantage of advancements made in TEE’s and MPC’s, and may be further improved to allow some of the data to be private.    This is a new idea, but we predict that companies will step up to begin building this and integrating it into on-chain services, like verifiable oracles for non-financial data or cryptographically secured data oracles.    Regulatory support For the first time, the U.S. regulatory environment seems crypto-positive. 278 pro-crypto house candidates were elected versus 122 anti-crypto candidates. Gary Gensler, an anti-crypto SEC chair, announced that he will be resigning in January. Reportedly, Trump is set to nominate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC. He was previously an SEC Commissioner from 2002-2008 and is outspokenly supportive of the crypto industry and an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an institution focused on promoting the acceptance of crypto. Trump also named David Sacks, a tech investor and former CEO of Yammer and COO of PayPal, to head the new role of “AI & crypto czar.” Trump’s announcement said that “[David Sacks] will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for.”  We hope for a winding down of SEC lawsuits, clear definitions of crypto as a particular asset class, and tax considerations.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Paul Veradittakit,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/16/paul-veradittakit-8-predictions-for-crypto-in-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5be1b6ca2b92823a9071fc43c04c8b1217f55b8-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We have yet to achieve the true cultural relevance that other cutting-edge technologies enjoy. Our most widely used product as an industry is cryptocurrency itself, but even our biggest advocates now realize that coins alone will not be enough to provide the consumer breakthrough we have been building towards for over a decade.    NFTs, Web3 gaming, social apps, and various forms of decentralized music, art, film, and TV have not broken beyond a crypto-native audience, and many of these projects have been unable to attain even that level of traction. Challenges include complex user experiences, speculative economic models and technical limitations that alienate mainstream consumers. Throughout 2024, the sector grappled with persistent issues including liquidity fragmentation, user experience friction and a reputation for prioritizing financial speculation over consumer experiences, all of which did not resonate in a softer crypto market.    However, in 2025’s growth cycle, we’ll see mass mainstream adoption of Web3 driven by consumer apps building in highly scalable environments that have figured out distribution to wider user bases. Key catalysts include solutions to the liquidity fragmentation crisis, regulatory clarity under a crypto-friendly administration, advanced blockchain infrastructure and the integration of sophisticated AI technologies. Web3 gaming in particular is positioned to transition from a niche experiment to an innovative force in the gaming ecosystem, offering unprecedented player ownership and economic opportunities that will bring the gaming industry out of recession, and new experiences to gamers. Here’s what to expect from crypto consumer breakthroughs in 2025:    1. AI in gaming and other interactive environments  While there is a great deal of chatter around AI leveraging crypto rails for payments, the most concrete and popular uses have centered around gaming. The general public was not made aware of this development because much of the AI was being used as part of the development process for art in the games, or to generate the game itself. Gaming markets are like any other entertainment content — you hear about the player experience, but very rarely the technology that goes into it.    For web3 games specifically, AI will open a lot of doors for game developers in the industry, particularly around the use of AI agents onchain for non-player characters (NPCs). The ability of small developer studios to harness this tech in a meaningful way has accelerated significantly. A critical mass of Saga games have already introduced these agents, and we would not be surprised if almost all our games have AI agents by next year. Many of these AI agents have taken it a step further and created their own L1s at will on Saga, leading to the phenomenon of swarm sentience and fully autonomous interactive worlds on a decentralized network.    2. Gaming maturity and established titles in Web3  2025 is the transition point for established gaming studios entering Web3. These organizations are building with blockchain as core infrastructure, enabling player ownership and decentralized economies. The experimentation phase is over. Now comes the era of quality. Gaming will drive the next wave of mass adoption because it naturally demands the decentralized infrastructure that blockchain can deliver. With the industry in recession over the last 1.5 years, gaming needed answers to its problems of lack of original content and prohibitive user acquisition costs. A crypto-native environment encourages both creative experimentation and extended user acquisition channels for more effective community building. It wouldn’t be far-fetched to say Web3 gaming will end up saving gaming.    3. Meme and degen asset creation  Memes and degen assets are the cultural backbone of Web3. They manifest as game drops, community projects, and viral moments. This is how crypto culture propagates—through creativity at the edges. While traditional finance struggles to understand this phenomenon, these assets drive community engagement and create the authentic moments that define Web3. It’s no surprise that when an AI-agent stood up its first L1 on Saga for a social app, its first action was to launch a memecoin.    4. Sophisticated in-game marketplaces  The next generation of in-game marketplaces will operate as sovereign economies. Players become the market makers, leveraging DeFi infrastructure to drive value. This puts real economic power in the hands of gaming communities. The integration of DeFi principles into gaming creates entirely new mechanisms for player engagement and retention that traditional gaming studios cannot match.    5. Advancements in liquidity solutions  The solution to fragmentation lies in shared liquidity infrastructure. Connected layers between decentralized applications create fluid movement of assets. This enables true composability across gaming, marketplaces and DeFi. The projects that solve this will unlock the next phase of Web3 growth by removing the friction that currently plagues cross-chain interactions.    The truly potent combination is a Web3 asset that has social utility. Particularly among GenZ and Gen Alpha, this sort of combined economic and social activity is not just normal but an incredibly popular form of entertainment. The attribution of value to an asset purely because of community consensus was the origin of web3, and the same force of SocialFi on open liquidity rails will drive the industry into mass adoption.    6. Catalysts from the post-election environment  Trump's return reshapes crypto's regulatory landscape. New SEC leadership will shift policy direction. These changes will shape Web3 gaming adoption through a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape, characterized by reduced bureaucratic constraints and a business-oriented approach to digital assets. This environment might include easing SEC enforcement, creating more lenient digital asset classifications and potentially establishing regulatory sandboxes or tax incentives for blockchain gaming startups.    In 2025, the success (or failure) of mainstream integration through gaming, finance, and social applications will determine crypto's future. Speculation alone cannot sustain another market cycle. Real adoption requires solving real problems for consumers beyond our existing community. The gaming industry, with its billions of users and appetite for innovation, represents our clearest path to achieving this scale. My hope is that 2025 will represent a critical inflection point for all consumer apps alongside Web3 gaming, and in turn, the crypto industry as a whole.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rebecca Liao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/16/how-web3-consumer-apps-will-finally-break-out-in-2025-6-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50e593445ecaaa230ad450b8ed2ab7d5729b568d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The US-based company used the proceeds of its stock sale to buy the 15,350 BTC between December 9 and 15, 2024, per a regulatory filing on Monday. The buy enhances MicroStrategy’s status as the world’s largest corporate holder of the benchmark cryptocurrency, with total BTC holdings reaching 439,000. MicroStrategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor shared the news via X, adding that its BTC yield reached 46.4% quarter-to-date and 72.4% year-to-date. The company has acquired this massive Bitcoin haul for approximately $27.1 billion. Saylor noted : MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD.

USDtb operates similarly to other popular fiat-backed stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ), with reserves held in cash or cash-equivalent assets at a 1:1 ratio. Unlike most stablecoins, USDtb distinguishes itself by allocating 90% of its reserves to BlackRock’s BUIDL fund. This tokenized money market fund primarily invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements. This is the highest BUIDL allocation of any stablecoin, allowing USDtb to scale more effectively and providing a high degree of stability, according to Ethena ( ENA ). The stablecoin is being launched in partnership with Securitize , a leader in tokenization of real-world assets. USDtb is positioned as a more traditional stablecoin option, with a completely separate risk profile compared to Ethena’s flagship token, USDe ( USDe ), which uses a derivative-based strategy to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar.

Moca Coin ( MOCA ) reached an all-time high of $0.4347, marking a 616% increase from its October low. This rally boosted its market cap to over $278 million and its fully diluted valuation to $1.6 billion. The surge followed Binance Futures’ announcement that it would list MOCA with up to 75x leverage. This listing is significant, as Binance, the largest crypto exchange globally, provides access to millions of users who can now trade the coin.

The majority of Moca Coin trading activity is occurring on Bybit, Bithumb, Bitget, and Kucoin. Moca is a blockchain network developed by Animoca Brands, one of the most prominent investors in the crypto industry. It powers the Mocaverse, which aims to create the largest on-chain cultural economy. Built on the LayerZero v2 protocol, Moca supports platforms across industries such as music, gaming, and education. Moca Coin is used to facilitate payments and cover transaction fees within the network. Cryptocurrency prices often rally after receiving a major listing by companies like Binance , Upbit, and Bithumb. This rally is often accompanied by high volume and hype. In Moca Coin’s case, the 24-hour volume rose to over $1.2 billion, the highest level on record. However, such rallies are often short-lived as momentum fades. This explains why Moca Coin spiked to $0.4347 before experiencing a sharp reversal to $0.15.

How MicroStrategy funds its Bitcoin obsession The funding for these massive Bitcoin purchases comes from an October 30 sales agreement with many heavy-hitter financial institutions, including TD Securities, Barclays, and Cantor Fitzgerald. The agreement allows MicroStrategy to issue and sell up to $21 billion worth of its class A common stock over time. By December 15, the company had already sold shares worth $1.54 billion, leaving $7.65 billion in available shares for future sales. These sales have proven to be a reliable pipeline for fueling MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying spree. It’s actually a calculated bet. MicroStrategy’s leadership, including co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, views Bitcoin as the ultimate reserve asset, superior to cash or traditional investments. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin is unmatched, and its aggressive stock issuance strategy is a reflection of its unrelenting belief in the crypto’s long-term value. The company’s decision to execute a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year also plays into this strategy. By increasing accessibility for retail investors, MicroStrategy made its shares more liquid and, by extension, enhanced its ability to raise capital for Bitcoin acquisitions. The split, adjusted all historical share counts and equity award figures, aligning them with the new structure. BTC yield: A key metric in MicroStrategy’s strategy MicroStrategy’s BTC yield is a metric that sets it apart from other corporate Bitcoin holders. The company uses this key performance indicator (KPI) to measure the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings relative to its assumed diluted shares outstanding. From October 1 to December 15, MicroStrategy’s BTC yield climbed by 46.4%. The year-to-date figure is a stunning 72.4%. What does this number really mean? In simple terms, it tracks how much Bitcoin the company acquires for every share issued, showcasing the efficiency of its strategy. Though BTC yield isn’t perfect. It doesn’t consider liabilities like debt, nor does it account for the trading price of MicroStrategy’s stock. Still, it’s a creative way for the company to evaluate its performance and give Bitcoin-focused investors something unique to consider. The company acknowledges that BTC yield can fluctuate based on external factors. For instance, the redemption of 6.125% senior secured notes earlier this year boosted yield figures by reducing liabilities. On the flip side, future redemptions or stock sales could drive the metric down.

The license allows Bitget to facilitate Bitcoin-to-fiat exchanges, Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments, and custody services in the country. With the BSP license, Bitget can now offer Bitcoin-focused services such as buying, selling, storing, and transferring BTC. This milestone is part of Bitget’s broader strategy to strengthen its regulatory standing and expand globally. The company is also pursuing a Digital Assets Service Provider license from El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets. This additional license would enable Bitget to offer services for other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin in El Salvador . El Salvador has emerged as a global hub for cryptocurrency adoption since declaring Bitcoin a legal tender in 2021.

PEPE has become popular at $0.000024 and has a market capitalization of around $10 billion. Although PEPE's meme status drives its explosive expansion, there are questions about whether it will sustain momentum to each of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by 2025. However, a real-world crypto asset with great potential to rank in the top 10 in 2025 is Rexas Finance (RXS), which is only starting to emerge. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, RXS can reach $31.95 in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Paradigm Change In Cryptocurrency Assets Rexas Finance (RXS) is currently priced at $0.15 as of writing, but it is displaying significant optimistic momentum in its presale since it has gained 400% over the past 30 days. As the presale approaches its last phases, RXS will likely see a pump to $32 by 2025, indicating significant expansion potential. Early RXS investors may find a fantastic 213x return on investment (ROI) should this projection come true. Beginning its presale in early September 2024 at $0.030 per token, Rexas Finance has seen a startling 400% price rise to $0.15 at presale stage 10. With 1 billion RXS coins overall, the presale has already generated $27,667,398, selling 343,613,706 tokens. With a $1 million giveaway raking in over 494,000 submissions and 20 lucky winners poised to get $50,000 worth of RXS each, this explosive expansion has resulted in extraordinary interest. The presale of Rexas Finance keeps gathering steam and is likely to climb another 35% before the last round. From $0.15 to $0.175 at stage 11 and then to $0.2 at launch, the price of RXS will rise as the presale develops. For those wishing to enter at the ground level, this offers a great chance to buy RXS at a discounted price before it moves upmarket. Strategic Edge of Rexas Finance: Real-World Tokenizing of Assets Rexas Finance has a strong basis based on physical value, unlike PEPE, which depends on its meme status and community for expansion. Thanks to its Rexas Token Builder, Rexas Finance lets users tokenize physical assets quickly and without requiring code writing. Anyone can design tokens for real estate, goods, or art and sell them fractionally or using this tool. Additionally available on the platform is Rexas Launchpad, where users may fund their tokenized assets. The platform's adaptability is shown by its support of several token standards, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, which guarantees its ability to fit a variety of sectors. With a market worth billions of dollars, Rexas Finance has a great chance to lead in the field of asset tokenizing worldwide. Rexas Finance also stands out for its Certik assessment, which ensures the platform's security and openness—two fundamental criteria for any investor. Rexas Finance has also guaranteed listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Therefore, its profile in the crypto market ensures that potential investors can access accurate, real-time project data. Investors are most interested in Rexas Finance opening on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges in 2025. This calculated action would give RXS great exposure and liquidity, raising its prospects of ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the following years. Rexas Finance has followed a different path than many cryptocurrency initiatives, which mostly rely on venture capital money to spur expansion. By deciding to include individual investors rather than venture capital money, Rexas Finance has developed a devoted network of supporters. This community-driven strategy guarantees that the interests of the token holders always come first, which will surely enable Rexas Finance to flourish going forward. Why Would One Invest In RXS Right Now? Unquestionably, Rexas Finance has an excellent chance for explosive expansion in 2025. With its real-world asset tokenization capabilities, outstanding presale performance, Certik audit, and plans for debut on elite exchanges, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself as a unique investment possibility in the crypto arena. RXS can be your ticket to a prosperous 2025 if you seek a project with strong foundations and great expansion possibilities. Given a 213x ROI prediction and the approaching spike in value as the presale draws close, now is the moment to become involved in Rexas Finance before it becomes mainstream. Don't miss it; guarantee your spot in the presale and join the Rexas Finance revolution.

Omnichain Money Market Yei Finance is creating a unified liquidity pool that simplifies borrowing and lending across blockchains. By integrating Circle’s CCTP for native USDC transfers, the protocol eliminates reliance on wrapped tokens or third-party bridges. This streamlines capital utilization and reduces liquidity fragmentation, providing a seamless user experience. Strengthening the DeFi Landscape Yei Finance is developing critical innovations like smart routing for optimal cross-chain lending and a robust liquidation framework to mitigate systemic risks. These features position Yei Finance as a prominent protocol in the omnichain lending space. “This funding allows us to realize our vision of creating a truly omnichain money market that eliminates inefficiencies and drives DeFi adoption,” said Austin, Co-Founder of Yei Finance. “With V2, we’re unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance through seamless interoperability and user-centric design.” Looking Ahead With the $2M raised in this seed round, Yei Finance presents: A Fresh, User-Friendly Design: They're revamping the platform’s interface to make it more intuitive and easier to navigate.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As meme coins fade, 1Fuel’s $0.01 presale and 100x growth forecast make it the top choice for investors seeking real utility. Table of Contents Massive rise and decline of crypto meme coins Is 1Fuel the best crypto to buy now? Investors shift from meme coins Experts prediction for 1Fuel The path forward for meme coins Conclusion For years, top meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have dominated the entire market. But times are rapidly changing. As the crypto sector grows due to the adoption of new technology, projects like 1Fuel that combine smart solutions and sustainable growth are winning. With a presale price of just $0.01, 1Fuel is successfully capturing the attention of investors who appreciate uniqueness and look beyond meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In this article, we’ll look into why investors are eyeing 1Fuel. Massive rise and decline of crypto meme coins Shiba Inu, often dubbed the “doge-killer,” has been successful at creating a buzz with its bold ambitions. Similarly, Dogecoin has gained traction because of its light-hearted approach to cryptocurrencies and endorsement from popular figures like Elon Musk. Both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are considered cultural phenomena. However, they’re facing challenges now largely because crypto investors are demanding more than just hype. Both these meme coins have struggled for years to prove their real worth, supported by the delivery of innovative solutions and utility, and their appeal is fading away. Is 1Fuel the best crypto to buy now? 1Fuel is a project that is deeply rooted in utility and forward-thinking technology. It offers cross-chain interoperability, which helps address a crucial issue in the crypto space. With 1Fuel, users are able to interact with different blockchains seamlessly, as 1Fuel handles all of the technical work in the backend. Moreover, 1Fuel offers fast, more secure, and cost-efficient interactions between different networks, making it an essential tool for the future of decentralized applications and decentralized finance. 1Fuel’s token OFT has a much higher appeal than meme coins since it’s deeply rooted in utility and forward-thinking technology. The 1Fuel presale price of $0.01 gives users an accessible entry point for growth that is backed by not mere emotions but pure innovation. Investors shift from meme coins Investors are not focused on unexpected price hikes of top meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which are entirely driven by their community. Instead, they are looking for projects like 1Fuel that address real-world problems and help make blockchain technology more accessible to everyone. 1Fuel is one of the leading crypto to buy now, as it’s entirely focused on utility, which resonates with the new wave of investors. Moreover, unlike old blockchains, 1Fuel is built to overcome future challenges. That’s why it places major emphasis on environmental sustainability. Its consensus mechanism ensures that 1Fuel reduces the ecological footprint of blockchain transactions. 1Fuel’s approach adds another layer of appeal for investors who prioritize eco-friendly financial instruments in their portfolios.

The path forward for meme coins The massive rise of 1Fuel helps underscore a fundamental shift within the crypto landscape.

Top XRP Rival to Consider","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's recent 60 Minutes appearance brought new perspectives to the ongoing legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite spending over $150 million in legal defenses, Ripple’s XRP token remains below $4, leading many to question its future potential. Garlinghouse emphasized the need for tailored regulations for digital assets, highlighting the outdated nature of existing laws. Yet, his candid critique of the SEC and advocacy for a crypto-friendly framework failed to push XRP to new highs. This begs the question: if not regulatory drama, what can reignite XRP's growth? Meanwhile, investors are eyeing innovative tokens like Rexas Finance (RXS), which promise groundbreaking approaches in the crypto market. The Ripple (XRP) Conundrum Ripple’s battle with the SEC has undoubtedly impacted XRP's trajectory. Garlinghouse’s advocacy for clarity in crypto regulation aims to benefit the broader market, yet XRP's performance remains stagnant. Legal hurdles and market skepticism have stifled its growth, despite the establishment of initiatives like FairShake to champion fair treatment in the industry. While XRP has historical significance as a major player, its current outlook is overshadowed by the slow progress of regulatory clarity. This leaves investors exploring other tokens with immediate utility and strong growth potential. Rexas Finance Redefines Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is revolutionizing the crypto market by tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate, gold, and commodities. This innovation allows investors to own fractions of assets across the globe with just a click. The possibilities are vast: an investor from Asia could hold partial ownership of a European hotel and earn passive income, breaking barriers that traditionally limited these markets to institutions and elites. At the heart of Rexas Finance’s ecosystem is the Rexas Token Builder, a tool enabling users to tokenize assets seamlessly. Whether it's real estate or commodities, this platform enhances liquidity and democratizes investments. Additionally, the Rexas QuickMint Bot simplifies token creation on Telegram and Discord, allowing users to mint tokens effortlessly across Ethereum-compatible blockchains. Beyond tokenization, Rexas Finance offers a Launchpad for projects to raise funds through token sales. This feature supports entrepreneurs in securing investments and expanding their ventures. The ecosystem is bolstered by Rexas Estate, enabling users to participate in real estate investments globally, and Rexas AI Shield, providing advanced security for blockchain interactions. With these tools, Rexas Finance bridges the gap between traditional markets and blockchain technology, setting a new standard for asset accessibility. Listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS has gained visibility among millions of crypto enthusiasts. Its CertiK audit reinforces security and trust, ensuring reliability for investors. RXS Token Details and Performance Rexas Finance’s presale has demonstrated robust demand, raising over $27 million. Stages 1-9 sold out quickly, accumulating $26.37 million, with the token price increasing fivefold from its initial stage. Currently in stage 10, RXS is priced at $0.15 per token, offering a 1.33x return for stage 9 buyers upon launch. The tokenomics ensure a balanced allocation: 42.5% for presale, 22.5% for staking pools, and smaller percentages for marketing, liquidity, and team incentives. Investors benefit from opportunities like the Rexas Millionaire Giveaway, offering $50,000 USDT to 20 lucky winners. By completing actions and referring friends, participants can boost their chances of winning. With its innovative approach and strong presale performance, RXS is positioned to achieve significant growth. Analysts predict a price surge to over $10 by early 2025, representing a 150x increase from its current value. Final Thoughts If XRP’s regulatory challenges and advocacy efforts fail to propel it to $4, investors must consider alternatives. Rexas Finance emerges as a formidable contender, offering unmatched potential in real-world asset tokenization. With tools that simplify access to global markets and a presale already demonstrating exponential growth, RXS stands out in the crypto market. For those seeking a token with immediate utility and long-term prospects, Rexas Finance presents an opportunity that’s hard to ignore.

42389132,3d01744e-f01d-4e53-8dbc-35007aba0be3,1734360580,How Trump Can Help Crypto on Day One,"Dear President Elect Trump,  As the co-head of a major law firm’s digital assets practice, I am hopeful that your nominee to chair the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) will make much-needed (and long-overdue) reforms to the way the SEC approaches crypto market regulation in the United States.    However, as you know, it will take some time for your nominee to be confirmed as SEC chair, and for him to formulate new SEC guidance and rules for the crypto industry. Bearing that in mind, I write respectfully to propose an Executive Order that you can issue — on Day One of your Presidency — to help restore American leadership in the burgeoning crypto financial system.    While other countries have raced to create regulatory clarity for crypto entrepreneurship to thrive, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have thus far refused to mold and modernize decades-old rules that were never meant to apply to this groundbreaking technology, leaving U.S. market participants adrift in a sea of regulatory ambiguity. All the while, the SEC under its current chair, Gary Gensler, has teed up case-after-case against crypto companies, projects and founders based on allegations that they violated these outmoded and anachronistic requirements, even where there are no allegations of fraud or actual harm to investors.    It should be no surprise that this regulation-by-enforcement approach has chased many of the leading innovators and businesses in the digital assets sector offshore, jeopardizing America’s leadership position in the global economy.  How to find our way again  The good news is that it’s not too late to turn things around. The current moment presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make America the crypto capital of the world, and harness the transformative promise that digital assets and blockchain technology hold for our country. While there are many legislative, regulatory and tax reforms that will be needed to seize this opportunity, there is one immediate action you can take — on Day One of your Presidency — to pave the way for the crypto sector’s resurgence in America.    You can issue an Executive Order on January 20 directing all federal agencies to:    1. Immediately stay all investigations, enforcement actions and prosecutions of crypto companies, projects and founders unless they involve credible allegations of (a) acts of fraud or other intentional misconduct that harms investors or other victims, or (b) conduct that threatens our national security.    2. Provide a written report to the Office of the President within 180 days detailing why the relevant agency should not immediately terminate such proceedings.    3. Promptly terminate all investigations, enforcement actions, or prosecutions of crypto companies, projects or founders that do not warrant continued prosecution.    What the proposed executive order would accomplish  This proposed Executive Order would be vitally important to undo the chilling effect on the digital assets industry that has been caused by the explosion in recent years of government enforcement litigation, including actions brought against good actors who at most did not follow outdated and inapplicable rules without causing harm to a single investor. The SEC, most notably, has extracted billions of dollars in disgorgement — a financial penalty which, several courts have held, should be used only in cases where an alleged violation of law caused pecuniary harm to victims—in victimless crypto enforcement lawsuits.    Many of these lawsuits have sought to impose draconian sanctions against legitimate crypto market participants that are providing the digital infrastructure needed for these markets to flourish in the United States. The time has come to rethink this blunderbuss approach to enforcement. The proposed Executive Order can achieve this on Day One of your Presidency.    To be clear, you have ample authority to do this. Article II of the Constitution gives the President the power to unilaterally issue such Executive Orders without legislation or regulatory rulemaking. The Justice Department’s own Office of Legal Counsel has opined that Article II empowers the President to compel all federal agencies — including independent regulatory agencies such as the SEC—to comply with executive orders, such as the one proposed here, that would apply generally to all Executive Branch agencies.    You can make America the center of the global crypto economy. The proposed Executive Order can be your first step, on Day One of your Presidency, towards achieving that goal.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Samson Enzer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/16/how-trump-can-help-crypto-on-day-one,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0caa247a2442e0c088f8f9af2c411198c72c1b08-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After rising over 98% from about $0.00001687 to highs around $0.00003343 after the U.S. election, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) rally appears to be stalling. Last week, for example, the popular doggy-themed meme coin declined by over 15% from an opening price of $0.00003219 to close at about $0.00002788. Despite this lackluster price showing, interest in the token remains significantly high, at least according to a recent MetaMask ranking.Shiba Inu (SHIB) Swaps Remain HighSHIB was among the most swapped tokens by MetaMask users last week. According to the popular Ethereum wallet, it was the fifth most swapped token on the platform during the period in question.Other tokens in the top five rankings were Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Pepe (PEPE) , Baby Doge (BabyDoge), and HEX (HEX), in first, second, third, and fourth place, respectively.https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1867643638228168733SHIB's appearance in the ranking highlights high interest among traders. The metric holds even more weight, considering MetaMask's large customer base. The wallet is widely regarded as the most used Ethereum wallet, with over 30 million monthly users. Interestingly, with the latest development, SHIB has now appeared in the MetaMask ranking for three consecutive weeks.A Potential High Return Play?The sustained interest in SHIB despite recent price slumps comes as some investors may see the asset as a potential high-return play. That's because despite SHIB's impressive November 2024 rally, it still significantly underperformed meme coin market leader Dogecoin (DOGE). Specifically, while SHIB rose up to 98% after the election, DOGE surged 220%, suggesting the former may even have more latent bullish potential.Amid these speculations, one market commentator has recently suggested that SHIB is at a critical point, testing the upper bounds of a years-long downtrend. According to the analyst, the meme coin could kick off a 150% rally or decline from here, depending on whether or not the resistance holds. At the time of writing, the token exchanges hands for about $0.00002689.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | SHIB,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/16/shiba-inu-makes-key-metamask-ranking-despite-stalling-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-makes-key-metamask-ranking-despite-stalling-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37718913,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26514,1734360120,"Bitcoin Hits New High Amid Reserve Asset Speculation, Bullish Sentiment Builds","Bitcoin rallied nearly 5% on Dec. 15, reaching a new all-time high of $106,554, fueled by speculation that it may become a U.S. reserve asset. Data from TradingView shows Bitcoin surpassed its previous high of $104,000, set on Dec. 5, before retracing slightly. CK Zheng, chief investment officer of ZK Square, attributed the surge to a “Santa Claus mode,” as investors fear missing out and increase their capital allocation to Bitcoin. Zheng predicted Bitcoin could hit $125,000 by early 2025 but cautioned about a potential 30% correction as much of the bullish sentiment tied to the incoming Trump administration has already been “priced in.” Such a correction from $125,000 would bring Bitcoin down to approximately $87,500. Trump Administration Speculation Fuels Rally The rally follows comments from Strike CEO Jack Mallers, who suggested President-Elect Donald Trump might issue an executive order on Jan. 20, designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset. “There’s potential to use a day-one executive order to purchase Bitcoin,” Mallers said, though he clarified, “It wouldn’t be the size and scale of 1 million coins, but it would be a significant position.” Meanwhile, Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, revealed that a third Bitcoin reserve bill is in progress at the state level, joining similar measures in Texas and Pennsylvania. “We’re going to see more and more of these bills come. At least 10, in my opinion,” Porter said during a Dec. 15 X Spaces discussion. Additional Catalysts for Bitcoin’s Surge Financial analysts are also anticipating a 0.25% interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Dec. 18, which could further boost Bitcoin. Additionally, a new Financial Accounting Standards Board rule taking effect after Dec. 15 allows institutions to more accurately report the value of their crypto assets, potentially attracting more institutional investors.

37719029,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628144,1734359736,Russia’s central bank to aggressively raise interest rates to battle inflation,"Several economists, including Liam Peach, a senior emerging market economist in Capital Economics, expect the Central Bank of Russia to initiate major interest rate hikes on December 20. The speculations are despite the CBR’s Governor, Elvira Nabiullina, mentioning last week that a rate hike was not predetermined in the upcoming rate-setting meeting. Russia’s inflation has continued to rise despite rate hikes to reduce consumer prices during the war with Ukraine. The November inflation report indicated that the consumer price index had risen to 8.9% in November, compared to the 8.5% recorded in October. The rising index was mostly attributed to hiking food prices in Russia. The CBR raised interest rates by 200 basis points in October, bringing borrowing rates to 21% annually. The central bank reported on October 25 that the inflation rate was rising beyond the bank’s July forecast. The report further indicated the continued rise in other metrics, including seasonally adjusted price growth and core inflation. The central bank forecasted an inflation range between 8.0% and 8.5% by the end of the year. Another report confirmed that Russian consumers have experienced a double-digit increase in the price of basic foodstuffs over the past few months. The report highlighted the increasing consumer demand during the war, putting a strain on the country’s supply of goods. Russia has also been experiencing labor shortages and increased production costs. The country has received several sanctions from different countries since 2022, weakening its economic relations. The CBR expected to raise interest rates by 200 basis points A recent Reuters poll indicated that the CBR might raise the interest rate by another 200 basis points on December 20, bringing the borrowing rates to 23% per annum. Some economists in the poll suggested an increase in the borrowing rate to 22%, while others expected a higher rate hike to 25%. Chief economist at Sovkombank Mikhail Vasilyev commented that a 200-basis-point rate hike should be expected, and other indicators point to more hikes in future meetings. The economist Liam Peach agreed to the possibility of a 200-basis-point hike as the base case and speculated that a higher rate hike was also possible. According to Peach, the acceleration in inflation favored another large interest rate hike from the Russian central bank. The economist further highlighted that firms had a growing price expectation. Peach explained that the expectations indicated the CBR’s losing battle with rising inflation. The economist also highlighted that the current conditions would force the bank to hike interest rates massively. The Russian ruble continues to weaken The Russian ruble has been getting weaker amid the growing inflation crisis, with the currency weakening to 114 against the U.S. dollar in November. The ruble has declined to reach 104 against the dollar since then. A University of California San Diego professor, Branislav Slantchev, explained that the currency is at its weakest since the collapse of the USSR. The CBR announced on November 27 that it would stop purchasing foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market to reduce the Russian economy. Moscow leader Vladimir Putin also insisted that the ongoing panic due to the currency’s plunge is unnecessary. Putin explained that the ruble’s fluctuations resulted from ongoing inflation, oil prices, payments to the budget, and more.

Currently, 94.25 percent of the total 21 million BTC supply has been mined, with Bitcoin now the seventh-largest asset globally, overtaking silver and Saudi Aramco in terms of market capitalisation. Notably, ETFs have emerged as a dominant force in BTC markets in 2024, holding over 1.13 million BTC, with cumulative US spot ETF inflows reaching $35.5 billion. This week’s Bitfinex Alpha is our final edition for 2024, and as we head into the Holiday Season, we have an optimistic view of the new year ahead. From the bear market lows of $15,487 in November 2022, Bitcoin has surged over 573 percent, with its price appreciating 130 percent year-to-date. The current bull market reflects strong institutional demand, led by ETFs and spot accumulation. Historical data suggests we are mid-cycle , following the April 2024 halving, with the market likely to peak around Q3–Q4 2025, approximately 450 days post-halving. Cycle Indicators Metrics like MVRV , NUPL , and the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator indicate we remain in the bull phase but far from euphoric peaks. The Pi Cycle Top and 4-Year Moving Average models project potential cycle tops between $145,000 and $189,000. On a historical basis, diminishing returns are moderating the kind of explosive gains we saw for BTC in previous cycles. Key Trends and Future Outlook – Our view is that any corrections in 2025 will remain mild , thanks to institutional inflows. – Halving Year Effect: Historically, post-halving years have seen the strongest rallies . – Cycle Targets: Minimum price estimates stand at $145,000 by mid-2025 , potentially stretching to $200,000 under favourable conditions. While volatility is expected in Q1 2025, the broader trend points to further price appreciation, supported by ETFs, institutional adoption, and Bitcoin’s increasing prominence as a global asset. Investors should however remain vigilant for signs of overbought conditions as Bitcoin approaches its cycle top. BTC price performance in 2025 also takes place against the backdrop of a US economy that is seeing gradual normalisation across key sectors. The labour market continues its steady adjustment , with a modest rise in unemployment to 4.2 percent driven by increased supply of workers, rather than job losses. Wage growth remains robust at 4 percent annually, supporting consumer spending, while gains in sectors like healthcare and leisure highlight the economy’s resilience. The Federal Reserve is expected to proceed cautiously with rate cuts, balancing the cooling job market and persistent inflationary pressures. In the housing market, a projected 2.4 percent increase in home prices signals stable demand despite elevated mortgage rates, which, while declining slightly, remain restrictive for affordability. Improvements in housing supply and rental inventory aim to address structural shortages, but affordability challenges persist, particularly for first-time buyers. These dynamics create opportunities for construction-related industries while constraining high-end market segments. Inflation remains a central focus, with core CPI steady at 3.3 percent YoY, reflecting persistent pressures in vehicle prices and durable goods. The Fed’s restrictive stance, despite planned rate cuts, underscores the difficulty of achieving its 2 percent inflation target. Strong economic growth, including a projected 3.8 percent Q4 annualised rate, supports cautious monetary easing but leaves room for recalibration should inflation persist. The stock market outlook under President-elect Donald Trump is buoyed by pro-growth policies , including tax cuts and deregulation, which benefit industrials, financials, and consumer discretionary sectors. The housing market’s moderate growth and supply improvements could also support equities that are exposed to the sector, though high borrowing costs may limit gains in affordability-sensitive segments. Historical trends suggest potential market optimism following Fed rate cuts, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average already posting strong post-cut gains . However, risks like inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and fiscal constraints could temper long-term market performance. In sum, 2025 presents a cautiously optimistic economic environment marked by steady growth, persistent structural challenges, and strategic policy adjustments. While normalisation across sectors offers stability, external risks and inflationary pressures will remain critical considerations for sustained momentum.

Another week, another Saylor buy. On Dec. 16, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor disclosed the firm’s latest Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchase, worth $1.5 billion for 15,350 BTC at an average price of $100,386, according to a regulatory filing. MicroStrategy’s entire Bitcoin stash is now valued at over $45 billion, as BTC reached a new all-time high of $106,000. Approximately $18 billion of this value represents unrealized profits, with the company’s initial capital investment since 2020 estimated at $27.1 billion. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD.

The so-called “infinite money glitch” strategy employed by MicroStrategy has ignited debates across both traditional finance and crypto communities. Saylor plans to buy $42 billion worth of Bitcoin before 2028, by issuing debt to raise capital from shares investors. BTC miners like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms hopped on the trend, filing their treasures with more BTC by offering convertible notes. This strategy has earned MicroStrategy billions and positioned the company as the top private BTC holding entity. The Nasdaq exchange plans to add MicroStrategy to the coveted Nasdaq-100 index, providing MSTR with larger investor exposure. You might also like: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge However, the debt-for-BTC strategy has drawn criticism. Saylor’s plan heavily relies on Bitcoin maintaining an upward trend, an outcome many in traditional finance and crypto circles view as likely. Nonetheless, a sharp market correction could jeopardize MicroStrategy’s position and potentially trigger a cascading effect reminiscent of the 2022 crypto market downturn. Bitcoin bull thesis Whether viewed as accounting brilliance or financial recklessness, Saylor’s steadfast support for Bitcoin has garnered praise from crypto advocates, who point to bullish indicators to counter skepticism.

37718605,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662956,1734359444,Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’,"Raoul Pal, the former hedge fund manager who retired at the age of 36 and now serves as the co-founder of Real Vision, a prominent financial media company, has given an update on his crypto portfolio. In a post on X today, December 16, Pal unveiled his concentrated investment strategy, highlighting Dogecoin as a central component of his crypto portfolio. Raoul Pal Stills Bets Big On Dogecoin “I have concentrated bets. This is my watch list. I won’t be the best performer and I won’t be the worst. Outside of this I just scrape profits to buy NFT’s for the long haul,” Pal stated in his announcement. The accompanying screenshot detailed his watch list, which encompasses a range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, SUI, DeepBook Protocol, and Smoking Chicken Fish. When queried by a user about his thesis for Dogecoin, Pal responded, “It’s outperformed BTC by 500% since 2013… and Elon/X.” This statement underscores his confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential, especially because of the connection to Elon Musk. Musk has been hinting at integrating Dogecoin into the payments feature of X, though no official confirmation has yet been made. Recent activity and speculation have been fueled by a tweet from Musk featuring a new dollar icon on a user’s profile, which differs from the existing tipping feature on X. This has led to increased speculation that Dogecoin could be integrated into a forthcoming X Payments service​. Related Reading: Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle Previously, Musk had expressed intentions to use Dogecoin for premium services on the platform, but initial documents related to X Payments did not include crypto in its launch phase. Nonetheless, Musk’s continued public support for Dogecoin and his comments favoring its integration have kept hopes alive within the Dogecoin community​, one of the strongest catalysts for DOGE price. Another user engaged Pal in a discussion regarding Dogecoin’s future, stating, “I secured 100k DOGE thinking next year when they implement Department of Government Efficiency it will be constantly in the news circulation and may result in subconsciously influencing the market trend. What do you think?” To which Pal succinctly replied, “Just the start,” indicating his belief that the headline for Department of Governance Efficiency (DOGE) under the lead of Musk will have significant impact on Dogecoin in the upcoming months. When asked about his investment in the lesser-known altcoin DeepBook Protocol (DEEP), Pal explained, “As Sui volumes scale, so does DEEP. Pretty simple beta play and it’s still a low market cap,” highlighting his strategy of targeting emerging projects with growth potential tied to scalable blockchain solutions. In addition to his statements on X, Pal recently shared his broader investment philosophy in an interview with Mario Nawfal. He articulated his views on the cyclical nature of liquidity injection into markets, driven by governmental debt refinancing every four years. Pal elaborated: Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Slump Looms, Analyst Points To Only One Lifeline “Where are we in the four-year cycle? I break them down by seasons each year being a different season Bitcoin usually leads in spring and summer which is now and then Bitcoin dominance falls and ALT season starts in a couple of months […] This is just an annual sign when we go into the next fall or the Autumn cycle that’s usually the most explosive beginning of next year.” Pal further discussed the implications of these cycles on the crypto market, suggesting that current conditions are setting the stage for an “explosive” period in the upcoming cycle. He emphasized that the persistence of these cycles hinges on the continued injection and withdrawal of liquidity by governments, a dynamic he refers to as the “everything code.” Notably, Pal addressed the concept of a potential “super cycle” for Bitcoin and crypto markets, positing that such an occurrence is improbable unless there is a fundamental change in the underlying economic structures, specifically regarding global debt and demographics. “I don’t see how that happens, unless they break this everything code cycle of liquidity,” Pal remarked.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

With this, the altcoins that were trying hard to keep up the bullish trend have scrambled back under bearish influence. In the meantime, the prices of the two popular and primitive altcoins, XRP & Litecoin (LTC), appear to have been sailing within a similar boat, forming similar chart patterns. Which will trigger a breakout first? XRP Price Analysis After rising by nearly 500%, the XRP price is believed to be one of the top gainers of the impact of the U.S. elections. Meanwhile, the bulls continue to exert extreme exhaustion since then and as a result, the price is maintaining a declining consolidation, forming constant lower highs and lows. However, the token in the short term displays huge bearish influence, but in reality it is preparing for a major shift in the momentum. The price is trading within a decisive symmetrical triangle in the short term, and despite a rejection from the resistance, a rebound appears to be imminent. The stochastic RSI has reached the lower oversold zone, which suggests a bullish crossover could be fast appsoching. With this, the price is expected to break above the triangle and secure the immediate resistance at $2.5. However, a continuous rise within the resistance zone around $2.6 may eliminate the bearish activity, pushing the price towards new yearly highs, probably above $3. Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis On the other hand, the Litecoin price also trades within a decisive triangle, similar to XRP but carries the possibility of a 6% to 8% pullback. Although the price is failing to rise over the resistance of the triangle, the technicals suggest the lows for the current pullback have yet to be reached. As seen in the above chart, the stochastic RSI has triggered a bearish crossover but is yet to reach the lower support. Until then, the Litecoin price is believed to maintain a consistent descending trend within the triangle and reach the lower support close to $110 in the next few hours. However, a rebound could occur but the trend may remain consolidated within the pattern, while a breakout could require more strength and volume of the buyers.",NEUTRAL,LTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | LTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/litecoin-xrp-trades-within-a-decessive-phase-heres-when-the-xrp-ltc-prices-may-breakout/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), one of the leading players in the tokenization industry, surged to a high of $2.15, marking an increase of over 327% from its August low The rally was primarily driven by World Liberty Finance, platform associated with Donald Trump, which purchased ONDO tokens worth over $250,000. These purchases were a continuation of a process that started recently. It bought Ethereum tokens worth $57 million, USDC worth $6.1 million, and AAVE worth $2.3 million.

It recently broke above a critical resistance level at $1.4840, completing the upper side of a cup-and-handle pattern. Ondo has also surpassed the pivot and reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines at $2. The coin remains above all major moving averages, indicating that bulls are firmly in control. Additionally, oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD are pointing upwards. As a result, Ondo Finance’s price is expected to continue rising, with bulls targeting the key resistance level at $2.5, approximately 25% above the current price. This target is derived from the depth of the cup pattern projected from the breakout point. However, a drop below the support level at $1.48 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

It seems that any attempt to garner significant upward momentum is stubbed, somewhat dampening bullish end-of-year projections for Ripple . Indeed, the week has seen just a 1% gain. With trading volume at a monthly low of $6.6 billion, XRP, like other notable altcoins , has taken a backseat.

From its current position at a $137.22 billion market cap, such a valuation would represent an almost 630% advance on current prices. However, he cautions that his analysis serves as a template for price action rather than precise timeframes and price points. This forecast is not without its merit, though, particularly with the imminent launch of Ripple’s $RLUSD stablecoin . Something Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said could significantly enhance XRP’s utility and liquidity. “By increasing transaction volumes and demand for XRP, RLUSD may play a pivotal role in supporting price growth. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing adoption for cross-border payments continues to bolster market sentiment,” he explained. However, while he did credit forecasts placing an XRP price peak above $10, he cautioned that these targets “hinge largely on adoption and a resolution to regulatory hurdles.” XRP Price Analysis: Where Will Ripple Go From Here? A seemingly successful breakout of a flag pattern forming since late November could mark the beginning of CrediBULL Crypto’s vision for XRP. XRP / USDT 4H chart, flag pattern breakout. Source: Binance. This pattern sets an XRP price target of $3.43, representing a 45% advance on current prices and a notable leap towards the asset’s previous high of $3.84. While the initial breakout has experienced subdued momentum, the $2.5571 support level appears to be holding strong. However, if this support level is lost, there might be a retest of the pattern’s upper resistance trendline to confirm the breakout. This scenario seems credible considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in bearish territory just below neutral, and the MACD line remains below the signal line. Both indicators suggest that bears retain control over the XRP price. This New Opportunity Could Bring Bigger Gains While Solana’s potential is undeniable, its meteoric rise this year has been significantly bolstered by the meme coin scene – the foremost narrative driving gains this cycle.

37719035,https://blockworks.co/news/helium-revenue-supports-dawn-future,1734359015,Helium revenues heat up just in time for a new DAWN,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . DAWN’s goal is lofty. All the best ones are. Aiming to enable regular consumers to serve each other broadband — and be rewarded for it with crypto — is similar to what Helium has done for mobile coverage over the past few years. DAWN is positioning itself as a decentralized protocol for gigabit-level internet access, as in, download speeds of over 1 gigabyte per second (1,000 megabytes per second). Helium hotspots, on the other hand, generally offer a 5G-grade service. There are technically no minimum and maximum levels for how fast 5G internet can be. Helium users have reported download speeds ranging from under 100 megabytes per second to actual gigabit ranges. But it depends on the area, with factors including user demand, density and quality of the hotspots available. Still, Helium plays a role in DAWN’s future, whether it likes it or not. Helium is the most obvious benchmark for DePIN adoption right now, especially for projects vying to disrupt services like telecoms and the internet. Helium has been heating up all year And considering DAWN is utilizing Solana for its tokenomics — as does Helium since it switched from its own network in April 2023 — the two are destined to be compared against each other ad infinitum. It could be that DAWN may only really be considered a success if it can eclipse Helium in certain metrics. While the subscription rates of Helium’s mobile service have slowed somewhat (105 per day on average this quarter compared to 225 in Q3), users are spending more than ever to use the network. At least since Helium swapped over to Solana as usage data before the jump is apparently no longer publicly available. Helium users spent almost $63,000 and $56,000 on data in the first two weeks of December, as shown by the light green columns on the above chart. The price of HNT is otherwise plotted by the purple line. In a way, DAWN is a bet on that number increasing dramatically from here. And what’s good for Helium could be good for DAWN — as long as the latter successfully channels that energy toward the home, rather than the hotspot.

Yet, it might do so soon if it is able to take out this one significant obstacle. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the ADA/USDT chart, the asset has been surging almost vertically, breaking above several resistance levels, including the 200-day moving average, which is a key trend indicator. However, the $1.2 resistance level has been preventing the market from rising further, and the price is consolidating below it at the moment. While it seemingly creates a head and shoulders pattern, as long as the $0.75 support zone holds, the market structure will remain bullish, and a new record high will be within reach. The BTC Paired Chart The Bitcoin-paired chart shows an almost similar picture to that of the ADA/USDT one, with a key difference. The ADA/BTC chart creates the head and shoulders pattern above a significant level, which is the 1000 SAT area. If the neckline of the pattern, which coincides with the 1000 SAT support level, breaks down, a drop toward the 200-day moving average, located around the 700 SAT mark, will be probable. On the other hand, if the 1000 SAT area holds, a further rally toward the 1500 SAT resistance zone would be very likely in the coming weeks.

37718230,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374815,1734358671,Here’s What Needs to Happen for ETH to Break its All-Time High Soon: Ethereum Price Analysis,"After facing rejection at the critical $4K resistance and retracing to the $3.5K support level, Ethereum witnessed a strong resurgence of buying pressure, triggering another impulsive rally. The price has once again approached the $4K resistance, where a potential breakout could ignite a short-squeeze, driving Ethereum higher. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum recently faced a rejection at the pivotal $4K resistance, triggering a decline to the critical $3.5K support level. This range has proven to be a key demand zone, attracting significant buying pressure. As a result, the market witnessed a strong rebound, driving the price back toward the $4K resistance. Currently, buyers are striving to reclaim this psychological and structural barrier, setting the stage for a sustained rally toward the asset’s all-time high. If ETH breaks above the $4K resistance in the coming days, it could trigger a short-squeeze event, forcing short positions to unwind and propelling the price higher. However, the $4K level also serves as a substantial supply zone, and failure to break through could lead to another rejection. In such a scenario, Ethereum is likely to continue consolidating within the $3.5K–$4K range in the short term as buyers and sellers compete for control. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum has been moving within an ascending price channel. Following a rejection at the channel’s upper boundary near the $4K level, the price retraced sharply, breaking below the channel’s middle boundary and testing the lower trendline around the $3.5K support zone. This critical juncture sparked renewed buying activity, resulting in a bullish rebound that pushed ETH back toward the channel’s middle boundary at $4K. The $4K level now poses significant resistance, aligning with the channel’s upper boundary. If buyers manage to break above this resistance and decisively sustain the momentum, Ethereum could embark on a fresh bullish rally, targeting its ATH. However, in the event of another rejection, the price may remain confined within the ascending channel, with the $3.5K support acting as a key cushion. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The futures market plays a crucial role in driving price trends and volatility. Among its key indicators, funding rates offer valuable insights into market sentiment. As shown in the chart, the recent bullish rebound from the $3.5K support level was accompanied by a noticeable spike in funding rates, reflecting traders’ growing interest in taking long positions on Ethereum. This surge in funding rates highlights the increasing buying pressure and prevailing bullish sentiment, with market participants anticipating further gains in the mid-term. If the upward trend in funding rates continues, a breakout above the $4K resistance will become increasingly likely.

37717704,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/your-wealth-deserves-the-best-web3-banking-advantages-and-safety-tips,1734358622,Your Wealth Deserves the Best: Web3 Banking Advantages and Safety Tips,"Web3 banking offers numerous benefits tailored to the unique needs of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), providing enhanced financial flexibility, privacy, and opportunities for wealth management in the decentralized economy. However, a final stance on the regulation of Web3 is still pending, and security remains a common concern. There is no doubt some financial institutions in the space are untrustworthy, while others may face security vulnerabilities or flaws, which is equally valid for traditional banks. Individuals seeking to avail themselves of the exciting opportunities that Web3 offers can take measures to ensure that their assets are safe. Legitimate platforms comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules and hold licenses from the financial authorities in their operating regions, such as FINMA in Switzerland, DFSA in Dubai, and MAS in Singapore. Luxury banking platforms like WELF, which caters to HNWIs, adhere closely to all three. Advanced cryptographic tools ensure fund safety Reliable digital banks use strong encryption to protect data transmission and secure personal and financial information. Reliable, modern cryptographic security protocols include homomorphic and biometric encryption as well as multiparty computation. Homomorphic encryption is a computation method that involves processing data without the need to decrypt it first. One of its most promising features is the ability to secure data in transit or in use. Biometric encryption binds biometrics like facial scans, fingerprints, or voice to a cryptographic key in such a way that malicious entities cannot retrieve the biometric or the key from the stored template. Recreating the key is only possible if the original and live biometrics are presented for verification. Multiparty computation is a crucial cryptography subset, which distributes work across numerous servers. The method makes sure that no single server has all the encrypted data at the same time. In sum, Web3 introduces a new trust model: minimizing trust and placing it in technical processes. Investigating the platform’s financial stability Potential clients of Web3 banks should investigate financial health, such as the bank’s funding sources, profitability, or backing by strong investors. Certifications like ISO 27001 demonstrate adherence to global security standards. In addition, the institution should regularly be undergoing third-party audits and sharing reports on its operational and financial performance. These efforts are encouraged in light of the potential benefits that exposure to crypto and blockchain brings. While Web3 doesn’t always rely on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the concept is nearly indistinguishable from the technologies behind it. Exposure to cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and tokenized assets diversifies portfolios and opens pathways to new markets. Decentralized finance platforms offer staking, lending, and liquidity provisioning with attractive yields compared to traditional banking. Tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate and art, allows fractional investments and liquidity in these traditionally illiquid assets. Global access without borders Unlike traditional banking, Web3 banking operates around the clock, ensuring instant access to funds anywhere in the world. For example, WELF’s high-limit credit and debit cards offer global access, advanced security, and concierge services. Clients get access to secure, modern digital platforms while benefiting from transparent advisory services. WELF’s platform builds the bridge between bleeding-edge technology and the reliability of traditional banking, ensuring the very best for its clients’ wealth. Its increasing impact in the Web3 space is reflected in the upcoming sale of its native token, $WELF, which will subsequently be listed on a centralized exchange. The token will serve as the ecosystem’s cornerstone, facilitating platform governance, transactions, and access to premium services, ultimately helping integrate blockchain technology with conventional wealth management tools. Safeguarding against economic uncertainty Web3 wealth management platforms provide a hedge against inflation. High-market-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum or stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies can preserve wealth. Access to decentralized ecosystems ensures liquidity even in times of financial crises. Tailored wealth management strategies Programmable smart contracts can execute wealth management strategies or inheritance plans automatically. Onboarding for HNWIs is streamlined, but not at the expense of maintaining privacy and regulatory compliance. Web3 protocols can be customized to meet specific needs, like multi-signature wallets or family office integrations. Eliminating intermediaries By doing away with middlemen, Web3 banking reduces fees associated with traditional banking services like asset management. The blockchain ensures direct ownership of assets, eliminating counterparty risks from third-party custody. Tools like zero-knowledge proofs enable private transactions without compromising transparency. Exclusive access to premium services Some digital banking platforms offer premium services like membership in elite DAOs and token-gated services. HNWIs can take part in exclusive decentralized autonomous organizations tailored to their unique needs and requirements, offering networking opportunities and shared investment strategies. They gain access to exclusive investment opportunities based on ownership of specific digital assets. Web3’s role in furthering philanthropy Web3 platforms enable traceable and efficient charitable contributions, a frequent consideration for wealthy donors, who get the most significant tax breaks from philanthropic initiatives. The direct taxpayer subsidy for charity is estimated to amount to several hundreds of billions a year if one is to include the total value of capital gains and estate tax reductions. The wealthier the individual, the higher the taxpayer subsidy for their donation because affluent donors face considerably lower tax obligations, including income tax, estate tax, capital gains, and gift taxes. First-mover advantages HNWIs are uniquely positioned at the forefront of Web3 innovations, potentially enjoying first-mover advantages. In 2014, Tim Draper made headlines for buying approximately 30,000 BTC during a US government auction. At the time, 1 BTC was worth $632. He was wealthy before that but became even wealthier.

37718324,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628061,1734358543,Polygon’s $1B yield plan under fire from former employee,"A former Polygon employee, via an X post, flagged the blockchain’s risky incentive injection to boost its Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) ecosystem. He suggests that the Polygon community is evaluating a proposal to generate yield from over $1 billion in stablecoin reserves held on the PoS Chain bridge. The AggLayer is a decentralized protocol that aggregates ZK proofs from all connected chains and ensures safety for near-instant cross-chain transactions. The proposal came when Polygon recently transitioned from MATIC to POL, its new native token. POL is serving as the gas and staking token for Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain while supporting the network’s ambitious 2.0 roadmap. Polygon’s $1B yield proposal sparks debate Pranav Maheshwari in an X post mentioned that the proposal to generate yield from stablecoin reserves was presented by the Allez Labs in collaboration with DeFi protocols. The plan suggests approximately $70 million in annual opportunity costs from the idle reserves. Polygon Bridge locks the stable reserves through multiple processes. First of all, a user decides to initiate the transfer of tokens from Ethereum to Polygon. After this, tokens are being locked in a smart contract on Ethereum which serves as an escrow. It ensures that the tokens remain secure until the process is complete. The former Polygon employee highlighted that these locked tokens are the assets that the side chain is looking to use as collateral to generate yield for the ecosystem. However, Validators on Polygon are notified of the locked tokens in the process while equivalent tokens are minted on the network. Here comes the main thing – How will the yield be generated from here? Maheshwari added that around $1.3 billion in stablecoin is sitting idle on the Polygon Pos Bridge. These funds would be bridged to Ethereum and deposited into ERC-4626 vaults (Morpho Labs, Sky Ecosystem) to generate 7% APY which will eventually yield $91 million annually. The yield will return to the Polygon ecosystem and will reward depositors via Yearnfi vaults for USDC, USDT, and DAI. While the proposal promises liquidity, decentralization, and ecosystem growth, risks loom. He warns that any hack or attack on the yield protocols could jeopardize the bridge’s stability, endangering user assets. Security Concerns & measures In theory, this approach seems ideal, but in practice, it carries significant risks. If any underlying yield-generating protocol experiences a hack or financial attack, it could compromise the value of the Polygon assets secured by the bridge,… — Pranav Maheshwari (@impranavm_) December 16, 2024 He added that the security assurances have been made, but the community must weigh innovation against potential fallout. If this process turns out to be successful, it could set a trend for native liquidity solutions in DeFi. Aave governance raises concerns Aave governance delegate Marc Zeller has raised concerns over the controversial plan as it could affect Aave’s future on Polygon. It is the largest protocol on Polygon. It holds over a third of the chain’s total value locked (TVL) at $467 million (DeFiLlama). Some users have argued that the program’s profits could help incentivize liquidity and fuel ecosystem growth. But Marc Zeller and many others are wary as adding extra layers of risk to “stable” assets could backfire. If any yield protocols face issues, it could destabilize Polygon’s bridge and harm the ecosystem. Stablecoins are meant to be stable, and this could undermine that trust. As of now, POL (ex-MATIC) (POL) recorded a correction after registering a fun upward run. POL price is down by around 10% in the last 7 days while it is still up by 62% over the past 60 days. POL is trading at an average price of $0.59, at the press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 26% to stand at $289 million.

37718323,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628106,1734358531,Peter Schiff accuses Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy of Bitcoin market manipulation,"Peter Schiff, the relentless gold maximalist and Bitcoin hater, has set his sights on Michael Saylor and his company MicroStrategy, accusing them of manipulating BTC price. The sharp allegations followed Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to an all-time high of $106,493 last night. Pointing to MicroStrategy’s buying spree, Peter said that the company’s pattern of purchases is a calculated move to drive BTC prices higher. “Most likely, we’ll find out tomorrow that Saylor was the buyer. That seems to be the trend—it’s happened the last five Mondays in a row,” he quipped in one of his routine scathing social media posts. Now Peter has been consistent in his hatred. “Bitcoin misdirects investments from essential sectors,” he has said in the past, claiming that it diverts resources away from productive endeavors. He’s particularly critical of government officials who support Bitcoin investments, calling it a misuse of taxpayer money. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin obsession MicroStrategy’s buying frenzy began in July when the company purchased 12,222 BTC for $805.2 million, paying an average price of $65,882 per coin. By the end of that month, its total stash had swelled to 226,500 BTC, acquired at a cumulative cost of $8.3 billion. While figures for August and September remain murky, December turned into a showcase of MicroStrategy’s unapologetic appetite for Bitcoin. On December 9, the company announced a jaw-dropping purchase of 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion. This was the fifth consecutive Monday of major acquisitions, establishing a suspiciously consistent buying pattern that the likes of Peter are quick to cite in their accusations. At press time, MicroStrategy holds 423,650 BTC. With BTC above $100,000, the company’s holdings were valued at over $43.6 billion. Saylor hinted at even more purchases, saying that the company is now paying over $100,000 per token. If true, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin portfolio could soon approach $50 billion in value. Coincidence or manipulation? Every time MicroStrategy announces a new Bitcoin acquisition, the market reacts. And it’s not subtle. The correlation between Saylor’s buying habits and BTC’s price movements is frankly too conspicuous to ignore. Bitcoin’s decentralized and lightly regulated nature makes it a prime target for manipulation. Common tactics like pump-and-dump schemes, spoofing, and wash trading have plagued the industry for years, and institutional players risk exploiting these same loopholes on a much larger scale. While some folks like to argue that institutional involvement legitimizes Bitcoin as a mainstream asset, others, like the author of this article, believe it undermines the principles that the digital asset was built on.

Here’s What Happened,"As per data from XRPScan, a significant XRP transaction involving the transfer of 800 million XRP worth about $2 billion was recorded on December 16, 2024. The transaction, which occurred between two Binance-linked wallets, was shared on X by Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a well-known XRP community member, and has sparked community interest and speculation regarding its purpose. Massive #XRP Transfer: 800 Million XRP Moved Between Binance Wallets in Single Transaction pic.twitter.com/g3HLq1vEm1 — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) December 16, 2024 Despite the transaction’s scale, preliminary analysis suggests it is part of Binance’s internal fund management activities rather than an indicator of market manipulation or an impending event. The transaction was executed successfully, with no irregularities reported. It incurred a minimal fee of 0.00001 XRP. Such low transaction costs are typical of the XRP Ledger’s efficient infrastructure, which remains one of its key competitive advantages. Community Reactions The substantial movement of funds triggered varied reactions from the XRP community and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. A notable comment from a user speculated, “Something huge is on the horizon,” indicating a belief that the transaction could precede significant developments, such as a market rally or a strategic move by Binance. Another commenter shared this bullish sentiment, suggesting , “Tomorrow morning, buy the last dip.” This hints at a massive move for the digital asset in the near term and suggests that whales might be preparing for this rally with the recent transaction. However, not all reactions were optimistic. One critical observation raised the possibility of illicit fund transfers. While this claim lacks substantial evidence, it highlights persistent concerns about the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit financial activities, which is often over-emphasized, like in the recent 60 Minutes interview with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Explanations for the Transfer Massive transactions like this are common in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially among exchanges. Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, often conducts high-value internal transfers to optimize liquidity, enhance security, or rebalance funds across its wallets. These internal transactions are typically unrelated to broader market movements or speculative events. Unlike whale transactions involving private wallets, which might signal strategic buy or sell actions, exchanges like Binance frequently move funds without any direct implications for market prices. The internal nature of this transaction, coupled with Binance’s operational scale, suggests it is likely a routine measure rather than a signal for market players. XRP has not significantly reacted to this transaction, currently trading at $2.38, and showing a 1.20% decline over the past 24 hours.

37720076,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319710,1734358290,Report Suggests New Developers Prefer Solana – Can This Push SOL to $500?,"Solana has risen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $219.66 coming as the cryptocurrency market as a whole gains by the same percentage today. The alt is now down by 3% in a week and by 16.5% since reaching an all-time high of $263.21 on November 23, with SOL price predictions remaining bullish in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory. And while it has retreated since late November, now remains very much a positive time for Solana, with Electric Capital’s latest Developer Report finding that it became the most popular network and ecosystem among new developers in 2024. This is very encouraging as far as Solana’s fundamentals go, suggesting that SOL could make some very big price gains next year, and beyond. Report Suggests New Developers Prefer Solana – Can This Push SOL to $500? What’s interesting about Electric Capital’s Developer Report is that it documents changes in cryptocurrency development since 2015, finding some big shifts in demographics and adoption.

Source: Electric Capital And in India, Solana happens to be the most popular ecosystem, accounting for just under 30% of all devs. The report also discovered that Solana doesn’t only dominate with new developers, but also with NFTs and DEXes. For instance, 57% of all NFT minters are on Solana, which also accounts for 81% of all DEX (decentralized exchange) transactions. Source: Electric Capital It’s therefore quite difficult not to be bullish about SOL, which has already been one of this year’s best-performing tokens. Many analysts are already very positive about the token for purely technical reasons, with the coin recently breaking through the neckline of a long-term neck-and-shoulders pattern. #Solana Intermediate Target: $400 $SOL has successfully retested the neckline of the Cup & Handle pattern and looks poised for an upward move. pic.twitter.com/N7S8uyUWIQ — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) December 15, 2024 And looking at its chart today, it seems that the coin is getting closer to enjoying a significant rebound from recent selling. Its relative strength index (purple) has been below 50 for a few days now, increasing the probability of a recovery. We also see that its 30-period average (orange) has been below the 200-period (blue) for several days, so this adds to the suspicion that SOL could rally this week. Source: TradingView Based on this analysis, we could see the Solana price move to $230 by the end of the week, before ending the year at around $260. New Presale Coins Offer Strong Diversification Potential Solana is likely to remain one of the strongest major alts for a long time to come, but traders looking to hedge their bets would do well to consider smaller cap tokens as well. Smaller alts can often outperform the market, and this includes presale coins, which often generate lots of momentum en route to listing for the first time. One token doing this right now is Best Wallet Token (BEST) , which has now raised an impressive $4.5 million in its ongoing sale. Over $4 Million Raised in the $BEST Presale! Best Wallet Family, we are unstoppable! This presale is advancing rapidly, and each phase is closing out faster than before. Secure your $BEST tokens before we progress to the next stage! Join here https://t.co/AALEwrMCmn pic.twitter.com/HpkPyzL4Ty — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) December 13, 2024 Best is the native ERC-20 token of Best Wallet app, which has become one of the most popular software wallets in crypto since launching last year. Best Wallet users will gain several benefits from holding BEST, including discounts on transaction fees, higher staking rewards, voting rights, and early access to new presales and airdrops. And because Best Wallet is one of the most well-established crypto wallets in the sector, BEST should therefore experience plenty of organic demand once it launches in the next few months. To join the sale, investors can simply go to the official Best Wallet Token website , where BEST is selling at $0.0232. This price will rise in just under a day, and will rise numerous more times before the sale ends. New investors should therefore act quickly, since all the available signs suggest that BEST could surge once it lists next year.

37719530,https://invezz.com/?p=2389330,1734358168,Ethereum and Solana prices rise as investors shift to iDEGEN,"Ethereum price holds steady amid heightened investor interest ETH/USD has held steady above the previously strong resistance zone of $3,750 for close to a week; trading close to the 9-month high it hit earlier in the month. The leading altcoin has been leveraging on the positive market sentiment that has seen BTC/USD hit fresh highs in recent weeks. On Monday, Bitcoin extended last week’s gains to an intraday high of $106,584.38. In addition to this Bitcoin-led rallying, Ethereum price is leveraging on its increased investor interest and heightened activity within its ecosystem. According to sosovalue , ETH spot ETFs recorded daily net inflows of $23.61 million on Friday with the cumulative net inflows reaching $2.26 billion. Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) recorded inflows of $7.24 million while BlackRock’s ETHA saw daily inflows of $9.51 million. iDEGEN’s fair pricing model prompts wild investor interest In about two weeks from now, the viral AI experiment – iDEGEN – will be listed on crypto exchanges. Since its launch on 26th November, it has raised over $5 million with over 1 billion $IDGN tokens sold. So what’s behind the success of this project? The project has been developed such that it is for the community, by the community. The result has been a viral AI meme coin that a large number of savvy investors want a piece of. To start with, it was born on X on blank-slate AI. Its only rule is that it posts hourly; learning and absorbing all the chaos thrown at it by crypto degens in the form of tags, tweets, or comments. Having users shape the project’s development is an approach that has caught momentum in the crypto space and iDEGEN continues to benefit from it. Not only has it heightened curiosity among potential investors, but it has also boosted engagement. The resultant FOMO is what has pushed savvy investors, both seasoned and novice, to acquire some $IDGN tokens before they hit the public shelves. Besides, its fair pricing model is such that one can purchase some tokens without breaking the bank. In a typical presale, the prices start low and increases as the project gains traction. However, the price can come crushing after an ICO as most of the early adopters liquidate their holdings to make a quick buck. iDEGEN has adopted a unique auction that ensures the market gets a reasonable price while mitigating dumps post its listing in January 2025. In its dynamic pricing model, the price changes after every 5 minutes depending on the market activity. For instance, a buy made within 5 minutes will have the price remaining unchanged in the next 5-minute interval. On the other hand, the price will drop by 5% if no purchase is made within a span of 5 minutes. At the same time, purchases during two consecutive intervals yields a price increase of 5%. Upon its listing, $IDGN’s price will be 10% higher than at the close of the current auction. This model ensures that the market ends up with the price it determined for itself as opposed to random figures set by its creators. You can buy the iDEGEN token here . SOL/USD may be range-bound even as bulls remain in control After hitting a fresh all-time high in November at $265.05, Solana has erased some of its gains to trade at $219.26 as at the time of writing. Amid the positive market sentiment in the crypto space, the bulls are striving to defend the support zone at around $220. Notably, this previously steady resistance zone has been a rather strong support level for the altcoin for about a month now. While the bulls remain in control, SOL/USD may be rangebound in the near term. A look at its daily chart shows it trading between the 20 and 50-day EMAs. A period of consolidation may have it trading between $215.53 and $233.07 as bulls gather enough momentum for further rallying.

Interestingly, Peter Schiff was quick to intercept the announcement with another criticism against Saylor, his company, and BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD.

The firm’s total stash has grown to 439,000 BTC, valued at well above $44 billion at current prices, while it spent $27.1 billion to acquire it. MicroStrategy’s BTC yield has grown to 46.4% in the past quarter alone, with the number standing above 72% for the entire year. Thus, the company has continued a recent tradition that started several weeks ago: announcing massive purchases worth over $1 billion on Monday. Another thing that didn’t change this week is the vocal criticism of well-known bitcoin hater – Peter Schiff.

Its native coin, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana stands out by avoiding sharding or second-layer solutions, focusing instead on a network capable of handling many transactions per second. This approach aims to attract developers and users looking for fast and efficient decentralized services. With its emphasis on speed and flexibility across programming languages, SOL and the Solana platform offer potential in supporting high-activity products and services in the current market. Ethereum’s Role and Potential in Blockchain Technology Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It enables smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. The network supports decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens for governance, utility, and value storage, but Ether (ETH) is still needed for gas fees. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, improving scalability and efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase aims to further boost these aspects. Ether remains central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. With its continuous developments and key position in the blockchain space, Ethereum holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Conclusion While XRP, SOL, and ETH show limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN offers high growth potential with expected 700% gains by the end of presale. Following successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, it builds a community of leaders and provides real benefits, including exclusive campaigns for early adopters.

The USDtb token aims to keep a steady $1 price and holds 90% of its reserves in BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize.  ""In light of the rapidly accelerating demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to provide a new product that offers users an entirely different risk profile from USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem,” Ethena founder Guy Young said in a statement.  Ethena is one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms this year, attracting nearly $6 billion of user funds since its public launch in early 2024. The protocol's flagship token USDe, marketed as a ""synthetic dollar"" with a steady $1 price, generates yield to investors by shorting bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) perpetual swaps and farming the funding rates. This investment strategy offers lofty yields – currently 27% annualized – when crypto markets are in bull mode, but can quickly turn unprofitable when things turn bearish with persistently negative funding rates.  The new offering will allow Ethena close the underlying derivatives positions behind USDe and divert the backing assets to USDtb during periods of negative funding rates and mitigating risks, the Ethena team explained.  The protocol also aspires to get USDtb accepted as collateral in the future for margin trading on centralized exchanges.  Read more: Tokenized Treasuries: A Game-Changer for Collateral in Crypto Markets  Ethena enlisted Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional as custodians for USDtb, according to a press release. Liquidity providers for the token include Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets and SCB Limited.  Ethena also applied with the new USDtb stablecoin for Sky's, formerly MakerDAO, so-called Tokenization Gran Prix program that aims to invest up to $1 billion funds in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) products.

The collaboration will leverage blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent data sharing while creating a liquid market for compute assets such as graphics processing units ( GPUs ). Monetizing AI resources Kite AI and GAIB seek to provide stakeholders with the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) tools necessary to monetize AI-related resources, including GPU-backed stablecoins and lending markets . As such, the partnership is expected to empower smaller players in the sector , accelerate adoption, encourage innovation, and address a number of issues in an industry dominated by large corporations. Kony Kwong, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GAIB, described compute as the ‘new currency’, implying market access is essential: “In the AI era, compute is the new currency, and GPUs are the new assets driving this currency. Partnering with Kite AI allows us to dismantle barriers for people to access the marketplace, unlocking new financial opportunities of the AI industry for all.” Chi Zhang, Co-founder and CEO of Kite AI, echoed Kwong’s sentiment, stating: “We envision an AI landscape where innovation is driven by a diverse ecosystem of contributors, not monopolized by a few giants. Our partnership with GAIB is a critical step toward that goal. Together, we’re building a decentralized, democratic, and trustless AI economy.” How can Kite AI and GAIB increase AI liquidity? As part of the collaboration, Kite AI will rely on a blockchain-based coordination layer to bring AI models, datasets, and agents to a decentralized platform. On the other hand, GAIB will leverage its economic framework to turn illiquid AI resources into tokenized, tradable assets. This approach not only creates new revenue streams for stakeholders but also makes compute and data resources more available. Consequently, the two partners expect the collaboration to promote future AI innovation that emphasizes more than just centralized control and empowers more participants in the sector.

37717753,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628115,1734357318,The Federal Reserve is at a breaking point – What does the 2025 rate script look like?,"Analysts forecast a final interest rate reduction from the Federal Reserve this Wednesday, but the real focus is on whether the central bank will adjust its expectations for 2025. Inflation remains sticky, but the job market is showing resilience, and policymakers are uncertain about the path ahead. Federal Reserve officials are expected to reduce interest rates for the third consecutive month, with economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecasting another quarter-point cut at the upcoming December 17-18 meeting. The cuts would bring the central bank’s key benchmark rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, marking a cumulative one percentage point reduction since September. Alongside this move, the Fed is expected to scale back its projections for the number of rate cuts in 2025. The Federal Reserve’s 2024 rate cut Per a recent Yahoo news report, investors are keeping tabs on the Fed’s quarterly “dot plot,” a chart where each Federal Reserve official projects the future direction of the federal funds rate. This tool helps businesspeople keep track of the Fed’s monetary policy stance and insights into the central bank’s thinking. In September, the dot plot showed that the Fed expected to reduce rates twice more in 2024, followed by four additional cuts in 2025. However, recent inflation data and cautious comments from officials have led some to question the viability of these projections. The Federal Reserve’s Dot Plot from September. Source: Bloomberg These uncertainties are amplified by the possible impact of new government policies under the upcoming Trump administration, which will complicate the Fed’s decision-making process. Loretta Mester, former president of the Cleveland Fed, told Yahoo Finance that the forecast for four cuts in 2025 may need to be revised. Mester suggested that a “slowing down” of the pace of rate reductions next year is likely, with two or three cuts appearing more realistic. This shift is being debated, as some economists believe the Fed will still adhere to its original plan. “The story overall is they still expect inflation to come down,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. Tilley believes the median estimate for 2025 will remain at four rate cuts, reasoning that Fed officials continue to view rates as restrictive and still anticipate inflation will moderate. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has allowed room for a more cautious approach if necessary. In early December, Powell noted that “we can afford to be a little more cautious” in light of stronger-than-expected economic conditions. Powell’s comments suggest that while the Fed is likely to continue with a measured pace, it is prepared to adapt its stance based on emerging data. Inflation and job market resilience test Fed’s 2025 projections The potential for a revision in the Fed’s 2025 policy outlook is largely influenced by two developments in late 2024. First, the job market showed no significant signs of weakening, continuing to support consumer spending and economic growth. Second, inflation has proven more persistent than many expected, failing to show consistent signs of easing toward the Fed’s 2% target. 12-month percentage change, CPI, and selected categories as of November 2024. Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics The latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a 2.7% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November, up slightly from October’s 2.6% year-over-year gain. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Wholesale prices also climbed more than anticipated in November, suggesting inflationary pressures are not yet fully abated. CPI & CPI Core data from 2020 to 2024. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Despite these inflationary readings, markets are betting heavily on a rate cut this week, with traders now assigning a 95% probability to a 25-basis point reduction. Many expect the Federal Reserve’s 2025 forecast will remain largely unchanged, despite the recent inflation data. Tilley of Wilmington Trust maintains that the Fed will stick with its projection for four cuts in 2025. He believes the central bank will focus on the labor market’s volatility while also factoring in recent inflation trends. Tilley remains particularly concerned about the labor market, where private sector job growth has slowed significantly. He predicts job creation will drop to an average of 100,000 positions per month in the coming months, which he views as a potential risk to the broader economy. Wilmington Trust’s bond portfolio manager, Wilmer Stith, also believes the Fed will continue with its original plan for 2025. Stith anticipates Powell will highlight progress made in tackling inflation, particularly with regard to shelter prices and other components of the CPI. Stith views a 25-basis point rate cut as almost certain this week and expects Powell to emphasize that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to its inflation target. Fed officials remain divided on the 2025 outlook Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has expressed optimism about the inflation outlook, suggesting that inflation will continue to decrease in 2025. Barkin attributed recent flat core inflation readings to tough year-over-year comparisons and expects inflation data in early 2025 to appear more favorable due to higher base numbers from the previous year. Similarly, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee pointed to the significant drop in inflation since it peaked at 9% in 2022, the highest level in four decades. Goolsbee remains confident that the Fed will reach its 2% target over time, reinforcing the Fed’s commitment to returning inflation to sustainable levels. However, Mester is less optimistic about 2025, cautioning that recent inflation data and potential fiscal policy shifts could force the Fed to reconsider its rate-cutting plans. “I think there’s going to be a rethink about what that appropriate policy path may have to look like next year,” Mester remarked. While Mester expects a rate cut this week, she anticipates a pause in January, as the Federal Reserve will likely reassess the economic landscape heading into 2025. The current economic environment presents a delicate balancing act for the Federal Reserve: it must navigate stubborn inflation while avoiding triggering a recession, given the mixed signals from the labor market.

It enables smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. The network supports decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens for governance, utility, and value storage, but Ether (ETH) is still needed for gas fees. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, improving scalability and efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase aims to further boost these aspects. Ether remains central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. With its continuous developments and key position in the blockchain space, Ethereum holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Conclusion DOGEN, for those seeking success, offers high growth potential. Expected 700% growth by presale end with possible thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. While ETH and others have less short-term potential, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

37717383,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/its-impossible-for-dogecoin-price-to-reach-20-but-doge-alternative-priced-at-015-will-do-it-in-less-than-90-days,1734356899,"It's Impossible for Dogecoin Price to Reach $20, But DOGE Alternative Priced at $0.15 Will Do It in Less Than 90 Days","Due to its humorous roots and price spikes, Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency industry staple. Despite a recent increase to $0.44, DOGE exceeding $20 is unlikely due to inflation, excess supply, and low utility. Using groundbreaking real-world asset tokenization and smart tokenomics, Rexas Finance (RXS), currently trading at $0.15, might reach this milestone within 90 days. Let's examine Dogecoin's challenges and how Rexas Finance offers a more likely exponential development path. Why Dogecoin’s $20 Dream Might be a Fallacy Dogecoin's economics make $20 nearly unfeasible. Its inflationary process slowly devalues the token, with 140 billion in circulation and 5 billion issued annually. The market capitalization must reach $2.8 trillion, more than Bitcoin and Ethereum, to reach $20. The lack of value and institutional backing make this an intractable issue. Furthermore, Dogecoin uses are limited. The coin has a committed community but is not integrated into large financial institutions or widely used in decentralized finance. Its main usage is speculative trading and tipping, with no innovative applications to boost prices. Dogecoin's future is restricted without fixing these core flaws. Also, meme coins like DOGE are known for huge gains followed by notable sheddings that impact their ability to reach notable prices over the year. For instance, Dogecoin soared to its all time high of $0.73 in 2021. Notable dips followed this and, at a point, trading below $0.10. In contrast, with a similar price action, Solana had surged from its 2022 dip to $10 back to a new ATH of $264 this cycle. Traders use meme coins like DOGE for short-term gains, which might remain so for ages. Why Is Rexas Finance Unique? In contrast to DOGE’s uncertain path to $20, Rexas Finance is becoming a revolutionary crypto player with the means and strategy to reach a $20 valuation quickly. Rexas Finance stands out for combining cutting-edge technology with real-world applications. Rexas Finance's main innovation is tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) like real estate, commodities, and fine art. It breaks traditional, illiquid assets into fractional shares that can be traded easily on the blockchain. For instance, an investor can buy a part of a $10 million mansion with just $100 in RXS tokens. This increases liquidity, investor participation, and access to high-value markets. The RWA industry is vast. Global real estate is $379.7 trillion, while commodities will reach $121.2 trillion by 2024. Rexas Finance enters multi-trillion-dollar markets, increasing token demand and leading this fast-growing industry. Through its incredible presale performance and community incentives, Rexas Finance has gained market share. The project raised $27.50 million within three months and sold 340 million RXS tokens. The token's price rose 400% from $0.03 to $0.15. This huge increase shows investor confidence and bodes well for post-listing prospects. Running alongside the presale is a $1 million giveaway that rewards the community’s loyalty and reaches more investors. With over 450,000 entries received, the top 20 participants stand to earn $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Unlike speculative coins, RXS has value due to its strong ecosystem and practical applications. The platform's exchange listings will boost liquidity and visibility, causing exponential price hikes. Its deflationary tokenomics and 1 billion token production limit ensure scarcity and value appreciation. Token buybacks and burns limit circulating supply, aligning investor interests with long-term growth. The Rexas Finance ecosystem also includes various tools and features intended to increase user engagement and utility. The Rexas Token Builder makes creating tokens easier for individuals and institutions. At the same time, the QuickMint Bot interfaces with popular platforms such as Telegram to allow for smooth token distribution. Rexas AI Shield offers continuous smart contract monitoring and audits for improved security, ensuring trust and reliability. Furthermore, Rexas Treasury automates yield farming across various blockchains to maximize investors' profits. These capabilities make Rexas Finance an all-in-one platform that promotes adoption and long-term growth. RXS To Surge to $20 in 90 Days Rexas Finance's capacity to reach $20 in 90 days is not speculative but supported by statistics and market patterns. Historical evidence from other high-growth coins like Solana demonstrates that companies with good presale success and thriving ecosystems frequently enjoy exponential gains after listing. For example, SOL surged sporadically from $0.05 in 2020 to an all-time high of $259 in 2021, reaching a multibillion-dollar market cap within a year of inception. With its deflationary supply, vast addressable market, and presale momentum, RXS is poised to emulate or even outperform previous triumphs. Post-listing trading volumes, greater institutional interest, and continued use of RWA tokenization will drive price increases. While Rexas Finance has a lot of potential, it's important to evaluate the risks, such as market volatility or regulatory changes in asset tokenization. However, the platform's Certik audit, adherence to regulatory requirements, and innovative use of blockchain technology all alleviate many of these worries. Rexas Finance earns investor trust by ensuring transparency and security and positions itself for long-term growth. Conclusion Dogecoin's architectural faults and lack of utility make it unlikely to reach $20, even in the long run. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, with its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, deflationary tokenomics, and an innovative ecosystem, provides a viable and data-backed road to achieving this ambitious goal in 90 days. Rexas Finance is a platform that revolutionizes decentralized finance and makes conventional asset markets more reachable to everyone, not just a token. RXS presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking a high-growth possibility to participate in the future of blockchain evolution. Seize the chance to be part of the Rexas movement.

37717370,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393771,1734356861,When Will Altseason Begin? Which Altcoins Should You Be Paying Attention To?,"The post When Will Altseason Begin? Which Altcoins Should You Be Paying Attention To? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After the bullish start for the month, the Altseason was believed to have kicked off, reclaiming 3.5 years of resistance. Meanwhile, they are failing to gain momentum even in times when the BTC price consolidates after a notable rise. This suggests the market participants have currently concentrated on the star crypto and may remain until the token does not reach the peak of the prevailing bull run. Not all the altcoins are behaving in a similar fashion at present. While the tokens like LINK, AAVE, etc. are pushing higher, others like MANA, ETH, ADA, etc. are consolidating and waiting for their moment. The Altcoin market cap was testing the crucial resistance at $1.64 trillion but the rejection that followed has circulated bearish waves with a fear of an extended pullback below $1.5 trillion. Does this suggest the wait for a strong altseason could consume more time than expected? As seen in the above chart, the market capitalisation excluding Bitcoin has faced a rejection just below it’s ATH at $1.71 trillion. It was expected to be a small pullback, but the second consecutive week under bearish influence raises many concerns. Mainly because the volume has reached the 2021 levels and a similar rejection could validate the bearish possibilities. However, the RSI, which has displayed a bearish divergence, is yet to mark the highs, which could be close to 85. The Altseason experienced a Golden Cross in the past few days, which appeared to be much similar to the 2020-21 cycle. Therefore, considering a similar impact in the upcoming days, the Q1 of 2025 is expected to be pretty explosive. Although Bitcoin dominance has hit hard and is trying to rise, it is expected to fall eventually, leading the markets to witness one of the strongest Altseasons ever in history. With this, it is required to be away from the memecoin FOMO and focus more on the projects with strong fundamentals. For instance, Worldcoin that works for identity & finance, Uniswap, is called the OG of DEXs with staying power. Meanwhile, AAVE, known as a DeFi powerhouse, Chianlink, which is called the backbone of DEX oracles and Maker-A key in stablecoins. Along with these, Ondo is working on tokenized real-world assets, Solana is focusing on speed, scalability, & a thriving ecosystem, and BinanceCoin is the native token of a huge exchange with a wide range of utility.",NEUTRAL,AAVE | BTC,AAVE | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/when-will-altseason-begin-which-altcoins-should-you-be-paying-attention-to/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37717278,https://blockworks.co/news/two-vaneck-funds-back-depin-dawn,1734356700,Exclusive: 2 VanEck funds back Solana-based DePIN DAWN,"VanEck is putting $2.5 million into DAWN, a DePIN project aiming to create a decentralized internet service provider. The investment comes from VanEck’s Digital Assets Alpha fund and VanEck Ventures. The strategic funding round marks the first time that “multiple funds at VanEck have made a direct investment into the same company,” the firm exclusively told Blockworks. The newest raise comes after Andrena, the company behind DAWN, raised $18 million in a round back in August.* Andrena CEO Neil Chatterjee told Blockworks that DAWN was designed to capitalize on the “transformation of our lives” as society goes from being wired into the internet to being completely wireless following the rollouts of 5G and Starlink. Read more: Turning Tesla cameras into data engines “So now that we are kind of as a society going from a transition from a wired society to a more wireless one, we can actually use that wireless transformation in a way that we can wield it to benefit the end consumer, to benefit the end household, in a way [so they] are owning their own network. With this new transformation, we want homes to be the ones that are taking the benefit,” he explained. DAWN’s hardware can be used to reshare internet “no matter what provider you’re with,” and doesn’t need to be DAWN’s specific internet, the Andrena team explained to Blockworks. Chatterjee said his project aims to give “anybody all across the globe that has underutilized bandwidth…the means to sell it without having to worry about the customer acquisition.” The $2.5 million figure will partially be used to scale retail engagement through the hardware, allowing users to create mini networks for internet sharing and let DAWN expand internationally. Right now, the user base is predominantly in the US. Read more: Solana Foundation exec departs for ‘the most interesting experiment in crypto’ Through that, Chatterjee’s team is looking for “partnerships with data centers, internet service providers, real estate, companies, that can kind of give you a very big footprint very quickly, and then we’ll be using our capital to help expedite that deployment process.” The two biggest goals for the team are trickled down through their plans: onchain revenue and households. Chatterjee declined to give specifics on either metric, but noted that the team is moving to get both in the “millions.” For VanEck Ventures, which launched back in October, DAWN offers a product that’s not only “economically competitive” but also challenges the “monopolistic nature” of legacy internet service providers, general partner Wyatt Lonergan told Blockworks. The investment aligns with the new venture fund’s philosophy, which is jumping into an early-stage project with a check from $500,000 to $1 million, as Lonergan explained to the Empire newsletter in October . According to Lonergan, DAWN aims to disrupt the monopoly held by traditional ISPs while giving “the consumer a better product, [and putting] them in control, [so the] token is kind of pouring fuel on the fire. It creates the really amazing network effects that you wouldn’t otherwise get and turns these users into owners. And that kind of strengthens the entire network, in our opinion. So I love the idea of using these mesh networks to bootstrap businesses that otherwise would be really hard to do. That is kind of the promise of tokens.” But what really drew him, and the Digital Assets Alpha Fund, was the team behind DAWN. “WiFi is something, to me, that’s really easy to understand,” which pushes this project more mainstream than other crypto projects, he explained. For VanEck, Lonergan said the goal is to back a “category-winning team,” which both funds believe DAWN is.

Solana (SOL) Solana has experienced significant price movements over the past six months, showing an impressive increase of 53.75%. In the last month, the price rose by 5.15%, indicating continued growth. However, the past week saw a decline of 7.57%, reflecting some short-term volatility. The current price range of $219.27 to $251.07 is close to the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, which are at $218.87 and $225.07 respectively. The Relative Strength Index sits at 51.58, suggesting neutral market momentum. The MACD level is -0.7166, while the Stochastic indicator is at 66.67, pointing towards a mix of bearish and bullish signals. If Solana's price breaks above the nearest resistance level of $264.92, it could target the second resistance at $296.72, representing a potential increase of over 20%. On the downside, falling below the nearest support at $201.32 might lead to the second support at $169.52, implying a possible decrease of around 15%. These resistance and support levels are key points to watch for potential shifts in Solana's price trajectory. XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month alone, it surged 212.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. However, the past week saw a downturn with a 7.32% decline, indicating short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. Traders are watching these levels closely, as movements could signal significant shifts in market sentiment. Conclusion While SOL and XRP show strong prospects, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth in the 2024 bull market.

Ripple Warns Against FOMO as RLUSD Prepares for Launch Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz , warned investors about potential ”supply shortages” and volatility after the launch of Ripple's U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RippleUSD (RLUSD). In a post on Dec. 15, Schwartz shed some light on the possibility of major fluctuations in RLUSD’s value in its early days, despite its design to maintain a 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar. He shared that some early pre-market bids for RLUSD were already inflating its perceived value, with one Ripple wallet listing 1 RLUSD for 511 XRP , equivalent to over $1,200 at current prices. Schwartz dismissed the inflated valuation, and suggested that it was likely an attempt by someone looking for the symbolic honor of buying the first RLUSD. He also reassured potential users that the stablecoin’s price will return to its intended $1 parity once supply stabilizes. Schwartz warned against ”FOMO” buying into the stablecoin, and clarified that it is not a vehicle for speculative profit and urged users to exercise restraint. RippleUSD recently received its final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, which was announced by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on Dec. 11. The stablecoin is designed to work alongside XRP in the company’s cross-border payments solutions. According to Ripple, RLUSD is expected to serve large institutional players and complement XRP, with both assets paired to enhance liquidity and stabilize RLUSD’s price. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, previously described RLUSD as “ complementary and additive” to XRP. XRP’s widespread availability on exchanges will support RLUSD’s liquidity, while pairing mechanisms will prevent potential depegging. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is specifically designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar, a commodity like gold , or a basket of assets. This pegging mechanism helps reduce the price volatility that is typically seen in other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins achieve their stability through reserves held in fiat currencies or other assets, algorithms, or a combination of both. They are widely used for transactions, remittances, and as a store of value, which essentially makes them a bridge between traditional financial systems and the world of digital assets. RLUSD Stablecoin Poised to Boost XRP The upcoming RLUSD stablecoin is also expected to drive increased demand for XRP in 2025, according to Georgios Vlachos , co-founder of the Axelar interoperability platform. Axelar serves as the canonical bridge connecting the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to the XRPL EVM chain and 69 other blockchains. Vlachos pointed out that stablecoins like RLUSD are widely used in emerging economies for transactions and as a store of value. With RLUSD transactions and remittances settling on the XRPL and XRP-EVM sidechain, gas fees paid in XRP will burn tokens, benefiting XRP holders and adding to the demand for the cryptocurrency. XRP price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) XRP recently saw a historic rally after reaching a seven-year high of $2.90 on Dec. 3 of 2024, before retreating to its current level of $2.39. The pullback happened after a surge in the relative strength index (RSI) to 95, indicating overbought conditions. However, XRP continues to attract investor interest due to several catalysts. These include political tailwinds from Donald Trump’s election victory, which boosted pro-crypto sentiment and hopes for a favorable regulatory environment in the U.S. XRP also gained some momentum after flipping Solana in market capitalization on Dec. 1, which allowed it to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $136 billion. This is just shy of Tether’s $140 billion. Top cryptocurrencies by market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Further fueling optimism, major asset management firms like WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares, have filed for XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the SEC. Paxos and Standard Chartered Partner In other stablecoin-related news, Paxos partnered with Standard Chartered to strengthen the management of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, Global Dollar (USDG) and Lift Dollar (USDL), in Singapore and the UAE. Through this collaboration, Standard Chartered will provide cash management, trading, and custody services to enhance the infrastructure supporting these stablecoins. The partnership will also integrate Standard Chartered’s banking capabilities across transaction banking, financial markets, and securities services with Paxos’ global tokenization platform. One of the main goals of this partnership is to offer institutional-grade solutions for the growing stablecoin industry. Adam Ackermann, the head of treasury and portfolio management at Paxos, pointed out just how important Standard Chartered’s expertise in risk management and compliance are in supporting Paxos as a regulated stablecoin issuer. John Collura, global head of banks and broker dealer sales at Standard Chartered, shared that the bank is fully committed to advancing secure and regulated digital asset solutions that promote global adoption and economic inclusion. Global Dollar (USDG) is issued by Paxos Digital Singapore, and complies with the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) forthcoming stablecoin regulations. Lift Dollar (USDL) was introduced by Paxos International and is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. It also offers holders a daily programmatic safe yield. Circle and Binance Team Up Circle and Binance also recently announced a strategic partnership to enhance the global financial services ecosystem and support the growth of digital assets. The alliance was unveiled during Abu Dhabi Finance Week. As part of the partnership, Binance will integrate Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) into its platform, increasing its availability for users. Binance plans to offer additional USDC trading pairs, promotions, and other platform products to encourage its adoption. Circle will provide Binance with technology, liquidity, and support to strengthen Binance’s connections within global finance and commerce. During Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Circle also announced its incorporation in the Abu Dhabi Global Market and a new partnership with LuLu Financial Holdings . This collaboration will facilitate cross-border payments and remittances using USDC, taking advantage of LuLu Financial’s extensive operations in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Indian subcontinent, and the Asia-Pacific region. Looking ahead, Circle also plans to relocate its headquarters to New York in early 2025 and pursue an initial public offering (IPO) once it receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | XRP | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6554/ripple-usd-stablecoin-faces-potential-volatility-cto-david-schwartz,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37717045,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393740,1734356267,UK’s New Crypto Rules: What They Mean for Investors and Companies,"The post UK’s New Crypto Rules: What They Mean for Investors and Companies appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Various countries are embracing Bitcoin and crypto while some are trying to push leash on the ecosystem. The UK is one of the countries that are trying to bring strict regulations to protect the investors. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has shared its latest proposals for tight regulations on crypto assets. The objective behind them is to make the market safer. The FCA has made it clear: if you’re trading crypto, you’ll need to play by their rules. But what does that mean for the average investor—or the companies behind these digital coins? Are crypto regulations in the UK going to be tougher? Let’s find out. Why the FCA is Introducing Stricter Rules The FCA wants to protect investors and ensure a fair market. Recent controversies like scams, insider trading, and market manipulation have dented trust in cryptocurrencies. These issues have pushed the FCA to take action, aiming to clean up the industry and rebuild confidence. Source : FCA One major proposal is to allow public offerings of crypto assets only on regulated trading platforms. This means that unregulated or risky crypto projects will find it harder to enter the market. The goal is to offer investors safer and more reliable options for their investments. New Standards for Crypto Companies Crypto companies will face tougher requirements. They will need to provide detailed information about their projects, including risks, governance, and environmental impacts like energy usage and emissions. The FCA also plans to introduce stricter checks on project teams, ensuring only credible players can operate in the UK market. To prevent unethical practices like insider trading, trading platforms will need systems to detect and report market abuses. The FCA is also pushing for greater transparency—companies must make all documents related to their crypto offerings publicly available through the National Storage Mechanism. This aligns with the blockchain principle of openness. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitget Secures El Salvador Bitcoin License, Eyes Latin America Crypto Expansion , Implementing Crypto Regulations in The UK The FCA is inviting feedback on these proposals from the public and industry experts, with a deadline in March 2025. Based on this input, the final regulations are expected to be rolled out by 2026. The proposed rules aim to make the crypto market safer, but they come with challenges. Companies will face higher compliance costs, and investors might have fewer choices. Still, the FCA’s goal is clear: to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month alone, it surged 212.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. However, the past week saw a downturn with a 7.32% decline, indicating short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. If ADA breaks above the nearest resistance level of $1.46, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.73, representing an increase of approximately 30%. On the downside, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.923, it might test the second support at $0.653, a potential decrease of about 40%. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $1.08 and $1.10, suggesting consolidation before the next major move. Cardano (ADA) Over the past week, Cardano (ADA) has seen a price drop of 10.07%. However, in the last month, it has surged by 88.08%, and over six months, it has climbed by 170.90%. The current price ranges between $1.06 and $1.33, showing significant movement in a short period. Technical indicators suggest potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.78, indicating neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator is at 82.14, which is nearing the overbought zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is slightly negative at -0.00015329, hinting at a possible bullish reversal.

37717059,https://finbold.com/?p=219834,1734356207,Robert Kiyosaki reveals his next big investment,"Robert Kiyosaki , the prominent investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ saw many of his favorite assets explode in value since the start of 2024. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Kiyosaki’s most discussed – though not the only favored as evidenced by his stakes in Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) – cryptocurrency breached $100,000 in December and is, at press time, trading above $104,000. Despite a slowdown in the last month and a half, gold likewise performed remarkably well, and many believe it will not be long before it continues the rally toward $3,000 per ounce. Given such a setup, it is unsurprising that, in a December 16 X post, Kiyosaki revealed his next investment should neither be in the world’s premier cryptocurrency nor the world’s biggest commodity . This is Robert Kiyosaki’s next big investment Specifically, in the same tweet in which he confirmed attendance at the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference (VRIC) in January, Robert Kiyosaki revealed he is in the market for a new silver mine. LEARNING & INVESTING CONFERENCE: I will be attending the much awaited VRIC Vancouver Resources Investor Conference….in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada… January 19, 20. I will speaking, learning, and investing… specifically…I am looking for a new silver mine to invest… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 16, 2024 In fact, the author explained his interest in VRIC with the fact that ‘expert speakers, and real miners with real mines to talk one-on-one-with’ will be in attendance. The investor particularly emphasized that he isn’t interested in talks with ‘financial planners or stock brokers’ but exclusively with the ‘real miners.’ As for his reasoning behind a silver mine being the next big investment, Robert Kiyosaki merely pointed toward gold’s price performance – the fact it had ‘already taken off’ – and opined that silver would be next. Why is Robert Kiyosaki looking to invest in a Silver mine Looking at silver’s performance since January 2024, Robert Kiyosaki’s logic appears obvious. Despite the precious and industrial metal having a seemingly more decisive rally than gold this year – 33.3% against 28.93% – it is, unlike its yellow counterpart, at the press-time price of $30.64, well below its all-time highs. Silver all-time price chart. Source: TradingView Furthermore, silver would need to rally another 53.6% to reclaim its old heights near $47 – and 60% if the manipulated 1980 highs are accounted for – proving there is ample room for the commodity to surge before hitting uncharted territory. The comparison with Kiyosaki’s third favored asset – Bitcoin – is even more obvious as the world’s premier cryptocurrency is approximately 140% in the green in 2024, though it is, by the famous investor’s own reckoning , likely still a good investment as it is predicted to rally another 150% in the coming 12 months.

According to authorities, Hussein impersonated an Uber driver in order to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting passengers by accessing their phones. Elaborate Crypto Theft Scheme Hussein reportedly worked outside Scottsdale’s W Hotel, targeting victims waiting for a ride. The police say he called the passengers by name to make them think that he was their Uber driver. Once the victims were in his car, Hussein allegedly borrowed their phones, under the guise of troubleshooting the Uber app or fixing a device issue. Police allege during this time, he accessed the victims’ Coinbase accounts, transferring funds to a cold storage wallet. Court records reflect that Hussein executed this scheme on at least two occasions, in March and then again in October. Authorities would not say how Hussein obtained names of the victims but described his actions as premeditated and calculated. Threats and Intimidation One of the victims reportedly became suspicious of Hussein’s actions and demanded their phone back. In response, Hussein is alleged to have threatened the victim, warning them to “chill or something bad would happen.” This act of intimidation further demonstrates the length he allegedly went to execute his thefts. Arrest and Legal Actions On Dec. 11, Scottsdale detectives and Secret Service agents arrested Hussein. He has been charged with theft, fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors had secured a $200,000 cash bond and requested Hussein be electronically monitored if he posts bail. He has been barred from access to the internet and international trips due to the risk of evidence tampering and flight. Court documents showed trips he made to Ethiopia as recently as this year sparked concerns about his potential to flee the country. A trial date is set for Dec. 18.

According to GitHub , there were 19 cases of in-person cryptocurrency theft in 2024, up from 17 in 2023. These incidents are very innovative, targeting crypto holders directly. Another such incident occurred earlier this month when thieves in Melbourne, Australia, stole a Bitcoin ATM from a shopping center. It was later found pried open and set on fire.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

Meanwhile, a hardware wallet user reported the devastating loss of $2.5 million in Bitcoin and NFTs due to a phishing scam dating back several years. Drake's X Account Hacked to Promote Fraudulent Solana Meme Coin ”Anita” Canadian music icon Drake became the latest high-profile victim of a social media hack when his X account was compromised on Saturday night. The hacker used the account to promote a fraudulent Solana-based meme coin dubbed ”$ANITA,” a token reportedly inspired by Drake's cartoon ”alter ego,” Anita Max Wynn. Drake, born Aubrey Drake Graham, has long been known for his love of gambling, a theme reflected in his cartoon persona, Anita Max Wynn. The name, a playful nod to the phrase “I need a max win,” resonates with the gambling community and fits seamlessly with Drake’s partnership with Stake, a popular crypto betting platform. Exploiting this association, the hackers reposted and quoted a now-deleted X account to promote the coin as an official collaboration between Drake and Stake. The fraudulent ”$ANITA” token also capitalized on Drake’s current ”Anita Max Wynn” tour, which marks his return to Australia and New Zealand after a seven-year hiatus. By tying the token to Drake’s brand and tour, the hackers created a veneer of credibility, enticing unsuspecting fans and crypto traders to buy into the scam. The promotion to Drake’s 39 million followers resulted in a swift surge in activity around ”$ANITA.” According to DexScreener data , the meme coin saw an astonishing $5 million in trading volume before traders began to realize the project was fraudulent. The price of the token collapsed as the scam unraveled, leaving many buyers at a loss. The posts were later removed from Drake’s account, and neither Drake nor his representatives have issued a public statement about the incident at the time of writing. Drake’s hacked account is part of a troubling trend of social media exploits targeting influential figures and organizations to push fraudulent crypto schemes. Just a week earlier, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was similarly hacked and used to promote a meme coin scam. However, that scam managed to generate only a fraction of the trading volume—just 10% of the ”$ANITA” coin’s total. Other recent victims include chart-topping musicians Cardi B and Doja Cat, as well as legendary rock band Metallica. These incidents have exposed the vulnerabilities in X's security protocols and raised concerns about the platform’s ability to safeguard accounts with massive followings. The hack sheds some light on the risks of unregulated and hype-driven cryptocurrency projects, particularly meme coins , which often lack intrinsic value and are fueled by speculative trading. It also demonstrates the ease with which bad actors can exploit the trust and influence of celebrities to deceive the public. For Drake, the incident may prompt a reassessment of security measures for his social media accounts. For X, the platform faces mounting pressure to bolster its defenses and provide enhanced security tools for high-profile accounts. Crypto Community's Reaction The crypto community and Drake’s fans have expressed mixed emotions about the incident. Some traders voiced frustration over losing money to the fraudulent token, while others saw it as a cautionary tale about the risks of investing in projects promoted through unofficial or suspicious channels. As celebrity-endorsed scams become more prevalent, this latest incident with Drake’s X account reiterates the urgent need for better education around cryptocurrency scams and stronger security measures on social media platforms. While the fraudulent ”$ANITA” meme coin may have been short-lived, its impact will serve as a warning to both fans and the broader crypto community about the dangers of blindly trusting promotional posts—even from trusted public figures. Crypto Investor Loses $2.5 Million in Phishing Scam, Highlighting Ongoing Security Risks In other security news, the cryptocurrency community was dealt another stark reminder of the risks lurking in the digital asset space as a hardware wallet user, identified as “Anchor Drops” on X, reported losing $2.5 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) due to a phishing attack. On Dec. 13, Anchor Drops revealed on X that their Ledger Nano S hardware wallet had been compromised, resulting in the loss of 10 BTC, worth approximately $1 million at current market prices, alongside $1.5 million worth of NFTs. The incident was traced back to a phishing attack that reportedly occurred years ago but only recently came to light. Blockchain security analysts and Ledger, the wallet’s manufacturer, have since analyzed the breach and confirmed its connection to a malicious transaction from February 2022. Ledger, a leading manufacturer of hardware wallets, pointed to a phishing transaction tagged “Fake_Phishing5443” on Etherscan as the likely source of the hack. According to blockchain analyst KDean, Anchor Drops unknowingly signed a phishing transaction nearly three years ago, granting token approval to a malicious actor. The phishing transaction allowed the attacker to quietly monitor the wallet for years before eventually draining it. This ”dormant hack” strategy has become increasingly common among cybercriminals, allowing them to avoid detection until the right moment to strike. Hakan Unal, a senior scientist at blockchain security platform Cyvers, explained, “Blockchain evidence shows they signed a phishing transaction nearly three years ago, unknowingly granting approval to a malicious actor. The hacker remained dormant for years before eventually draining the wallet.” Unal emphasized that the incident had no connection to Ledger’s hardware or software, adding that users should regularly review token approvals to safeguard their assets. While the NFT theft was tied to Ethereum transactions, the method used to drain the victim’s Bitcoin holdings remains unclear. Tony Ke, lead security researcher at blockchain firm Fuzzland, noted, “For the NFT, KDean’s comment can explain everything. But I don’t understand how the BTC is stolen.” Experts suggest that if the phishing attack also compromised the user’s recovery phrase, it could have granted the attacker access to the wallet across all supported blockchains, including Bitcoin. “If the phishing attempt also captured the user’s recovery phrase, the attacker could gain access to the wallet across all supported chains,” Unal explained. Ledger echoed this assessment, indicating that user error might have played a role in the Bitcoin loss as well. The incident highlights several important lessons for crypto users: Understand Token Approvals: Phishing scams often exploit token approvals, granting malicious actors access to wallet funds. Regularly reviewing and revoking unnecessary approvals can help prevent such attacks. Secure Recovery Phrases: A compromised recovery phrase is akin to handing over the keys to a safe. Users should store their recovery phrases offline and away from potential phishing attempts. Be Cautious with On-Chain Interactions: Signing transactions without fully understanding their implications can have catastrophic consequences. As Ledger and other security experts stress, using a hardware wallet is only part of the equation; users must remain vigilant and informed about every interaction. An Ongoing Problem in Crypto Security The phishing attack on Anchor Drops adds to a growing list of high-profile crypto scams, with criminals becoming increasingly sophisticated in targeting unsuspecting users. According to blockchain security firms, phishing remains one of the most effective tools for attackers, particularly in the crypto space, where transactions are irreversible, and assets are self-custodied. As decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs gain mainstream traction, the stakes for protecting digital assets have never been higher. While hardware wallets like Ledger are designed to provide enhanced security, incidents like this reveal that user education and awareness are just as crucial as the technology itself. In light of the incident, Ledger has reiterated its commitment to user education and security. The company encourages users to adopt best practices, such as: Regularly reviewing token approvals and revoking unnecessary ones. Storing recovery phrases securely and offline. Verifying all on-chain interactions before signing transactions. “While using hardware wallets is crucial in terms of security enhancement, it’s equally important to understand every interaction with the wallet and make informed decisions,” said Fuzzland’s Ke. The $2.5 million loss suffered by Anchor Drops serves as a harsh reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the sophistication of hardware wallets like Ledger, no solution is foolproof without user vigilance. As the crypto space continues to evolve, staying informed and cautious will be key to avoiding similar tragedies. For the broader crypto community, this incident underscores the importance of cybersecurity practices and regular audits of on-chain permissions, particularly during periods of heightened market activity.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | WALLET,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6556/drake-s-x-account-hacked-to-promote-solana-meme-coin-scam,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Veteran trader Peter Brandt announced the milestone on X, stating that it now takes 40 ounces of gold to purchase one Bitcoin. The ratio surged as Bitcoin’s price soared past $106,000 , while spot gold traded around $2,650 per ounce. The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio, a key metric in the crypto market, measures Bitcoin’s purchasing power in terms of gold. This historic peak underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as an alternative store of value. Brandt, a prominent voice in the trading community, expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. “Next stop will be 89 to 1,” he predicted, suggesting that Bitcoin could command the equivalent of 89 ounces of gold in the future. Bitcoin Growing Over Gold This milestone aligns with a broader narrative championed by cryptocurrency advocates who see Bitcoin as the successor to gold’s $15 trillion market. Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Invest and a noted Bitcoin proponent, reiterated this sentiment earlier in December. Wood emphasized Bitcoin’s potential for exponential growth, especially given the significant gap in market capitalization between the two assets. Currently valued at $2.1 trillion, Bitcoin still trails gold’s market by a wide margin. However, its recent breakthroughs, including surpassing the $100,000 mark on December 5, have fueled optimism. Even U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold,” further validating its status as a viable asset class. Rising Challenges for Bitcoin Miners While Bitcoin celebrates its triumphs in market valuation, its growing mining difficulty poses challenges for the network. As of December 15, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit a record high of over 105 trillion, according to CoinWarz data. This metric, which adjusts approximately every two weeks, reflects the increasing computational power required to secure the blockchain. With the next adjustment scheduled for January 1, 2025, mining operations are under pressure to maintain efficiency amidst intensifying competition. However, this rising difficulty also strengthens Bitcoin’s network security, reinforcing its position as a robust and reliable digital asset.

Following Donald Trump’s recent electoral victory, NEAR has attracted renewed attention from investors, elevating its potential for growth. In parallel, Tron is demonstrating strong performance due to its latest network enhancements and a rise in revenue, which has expanded the adoption of its TRX coin. As NEAR and TRON chart impressive growth paths, Web3Bay is becoming a crucial conduit between traditional e-commerce and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. Through the integration of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized storage, Web3Bay provides a secure and transparent environment where users can conduct seamless transactions and engage actively in governance with the 3BAY token. Currently, in its inaugural presale stage at merely $0.003000, Web3Bay is playing a vital role in shaping the future of digital commerce and the broader adoption of Web3. Near Protocol (NEAR) Signals Upcoming Upswing Near Protocol (NEAR) is exhibiting signs of a bullish pattern on its daily chart, with indications that this upward trend could continue into longer timeframes. NEAR’s price has recently climbed from $3.70 to a high of $4.22, underscoring a resurgence in buying interest. Despite recent losses of 4.4% over the past week and 20.1% over the month, technical indicators like the Stochastic Fast (14) and RSI (14) are signaling buy opportunities, suggesting an optimistic outlook for further price increases. This trend hints at attractive prospects for investors as buying pressure mounts. Tron (TRX) Advances with Robust Revenue Achievements Tron’s TRX token has experienced significant growth, propelled by recent network upgrades and impressive revenue figures. This October, Tron accrued $45.5 million in revenue and exceeded 2.1 million active addresses, positioning it just behind Ethereum in terms of stablecoin market share. With a year-to-date increase of 55%, bolstered by its solid stablecoin integration and low transaction fees, TRX is gaining popularity, especially in emerging markets seeking cost-effective USD alternatives. Enhancing its appeal, Tron founder Justin Sun has recently announced a 50% cut in network fees, a move designed to stimulate developer involvement and boost TRX’s market value. This blend of revenue enhancement, broad adoption, and affordability strengthens Tron’s appeal in the digital currency landscape. Web3Bay: Merging Established E-Commerce Practices with Web3 Innovations Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce by marrying the established elements of online shopping with the decentralized strengths of Web3. At the heart of this innovation is the 3BAY token, which not only smoothens transactions but also offers users a 5% discount on purchases and a voice in significant platform decisions through governance. Web3Bay’s framework employs state-of-the-art blockchain technologies, including smart contracts and decentralized storage options like IPFS, to assure security, transparency, and operational efficiency. This decentralized infrastructure prioritizes user privacy and security, addressing vital concerns in the modern digital era. With a total of 5 billion 3BAY tokens issued, Web3Bay has earmarked 40% (2 billion tokens) for its presale, commencing at just $0.003000 in Stage 1. Each subsequent stage of the 28 presale phases introduces a 15% price increment, offering early investors significant growth potential.

The hashprice increased as the rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency outpaced the rise in the network hashrate, the report said. The hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The network hashrate has increased 6% month-to-date to an average of 773 exahashes per second (EH/s), the bank noted.  ""We note miners earned about $57,300 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s over the first two weeks of December,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, adding that this is the highest level in the last seven months, but is still about 40% below pre-halving levels.  The combined hashrate of the fourteen U.S.-listed miners the bank tracks has increased almost 94% year-to-date to 222 EH/s and now accounts for around 29% of the global network, the bank said.  The total market cap of the miners the bank tracks fell 4% or $1.5 billion, having increased more than 50% following the U.S. presidential election.  The bank estimated that the U.S.-listed miners are currently trading on about two times their proportional share of the four-year block reward opportunity.

37716951,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628075,1734355513,Trump’s Silicon Valley advisers wage war against AI censorship,"Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, including David Sacks, Elon Musk, and Marc Andreessen, who now advise Trump on technology matters, raised concerns about the threat of AI censorship from Big Tech. The technologists were fairly aligned on the need for rapid development and adoption of “truthful” AI throughout the United States. The trio could make AI chatbots’ responses a new battleground for conservatives to fight their ongoing “culture war” with tech companies. AI firms can control how chatbots give answers to conform to certain political ideologies or push their biased content moderation. Getting AI answers right remains a constantly evolving challenge Is there a way to score AI models based on how truthful they are? Let’s call it the Galileo Index. Suggestions welcome. https://t.co/fJzwOH3JJa — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) December 12, 2024 According to Trump’s tech advisors, getting AI answers right for controversial subjects and live news events is a “constantly moving target.” Conservatives repeatedly criticized Big Tech for caving into government-sanctioned censorship, although some tech executives had begun to moderate their positions in public. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, apologized to Congress ahead of the 2024 elections for bending to the Biden administration’s pressure to moderate content related to COVID-19. He said he had made a 20-year political mistake by taking too much responsibility for problems out of Meta’s control. Zuckerberg, however, promised never to repeat those mistakes. Sacks also criticized OpenAI and Google for forcing AI chatbots to be politically correct, saying that one of ChatGPT’s earlier concerns was that it was programmed to be “woke.” He added that ChatGPT was not giving people truthful answers, pointing out that censorship was built into the answers. “I think what’s important in training AI is to make sure that it is as truthful as possible and maximally curious because it is important that it trains to be honest even if that truth is unpopular.” – Elon Musk , Tesla Motors CEO Andreessen, the co-founder of a16z, believes that AI censorship has the potential to be a thousand times worse than social media censorship. He added that having everything controlled by an AI programmed to lie would be the perfect way to create the ultimate dystopian world. Sacks made it clear that he was focused on “AI truthfulness.” Trump’s advisor, Sacks suggests the ‘Galileo Index’ to score AI truthfulness Trump’s tech advisors suggested that specialized agencies could undertake AI truthfulness investigations. It is, however, unclear whether the Trump administration has the investigative options and capacity. Sacks suggested the Galileo Index as a way to score AI models based on how truthful they are. Musk said he would start something called “TruthGPT,” a truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. Sacks applauded Musk’s launch of Grok, saying that having it would, at minimum, keep both OpenAI and ChatGPT honest. Andreessen also added that with the Twitter files, Musk is doing what needed to happen broadly. Andreessen emphasized that the American people need to find out how government pressure and censorship intertwine. He also noted that there needs to be consequences. Users recently discovered that ChatGPT refused to answer questions about certain names, while OpenAI admitted that some names triggered internal privacy tools. Almost all AI tools, except for Grok and Perplexity, refused to answer questions about the 2024 election results.

XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month alone, it surged 212.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. However, the past week saw a downturn with a 7.32% decline, indicating short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. Traders are watching these levels closely, as movements could signal significant shifts in market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum's price has shown mixed movements recently. Over the past week, ETH has decreased by 2.68%. However, in the last month, it has climbed by 27.26%. Over the past six months, the price has increased by 10.87%. This indicates substantial growth over the longer term despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3643 and $4233. The 10-day simple moving average is $3873.26, and the 100-day SMA is $3883.85. The relative strength index stands at 55.00, suggesting neutral market sentiment. The stochastic oscillator is at 72.74, indicating that the asset is approaching overbought conditions. The MACD level is -1.149, which may signal a bearish trend. The nearest resistance level is at $4458. If ETH rises to this point from its current price, it would be an increase of about 13%. Breaking above this could lead to the second resistance at $5047, a rise of approximately 28%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3279, a decrease of about 17%. The second support level is at $2689, representing a drop of around 32%. These levels are important for traders watching for potential breakouts or reversals. Conclusion Though XRP and ETH show promise, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering sports memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth through its unique blend of memes and community-driven initiatives.

December 2024 unveils a blend of tenacity and progressive movement in the market. Yet, pinpointing the premier altcoins goes beyond mere market analysis—it calls for an in-depth exploration of the innovations at the heart of each network. From BlockDAG’s revolutionary scalability to Aptos’ breakthroughs in stablecoin technology, Bitcoin Cash’s revitalized push, Ethereum’s surging appeal among institutions, and Cardano’s methodical market adjustments—here are December 2024’s top crypto projects to keep on your radar! BlockDAG: Pioneering Scalability in Blockchain BlockDAG (BDAG) is transforming blockchain technology with its DAG-based structure, which combines blockchain security and decentralization with the rapid transaction capabilities of DAG. This modern framework allows BlockDAG to process significantly more transactions, even at peak times, without succumbing to delays. Its ability to handle parallel processing tailors it for expanding demands, setting it up for widespread use and enduring viability. For example, in practical use, BlockDAG’s scalability enables flawless financial operations, allowing for immediate international payments without system failures. This strong base has boosted the confidence of crypto enthusiasts in BlockDAG, reflected in its impressive pre-sale progress. Currently, at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, BDAG has surged by 2240% from its initial offering. So far, the platform has garnered over $166.5 million in pre-sale funds with more than 17.2 billion coins exchanged. Experts believe that BlockDAG’s solid fundamentals, combined with its remarkable pre-sale performance, could lead to up to a 30,000x return on initial funds for early participants, marking it as a key top crypto project to follow in December 2024. 2. Aptos Hits New Highs with Emerging Tech Aptos (APT) has seen a surge in activity, marking it as a standout crypto as its price jumps from $9.6 in late November to $15, pushing its market cap close to $8 billion. Despite not yet reaching its peak price of $20 from 2021, the Aptos team is planning significant developments, including parallel transaction processing and on-chain randomness, to support a scalable framework capable of handling billions of transactions. These enhancements are poised to facilitate a range of applications from prediction markets to comprehensive payment systems designed for loyalty schemes. 3. Bitcoin Cash's Surge: Capturing Market Momentum Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a major offshoot of Bitcoin, is capturing headlines again as it ascends to $600 with a market cap of $12.9 billion. Its scalable transaction system and emphasis on speedy, economical payments position BCH as a pivotal figure in the blockchain industry. Market experts anticipate that BCH could surge to $1,000, necessitating a 1.5x leap in both price and market cap, potentially exceeding $19 billion. This optimism, buoyed by the expected rise in Bitcoin to six figures, might enhance BCH’s appeal as a quicker, more affordable option among top crypto projects. 4. Cardano's Volatile Journey: A Tale of Dips and Recoveries Recently, Cardano faced a sharp 16% drop, plummeting to $0.91 before settling at $1, marking its biggest daily decline since 2021. By December 10, 2024, ADA modestly improved, climbing 1.3% to $1.02. This decline saw Cardano's market cap shrink to $35.6 billion, ranking it ninth among cryptocurrencies. This decrease reflects broader market actions and profit-taking, with ADA exhibiting fatigue. A move out of the overbought zone in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a cooling-off period for the asset. 5. Ethereum: Indicators of a Bullish Upswing with ETF Contributions Ethereum faced a 10% dip on Monday as markets experienced a heavy sell-off, resulting in the highest futures liquidations seen in two years. Nonetheless, Ethereum ETFs reported a historic $836.8 million in net inflows last week, with BlackRock's ETHA contributing a substantial $573 million. The total ETF inflows exceeded $1.4 billion, showing a solid increase in institutional interest. Moreover, over 256K ETH were removed from exchanges, indicating a bullish outlook as the availability of reserves fell. Thanks to its robust fundamentals, Ethereum stands as a top crypto project to keep an eye on this December. Wrap-Up: December 2024’s Crypto Spotlight In summary, Aptos showcases its capabilities with attractive stablecoin applications and scalable solutions, while Bitcoin Cash draws attention as a swift and cost-effective cryptocurrency. Cardano's subtle bounce-back shows its tenacity amidst market fluctuations, and Ethereum's significant institutional inflows underscore a strengthening trust. Nevertheless, with a solid base and extraordinary potential for growth, suggesting a possible 30,000x ROI, BlockDAG continues to be a crucial top crypto project to watch this December.

37716525,https://finbold.com/?p=219795,1734355243,"How much you’d have if you invested $1,000 in Bitcoin when JPMorgan CEO called BTC ‘pet rock’","Over the years, JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon has maintained a dismissive stance regarding Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) potential, with his concerns mostly centered on the asset’s ability to be leveraged in illicit activities. At the same time, Dimon has questioned Bitcoin’s actual value in the financial landscape. Despite his view on the maiden cryptocurrency, BTC has forged ahead, hitting new record highs. One of Dimon’s notable objections emerged on January 17, 2024, when he famously labeled Bitcoin a ‘pet rock,’ claiming that the digital currency ‘does nothing’ while vowing not to speak about it again. However, he broke this promise days later. To his credit, Dimon sees value in blockchain technology, especially for facilitating payments. “This is the last time I’ve ever talked about this [Bitcoin]. Blockchain is real. It’s a technology. We use it, it’s going to move money. There are cryptocurrencies that do something that might have value. And then there’s one that does nothing, I call it pet rock. The Bitcoin, or something like that,” said Dimon. Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin after ‘pet rock’ comments When the executive made these remarks, Bitcoin was trading at $43,132. Since then, BTC has surged 141% to trade at $104,038 as of December 16. BTC YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Therefore, an investment of $1,000 back in January would have grown to $2,410, representing a gain of $1,410, more than doubling your money. Indeed, Bitcoin has had a rollercoaster during this period, culminating in a record high of over $106,000 on December 16. This surge was buoyed by post-election optimism following Donald Trump’s victory. The price momentum has been fueled by projected friendly crypto regulations under the Trump administration, with recent gains stemming from speculation about the possible rollout of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. When Dimon made his remarks, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), contributing to Bitcoin’s first all-time high of the year, above $73,000. What next for Bitcoin As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $104,038, having retracted from its record high of $106,000 earlier in the day. The short-term correction emerged amid skepticism regarding the impact of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There is anticipation that the institution will lower rates by 25 basis points, translating to a total easing of 100 basis points since September. However, markets have reacted with skepticism as concerns linger that after this rate cut, the Fed’s stance could potentially diminish hopes for further reductions and limit the bullish impact of the rate cut. Nevertheless, most market sentiment remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Several entities project that the asset will likely double its valuation by 2025. As reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered projects that institutional capital inflows will push Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025, elevating its market cap to almost $4 trillion. Finally, in a December 13 note, investment management firm VanEck forecasted that the current bull market would likely extend into the first half of 2025, with Bitcoin potentially hitting $180,000.

Solana (SOL) Poised for Growth Amid Altcoin Season Anticipation Solana (SOL) has been trading between $219.27 and $251.07. The coin recently saw a monthly price increase of 4.66% and a substantial six-month rise of 53.02%. With an RSI near the neutral mark, Solana is neither overbought nor oversold. The slight negative MACD suggests potential upward movement. If SOL breaks the nearest resistance at $264, it could target the next level at $296, representing a possible gain of around 20%. The simple moving averages show consolidation, with the 10-day at $220.35 and the 100-day at $224.51. The anticipated altcoin season might propel Solana's price even higher. Aptos (APT) Poised for a Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Aptos (APT) has shown impressive performance, nearly doubling in value over six months. Currently trading between $12.79 and $15.83, it's consolidating after a strong upward move. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around a neutral 51, indicating potential for further gains. If APT breaks above the nearest resistance at $17.12, it could rally to the next level at $20.16, offering a substantial increase from current prices. The recent 7% dip this week might be a healthy correction, setting the stage for a new surge. With altcoin season on the horizon, Aptos appears ready for significant growth. Uniswap (UNI) Poised for a Bullish Breakout Amid Altcoin Season Hype Uniswap's price has surged over 100% in the past month, signaling strong upward momentum. Despite a slight pullback of around 8% this week, UNI remains above key support levels. The Relative Strength Index is 46.28, suggesting there's room for growth. With the nearest resistance at $23.88, breaking through could propel the price toward the next target of $30.92. This represents a potential gain of over 40% from current levels. As the crypto market gears up for a new altcoin season, Uniswap's decentralized exchange platform positions it favorably to capture market interest and possibly lead the next rally. FET Gears Up for a Surge Amid Approaching Altcoin Season Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is showing signs of potential growth. Despite a recent 15% dip over the past week, the coin has surged nearly 43% in the last month. The current price hovers between $1.77 and $2.27, aligning with its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages around $1.76 and $1.78. With the RSI at 53 and Stochastic at 55, momentum appears neutral but primed for an upward move. If FET breaks through the nearest resistance at $2.48, it could aim for the next target at $2.97, potentially an increase of over 30%. Support at $1.49 may provide a safety net for investors anticipating the altcoin season. Conclusion While SOL, APT, UNI, and FET have less short-term potential, Catzilla ($CATZILLA) stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features, it unites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

Fartcoin price on Dec. 16, courtesy Coingecko. According to data from Coingecko, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN ) is currently trading at $0.78 and is up nearly 22% in 24 hour trading. Fartcoin is a cryptocurrency that combines internet culture with cryptocurrency, focusing on humor rather than traditional financial utility. It allows users to engage in activities like submitting fart-themed memes or jokes to earn tokens. A unique feature includes a “Gas Fee” system where each transaction triggers a digital fart sound, enhancing the meme-based experience. The coin also uses an AI framework called “Terminal of Truth” to generate creative content and engage its community. In contrast, the meme coin Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) is down 12.8% in 24 hour trading, with its market cap sinking below the $700 million threshold for the first time since November 2024. Goatseus Maximus price on Dec. 16, courtesy Coingecko. Both Fartcoin and Goat derive from internet meme culture, tapping into the humor and virality that memes can bring to the crypto space. Fartcoin, as the name suggests, likely plays on the juvenile humor of bodily functions, while GOAT is inspired by the infamous Goatse meme, albeit in a more abstract, AI-driven context. You might also like: Crypto scammers hijack Truth Terminal founder’s X account The promotion or creation of both tokens has been influenced by AI. GOAT was significantly promoted by an AI chatbot named Truth Terminal , which has become a quirky influencer in its own right. Similarly, posts on X suggest that AI bots or algorithms might be playing a role in the trading patterns of Fartcoin, although specifics on this are less clear.

Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion coins, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple to support development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance network liquidity and improve the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. Designed to be fast, low-cost, and open, XRP enables seamless payment transfers across different currencies without needing a bank account. Its technology aims to make global transactions secure, irreversible, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting, offering potential for transforming cross-border payments. Cardano's ADA: Sustainable Blockchain Solution with High Potential Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency is ADA. Cardano aims to be flexible, sustainable, and scalable. It allows the development of decentralized apps, tokens, and games. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy efficient compared to proof-of-work models. Cardano is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design can enhance its transaction processing capability potentially up to a million transactions per second. In March 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens for secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market cycle, Cardano's features could make ADA an attractive option for users and developers.

Recently, a cryptocurrency inspired by Chill Guy has emerged, aiming to spread his message through blockchain technology. Its potential lies in its community-driven approach; however, its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various market factors and should be evaluated carefully.

37716628,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628089,1734354609,What will and should crypto regulation look like under Trump? – Stakeholders weigh in,"In just a matter of weeks, Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States of America. At first glance, after his victory in the November elections, everything appears to be in order in the cryptocurrency industry, but is it? The 2024 US presidential election is widely regarded as a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. Economists believe part of the reason Trump won his ticket back to the Oval Office is because of his “loud” pro-crypto-stance. Well, in all honesty, he had the support of over 290 pro-crypto lawmakers in Congress; it was highly unlikely he would lose. Trump promised to position the United States as the global hub for crypto, so the sector is poised for a potential renaissance. According to Coinfund President Chris Perkins, the election signaled a turning point for the crypto market, which has long grappled with regulatory uncertainty. Contributing to a Financial Times article , Perkins argues that this shift offers the US an opportunity to solidify its leadership in emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, he warned the community that optimism hinges on whether the post-election enthusiasm translates into actionable, thoughtful policies. Out with the old, in with the new? Under the Biden administration, crypto faced what many described as “regulation by enforcement,” where agencies stretched decades-old laws to oversee the nascent industry. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump says he will ""end Joe Biden's war on crypto, and ensure that the future of crypto and the future of #Bitcoin will be made in America, with a lot of it being done right here in Florida.” pic.twitter.com/qstVuzbOAI — DΛVID (@DavidShares) June 15, 2024 Critics insist that this approach blurred regulatory boundaries, wasted resources, and imposed significant costs on American companies, estimated at over $400 million. Biden, supported by US financial authorities, seemingly failed to prevent high-profile fraud cases. An indelible case is the fall of FTX, a memory the community will probably never forget. Moving forward, policymakers and regulators are being urged to focus on fostering innovation while protecting consumers. An imperative industry demand is the differentiation between technology and its applications, reiterates Perkins. Blockchain and cryptocurrency advocates liken the current situation to the early days of the internet: while websites and apps are not inherently illegal, their misuse can be addressed through law enforcement. Coinfund’s President highlighted a case echoing this approach. In a recent ruling, Judge Katherine Polk Failla rejected attempts to hold a crypto exchange liable for how its technology was used, drawing parallels to payment platforms like Venmo. Unanswered questions about the crypto market under Trump As reported by Cryptopolitan, Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson voiced concerns over the lack of a clear roadmap for the crypto industry from Donald Trump. Despite Trump’s more progressive stance on crypto, Hoskinson said that he hasn’t yet outlined concrete policies for the sector’s future in the United States. Hoskinson warned that Trump’s involvement in crypto could create a more complicated regulatory environment, noting the intense partisan divide that surrounds the former president’s actions. “ Everything Trump does the left hates with such a passion ,” Hoskinson said, adding the move could take a bipartisan issue and make it partisan, potentially alienating support for the crypto industry. He also criticized the current political discourse, stating, “ I don’t see that level of quality and sophistication in the discourse. ” The alienated Ethereum co-founder also questioned whether Trump could assemble a team capable of supporting the crypto industry, referencing the former president’s history of high staff turnover. Hoskinson’s skepticism grew after Trump announced a new decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, World Liberty Financial, which he is backing alongside his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as property developer Steve Witkoff. Vitalik Buterin is cautious about Trump Back in July, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin weighed in on the trend of supporting political candidates solely based on their crypto stance. In a blog post , Buterin warned against the practice of endorsing “pro-crypto” candidates, arguing that it could create an environment where politicians merely need to support crypto to gain backing without addressing the broader values that drive the industry. “ There is a growing push within the crypto space to become more politically active.” Buterin continued, “In this post, I argue against this trend, and in particular, I argue that making decisions in this way carries a high risk of going against the values that brought you into the crypto space in the first place.” Trump could be good for crypto Donald Trump is one very unpredictable businessman: the very epitome of controversy. On one hand, Democrats are arguing he will use the Oval Office to make the rich wealthier. On the other, Trump says he won’t take a penny of his official salary. His first presidential campaign was pretty much against crypto, but his own son is now telling the world “Dad will be the most pro-crypto president America has ever seen.” Trump’s proposals for the industry include rolling back existing regulations and introducing bold ideas such as creating a national Bitcoin reserve, where the government would stockpile the cryptocurrency. Some analysts are skeptical about Trump’s stance on crypto, arguing that it could be motivated by self-interest. Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, emphasized the significance of how crypto will be regulated in the coming years. “ One of the most important issues to be determined over the next couple years is how crypto is regulated, ” Canter said. “ Well, now, he’s an active player in the crypto market. How it could be regulated [could] affect his personal wealth, what kind of position he takes. “ JUST IN: Donald Trump has $5,417,000 invested in these 6 cryptocurrencies: pic.twitter.com/loggTKZPFR — Andrew Lokenauth | TheFinanceNewsletter.com (@FluentInFinance) November 25, 2024 Nik Bhatia, founder of Bitcoin Layer, a firm that advocates for Bitcoin investments, suggested that dismissing Trump’s pro-crypto position as merely driven by personal gain overlooks its political dimensions. “ I don’t see these moves motivated by self-interest. I see them representing the electorate, ” Bhatia stated. Nevertheless, Bhatia acknowledged a potential conflict of interest, noting that Trump’s support for crypto could directly benefit his business ventures. “ I think there probably is a conflict of interest in that his pro-crypto stance will benefit his company, ” he added. Moreover, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC that the US SEC’s “regulation by enforcement” approach under Chairman Gary Gensler has pushed much of the crypto innovation abroad. Tenev suggested that a Trump administration could usher in a more “forward-looking policy,” supported by his new SEC chairman appointee Paul Atkins, who the community expects will embrace crypto. One thing we all know is Trump wants to do what’s best for America. If crypto aligns with that sentiment, then it shouldn’t be a surprise if the president-elect keeps his promises.

As Bitcoin soars past the $100,000 mark, experts suggest it might even reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. This surge has invigorated the presale scene, attracting significant attention as people search for high-growth opportunities. Low-cost presale cryptos such as Crypto All-Stars (STARS), Flockerz (FLOCK), Best Wallet Token (BEST), and BlockDAG (BDAG) have emerged as some of the cryptos with highest potential for 2025, each providing unique utilities and impressive prospects. Let's explore the standout features of these cryptos and see why they are primed for success in the upcoming bull market. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A Leader in Crypto Technology with a 2,240% Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) is revolutionizing blockchain scalability and security with its unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure and Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.

This blend of modern technology and enticing rewards places BlockDAG among the cryptos with the highest potential for substantial returns. It represents an exciting opportunity in the rapidly evolving crypto market, making it a standout choice among the cryptos with the highest potential for 2025. 2. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): Revolutionizing Meme Coin Staking Crypto All-Stars enhances the value of meme coins by introducing MemeVault, a platform focused on staking to maximize coin utility.

He questioned the absence of a “green dot” on SaylorTracker—an indicator widely associated with upcoming MicroStrategy Bitcoin purchases. The post fueled speculation about the company’s next steps. Starting December 23, MicroStrategy will join the Nasdaq-100, placing it alongside some of the world’s leading companies. This inclusion guarantees its presence in index-tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Invesco’s QQQ, which manages over $300 billion in assets. Collectively, Nasdaq-100 tracking ETFs manage more than $550 billion, greatly enhancing MicroStrategy’s exposure to investors globally. https://twitter.com/btcjvs/status/1868293573260739043 MicroStrategy is the first Bitcoin treasury company to enter the Nasdaq-100. Michael Saylor predicts that Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA), a leading Bitcoin mining firm, could follow suit and join the prestigious index in the near future. Eyeing S&P 500 Inclusion James Van Straten, a senior analyst at CoinDesk, believes MicroStrategy could qualify for the S&P 500 if it posts positive earnings over the last four quarters. He estimates that with Bitcoin reaching $120,000 and new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules taking effect in Q1 2025, MicroStrategy could achieve $25 billion in net income. This scenario would make the company eligible for S&P 500 inclusion as early as Q2 2025. Institutions are fueling Bitcoin’s rise—read Bitcoin price prediction to discover where this unstoppable surge is headed next! Impact on Bitcoin Price Bitcoin Price continued its upward trend, reaching a new all-time high of 106,488.25 early Monday. The recent spike comes amid rising investor optimism, spurred by US President-elect Donald Trump’s possible bitcoin strategic reserve fund and the continuous surge of institutional interest, including the Nasdaq listing of pro-Bitcoin startup MicroStrategy. As of press time, BTC price is changing hands at $103K, with a minor loss. Market experts believe that MicroStrategy’s growing influence in the Nasdaq-100 and its continued Bitcoin purchases could further attract additional institutional buyers, potentially pushing Bitcoin to new all-time highs. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The seasoned analyst made this prediction in a recent commentary on X, discussing the short-term fluctuations observed in XRP's price.For context, XRP surged nearly 500% in recent weeks, particularly between mid-November and early December. However, the asset's bullish momentum lost steam after XRP reached a price of $2.87. Specifically, XRP has struggled around the $2 mark over the past two weeks, even dipping to $1.90 at one point before recovering.Commenting on XRP's recent price action, CrediBULL advised non-traders to ""zoom out"" and focus on the bigger picture. He emphasized that XRP's structure looks exceptionally clean and bullish from the current position, describing it as ""insane.""The analyst urged holders to ignore the short-term fluctuations, calling them mere ""noise"" for non-traders. He reassured them that the broader market outlook is ""incredibly and unequivocally bullish.""XRP to $1.2T Market Cap by Early 2025CrediBULL referenced a historical XRP chart, pointing out that the asset is largely in a long-term uptrend and is now undergoing a brief consolidation. He believes a breakout from this consolidation is inevitable, in line with past patterns. Notably, the chart CrediBULL shared depicted XRP's potential path through 2025, suggesting the possibility of reaching as high as $22 in the first quarter. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.39, with a market cap of $137 billion. Reaching $22 would require an additional 820% increase from its current level, boosting XRP's market cap to $1.26 trillion. CrediBULL XRP chart When asked to confirm this projection, especially regarding the first-quarter timeline, CrediBULL responded affirmatively. However, he noted that the timeline could extend into the second quarter of 2025.Clarifying the Insight from the ChartMeanwhile, he also cautioned that, as with all charts, the time and price aren't shown in exact proportion. He advised taking things step by step, noting that this chart is meant to illustrate how early XRP is in the context of a larger, higher-timeframe impulsive structure.Additionally, another commenter asked for CrediBULL's thoughts on potential triggers for XRP's price beyond the chart, such as the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin and lower interest rates.CrediBULL responded that it’s impossible to know the exact driving force behind the price action. He agreed that multiple factors could influence buying behavior but explained that it's too difficult to quantify the effect of each fundamental catalyst. Therefore, it’s best to focus on the chart and the unfolding structure. According to CrediBULL, the specific causes of the price movement don't matter as much as the broader market structure.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/16/xrp-can-reach-1-2-trillion-cap-top-analyst-affirms/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-can-reach-1-2-trillion-cap-top-analyst-affirms,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The market is buzzing with opportunities, from decentralised projects breaking traditional barriers to tokens surging thanks to innovative real-world applications. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newbie looking to dip your toes, there’s something here for everyone. One name making waves is Qubetics ($TICS) . This project isn’t just another token; it’s solving real-world problems that have plagued the crypto space for years. By focusing on decentralised privacy solutions, Qubetics is setting itself apart in a way that’s impossible to ignore. Ready to find out which other coins should be on your radar? Let’s dive in. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Your Best Bet for a Secure Future Imagine a world where your online activities are completely private. Qubetics isn’t just imagining it—it’s making it happen with its decentralised VPN solution. Unlike traditional VPNs that route your data through centralised servers vulnerable to breaches, Qubetics uses blockchain technology to ensure true anonymity. Think of it as the Fort Knox of your internet connection. Businesses, too, can benefit. Picture a remote tech team securely accessing sensitive databases without worrying about leaks. Or a journalist bypassing censorship in restrictive countries. With Qubetics, these scenarios become the new normal. And individuals? Say goodbye to creepy targeted ads and hello to peace of mind. The excitement doesn’t stop there. The ongoing Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, with over 334 million tokens sold to 9,700 holders, raising $6.4 million so far. Priced at $0.0311 now, the token is expected to soar to $0.25 by presale’s end—a staggering 703% ROI. Post-launch predictions are even wilder, with analysts forecasting $TICS to hit $5 (a jaw-dropping 15,964% ROI) and possibly $15 after the mainnet launch (48,092% ROI). Simple: Qubetics is solving privacy issues like no other project, and its potential ROI makes it one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . 2. Cardano (ADA): Your Dependable Partner Known for its focus on scalability, security, and sustainability, Cardano’s ecosystem is thriving, and December 2024 is a great time to get involved. The latest buzz? Hydra, its scaling solution, is showing incredible potential, boasting 1 million transactions per second (TPS) capability in real-world tests. That’s the kind of speed Visa would envy. Cardano’s developments aren’t just technical fluff—they’re translating into adoption. With Africa-focused projects and partnerships with governments, Cardano is pushing blockchain into everyday life. Analysts predict ADA could rally to $0.75 by year-end , driven by increasing adoption and its thriving decentralised app (dApp) ecosystem. If you’ve been sleeping on Cardano, it’s time to wake up. Cardano is the tortoise in the race: steady, reliable, and primed for long-term growth. It’s hands-down one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Your Financial Powerhouse BNB isn’t just the backbone of Binance’s ecosystem—it’s a powerhouse. With the crypto giant continually expanding its services, BNB is more than just a token; it’s a gateway to an ecosystem. The most recent development? Binance launched its AI-driven NFT marketplace , driving insane adoption. BNB’s burn mechanism also adds value, with millions of tokens permanently removed from circulation. The icing on the cake? Its use in DeFi projects, staking, and transaction fee discounts. Analysts predict BNB will climb to $450 by early 2025 , with potential to hit $600 if bullish trends persist. It’s not just another token—it’s a cornerstone of crypto. BNB’s mix of utility and growth potential makes it a no-brainer. If you’re looking for the best coins to invest in December 2024 , BNB deserves your attention. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Your Innovative Partner Avalanche has been blazing trails with its lightning-fast transaction speeds and innovative subnets. Think of it as the Tesla of blockchain tech—fast, sleek, and futuristic. The platform recently launched its Everest upgrade , further boosting scalability and performance. Not to mention, its partnership with big names like Deloitte and Mastercard is putting Avalanche in the spotlight. AVAX is trading around $38.57 , but analysts believe it could reclaim $54.23 and possibly surge toward $65 in the coming months. Avalanche’s tech and partnerships make it a strong contender for anyone seeking the best coins to invest in December 2024 . 5. Polygon (POL): A Partner You Can Trust If you’re looking for a blockchain built for the future, Polygon is where it’s at. Known as Ethereum’s Internet of Blockchains, Polygon delivers scalability without sacrificing security. Its recent rebranding to POL reflects a shift toward interoperability, while its zkEVM upgrade is revolutionising Layer-2 solutions. Big brands like Reddit and Starbucks are already building on Polygon, and this is just the start. Analysts predict POL could hit $1.50 soon, with long-term forecasts suggesting a push toward $2. With its strong fundamentals and growing adoption, Polygon is easily one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . 6. Cosmos (ATOM): Your Steadfast Partner Cosmos has always been about connecting blockchains, and it’s smashing that goal. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is now supported by over 50 chains , making Cosmos the go-to for interoperability. Recent updates to its Cosmos Hub have strengthened its tokenomics, with staking rewards and improved security mechanisms. ATOM is trading at $10.24 , but predictions suggest it could reach $15 by early 2025 as adoption grows. Cosmos is making blockchain work like it should—together. That alone makes it one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . 7. Polkadot (DOT): Your Seamless Partner Polkadot is like the glue holding the blockchain universe together. Its parachain system allows for specialised chains to operate seamlessly, and its use cases are practically endless. The Polkadot Blockchain Academy’s latest graduates are already driving innovation in DeFi and NFTs, and DOT’s staking rewards keep the community engaged. Trading at $5.47 , analysts are eyeing $8 by mid-2025 , driven by strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot’s tech is cutting-edge, and its growth trajectory is unstoppable. No wonder it’s one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . Conclusion: Make Your Move Now And there you have it—the top 7 coins to invest in December 2024.

37715879,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662776,1734354042,XRP Price Targets $3.34 After Corrective Downtrend Within Descending Channel,"The XRP price has been trading on a consolidation path after reaching a six-year high of $2.9 on December 3. The cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum, and recent analysis points to the playout of a descending channel. According to an analysis on TradingView, XRP’s price movement suggests a corrective downtrend confined within a descending channel on the daily chart. Nonetheless, XRP is on track for a rebound to the upside, with price targets around its current all-time high. Corrective Downtrend And Key Support Levels According to a TradingView analysis, XRP has been experiencing a corrective downtrend since December 3. On that day, the cryptocurrency reached a peak of $2.9 on Binance but faced rejection and dropped to a low of $2.25 on the same day before closing at $2.5. This marked the beginning of a bearish phase, as XRP subsequently formed two more consecutive daily bearish candles. Related Reading: XRP Price In Motion: Analyst Reveals The Next Major Supports And Resistances While the token attempted a brief upward rebound, the move was met with another rejection. The alternating pattern of upward and downward movements resulted in the formation of lower highs and lower lows, which is a characteristic of a descending channel. The descending channel is a temporary phase of price correction rather than a prolonged bearish outlook. Within this context, the TradingView analysis identifies initial support levels at $1.8890 and $1.6, which align closely with the 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels when drawn from the $2.9 high. These levels are support zones where the cryptocurrency could stabilize if downward pressure persists. A successful defense of these supports might act as a springboard for a bullish reversal, paving the way for the next upward leg in XRP’s price trajectory. Failure to hold these levels could increase bearish pressure on the XRP price and drive the price further down to the most notable support at $1.5.

Potential Rebound And Target Levels For XRP Price If the XRP price successfully rebounds from the identified support zones, it is expected to challenge resistance at $2.8, marking the first milestone on its upward journey. A notable break above $2.8 would open up a run towards the final target of $3.3450. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $2.41 and is down by 0.9% and 2% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Reaching the $3.345 level is tantamount to a 39% increase from the current price levels. Furthermore, this would put the XRP price close to its current all-time high of $3.4. The bullish momentum required to reach $3.345 could also push the XRP price into new all-time highs from that point.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have opened new opportunities in this fast-growing market. With the rise of meme culture and social media, a new type of cryptocurrency has emerged meme coins. Meme coins are based on popular memes or internet trends. While they may seem like a joke, they’ve gained traction in the crypto community and seen impressive value gains. This is where Lightchain AI (LCAI) comes in. Lightchain AI (LCAI) presale is currently ongoing and it's quickly gaining attention in the crypto world. In this article, we’ll discuss why now is the best time to invest in meme coins and three bullish meme coins to grab while the market remains quiet. The Current State of the Crypto Market As of December 2024, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant growth, with the total market capitalization exceeding $3.82 trillion. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching approximately $102,696, reflecting increased mainstream adoption and investor confidence. This surge is partly attributed to President-elect Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, including plans to appoint crypto-friendly officials and establish a national Bitcoin reserve. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading around $3,895, maintaining its position as a dominant platform for decentralized applications. The market's expansion is further supported by the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), enhancing accessibility for traditional investors. However, this rapid growth has raised concerns about potential market volatility and the formation of speculative bubbles, reminiscent of the dot-com era. Dogecoin (DOGE) The Original Meme Coin Still Leading the Pack Dogecoin (DOGE), introduced in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, has evolved into a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. As of December 2024, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.40, with a market capitalization around $58.57 billion. The cryptocurrency has experienced substantial growth, partly due to endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk. Musk's involvement in initiatives such as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has further amplified interest in Dogecoin. Analysts offer varied price predictions for DOGE. Some forecasts suggest a potential rise to $1.08 by 2025, while others are more conservative, estimating an average price around $0.56. Despite its origins as a meme coin, Dogecoin's active community and increasing acceptance in transactions contribute to its resilience and prominence in the crypto space. However, potential investors should exercise caution due to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Expanding Utility Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu (SHIB), initially launched as a meme coin, has significantly expanded its utility, evolving into a multifaceted cryptocurrency ecosystem. A pivotal development is the introduction of Shibarium, Shiba Inu's Layer-2 solution, which has achieved remarkable milestones, including surpassing 600 million transactions and engaging over 2 million addresses. This growth reflects increasing user confidence in Shibarium as a scalable solution within the broader Shiba Inu network. Additionally, Shiba Inu has been integrated as collateral for over 200 perpetual futures contracts on Kraken, enhancing its utility in the financial sector. The ecosystem's expansion is further evidenced by the surge in network activity, with over 7,500 new wallets created in a single day, indicating growing interest and adoption. These developments underscore Shiba Inu's transition from a meme coin to a cryptocurrency with substantial real-world applications, attracting both users and developers to its expanding ecosystem. Lightchain AI (LCAI) The AI-Powered Meme Coin With Explosive Potential Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an innovative cryptocurrency that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming to revolutionize decentralized applications and governance. Currently in its presale phase , LCAI tokens are priced at $0.003, offering early investors a unique opportunity. Analysts project significant growth for LCAI, with some forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $1 by the end of 2024, driven by its innovative technology and growing adoption. Lightchain AI's unique features, such as the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), address critical challenges in scalability and energy efficiency, enhancing its appeal across various industries. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, LCAI's blend of AI and blockchain positions it as a promising contender in the digital asset space. However, potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before participating in the presale . How to Strategically Position Yourself for the Next Meme Coin Rally As the crypto market experiences unprecedented growth, investors are seeking alternative investment opportunities to diversify their portfolios. With the increasing popularity of meme coins, it's crucial to strategically position yourself for potential gains. Firstly, extensive research and staying informed about market developments is essential. This allows you to identify promising meme coins with strong fundamentals and potential for long-term growth. Additionally, patience and a long-term investment approach can help mitigate risks associated with volatile markets. While quick gains may be tempting, it's important to consider the underlying value and potential for sustained growth in meme coins. Furthermore, investing in a diversified portfolio of meme coins can help reduce risk while capitalizing on multiple opportunities in this emerging sector. Why Lightchain AI (LCAI) beats All Meme Coins Lightchain AI (LCAI) distinguishes itself from traditional meme coins by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with blockchain technology, offering tangible utility beyond mere speculative value. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing meaningful AI tasks, such as model training and optimization, enhancing network efficiency and scalability. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables developers to deploy AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) directly on the blockchain, facilitating real-time intelligent solutions across various industries. In contrast, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu primarily derive value from community engagement and social media trends, often lacking substantive technological innovation or real-world applications. By focusing on practical applications and technological advancement, Lightchain AI offers a more sustainable and impactful investment opportunity, positioning it as a leader in the evolving crypto landscape. Seizing the Opportunity Before the Market Heats Up As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, meme coins present a unique opportunity for savvy investors. While their volatile nature can be intimidating, thorough research and strategic positioning can yield significant gains. Investors should consider factors such as technological innovation, community engagement, and real-world applications when evaluating meme coins, paving the way for long-term success in this emerging sector. But with Lightchain AI (LCAI) presale ongoing and its promising blend of AI and blockchain technology, now may be the ideal time to explore this dynamic investment opportunity before the market heats up. Remember to always exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. So, stay informed, diversify your portfolio, and seize the potential gains in this evolving crypto landscape. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37716088,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628088,1734353714,Ethereum’s 400% growth this year is hidden in L2 apps,"On the surface, Ethereum (ETH) looks almost unchanged, with around 500K daily active wallets and daily transactions at a baseline level of around 1.3M. That’s because most of the Ethereum ecosystem’s growth in 2024 came from L2 chains. Ethereum’s importance in 2024 came from growth “hidden” in L2 chains. The main network carried up to 1.3M daily transactions, with no dramatic spikes in activity. However, Ethereum is as active as ever, only scaled by its busiest L2 chains. Throughput measures the number of transactions and their complexity. | Source: Growthepie L2 activity on the top 5 networks led to over 400% growth for the Ethereum ecosystem in 2024. By the end of the year, the throughput growth may reach 500%, based on an expansion of both raw transactions and complex token routing. DEX activity, a revival of NFTs, and stablecoin usage all add to the business of the top L2 chains. Ethereum serves as the settlement layer, app building goes to L2 For most of the year, ETH remained stagnant, serving as a utility token. However, other metrics showed Ethereum remained indispensable in the crypto space. L1 is still key to all activity, serving as a settlement layer and for added security. However, app building is now well-established in the L2 space. On the side of Ethereum, the busiest smart contracts reflect demand for on-chain swaps and stablecoin usage. Rarely, an outlier app will line up among the busiest contracts. On the main chain, the Uniswap router and Tether are the two biggest gas burners, consuming around 16% of all gas. When it comes to transactions at scale, the real activity reflects the growth of L2 chains. Based on the throughput metric, L2s have successfully scaled Ethereum while inviting more usage and handling more transactions. The most active growth for a single chain comes from Base, the tokenless protocol with the lowest fees. However, Arbitrum and Optimism have also added their apps, and more lately, Taiko and Gravity boosted the total transaction count. At this stage, it is relatively hard to estimate which transactions are high-quality, and which are carrying low value or are the result of bot activity. One of the metrics to estimate the value of L2 chains is their capacity to carry stablecoins. Arbitrum is still the leader, as its supply of stablecoins is on an upward trajectory. The chain may soon carry more than 6B stablecoins and is one of the main targets for inflows from Ethereum. L2 narrative shifted in 2024 The past year saw a shift in the overall attitude to the L2 narrative. In previous periods, any token with a potential L2 chain was capable of generating hype. However, with more than 100 proposed or working L2 chains, the market suffered from over-supply. The total market cap of L2 tokens toward the end of the year was at $22.4B . Most of the value was concentrated in the top 10 coins and tokens, especially Arbitrum and Optimism. Older legacy chains like Polygon lagged behind. Polygon only got a boost from its Polymarket predictive activity, which slowed down after November 6 and the US elections. The other narrative to slow down was ZK rollups. For now, most L2 chains are still at ‘stage 0’, meaning they still rely on a centralized sequencer. Only Arbitrum and Optimism are Stage 1, and DeGate V1 claims to be a fully functioning decentralized ZK rollup. Optimistic and ZK rollup chains came to dominate the Ethereum market this year, phasing out some of the chains using shards. The other change in 2024 was the emergence of a market for using Ethereum to secure and finalize L2 transactions. L2 chains pay blob fees almost daily while trying to adjust their posting schedule. Rent paid to L1 was negligible for most of the year but started rising in the last three months. The top 5 L2 chains are also the main spenders on L1 transactions. Taiko remains the most active blob poster with the highest expenses. However, rent paid to L1 is still a negligible part of Ethereum validators’ earnings. Most validators still depend on the block subsidy for their earnings.

37715620,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/tokenized-funds-vs-stablecoin-yield-as-a-service-which-is-best,1734353503,Tokenized Funds vs Stablecoin Yield-as-a-Service: Which Is Best?,"Rapid innovation in the digital asset tokenization space has led to the emergence of “tokenized funds” at the intersection of traditional finance and the blockchain. These funds, issued in the form of cryptocurrency tokens, make it possible for assets such as stocks, commodities, bonds and real estate to be traded freely on the blockchain, and aim to make the investment landscape simpler and more transparent. Tokenized funds usually represent shares or units in traditional investment funds, such as a private equity, venture capital or mutual fund. Some of the main advantages pitched by the purveyors of these digitized investments are reduced trading fees, a lower financial barrier to entry, the removal of geographical barriers and greater liquidity, allowing investors to buy in or cash out on secondary markets without restrictions. While the idea has some merit, the earliest tokenized funds appear to be rather experimental, perhaps more of an effort to encourage traditional financial institutions and investors to explore the capabilities of blockchain technology. But they still fall short of the true potential of tokenization in many ways. For instance, most tokenized funds are really just private fund wrappers that sell securities, repackaged as ERC-20 tokens, and they continue to focus on large clients, offering only limited access to retail investors. The failings of these early tokenized funds has led to the rise of alternative tokenization initiatives, and one of the most promising is the idea of stablecoin-yield-as-a-service. OpenTrade is pioneering this new concept, creating the operational framework for investors of all sizes to generate stable yield on digital assets across a range of lending markets. How Do They Differ? Tokenized funds are designed to lower the access requirements to traditional funds, primarily those with high minimum investment requirements and those with geographical restrictions. In addition, they can also solve the liquidity problem in funds focused on private equity and real estate, paving the way for fractional ownership that ostensibly lowers the financial barrier to entry. One of the most prominent examples of a tokenized fund is BlackRock’s BUIDL fund , which launched in March 2024 and quickly captured almost a third of the entire $1.3 billion tokenized treasury market in just six weeks. As of August 2024, BUIDL had more than $510.3 million assets under management, with a portfolio focused on cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. Other examples of tokenized funds include Ondo OUSG , which tracks short-dated U.S. Treasury Bonds, and OpenEden , a fund that tracks tokenised U.S. Treasury bills. Despite the proposed benefits that blockchain brings to these tokenized funds, their experimental nature creates a number of major limitations. They primarily act as an asset manager that issues tokens representing the funds, but they do not offer any other technology to help investors leverage their investments in them. In addition, the issuers play no role in the value chain beyond token issuance and redemption. Another major dealbreaker for tokenized funds is that they continue to operate with very high minimum investments. Individual tokens that represent a share of the fund still cost in excess of $100,000 in many tokenized funds, which prohibits the participation of retail investors. Instead, their primary customers are the same type of audience as traditional funds – namely, wealthy financial institutions that are simply looking to experiment with blockchain technology, and perhaps a handful of crypto whales looking for ways to invest their idle crypto holdings. In addition, geographic barriers still persist, with most tokenized funds restricting access to U.S.-based investors. Stablecoin Yield-as-a-Service is considerably more representative of the original ideals of tokenization, welcoming all kinds of investors with its low financial requirements. The core idea is that investors can deposit USDC stablecoins into “token vaults” representing different pools. For each token they deposit, they’ll receive a newly minted vault token (vToken) which represents their share of the vault, as well as any profits or losses generated by that vault. OpenTrade utilizes the funds in its vaults to earn interest in various ways, primarily through a range of blockchain-based structured credit and lending products. Borrowers can choose from various single-sided and multi-sided credit markets, with short-term, fixed-term and flexible-term loans, either collateralized or uncollateralized. By supporting a diversity of yield-generating activities, OpenTrade’s stablecoin yield-as-a-service can provide both stable returns, and the potential of much higher yields for investors with greater risk tolerance. Who Can Invest? The high minimum financial requirements of tokenized funds mean they remain out of bounds to all but the richest institutions and high net worth individuals. As such, they remain an exclusive product, similar to the traditional funds they represent. It’s a bit of a head scratcher because tokenization is primarily designed to increase accessibility, yet their issuers throw up numerous obstacles that not only restrict access, but also limit investors’ returns. OpenTrade’s Stablecoin Yield-as-a-Service is offered to financial institutions, including both crypto and non-crypto native firms, who in turn package them as products for retail investors. Its main customers are neobanks and crypto exchanges, who provide a range of applications and services for stablecoin holders to earn yield on their holdings, with simple one-click access and support for various risk profiles. As such, stablecoin yield-as-a-service is perhaps the first real example of a tokenized investment opportunity that’s available to the masses, wrapped in a strong legal framework that satisfies the compliance requirements of financial institutions. Ondo OUSG vs OpenTrade Ondo OUSG is enables institutional investors to experiment with tokenized exposure to short-term U.S. Treasury bonds and Money Market Funds. It’s available in two options – as an accumulating token called OUSG or a rebasing token called rOUSG, which represent both membership and equity interest in Ondo’s portfolio. The main benefits of Ondo OUSG are said to be instant, 24/7 minting and redemption, with low minimums for both investments and withdrawals and reduced fees. However, it continues to suffer from some severe limitations, including a higher financial threshold, limits on subscriptions and a lack of composibility – all problems that are successfully addressed by OpenTrade. While Ondo OUSG’ does allow for one instant subscription and redemption per day, further deposits and withdrawals must be submitted via email and are only settled after one-to-two business days. OpenTrade, on the other hand, has very few limitations, with support for unlimited instant deposits and same-day withdrawals. Ondo OUSG prides itself on being one of the most accessible tokenized funds, with relatively low minimums of just $5,000 for instant subscriptions and redemptions, but much higher limits of $100,000 and $50,000 for non-instant deposits and withdrawals. It also suffers from a lack of compatibility, and is only compatible with a limited number of permissioned products that adhere to strict regulatory requirements - namely, Ondo’s proprietary offerings. Other problems with Ondo OUSG include the expectation that OUSG will eventually be classified as a security token due to its legal rights, no EURC yield opportunities and lack of support for custodial wallets like Fireblocks, which can dissuade some institutional investors. OpenTrade is held back by none of the above, with no minimums on subscriptions or redemptions and a composable design with clear regulatory positioning, support for EURC yield and full integration with Fireblocks and other custodial wallet services. OpenEden vs OpenTrade OpenEden provides access to digital tokens that are backed on a 1:1 basis with U.S. Treasury bills structured via a fund. It simplifies investor's exposure via its T-Bill Vault, which is an ERC-20 compliant digital asset that’s pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, with variable yield based on the fluctuation of short-term Treasury bonds. Although simplified, OpenEden does little to address accessibility to U.S. Treasury bonds with its excessively high initial subscription requirements, while investors are also encumbered by a slow redemption process and higher transaction fees. OpenEden’s lack of accessibility is a serious handicap, with an initial subscription minimum value of $100,000 putting it out of bounds to the vast majority of retail investors, though it does support much lower minimum secondary deposits of just $1,000 thereafter. OpenEden’s redemption process is also slow, with requests locked in a FIFO queue and taking a minimum of one business day, while its regulatory perimeter limits composibility. Investors must also accept the risk that loss of access to their tokens may result in lock of access to their principal deposit. That’s not the case with OpenTrade, whose legal obligations are upheld by a Master Loan Agreement, ensuring that both the principal and any interest accrued is protected. By far the biggest stumbling block with OpenEden is its high transaction costs. It charges a flat transaction fee of 5 bps on all subscriptions and redemptions, which can have a substantial impact on client’s yield. OpenEden advertises a yield of 4.25%, but investors will rarely realize such gains due to its commercial model. Indeed, investors won’t start earning any interest unless they maintain their position in OpenEden for at least 9 days, and it takes a significant amount of time before they start earning anything close to the advertised yield. Incredibly, the impact of OpenEden’s transaction fee is such that investors are required to hold their tokens for a staggering 10 years in order to attain the 4.25% APY advertised. That’s in stark contrast to OpenTrade, which allows investors to start accumulating a 4.10% yield immediately after they make their first deposit. Final Thoughts Tokenization is a transformational concept and the growing popularity of tokenized funds and stablecoin yield products underscore its incredible potential to simplify investing and accelerate investors returns, while boosting access. Yet for all of these promises, most tokenized funds continue to be exclusive opportunities offered by traditional financial powerhouses for their regular clients, with little regard for retail investors. The limitations placed on these offerings significantly erode the attractiveness of tokenized investments and are at odds with the ethos of blockchain in general. Given their experimental nature, we can be optimistic that this will change and institutions will be more open to boosting the accessibility of their tokenized funds in future. In the meantime, retail investors can still explore the possibilities enabled by OpenTrade’s tokenized stablecoin yield-as-a-service products, which offer a compelling APY with significant flexibility based on their willingness to accept risk. In any case, tokenization is a concept that will continue to evolve, and it’s encouraging to see the progress being made by types of investments. But for now, OpenTrade is setting the standard with MiCA-compliant stablecoin yield products, which are designed to meet the demand for secure and flexible returns for every kind of investor.

XRP (XRP) XRP is currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, showing resilience despite a recent 7.32% decline over the past week. Both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close to $2.42, indicating a stable trend in the short and long term. The Relative Strength Index is at 51.94, suggesting a neutral market sentiment without signs of being overbought or oversold. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $3.30. If XRP breaks through this point, it could climb toward the second resistance at $4.03, representing a potential increase of over 35% from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $1.83. However, with a monthly growth of 212.42% and a six-month rise of 379.42%, XRP has shown significant upward momentum. As optimism grows for an upcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, XRP may continue its upward trajectory. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has been moving between $3643 and $4233. Recently, the bulls seem to be gaining strength as the price nears the first resistance level at $4458. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.00, indicating moderate momentum without being overbought or oversold. Over the past month, Ethereum’s price has increased by over 27%, showing a solid upward trend. However, the MACD level is slightly negative at -1.149, suggesting that the bears haven’t completely lost control. Looking ahead, if Ethereum breaks through the resistance at $4458, it could potentially rise to the next level at $5047. This would be an increase of around 20% from the current price range. The simple moving averages for 10 and 100 days are close. It hovering around $3880, which might act as support if there’s a pullback. With signs of a broader bull run in the market, Ethereum could be set to capitalize on this momentum and reach new heights. Conclusion XRP and ETH are thriving, but XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth as the first all-sport memecoin, blending meme culture with sports in a community-driven ecosystem.

Bitcoin is on a strong upward move, moving towards much higher targets above $110k. The price has been steadily rising, with shallow pullbacks, which is typical of previous cycles. The push higher suggests we could soon reach higher targets. Wave Count and Potential for $130k The current price action is aligned with a potential wave four pattern. While some expect a more shallow wave four, past cycles have seen similar patterns. The focus remains on Bitcoin reaching $130k, and there’s speculation about possible further extensions, with some predicting Bitcoin could hit $170k or even $190k. Higher Prices Expected, But With Risks Bitcoin is expected to keep moving higher, but as we approach the $130k target, the risks also increase. Price action is approaching a critical point, and the likelihood of reaching higher prices depends on whether we see the expected 4-5 wave pattern. Analyst Josh of Crypto World compared the current situation to Bitcoin’s price action from four years ago, highlighting a similar scenario when Bitcoin broke out after a bearish divergence in the ( Relative Strength Index ) RSI. After that breakout, the price experienced significant upward movement, and the analyst suggests a similar outcome could occur again.

The Speculation and Trends You Need to Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin surprised the community with a sudden 3.58% move towards $106,533.

The rise in wallet addresses with over 100 BTC shows the market confidence. MicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq 100: A New Path for Bitcoin? Michael Saylor led MicroStrategy, just joined the Nasdaq 100 index . This is great news for the crypto world. The company holds a whooping 423,650 BTC worth $44.58 billion. With the Nasdaq 100 membership, index funds could start buying more of MicroStrategy’s shares. And when that happens, we could see even more Bitcoin purchases from them.

Trump’s Pro-Crypto Plans: Could It Change Everything? As Donald Trump gets ready to take office again in January, some crypto enthusiasts are hopeful about what he might do for Bitcoin. He’s hinted at creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve , though we don’t have all the details yet. But the idea of a pro-crypto president is already making waves. If he fulfills his promises to the crypto community and follows a plan favorable for the ecosystem, it will be a serious boost for the whole ecosystem and not just Bitcoin. Technical Analysis: Where Is Bitcoin Headed? Let’s explore the charts for a while to see what is happening there. Bitcoin creating another ATH and staying above $100k is a great achievement. The industry is watching closely if it can stay above that mark. If the current momentum stays, we could see $110,000 around christmas. This road is not free from risks. Source : Tradingview RSI on a weekly chart is at 77, which is the overbought zone. If the rally has to continue, the price either needs a consolidation or a correction before further movement. However, a sudden rise in buy can do the deed. With this happening we might see $120k by the end of 2024. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Looking ahead, it seems like Bitcoin’s momentum could continue, especially with all the factors at play—like MicroStrategy’s consistent buying and the potential pro-Bitcoin policies under Trump. But don’t forget, there’s also the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting coming up, which could create some bumps in the road. Still, with the way things are shaping up, it’s hard not to feel optimistic about where Bitcoin’s price might go next. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37715408,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312939,1734353158,"Solana Holders May Be In for Same Pain As Ethereum Bulls, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen – Here’s Why","A widely followed crypto analyst says that holders of smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) may be due for the same pain Ethereum ( ETH ) traders felt during previous cycles. In a new interview on the Crypto Banter YouTube channel, popular crypto trader Benjamin Cowen says that Solana paired against Bitcoin (SOL/ BTC ) is printing the same patterns that ETH/BTC did years ago before stagnating. “A lot of these altcoins follow this pattern, and I want to show you this really interesting pattern by Solana… It’s following the same pattern so far – look at ETH/BTC. This was a 90% drop followed by a 500% rally [and] right and after that 500% rally, ETH/BTC got this drop and this drop was essentially putting in higher lows. It was putting in higher lows [and] everyone was calling for the flipping. It got [another] drop and then it had one more rally into the merge and then [it slowly descended until now]. Think about that chart – 90% down, 500% up, higher lows, fake out, one last rally. And then look [at] SOL/BTC, it’s the same thing, it’s identical.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen goes on to note that traders shouldn’t panic if Solana sees a major dip as there’s a chance it will recover, just like ETH/BTC did. However, he notes the SOL/BTC pair may enter a lengthy downtrend after its recovery as well. “If it breaks down, it doesn’t mean it’s over. You could have a scenario where it repeats what ETH/BTC did where it breaks down [and] people might think that’s the end. But it could very well just pop right back up in 2025 – exactly what ETH/BTC did – and then start to fade out in 2026, so there’s a chance something like that happens.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube SOL/BTC is trading for $0.0021 BTC ($216) while ETH/BTC is valued at $0.038 ($3,921).

Notably, in an X post , analyst DarkDefender highlighted that XRP has confirmed a breakout on the four-hour chart, signaling a clear shift in market sentiment. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At press time, XRP is trading at $2.40, marking a strong recovery from its prolonged consolidation range of $0.50 to $0.60. The digital asset has posted a 0.14% gain on the weekly chart and is up an impressive 326% year-to-date. This breakout comes on the heels of XRP reaching a local high of $2.71 on December 3, further fueling optimism for continued upside momentum. Technical indicators confirm bullish momentum According to the analysis, XRP’s breakout above a descending trendline on the four-hour timeframe signals a potential reversal of its earlier downtrend. However, a daily close above $2.52 is required to solidify this bullish outlook. XRP price analysis chart. Source: DarkDefender/X The Ichimoku Cloud is projecting a bullish trend, with XRP now trading above the cloud, a signal traditionally associated with further upside potential. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has formed a Golden Cross , confirming increasing buying pressure and a definitive shift in momentum Key levels to watch The immediate focus now lies on XRP’s ability to clear the critical resistance at $2.52. A confirmed daily close above this level could open the door for a retest of the December 3 high at $2.71. Beyond that, DarkDefender has outlined short-term price targets of $5.85 and $8.76, supported by bullish market conditions and historical price movements. On the downside, XRP must defend key support levels to sustain its bullish outlook. Analysts point to $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as critical zones where buyers are expected to step in to maintain the bullish momentum. Derivatives market data and broader ecosystem developments Derivatives data from CoinGlass further reinforces XRP’s bullish outlook. Options open interest has surged by 16.20% to $992.33K, reflecting growing confidence among traders in XRP’s upward trajectory. Meanwhile, options volume has increased by 17.41%, suggesting heightened activity as traders position themselves for volatility. XRP derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass The Binance long/short ratio among top traders stands at 3.845, indicating a clear bullish bias. Despite a slight decline of 12.62% in overall derivatives volume, open interest remains stable, signaling sustained market engagement and confidence in XRP’s potential for further gains. Moreover, investors are quite bullish on XRP and the wider Ripple Labs ecosystem, particularly as its stablecoin, RLUSD, has recently received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This milestone enhances confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem and strengthens XRP’s position within the broader digital asset market. Bull flag pattern points to a $4 target While long-term projections for XRP remain ambitious, with some analysts predicting prices as high as $48 , short-term forecasts point to immediate upside potential. Notably, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez , in a December 12 X post , identified a bull flag pattern on XRP’s chart, which suggests XRP could rally to $4 in the near term. $XRP appears to be forming a bull flag! Still, the TD Sequential recently presented a sell signal on the 4-hour chart, which leads me to believe #XRP may see a brief correction before a breakout above $2.46 that could send the price to $4! pic.twitter.com/L8zwMYT1Rb — Ali (@ali_charts) December 12, 2024 Martinez highlighted $2.46 as a key breakout level to confirm the pattern and noted that any short-term pullback could present a buying opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on the next upward move. That being said, XRP’s recent breakout, coupled with strong technical indicators and improving market sentiment, presents a bullish outlook for the digital asset. A decisive close above $2.52 could mark the beginning of XRP’s next major rally, with analysts projecting targets of $4 in the near term and $8.76 in subsequent moves. At $4, XRP’s market cap would rise to approximately $228.75 billion, surpassing Tether’s ( USDT ) valuation while remaining behind Ethereum (ETH), which currently holds a market cap of $471.63 billion. However, at $8.76, XRP’s market cap would surge to around $500.97 billion, surpassing Ethereum and solidifying its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin ( BTC ), which currently holds a market cap exceeding $2 trillion. Supported by rising derivatives interest and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem, XRP remains a key asset to watch as it positions itself for further gains in the ongoing market recovery.

37716078,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319730,1734352780,Bank Indonesia Completes Proof of Concept for Digital Rupiah: What’s Next?,"Bank Indonesia has achieved a significant milestone in exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It completed the Proof of Concept (PoC) for the Wholesale Rupiah Digital (wRD) Cash Ledger. This achievement marks the conclusion of the first phase of Project Garuda, a groundbreaking initiative to develop a digital Rupiah. It aims to make the digital Rupiah a legal tender central to the country’s financial modernization efforts. What Is Next for CBDC in Indonesia? Governor Perry Warjiyo emphasized in the whitepaper that the digital Rupiah represents Bank Indonesia’s proactive response to the rapid transformation of the financial landscape. Moreover, the regulator wants to be a single issuer of a state digital currency. The project seeks to create a unified and interconnected ecosystem capable of supporting diverse financial transactions while safeguarding the integrity of the Rupiah. The design of the digital Rupiah focuses on interoperability, ensuring seamless integration across various platforms and systems. With it, Indonesia aims to strengthen its financial infrastructure by adopting it all across its monetary sovereignty. Insights from the Proof of Concept The PoC phase explored three fundamental business processes critical to implementing the Wholesale Rupiah Digital: issuance, redemption, and fund transfer. These processes were tested using two advanced distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms: Corda, developed by R3 Hyperledger Besu, created by Kaleido Over 55 test scenarios evaluated the platforms’ suitability for the wRD business model, focusing on resilience, privacy, speed, scalability, and fault tolerance. Fransiskus Xaverius Tyas Prasaja, an economist at Bank Indonesia, highlighted that the technical success of the PoC validated DLT’s potential to meet the rigorous demands of the Rupiah Digital framework. Source: Linkedin Corda employs a central notary system to validate transactions. It ensures integrity through a directed acyclic graph interconnecting transaction data. Meanwhile, Hyperledger Besu leverages a proof-of-authority mechanism with multiple validators, maintaining data integrity within a blockchain-based structure. Notably, integrating smart contracts also emerged as a key innovation during the PoC phase. These programmable agreements enhanced transaction efficiency and offered greater flexibility. Moreover, the PoC demonstrated that DLT platforms can seamlessly integrate with conventional financial systems through ISO 20022 standards. It ensures compatibility with existing frameworks while enabling connectivity with other distributed systems. Transparency has been a cornerstone of Project Garuda’s development. Bank Indonesia released a comprehensive whitepaper titled “ Project Garuda: Navigating the Rupiah Digital Architecture ,” detailing the project’s phased approach. The PoC represents the first phase, laying the groundwork for the Intermediate State, where operationalization and scaling will take center stage. Deputy Governor Juda Agung also stressed the importance of these findings. He stated that the insights gained from this phase will serve as a foundation for refining the digital Rupiah’s business and technical dimensions. “The success and various insights from this proof of concept will form the foundation for strengthening the business and technical aspects of the Rupiah Digital in the future.” The next steps will focus on operational readiness, scalability, and ensuring that the digital Rupiah is equipped to serve the entire Indonesian population.

The token’s rapid rise underscores the importance of South Korea in shaping the future of web3 technologies and highlights MOCA’s growing significance in the decentralized metaverse space. This development marks a significant milestone for the Moca Foundation and positions the token as a key player in the global crypto market. MOCA trading debuts on Upbit with multiple pairs Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, was the first to list MOCA, enabling trading in Korean won (KRW), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT). Trading commenced on December 16 at 2:00 PM KST, with deposits and withdrawals exclusively supported on the Ethereum blockchain. The listing provides MOCA with exposure to one of the most active crypto markets globally, where local investors show strong interest in blockchain innovation. MOCA serves as the utility and governance token for the Mocaverse, a decentralized metaverse platform. Token holders gain access to platform features and participate in decision-making processes, showcasing the project’s commitment to decentralized governance. The listing on Upbit is expected to significantly enhance MOCA’s liquidity and market reach, attracting both institutional and retail investors. Bithumb follows with MOCA and MOODENG listings Following Upbit’s lead, Bithumb added MOCA to its platform on the same day, offering trading in KRW. The token debuted with an initial price of 136 KRW, further solidifying its foothold in South Korea’s competitive crypto landscape. Bithumb introduced MOODENG, another token associated with the Mocaverse ecosystem, indicating a broader partnership with the Moca Foundation. Both exchanges rebranded MOCA as “Mocabus” to align with local preferences, a strategic move aimed at increasing relatability among South Korean investors. This rebranding highlights the growing trend of customizing blockchain projects to meet the demands of regional markets. MOCA’s 380% surge in one hour The dual listings triggered an explosive rally for MOCA, with its price surging 380% within just one hour. The token’s trading volume also spiked by over 600% within 24 hours, reflecting heightened market interest. In the futures market, MOCA recorded a staggering 1,250% increase in open interest, reaching $33.27 million in a single day. As of December 16, MOCA’s price stands at $0.213, representing a 150% increase from its pre-listing value. The token’s market capitalization has climbed to $332 million, reinforcing its growing prominence in the blockchain ecosystem. South Korea continues to cement its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. The country’s tech-savvy population and robust crypto ecosystem make it a prime market for emerging web3 projects. MOCA’s success on Upbit and Bithumb demonstrates how strategic listings in such markets can propel blockchain initiatives to new heights. While the Moca Foundation celebrates this milestone, the broader crypto community is closely watching South Korea’s influence in advancing web3 technologies. This latest development further underscores the importance of regional markets in shaping the global trajectory of decentralised platforms.

37717812,https://invezz.com/?p=2388766,1734352339,MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq 100: why this move matters for Bitcoin and investors,"MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR.O), a leading software company and prominent Bitcoin holder, is set to join the Nasdaq 100 on December 23. The inclusion in the $25.7 trillion index, which tracks the largest non-financial companies, reflects its growing relevance in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. As of now, MicroStrategy holds approximately $4.4 billion worth of Bitcoin—around 2% of the total supply—making it a major indirect exposure point for institutional investors seeking crypto assets. The company’s shares surged 6% in premarket trading following the announcement, marking another step in its impressive 550% rally this year, driven by the rising price of Bitcoin. Why MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq inclusion matters By joining the Nasdaq 100, MicroStrategy brings indirect exposure to Bitcoin into one of the world’s most-watched indices. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the $322 billion Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ.O) track the Nasdaq 100, meaning funds mirroring the index will now include MicroStrategy in their portfolios. This could trigger additional institutional buying of MicroStrategy stock, further driving its price. MicroStrategy has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings this year through equity and debt offerings, doubling its treasury assets. Analysts, such as Matthew Dibb of Astronaut Capital, suggest that its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 may create a “looping cycle” of capital inflow. Higher stock prices could allow the company to raise more funds for additional Bitcoin purchases, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s spot price. A pivotal moment for Bitcoin and tech The company’s market capitalization has now surpassed $100 billion—more than twice the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Despite reporting a net loss of $340 million in Q3 2024, the company’s Bitcoin-centric strategy has proven highly profitable in the long term. Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2020 under co-founder Michael Saylor, its shares have gained over 3,200%. This move underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an institutional asset. With Bitcoin recently hitting a record high of $106,000, its integration into indices like the Nasdaq 100 represents a shift in how traditional markets interact with digital assets. Nasdaq 100 reshuffle MicroStrategy is not the only company making headlines in the latest Nasdaq 100 reshuffle. Other entrants include Palantir Technologies (PLTR.O) and Axon Enterprise (AXON.O), reflecting the evolving tech landscape. Meanwhile, firms like Illumina (ILMN.O), Super Micro (SMCI.O), and Moderna (MRNA.O) will exit the index. This reconstitution highlights the shifting dynamics of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 as it embraces companies that bridge traditional technology and emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq 100 debut is expected to amplify discussions around its role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bulls argue it represents a major milestone for the adoption of Bitcoin, while critics point to the company’s mounting debt and continued losses. Regardless, its inclusion in the index cements its position as a key player in both the tech and crypto sectors.

Whether it’s navigating blockchain’s steep learning curve or ensuring seamless scalability, Qubetics is paving the way for a more accessible Web3 future.The numbers speak for themselves: over 9,700 token holders and counting. Qubetics has built a strong, loyal community of investors who believe in its mission. This community-driven approach sets it apart from many other crypto projects that focus solely on hype. Analysts Are Buzzing The buzz isn’t just among everyday investors. Crypto analysts are making bold predictions for $TICS, and they’re backed by solid reasoning. Short-term Potential: Analysts expect $TICS to reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, which translates to a 703.21% ROI. Mid-term Growth: Once the mainnet launches, $TICS is projected to hit $10–$15, offering jaw-dropping returns of over 32,000%. This kind of growth isn’t speculative—it’s rooted in the practical value and innovative solutions Qubetics brings to the table. Your Second Chance at Crypto Success Regret missing out on SEI? Don’t make the same mistake twice. Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to invest early in a project that’s set to redefine the crypto landscape. With its presale nearing its final stages and the price still at $0.0311 , there’s no better time to jump in.

37715683,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52233,1734352212,Best Cryptos to Join Now – Qubetics Redefines Tokenised Marketplaces as Algorand and SEI Lead Blockchain Innovation,"The cryptocurrency landscape continues to expand, offering innovative solutions that redefine traditional markets. For investors, the current environment presents an exceptional opportunity to join projects poised for remarkable growth. With blockchain technology evolving rapidly, early adoption of the right projects can provide substantial returns. Among the emerging names, Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI stand out for their transformative approaches to market challenges. From Qubetics’ tokenised marketplace to Algorand’s focus on sustainability and SEI’s commitment to trading optimisation, these projects are not only innovating but also capturing the interest of forward-thinking investors. Qubetics: Redefining Markets with Tokenised Solutions Qubetics is making waves with its tokenised marketplace, a feature designed to democratise access to investment opportunities. Tokenisation enables fractional ownership of assets, such as real estate or art, making high-value investments accessible to smaller investors. This innovation also addresses a critical issue in traditional markets: illiquidity. Unlike conventional assets, tokenised assets can be traded seamlessly on blockchain platforms, ensuring higher liquidity and greater flexibility for investors. Transparency is another significant challenge that Qubetics aims to resolve. Traditional markets often operate with limited visibility into transactions, leaving investors in the dark about pricing and ownership structures. By leveraging blockchain, Qubetics ensures that every transaction is recorded immutably, providing unparalleled transparency and fostering trust among participants. While tokenisation offers numerous benefits, regulatory compliance remains a hurdle. Many blockchain projects struggle to align with local and international regulations, creating uncertainty for investors. Qubetics has taken a proactive approach by incorporating compliance measures into its tokenised marketplace. This ensures that transactions are not only secure but also adhere to legal frameworks, making it a safer and more reliable option for both individuals and institutions. With its focus on addressing real-world issues like market illiquidity, lack of transparency, and regulatory hurdles, Qubetics is a top contender for investors seeking to join the best cryptos now. Analysts are particularly optimistic about its potential, given the growing demand for tokenised assets and the project’s robust technological infrastructure. For more information on Qubetics, check out this video . Algorand: Pioneering Green Blockchain Technology Algorand has established itself as one of the most sustainable blockchains in the industry. As environmental concerns grow, energy-intensive proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin have faced criticism. Algorand, on the other hand, uses a pure proof-of-stake mechanism, which consumes significantly less energy. This has made it a favourite among environmentally conscious investors and organisations. The blockchain’s green credentials are backed by initiatives to offset its minimal carbon footprint. Algorand’s sustainability efforts have not only attracted eco-friendly projects but have also opened doors to partnerships with governments and enterprises exploring blockchain for climate solutions. This dual focus on technology and sustainability positions it as a strong contender for those looking to invest now. Beyond its environmental focus, Algorand excels in scalability and security. Its network is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with near-instant finality, making it ideal for large-scale applications like supply chain management, decentralised finance (DeFi), and tokenised assets. For short-term traders and long-term holders alike, Algorand’s combination of speed, cost-efficiency, and eco-friendliness offers a compelling investment opportunity. SEI: Revolutionising Decentralised Trading SEI stands out as a layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for trading applications. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, SEI optimises for speed and efficiency, addressing the limitations of existing decentralised exchanges. With features like front-running prevention and improved transaction throughput, SEI aims to provide a seamless trading experience that rivals centralised platforms. The project has gained attention for its innovative approach to order book management, allowing for better liquidity and price discovery. As decentralised finance (DeFi) continues to grow, SEI’s focus on creating a trader-friendly ecosystem positions it as a significant player in the blockchain space. SEI’s architecture is developer-friendly, enabling projects to build custom trading solutions with ease. This has led to a surge in new applications being launched on its platform, further strengthening its ecosystem. With the rise of DeFi and the increasing need for robust trading solutions, SEI offers a unique proposition for investors looking to capitalise on the next wave of blockchain innovation. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Crypto Revolution The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, offering new opportunities for those willing to dive in. Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI are at the forefront of this revolution, each addressing critical challenges and paving the way for a more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable financial future.

37714982,https://crypto.news/?p=14319671,1734352200,Trader who accurately predicted XRP’s rally past $1 now bets on Bonk and Yeti Ouro,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A crypto trader known for predicting XRP’s surge past $1 now eyes Bonk and Yeti Ouro as the next big DeFi opportunities, with substantial growth potential on the horizon. Table of Contents XRP bullish momentum continues, rally to ATH? Bonk rally: Is a breakout looming? Yeti Ouro gains investor confidence during presale A crypto trader who accurately predicted XRP’s recent rally past the $1 mark is now focusing on two promising DeFi assets, Bonk (BONK) and Yeti Ouro (YETIO). With XRP’s price action showing signs of continued bullish momentum, this trader’s focus has shifted to these emerging projects that could see substantial growth soon. XRP bullish momentum continues, rally to ATH? After predicting the XRP to break past $1, the trader has remained quite optimistic about the future of the digital asset. XRP rallied by 30% to break through its 2021 high of $1.96, which was successfully tested. This price action, along with the formation of a major ‘W’ pattern on the monthly chart, has opened up the possibility of XRP rising to $30 to $35 by 2025. Source X At press time, XRP was trading at $2.42, with many analysts predicting further upward movement. The trader urges holders to exercise vigilance and not fall prey to the price rise of XRP, suggesting that holders capitalize on the rally. ”As they say, there are no certainties in crypto, but the possibility of XRP hitting $35 by 2025 appears to be quite probable,” the trader said. Bonk rally: Is a breakout looming? Alongside XRP, the trader is also interested in Bonk , a Solana-based meme coin that has seen a surge in popularity in the last few months. Bonk has seen its price rise by over 100% since its listing on Coinbase due to high community engagement and a bold token distribution strategy. According to the experts, the price might rise even higher, with a short-term forecast at $0.0000545 and a long-term forecast at $0.000137. Source X The ongoing growth of Bonk’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX), known as BonkSwap, and its strategic position in the Solana ecosystem remain positive. Data from on-chain shows that whales have started paying attention to Bonk, as there has been massive outflow from exchanges, which is considered as a bullish signal. Yeti Ouro gains investor confidence during presale Concurrently, amid these rallies, another coin that has attracted the attention of holders in the crypto community is Yeti Ouro, a DeFi token with a gaming element integrated. The presale of the project has collected more than $1.15 million, with stage one sold out ahead of time, early investors are enjoying over 40% ROI. The tokens now sell for $0.017, with incentives for investors through staking rewards, token burn, and limited supply. The P2E game YetiGo, developed by Yeti Ouro, enhances its already strong appeal by being developed on Unreal Engine 5. It is a racing game that allows players to race and win and get incentives in the process. The development team behind the project consists of individuals who have previously worked on games such as Call of Duty and Spider-Man; they have focused on such aspects as fluid controls, destructible environments, and interactivity to make the game enjoyable to play. As there are only a few days left before the presale price increases, there is increased demand for YETIO tokens among holders. Analysts have projected that YETIO could reach $2.50 to $3.00 in 2025 as the ecosystem continues to expand. To learn more about Yeti Ouro community, visit the website , X , Telegram , and Discord.

In a new report published on Dec. 16, the UK’s financial authority has outlined new directives for the crypto industry. The UK’s FCA is preparing to outlaw public crypto offerings This move extends the existing promotional restrictions which limit unsolicited crypto communications to UK citizens Exceptions might be made for certain crypto asset trading platforms or under specific exemptions It is a significant move that builds upon last year’s promotional and advertising constraints, which barred unregistered crypto entities from initiating contact with UK clients. “Our Discussion Paper DP24/4 ( Admissions & disclosures and market abuse regime for cryptoassets ) is part of a series of publications that are designed to help us shape the UK’s crypto regime,” the FCA said. As part of the proposed legislation, the government plans to set “out proposals for firms to introduce strong controls that prevent harm,” and is seeking the consultation of the public on the newly proposed rules. “We are also suggesting certain firms, like authorised crypto trading platforms, share information with each other to help stop suspected market abuse.” You might also like: U.K. FCA will finalize crypto industry regulations in 2026: report The forthcoming legislation aims to further tighten these controls by disallowing public crypto offers, with exceptions possibly for established trading platforms or under specific regulatory waivers. The FCA’s document invites feedback from the crypto industry on critical areas such as market entry protocols, disclosure requirements, and mechanisms to combat market abuse. The new regulatory clarity is part of a broader series of consultations as the FCA gears up for a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, expected to be fully implemented by 2026 following the introduction of draft regulations next year. The FCA , tasked with regulating financial activities across the UK, including the burgeoning crypto sector, has been monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering laws since 2020. The forthcoming regulations aim to enhance consumer protection by ensuring investors have adequate information to make educated investment decisions and by strengthening measures against fraudulent activities through a robust market abuse framework. The FCA is inviting public consultations on the new rules until March 2025.

Two major factors—whale accumulation and a bull flag pattern—are shaping predictions of XRP’s rise to $4. Whale Accumulation in the XRP Market Data from Santiment reveals that XRP whales holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens added approximately 100 million XRP to their portfolios between December 7 and December 10. During this time, XRP’s price experienced a sharp decline of 27.2%, falling from $2.61 to $1.90. In the recent dip, whales bought over 100 million $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/xU2YscIkvj — Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2024 Instead of selling during the downturn, these whales took advantage of the lower prices to strengthen their holdings. Their cumulative balance rose from 4.71 billion XRP tokens to 4.80 billion, reflecting an additional $200 million in capital deployed. This activity is part of a broader accumulation trend over the past month. In mid-November, these whale holdings stood at 3.71 billion XRP. By early December, this figure had risen to 4.8 billion, indicating that approximately 1.1 billion XRP tokens were added during this period. Concurrently, XRP’s price climbed from $0.50 to $2.87, highlighting the potential impact of whale activity on the market. Although whales took some profits when XRP reached $2.87 earlier this month, their holdings increased again after a subsequent price dip. Following the market crash on December 10, XRP rebounded to $2.43, showing early signs of recovery.

However, some technical indicators suggest a temporary correction before the anticipated breakout. Ali Martinez, a prominent market analyst, noted on Twitter that while XRP is forming a bull flag, the TD Sequential indicator has issued a sell signal on the four-hour chart. “Based on this,” Martinez stated, “XRP could face another correction before the much-anticipated breakout beyond the $2 price range.” Martinez predicts that after the brief pullback, XRP could begin its rally toward $4. He first outlined this possibility earlier in the week, identifying a fourth bullish pennant formation. Similar patterns had led to price increases from $0.69 to $1.10 and, subsequently, from $1.50 to $2.87. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This move could set the stage for global expansion, raising questions about which cryptocurrencies might follow. Speculation surrounds Solana and XRP, with experts suggesting they could debut ETFs by 2025. However, Rollblock , a rising star in GambleFi, might outpace both altcoins in growth. Rollblock’s unique casino games and innovation could redefine expectations in the competitive crypto market. Solana ETFs Expected To Face Challenges From Current SEC Leaders Solana witnessed an all-time high of $263 in Q4 and is certainly demonstrating its rise in the blockchain space. This surge reflects Solana’s ability to draw in users with low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Decentralized applications like pump.fun have benefited from these features. However, pump.fun’s recent ban in the UK and potential regulations raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of Solana’s innovations. Also, the short-term prospects for Solana ETFs face challenges. Reports suggest the SEC plans to reject two of five pending Solana ETF applications under its current leadership. This decision dampens immediate investor enthusiasm. However, optimism is rising as Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, prepares to take over as SEC Chair in January. Appointed by President-elect Trump, Atkins is expected to support proactive crypto policies. Several industry experts think his leadership may boost Solana ETF approvals, bringing it closer to Ethereum and other major cryptos. XRP’s Price Keeps Up Impressive Momentum XRP (XRP) rallied to $2.84, a peak price last seen in early 2018. However, the price faced strong resistance and retraced. Currently, Ripple is consolidating around $2.50 after buyers quickly purchased the dip to $2.25. This particular rally pushed XRP’s market cap to $142 billion, well above Solana, BNB and Tether. This made XRP the third biggest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Ripple is planning to launch its RLUSD stablecoin following extensive testing. This development places Ripple in a strong position within the stablecoin market. Analysts believe this innovation could fuel new rallies, potentially pushing XRP above $3 before the year ends. Why Rollblock’s GambleFi Platform is a Game-Changer in Online Gambling Missing the XRP and XLM boom may have been unavoidable for some investors. Fortunately, Rollblock offers a new chance to buy a promising token at a low price and achieve substantial gains soon. The Rollblock presale is currently in stage 9, with each token priced at $0.0415. Early investors have already benefited from a 310% increase since the initial coin offering (ICO) began. Rollblock’s optimistic predictions stem from its innovative features and growth potential. The project stands out in the online gambling industry with its unique GambleFi platform. This platform blends a traditional casino’s experience with the benefits of cryptocurrency investing. Players can access thousands of casino games and earn Rollblock tokens weekly through a revenue-sharing system. RBLK token holders also enjoy staking opportunities with up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY). This feature allows users to earn passive income while engaging in enjoyable gaming activities. The presale is nearing stage 10, where the token price will rise to $0.047. Investors have a limited window to purchase Rollblock tokens at the current low price.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-solana-memecoin-will-explode-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37714928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628056,1734351837,Chinese stocks tumble as Bitcoin breaks all-time highs. Coincidence?,"China’s stock markets are bleeding red, while the Bitcoin it banned rockets to new highs, leaving us to wonder if there’s a connection between the two. On Monday, the CSI 300, which tracks China’s top companies, dipped 0.6%, and the Hang Seng index slid 0.4% in Hong Kong. Over the same period, Bitcoin exploded by 3.6%, hitting an unprecedented $106,493. It’s the biggest rally since “crypto president” Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. election triggered a bull run. China’s retail sales growth in November slowed to 3%, well below expectations, while real estate investment continued to plummet. Policymakers had just promised to revive domestic demand, but the numbers tell a different story. America determined to lead in crypto Since Trump’s win, BTC has gained more than 50%, climbing to levels once thought impossible. His plan to create a national Bitcoin reserve, akin to the country’s strategic oil reserve, has made almost everyone bullish. The president recently declared that: “We’re going to do something big with crypto because we’re not letting China or anyone else take the lead.” But this competition seems very one-sided as China continues to double down on its anti-crypto stance. Back in 2021, Beijing banned all crypto-related transactions, calling them illegal. The People’s Bank of China has been relentless , repeatedly emphasizing that Bitcoin and its counterparts have no place in the Chinese financial system. Despite whispers of potential changes in policy, nothing official has materialized. Hong Kong, however, has become a loophole, as the city courts crypto businesses under its semi-autonomous status. China’s weak economy adds to the pressure November’s economic data does little to inspire confidence in China’s recovery. As mentioned, retail sales, which grew by just 3% year-on-year, missed forecasts of 4.6%. This is a sharp slowdown from October’s 4.8% growth, which had been boosted by early Singles’ Day shopping promotions. Analysts point to a lack of consumer confidence and a property market that’s still in free fall. Real estate investment, a critical driver of China’s economy, shrank by 10.4% from January to November. This decline deepened from the 10.3% drop reported the previous month. With home prices falling and no signs of a turnaround, Beijing’s property woes are becoming harder to ignore. Fixed asset investment was another disappointment, rising just 3.3% this year through November, below the 3.4% analysts had expected. Industrial production, one of the few bright spots, rose by 5.4% in November, slightly beating expectations. But even this isn’t enough to offset the broader slowdown. Economists are skeptical about the effectiveness of recent stimulus measures, describing them as “short-lived.” The National Bureau of Statistics admitted in a statement that while the economy shows signs of improvement, domestic demand remains weak, and businesses are still facing significant challenges. Could Trump inspire China? China used to dominate Bitcoin. It was the epicenter of mining and trading before the 2021 crackdown. By banning crypto, Beijing handed that lead to the U.S., where pro-crypto policies are now flourishing. Its loss is America’s gain. The irony is rich: a country that once controlled over 70% of Bitcoin mining now watches from the sidelines as its rival profits. A lot of analysts seem to think that Trump could inspire China’s Xi Jinping to lift his ban, especially as the two are slowly rekindling their friendship. Though perhaps leaving it alone will be the best thing for the boys. They don’t need yet another thing to fight about. Meanwhile, Russia’s Vlad Putin has already made his decision. He’s signed a law that makes Bitcoin legal property in the country. That means any business or person can accept crypto as payment for anything. Some analysts, though, are concerned that if all these countries get deep into Bitcoin, it would tumble the global economy. And realistically speaking, from an economic point of view, they might be right.

37715920,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/stifling-decentralization-the-paradox-of-excessive-dao-oversight,1734351537,Stifling Decentralization: The Paradox of Excessive DAO Oversight,"On November 15, 2024, Atom Accelerator Decentralized Autonomous Organization (AADAO), a Cosmos Hub DAO, announced it was shuttering and would return the remaining funds to the Cosmos Hub Community Pool. Contributors to the DAO unanimously rejected performance bonuses for the year, amounting to the equivalent of $817,159 in ATOM tokens. AADAO’s venture portfolio includes Sphinx, Plaza Finance, Elys Network, Drop Protocol, and Union Labs. It is valued at $1.1 million, with pending venture investments worth an additional $750,000. Paradoxically, excessive oversight is not an uncommon challenge DAOs face, defeating their stated purposes of decentralization and autonomy. Upon shutting down its operations, AADAO commented that the Oversight Committee’s current approach obstructed its “ability to operate effectively,” adding that against this backdrop, no contributor wanted to lead the DAO moving forward or even continue working in it. The decision to shut down reflects the assessment that the DAO faces significant limitations in delivering value to the Cosmos Hub under its current structure. Supporting testnet programs, securing critical infrastructure, and promoting ATOM utility across platforms are among the milestones the DAO achieved during its operation. Decentralizing oversight mechanisms Potential solutions to stifling oversight involve delegating committees and implementing multi-sig governance. Multi-signature wallets require a consensus among several parties instead of a single centralized authority to make a decision. Token holders could assign oversight to smaller, specialized committees, potentially enabling streamlined and focused governance without micromanagement. Smart contracts automate oversight functions, ensuring actions are verifiable and reducing the need for manual interventions. Autonomous decision-making and governance frameworks Oracles automate decision-making based on predefined metrics or external data, reducing the need for human oversight. In addition, smaller and topic-specific DAOs could handle specialized tasks autonomously within the larger ecosystem. To establish clear boundaries, DAO stakeholders should define the scope and limits of oversight in governance frameworks in advance. Major decisions should require a high quorum, ensuring only significant issues require large-scale oversight. Lack of legal clarity and limited adoption There are currently more than 200 DAOs with millions of members and over $10 billion in AUM. Industry titans such as Mark Cuban, Peter Thiel, and Naval Ravikant have invested in these autonomous structures, recognizing their potential as a combination of progressivism and capitalism. The potential is undeniable, but investors would be wise to consider a few additional challenges before acting on their hunch. DAOs serve purposes beyond managing digital asset protocols. These include facilitating social media platforms, overseeing venture capitalist funds, managing social clubs, and supporting philanthropic efforts. Decentralized governance heavily relies on DAO token ownership, which can lead to a group of people accumulating a large share of tokens and obtaining higher voting power based on those tokens. When voting power is accumulated in the hands of a few investors, concerns about supporting unreasonable proposals become inevitable. DAOs frequently lack formal corporate structures with clear liability protection terms and distinctions between the different roles of participants. Governance token holders propose actions for the DAO to vote on and take. The lack of clarity in the legal form creates pronounced risks for members because of the uncertain nature of their legal liability. DAOs issue tokens rather than traditional equity. Typically, holders and issuers expect economic returns or governance rights from tokens, but there is often no legal relationship between the DAO and its token holders. This creates a risk for the latter as they may not have any recourse or protection if legal issues or disputes arise. Personal and tax liabilities Misunderstandings surrounding the personal responsibilities of DAO members can arise, especially when they fail to follow through on approved proposals. This ambiguity blocks DAO expansion beyond blockchain environments and raises issues in terms of integrating off-chain assets. As DAO networks grow and develop, addressing these issues becomes critical, as the objective is not only to survive but to thrive. What’s more, DAOs’ tax implications remain shrouded in mist. DAOs can’t file taxes or benefit from tax refunds like conventional businesses in most countries. The lack of clarity on taxation could mean that membership in such organizations presents a direct tax liability for investors in some jurisdictions. As the regulatory framework for DAOs continues to develop, investors need to keep track of any tax obligations and consequential implications. In light of all these potential issues, investors should carefully consider the possible challenges and risks of their initiatives and make informed decisions. Ultimately, a DAO’s prospects depend on its members’ resolve to move forward or the conscientiousness of their behavior if moving forward becomes unfeasible.

What Is the Bitcoin-to-Gold Ratio? The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s price by the spot price of gold. This metric provides insight into Bitcoin’s relative purchasing power compared to gold, often seen as a traditional store of value. Brandt suggested that the ratio could climb even higher, predicting a future target of 89 ounces of gold per Bitcoin. “Next stop will be 89 to 1 — it will require 89 ounces of Gold (purchased at a rip-off premium from Shifty-Schiff SchiffGold to buy a single Bitcoin.” This comes amid a growing belief within the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin could capture a larger share of gold’s $15 trillion market.

However, Michael Saylor urged the government not to buy more gold but to buy more Bitcoin for future assets against inflation. As a national reserve, he believes Bitcoin will rise to trillions of dollars. “Dump your gold, sell all the U.S. gold, and buy Bitcoin because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the cost of the gold. You’ll demonitize the entire gold asset class and our enemies hold gold in their banks, and so their asset would go to zero, while our asset go to trillion dollars.” Michael Saylor calls on the US Government to sell all of its gold and buy #Bitcoin . pic.twitter.com/G25G6uXHOf — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) December 15, 2024 Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New Record Adding to the momentum, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has also hit a new record.

Dorchak in a letter addressed to Sandra Epp Ryan, the Attorney of Record for Binance Holdings Limited. In the letter, Dorchak explained that Longo’s team submitted an application for registration of the copyrighted IP to the United States Copyright office. Therefore, when it is officially registered, the use of Peanut’s image on the Binance platform will fall under violation of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.

On Nov. 25, he accused the PNUT community of unlawfully taking advantage of his pet’s story without including him and his non-profit initiatives. Therefore, Longo launched his own token that he named JUSTICE (For Pnut and Fred) as a way to assert control over his narrative and denounce the PNUT community. Mark Longo saved Peanut from a car accident and shared their experiences on an Instagram account dedicated to Peanut and a raccoon named Fred. However, the New York City Department of Environmental Conservation later seized the animals from Longo’s residence following anonymous complaints. The PNUT token was created in honor of Peanut after the squirrel died from being euthanized by authorities.

37715985,https://invezz.com/?p=2388956,1734351438,How TikTok and Gen Z fueled XRP’s 400% monthly candle and the new trending altcoin,"In recent weeks, Ripple’s XRP token has risen 400%, becoming one of the most discussed online and offline discussions. XRP has soared on the back of the growing interest of Gen Z investors and TikTok influencers as it briefly became the world’s third-biggest cryptocurrency. However, there is another altcoin to watch in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which is also gaining traction rapidly, namely Rexas Finance , which is preselling for over $26 million. With social media playing a role in the investment trends, both XRP and Rexas Finance are picking up with retail investors looking for high-potential assets. The viral surge Of XRP on Tiktok, thanks to Gen Z TikTok virality and Gen Z FOMO (fear of missing out) effect also added to the massive price rally of XRP by over 400% recently. Viral TikTok videos fueled massive buying activity, drawing retail traders to the #XRP hashtag and interest in the cryptocurrency. Yes, TikTok’s algorithm put XRP in front of millions of young investors, and the surge kicked off with positivity surrounding Ripple’s success against the SEC. It has led these users, many of whom consider buying XRP below $2 as more affordable than incredibly priced assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to flood the market with new retail liquidity. Particularly, Gen Z are being hit hard by the FOMO effect in crypto where they view crypto as a primary investment option. In a shift from traditional investment choices such as stocks, Gen Z now prefers cryptocurrencies, according to the surveys. For this younger generation, as they continue to take social media by storm, their collective influence in the price of XRP is undeniable. In time, TikTok will elevate crypto trends that may drive XRP to surpass its 2017 all-time high by as soon as 2025, explain experts, largely fueled by social media exposure. Rexas Finance’s impressive presale success Recent months have also witnessed the rapid growth of Rexas Finance, a new decentralized finance (DeFi) project that has made its way into the competitive DeFi market. The project’s token presale has been a major success with over $26 million of the $26.375 million raised, nearly its entire allocation sold already at 99.16%. Lastly, our goal at Rexas Finance is to build out a decentralized ecosystem with multiple DeFi services, including stakes pools. The token’s price will increase in the following presale stage, as the RXS token currently costs $0.150, yet the token has proved quite popular. The tokenomics for Rexas Finance include a capped total supply of 1 billion RXS tokens, 42.5% of which will be available in the presale. The remaining tokens are spread out to liquidity, marketing, staking pools, etc. Rexas Finance wants to incentivize long-term community participation by allocating 22.5% of the total supply for staking and rewarding users with tokens. This structured allocation also demonstrates the project’s aim to create sustainable growth in the DeFi space. Rexas Finance has also secured investing by taking strong presale measures, and its presale performance has been strong. To prevent loss, the platform has said not to make any direct token transfers to addresses, as it will not reverse stolen funds. It’s not enough to be good at DeFi—this emphasis on transparency and security is also imperative for gaining trust amid a sea of rivals.

Self-described bitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) has increased its bitcoin holdings to a total of 439,000 BTC following its latest purchase of 15,350 BTC with the acquisition finishing on Dec. 15.   MicroStrategy disclosed that the 15,350 BTC purchase came to a total of $1.5 billion for an average price of $100,386 per bitcoin. This brings the company's total holdings to 439,000 BTC worth $45.6 billion at current market prices. The company's overall average purchase price is $61,725 per bitcoin.   The latest acquisition purchases was funded through share sales under the company's at-the-market (ATM) program. Before the announcement, MicroStrategy had $9.19 billion left of the ATM offering. Following the announcement, the company now has $7.65 billion left, according to the latest filing.   Once again, Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor teased the Monday announcement with a Sunday post.   This is now a multi week trend that MicroStrategy has announced a bitcoin purchase on a Monday before the U.S. market opens. In the previous five weeks MicroStrategy has purchased 171,430 BTC for $15.61 billion, according to an X post, by @LuckyXBT__. This current ATM offering is still part of MicroStrategy's well-known ""21/21 plan"". While, the company still has $18 billion left of convertible note offerings, of which only $3 billion has been used so far, according to LuckyXBT.   This announcement follows Friday's news of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100, with the index's re-shuffling going into effect on Dec. 23.   In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has officially adopted fair value accounting for bitcoin and other digital assets for fiscal years after Dec. 15 2024, which passed in 2023.  This means that digital assets will be able to account for using fair value measurement, which allows companies to recognize both fair value gains and impairments on their bitcoin holdings in net income. Under the previous rules, companies could only record impairments if that asset's value dropped below its purchase price, but they could not record any gains seen if the asset increased above the purchase price.   Following the news of both the Nasdaq 100 inclusion and recent bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy's share price is up 4% in pre-market trading at $425 a share. While, bitcoin is trading over $104,000, after recently setting an all-time high over $106,000.   Semler Scientific (SMLR) also acquired more bitcoin, 211 BTC for $421.5 million at $101,890 per bitcoin. As of Dec. 12, Semler Scientific holds 2,084 BTC. In addition, Semler Scientific filed a second prospectus supplement to its S-3 Shelf, increasing its ATM offering by a further $50 million, taking the total offering to $150 million.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/16/micro-strategy-boosts-bitcoin-holdings-to-439-000-btc-following-nasdaq-100-inclusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e08490c4247a73f17d32071ee1fd45bc1c49049f-1293x727.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37714488,https://crypto.news/?p=14319696,1734351408,CZ highlights how governments are leaning towards BTC strategic reserves,"Former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao creates a thread on X, showcasing news headlines that point to governments establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves, much like the plans introduced in the U.S. In a recent post, CZ shared a headline that showed how a Japanese lawmaker was pushing for the creation of a national strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. He posted the headline along with a sarcastic caption of “probably nothing…” accompanied by a laughing emoji. The crypto industry figurehead linked the post to a previous one he made in early December with the same caption. The post showed a similar move that happened in Russia , when a lawmaker suggested the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in light of current geopolitical issues. CZ’s post seemingly hints at a growing global trend, where people are starting to urge their governments to form Bitcoin reserves, ultimately following in America’s footsteps. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1868118429749899762?s=61&t=Goh7F7TZjoAVMq_tusVLpw Many X users were quick to comment under CZ’s post, expressing their certainty that Bitcoin domination was evidently happening across the globe after President-elect Donald Trump confirmed his plans to build a Bitcoin reserve. “Imagine the space race equivalent when countries start buying BTC as a reserve currency,” wrote @Cryptoking on X. “We love to see progress in the space!” wrote @FEGtoken in another comment. You might also like: Bitcoin hits $106K, an all-time high fueled by Donald Trump’s intention to do “great with crypto” On Dec. 11, a Japanese lawmaker — ironically named Satoshi Hamada — submitted questions for the government, asking whether they would consider forming a national Bitcoin reserve. Hamada directly referred to the U.S. government’s efforts to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country, claiming that such a move could add a “tremendous amount of power” to the markets. “Should Japan also introduce a system to convert part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin?” asked Hamada in his translated submission . As reported by crypto.news earlier this month, Anton Tkachev, state deputy of Duma, Russia urged the government to consider creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the country. In Tkachev’s proposal, he stated that Bitcoin would not only serve as a currency but also as an alternative asset for storing national funds. He argued that Bitcoin was not impacted by inflation nor cross-border sanctions, unlike the traditional currencies. Brazil’s Congress joined the race early on in Nov. 26, when Brazilian legislators in the Chamber of Deputies proposed a Bitcoin bill that would limit Brazil’s reserves to approximately $18.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Regulators also recommended allocating 5% of the nation’s $370 billion treasury to the Bitcoin strategic reserve. Since the start of his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to create a national Bitcoin reserve. After his presidential win, Senator Cynthia Lummis reaffirmed Trump’s plans to create a strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S. A number of states across America have also been inching towards establishing Bitcoin reserve bills, including Texas, Alabama and Pennsylvania among others. The Canadian city of Vancouver also recently jumped on the wagon with councilors voting in favor of Mayor Ken Sim’s “Bitcoin-friendly” motion, which included converting a portion of Vancouver’s current financial reserve.

37714462,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393647,1734351366,Crypto Bull Run 2025: What’s Next for Bitcoin and Altcoins?,"The post Crypto Bull Run 2025: What’s Next for Bitcoin and Altcoins? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for an exciting 2025, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge and altcoins set to follow in its wake. After hitting a new high above $106,000 recently, Bitcoin continues to show strength, signaling the possibility of further growth into the new year. What To Expect In 2025 As we move into 2025, the cryptocurrency market shows strong signs of a continued bull run. Q4 is usually a good time for Bitcoin, with a typical rally at the year’s end. However, some experts believe the “Santa Claus rally” may not be as significant for those focused on global trends and liquidity. In the past, Bitcoin has rallied into December, followed by a pullback in January. These dips are often short-lived, and Bitcoin has continued to rise after. Many believe this pattern may repeat in 2025, with a possible dip in January before another rally in Q1 and Q2. On the other hand, some analysts even expect the market to slow down by summer, but it remains uncertain. A pullback in early 2025 could test support levels around $88,000 or $80,000, but overall, the bullish sentiment remains strong. Bitcoin Price Eying For $120K Bitcoin’s recent price surge beyond $106,000 has attracted both retail and institutional investors. With expectations of Bitcoin reaching new highs in the coming months, the end-of-year rally could continue into Q1 2025, as we’ve seen in the past. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could rise to $114,000 or even $120,000, according to analysts using Fibonacci levels for price predictions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fed Rate Cut Date 2024: How December 18 Decision Could Shape the Crypto Market , Altcoin Market To Thrive The altcoin market is also showing strong signs of growth, with the total market cap already surpassing $1.5 trillion its all-time high from 2021. This signals a positive outlook for altcoins heading into 2025. Ethereum, in particular, is poised for a breakout, especially with Ethereum ETFs that could drive institutional interest. Out of the top 50 altcoins, 31 have already outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. However, the Altcoin Season Index is currently at 63, indicating that the Altcoin season hasn’t fully started yet. As Bitcoin continues its rally, altcoins are expected to follow suit, potentially leading to major gains in the altcoin space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the king of the cryptocurrencies starts to run out of steam, the altcoins are beginning to feel the effects of this new wind change. What’s next for Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SUI), and Sui ($SUI)? It really does look like gravity is starting to have its effect on the price of Bitcoin. Most indicators are now showing a very overbought condition, and therefore it is likely that a correction could be about to happen. So what about the altcoins when/if this takes place? Market wisdom so far in this bull market is that whenever $BTC drops in price, the altcoins do the same, but at a more accelerated pace. Could things be different this time? There is the possibility that as Bitcoin potentially tracks down and sideways for a time, the altcoins could take the opportunity for a bit of an altseason surge. Bitcoin Dominance breakdown about to be confirmed? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) shows a real tussle right now. Dominance rose above the top trendline of the wedge at one point, then fell all the way through the wedge, and is now creeping back up to perhaps test the bottom trendline. If a strong rejection takes place, that would be the signal perhaps for altcoins to have some fun. $ETH bulls need to hold $3,900 Source: TradingView The $ETH price is at a very important juncture. If the price can hold above what is now extremely strong support at $3,900, there is the possibility that this could be the new base support for the rest of this bull market. In the short term price action, the price may well go lower, but holding the support at the weekly close is the aim. Last week’s hammer candle with a huge wick to the downside is a sign that there may well be plenty of upside to come. This week’s price action could be critical. $SOL heading back to very strong $202 support level Source: TradingView The $SOL weekly chart looks fairly straightforward. The price is within a bull flag, although it looks as though the price may well revisit the very strong horizontal support at $202 before making the next upward bid. This could result in $SOL finally breaking through the top of the bull flag and heading much higher. $SUI rejected at 2.618 Fibonacci Source: TradingView The $SUI price really took off in early November, once the cup and handle pattern was confirmed. Only now, at the 2.618 Fibonacci for the entire $SUI price action, has it been rejected. Looking at the Fibonacci levels just for this upward move, it can be seen that $3.97 and $3.70 are decent possibilities as targets for this reversal. Looking at the worst case scenario, If the price falls below $2.98, this could signal the end of the upward trend. Otherwise, this is likely just a healthy correction.

Heightened BTC withdrawal tallies with Bitcoin’s surging prices. Analysts suspect ongoing BTC accumulation by investors. Coinglass data shows that Bitcoin accumulation is increasing as its price climbs. Last week, Bitcoin holders pulled roughly 37,000 BTC from centralized exchanges (CEXs). This has sparked a lot of talk about what’s next for Bitcoin. According to data from Coinglass, Coinbase Pro saw the highest withdrawal volume, with over 15,600 Bitcoins leaving the exchange. Bitcoin holders withdrew over 12,300 Bitcoins from Binance, while other top CEXs like Bitfinex, Gemini, and Kraken also experienced significant BTC withdrawals during the same period. Crypto analysts say these withdrawals match up with Bitcoin’s recent price gains. Bitcoin continued its upward trend, hitting $106,533.

While it wasn’t completely smooth sailing, with the leading digital asset hitting several speed bumps on its way to $100,000, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has now surpassed that mark, and was trading at approximately $104,807 by press time on December 16. Over the last week, BTC has seen prices rise by 6.52% — bolstering monthly returns to 14.78% and year-to-date (YTD) gains up to 146.81%. BTC price weekly chart. Source: Finbold There are a lot of favorable tailwinds at play as we draw closer to the end of the year. A favorable regulatory environment is expected going forward, and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve would go a long way in cementing the cryptocurrency’s role as an authentic store of value. Investor activity is also showing signs of a strong, robust uptrend — with volume having experienced a sustained rise since the beginning of November. While the actions of retail investors should never be underestimated, it’s the undertakings of large market participants — hedge funds, institutional investors, and banks, that have a much more pronounced effect on price action. This point is increasingly relevant as Bitcoin continues to see accelerated institutional adoption and mainstream appeal. Now, one cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out that the number of whales — accounts in this case holding more than 100 BTC, has skyrocketed since early November. Thousands of BTC whales have entered the market It cannot conclusively be stated that these were investments made by institutions — however, seeing as how Bitcoin prices have ranged from approximately $67,000 at the beginning of the rally to $104,807 at press time, buying 100 BTC would have required between $6,700,000 and $10,480,700. And transactions of this caliber have indeed skyrocketed — the number of addresses holding more than 100 BTC has increased from roughly 16,400 at the beginning of the rally to approximately 17,600, as explained by cryptocurrency expert and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez in a December 15 X post . Chart detailing the number of BTC whales. Source: Ali Martinez on X Beyond the scale of these addresses, how numerous they’ve become is also notable — suggesting that this is, after all, an influx of either institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals entering the market Readers should note, that while there is no set definition of a ‘whale’ in the cryptocurrency market, the term is generally used to refer to addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC — whereas Martinez used a significantly lower cutoff point of 100 BTC. However, the influx still constitutes a strong bullish signal — as analysts are eyeing price targets as high as $150,000 or $250,000 for 2025, this degree of optimism only serves to bolster the case that BTC is set for another year of stellar gains.

37714361,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110499,1734351154,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reaches 83, Reflecting “Extreme Greed”","The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a key sentiment indicator for the cryptocurrency market, climbed to 83 on December 16, 2024, remaining firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone. The index, up three points from the previous day, signals heightened optimism among investors as market momentum and trading volumes improve. With a range from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed) , the index captures the prevailing sentiment in the crypto market, offering valuable insights into potential investor behavior. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative , measures market sentiment by analyzing six key factors: Factor Weight What It Reflects Volatility 25% Measures price fluctuations and fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Assesses trading activity to gauge confidence. Social Media 15% Tracks mentions, engagement, and sentiment on platforms. Surveys 15% Collects opinions from investors to evaluate sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Indicates Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. Google Trends 10% Monitors search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. The resulting score serves as a sentiment barometer, guiding investors on market conditions. Why is the Index in the “Extreme Greed” Zone? 1. Rising Market Momentum and Volume The recent surge in trading activity and price movements, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, has strengthened investor confidence, pushing the index higher. 2. Improved Sentiment on Social Media Increased mentions of bullish terms and positive engagement across platforms like Twitter and Reddit have contributed to the index’s rise. 3. Bitcoin’s Stability and Dominance While Bitcoin remains stable above critical support levels, its dominance over altcoins has provided a sense of security for investors, further fueling optimism. Understanding the Zones of the Index Zone Score Range Market Implication Extreme Fear 0–24 Market panic; potential buying opportunity. Fear 25–49 Bearish sentiment; investors are cautious. Neutral 50 Balanced sentiment; no clear direction. Greed 51–74 Bullish sentiment; market showing confidence. Extreme Greed 75–100 High optimism; potential for overvaluation. Currently, the index’s 83 score indicates heightened greed, suggesting potential short-term market risks despite the bullish sentiment. What Does “Extreme Greed” Mean for Investors? While a high Fear & Greed Index signals positive sentiment, it also raises cautionary flags: 1. Potential Overvaluation Markets in “Extreme Greed” territory are often overbought, increasing the likelihood of corrections. 2. FOMO Among Investors Fear of missing out (FOMO) can drive irrational decision-making, leading to price spikes that may not be sustainable. 3. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Outlook While the index reflects short-term enthusiasm, investors should remain aware of long-term fundamentals to avoid hasty decisions. How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The index serves as a helpful tool for assessing market sentiment and planning investment strategies: For Cautious Investors Use high scores (Extreme Greed) as a signal to consider taking profits or diversifying holdings. For Opportunistic Buyers Low scores (Extreme Fear) may present buying opportunities , as they indicate market undervaluation. As a Complementary Tool Combine the index with technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive market view. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 83 highlights a surge in investor confidence, fueled by strong market momentum and improved sentiment. However, the current “Extreme Greed” zone serves as a reminder for investors to proceed cautiously and consider potential market corrections. As December progresses, monitoring the index alongside broader market developments will be crucial for making informed decisions in this dynamic environment.

This score confirms that the market is in Altcoin Season , where a significant majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. This latest reading reflects growing investor interest in altcoins as they deliver stronger returns compared to Bitcoin. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a tool designed to measure market trends by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin. How It Works Altcoin Season : Defined as when 75% or more of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. Bitcoin Season : Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin. Index Range : Scores range from 1 to 100 , with daily updates reflecting market changes. Current Market Status: Altcoin Season At a score of 65 , the index indicates that altcoins are outpacing Bitcoin in performance, a trend that has sparked increased interest in the broader cryptocurrency market. Why is the Market in Altcoin Season? Increased Investor Diversification Traders are seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin, allocating funds to high-performing altcoins. Altcoin Innovation Emerging blockchain projects and DeFi platforms are driving innovation and attracting capital. Bitcoin’s Slower Momentum Bitcoin’s relative stability compared to its 2021 bull runs has shifted attention to more volatile altcoins. How the Index is Calculated CoinMarketCap calculates the Altcoin Season Index by analyzing the top 100 cryptocurrencies’ performance over a 90-day period, excluding: Stablecoins : Tokens like USDT or USDC that maintain a fixed value. Wrapped Tokens : Assets like WBTC, pegged to other cryptocurrencies. By excluding these assets, the index offers a clearer picture of the performance dynamics among major cryptocurrencies. Implications of Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insights into market sentiment and trading opportunities: 1. Positive Sentiment for Altcoins A high index score signals a shift in focus toward altcoins, indicating strong investor confidence in alternative cryptocurrencies. 2. Increased Market Volatility Altcoins often exhibit higher price volatility compared to Bitcoin, presenting both risks and opportunities for traders. 3. Boost for Emerging Projects Altcoin Season tends to highlight new and innovative blockchain projects, driving increased adoption and investment. Comparison: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Metric Altcoin Season Bitcoin Season Performance Criteria 75% of top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin. 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin. Market Focus Altcoins dominate market gains. Bitcoin leads market performance. Investor Strategy Diversify into altcoins for higher returns. Focus on Bitcoin as the primary asset. What Does a Score of 65 Mean? While the Altcoin Season Index has climbed to 65, it has not yet reached the Extreme Altcoin Season zone, typically above 75. This score suggests: Strong Altcoin Market : The majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin but with room for further gains. Balanced Opportunities : While Bitcoin remains a stable choice, altcoins are offering greater short-term returns. Key Takeaways for Traders 1. Diversify Investments The current Altcoin Season presents opportunities for traders to explore high-performing altcoins, balancing portfolios with both Bitcoin and alternative assets. 2. Monitor Market Trends Staying updated on the Altcoin Season Index can help traders identify when to shift focus between Bitcoin and altcoins. 3. Assess Risk Levels Altcoins tend to be more volatile; investors should be prepared for rapid price swings while capitalizing on growth potential. Conclusion The rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 65 highlights growing momentum in the altcoin market, offering traders opportunities for diversification and higher returns. While Bitcoin remains the foundation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the focus on altcoins reflects the market’s dynamic nature and evolving investor preferences. As the market trends toward greater altcoin adoption, monitoring the Altcoin Season Index will be crucial for navigating these exciting developments.

This comes on the heels of a significant ETH selloff by Sun, raising questions about the potential impact of his actions on ETH price trajectory. On-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain reported that Sun recently withdrew 52,905 ETH from Lido, aligning with his broader accumulation strategy. Between February and August, Sun reportedly amassed 392,474 ETH through three wallets, spending $1.19 billion in total. His holdings now reflect a profit of $349 million, representing a robust 29% return on investment. Last week, Sun offloaded 29,920 ETH—worth $119.7 million—to the HTX exchange just as Ethereum touched the $4,000 milestone. The market has been abuzz with speculation about whether Sun intends to liquidate more ETH or maintain his current accumulation strategy. ETH Price Resilience Despite concerns over Sun’s recent selloff, Ethereum has shown remarkable resilience. ETH experienced a 2% uptick in the past 24 hours, trading at $3,961 with a peak of $4,020. Its one-day trading volume surged by 11% to $30.5 billion, signaling strong market activity. Over the past month, Ethereum has gained 27%, bolstering optimism among investors. Market confidence is further evident in the 5% rise in ETH Futures Open Interest, according to CoinGlass data. While some analysts worry that Sun’s moves could trigger volatility, others see bullish momentum in the broader market. Ali Martinez, a renowned crypto market expert, highlighted that ETH whales have been accumulating since the cryptocurrency crossed the $3,300 threshold. What Lies Ahead for Ethereum? As Ethereum inches closer to its psychological $4,000 barrier , the market remains divided on the implications of Sun’s actions. Some experts fear that additional selloffs could exert downward pressure on the price, while others point to bullish indicators, including predictions of ETH targeting the $15,000 mark in the near future. Sun’s decisions will undoubtedly remain a focal point for investors. Whether his next move supports Ethereum’s bullish run or introduces short-term turbulence, his actions are set to shape the narrative for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.

This bullish trend is driven by growing optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance , plans for regulatory reform, and record-breaking institutional investments. The rally, which has propelled Bitcoin’s price past $100,000, highlights renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency market as the U.S. prepares for potential regulatory shifts under Trump’s administration. Why is Bitcoin Rallying? Several factors are fueling Bitcoin’s ongoing seven-week streak: 1. Pro-Crypto Policies by President-Elect Trump Trump has announced plans to establish the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets , signaling a major regulatory shift from the restrictive policies under the Biden administration. His proposed national Bitcoin reserve has drawn significant attention, though its feasibility remains unclear. 2. Institutional Interest Surges Since Trump’s election victory, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $12.2 billion in inflows , reflecting increased confidence from institutional investors. In addition, $2.8 billion has flowed into Ether-focused ETFs , showcasing broader interest in the crypto market. 3. Market Optimism and Sentiment Renewed investor confidence has spurred buying activity, with Bitcoin’s role as a store of value gaining further validation. Bitcoin’s Longest Rally Since 2021 Key Metrics of the Current Rally Duration : Seven weeks of consecutive price gains. Price Levels : Bitcoin has crossed $100,000 , solidifying its position as the leading cryptocurrency. Market Sentiment : Strong bullish sentiment driven by institutional and retail participation. This marks Bitcoin’s longest streak of weekly gains in over three years, underlining the growing maturity and resilience of the cryptocurrency market. The Role of Spot Bitcoin ETFs The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a game-changer for institutional adoption: Accessibility : ETFs provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible way to invest in Bitcoin. Massive Inflows : $12.2 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF investments signals a strong appetite for exposure to digital assets. The success of these ETFs highlights the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial markets. Potential Regulatory Shifts Under Trump Trump’s presidency could mark a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto regulations: Key Proposals National Bitcoin Reserve : A controversial yet ambitious idea to solidify Bitcoin’s status as a strategic asset. Reversing Restrictive Policies : Trump has expressed plans to undo Biden-era crypto regulations, aiming to create a more business-friendly environment. Implications for the Crypto Market A clearer regulatory framework could attract even more institutional and retail investors. The U.S. could emerge as a hub for crypto innovation and investment.

Regulatory Developments Trump’s administration will play a key role in determining Bitcoin’s long-term success in the U.S. Clearer regulations could drive adoption and solidify Bitcoin’s role as a global asset. 2. Continued Institutional Interest As more institutions embrace Bitcoin, the demand for digital assets is likely to increase. 3. Market Volatility Investors should remain cautious as Bitcoin’s price remains susceptible to market corrections. Conclusion Bitcoin’s seven-week rally reflects growing optimism in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by institutional interest and a pro-crypto political climate under President-elect Donald Trump.

Furthermore, the President-Elect has given investors much to look forward to – at least in terms of promises and rhetoric. Specifically, he pledged to make the U.S. the digital assets capital of the world, create a strategic BTC reserve , and nominated a number of blockchain-friendly individuals for critical government and regulatory positions, including for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair . Is this the most bullish 2025 BTC price target? Under such circumstances, there has been no shortage of bullish price targets with $250,000 appearing a popular choice for 2025 as it is, at press time, the forecast provided by legendary Wall Street analysts like Tom Lee and consistent – if unreliable – BTC bulls like Robert Kiyosaki . Still, by December 13, another and unprecedented optimistic prediction appeared when Perianne Boring, the Founder and CEO of The Digital Chamber, estimated Bitcoin could rise above $800,000 before the end of next year, per the stock-flow model. Should BTC climb to such a price, it would boast a market capitalization of approximately $15 trillion – $13 trillion above the late 2024 valuation – and would be less than $3 trillion from overtaking the biggest asset in the world, gold . On the other hand, for Bitcoin to truly become bigger than gold, the precious metal would either have to decline from its press time prices, or the cryptocurrency would have to rise another $100,000 to the price of approximately $900,000. Finally, it is worth pointing out that, shortly before outlining the price target, Boring reflected on the hoped-for regulatory clarity under Donald Trump as a major driver of cryptocurrency investments and industry. Indeed, she described the situation under the Biden administration – believed by many to be marked and marred by a turf war between the SEC and the CFTC over digital assets – as hostile to blockchain companies and developers. $800,000 Bitcoin price target ambitious, but not out of reach Despite the bullishness, both $250,000 and $800,000 remain highly ambitious targets. Since the start of 2024 – an indubitably strong year for the cryptocurrency market – Bitcoin rocketed 146% to its press-time price of $104,172. BTC YTD price chart.

37714232,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110515,1734350940,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits Record High of 108.52 T,"Bitcoin’s mining difficulty reached a new all-time high of 108.52 T after a 4.43% adjustment at block height 874,944 , according to data from CloverPool . This milestone reflects the growing strength and competitiveness of the Bitcoin network as more miners participate. The next difficulty adjustment, projected in about 13 days, is expected to slightly decrease by 0.08% to 108.44 T . What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? Mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is for miners to validate transactions and add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. Adjusted approximately every two weeks (or 2,016 blocks), it ensures that blocks are mined at a consistent interval of roughly 10 minutes. Key Metrics Current Difficulty : 108.52 T (record high). Adjustment Cycle : Occurs every 2,016 blocks. Next Adjustment : Estimated at 108.44 T (-0.08%). Factors Behind the Record Difficulty 1. Increased Hashrate The mining difficulty adjustment corresponds to the Bitcoin network’s total computing power, or hashrate . A higher hashrate indicates: More miners joining the network. Increased competition for block rewards. 2. Network Security Higher difficulty enhances the security of the Bitcoin network , making it more resilient to attacks. 3. Price Incentives With Bitcoin trading above $100,000, the high profitability has attracted more miners, pushing up difficulty levels. Impact on Bitcoin Mining 1. Rising Costs for Miners Increased difficulty means miners must deploy more computational power, leading to: Higher energy consumption. Greater operational costs. 2. Reduced Profit Margins Smaller or less efficient mining operations may struggle to stay profitable as competition intensifies. 3. Benefits for the Network Despite the challenges for miners, higher difficulty reinforces Bitcoin’s decentralization and security, benefiting the overall ecosystem. What Happens at the Next Adjustment? The next difficulty adjustment is expected to slightly decrease to 108.44 T , a marginal 0.08% drop . This reflects the dynamic nature of Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustments, balancing network activity with block production times. Historical Context of Mining Difficulty Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has steadily increased over the years, reflecting: Advances in mining technology. Growth in the number of miners.

37714193,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110534,1734350853,What is Swap in Forex? Understanding Forex Swap Fees,"Forex trading , a swap refers to the interest fee traders pay or earn for holding a position overnight. Understanding how swaps work is crucial for managing trading costs and optimizing strategies. This guide explains what Forex swaps are, how they’re calculated, and how to navigate their impact on your trading. What is a Forex Swap? A Forex swap, also called a rollover fee , is the interest charged or earned when a trader keeps a position open overnight. Swaps occur because Forex trading involves borrowing one currency to buy another, and interest rates between the two currencies vary. Swap Charges : Paid when the interest rate of the base currency is lower than the counter currency. Swap Credits : Earned when the interest rate of the base currency is higher than the counter currency. Key Characteristics Swaps are calculated daily and automatically applied to open positions. They differ between long positions (buying a currency pair) and short positions (selling a currency pair). How is Swap Calculated in Forex? The swap rate depends on: Interest Rates : The difference between the interest rates of the two currencies in a pair. Trade Size : The larger the position, the higher the swap fee or credit. Broker’s Markup : Some brokers add additional charges to the swap rate. Swap Formula Swap Fee=Trade Size×(Interest Rate Difference)×Broker’s Commission\text{Swap Fee} = \text{Trade Size} \times (\text{Interest Rate Difference}) \times \text{Broker’s Commission} Swap Fee = Trade Size × ( Interest Rate Difference ) × Broker’s Commission Example of Swap in Forex Scenario 1: Positive Swap (Earned Interest) You buy EUR/USD and hold the position overnight. If the interest rate for EUR is higher than USD, you earn a positive swap. Scenario 2: Negative Swap (Paid Interest) You sell GBP/JPY and hold the position overnight. If the interest rate for GBP is lower than JPY, you pay a negative swap. Types of Swaps in Forex 1. Long Swap Applicable when holding a buy position overnight. Reflects the interest rate differential between the currencies. 2. Short Swap Applicable when holding a sell position overnight. Calculated based on the reverse interest rate differential. Factors Affecting Swap Rates Central Bank Policies : Changes in interest rates set by central banks directly affect swap rates. Market Conditions : Volatility and liquidity influence how brokers calculate swaps. Currency Pair : Exotic pairs often have higher swap rates due to greater volatility and interest rate differentials. How to Avoid or Minimize Swap Costs Use Swap-Free Accounts Many brokers offer Islamic accounts (swap-free accounts) for traders who do not want to incur swap charges due to religious beliefs. Close Trades Before Rollover Avoid holding positions overnight to eliminate swap fees. Choose Favorable Currency Pairs Trade pairs with a positive interest rate differential to earn swap credits. Plan Around Wednesday Swaps On Wednesdays, brokers often triple the swap fee to account for the weekend rollover. Advantages and Disadvantages of Swaps Advantages Earn Extra Income : Positive swaps add to profits when trading currency pairs with favorable interest rate differentials. Reflects Economic Fundamentals : Swap rates provide insights into the strength of different currencies. Disadvantages Added Costs : Negative swaps increase trading expenses, particularly for long-term positions. Complexity : Understanding and calculating swaps can be confusing for beginners. FAQs About Forex Swaps 1. What is a swap-free account? A swap-free account eliminates overnight interest charges, suitable for traders with religious restrictions or those avoiding extra costs. 2. When are swap fees applied? Swaps are applied at the end of each trading day, typically at 5 PM New York time . 3. Can swaps affect profitability? Yes, especially for long-term positions. Positive swaps can boost profits, while negative swaps can reduce earnings. 4. Are swaps the same for all brokers? No, swap rates vary between brokers based on their markup policies. 5. Do all currency pairs have swaps? Yes, but the rate varies depending on the currency pair and its interest rate differential. Conclusion Swaps play a vital role in Forex trading, influencing costs and profitability. By understanding how swaps work and adopting strategies to manage them, traders can minimize their impact on trading performance.

Early projects blending AI and blockchain, such as Fetch.ai or Ocean Protocol, helped pioneer the integration of these two emerging technologies by building systems that could automate real-world processes and allow data owners to monetize and share datasets securely. By demonstrating how blockchain and AI can complement one another, these early projects set the stage for future collaborations. You might also like: Put developers at the center of web3 | Opinion Once generative AI tools demonstrated their powerful capabilities and disruptive potential, the crypto and blockchain space began theorizing additional use cases. Web3 enthusiasts and developers quickly recognized the prospect of decentralized AI models, the possibility of automated and chatbot-powered crypto services, and numerous other innovative applications. While many of these conversations were dismissed as crypto hijacking a conversation through its characteristic overhyping, the integration of web3 and advanced AI systems is well underway. Nothing illustrates this more than CoinMarketCap dedicating a market capitalization category for “AI and Big Data tokens.” However, with 335 dedicated token projects focused on AI and Big Data, it’s now easier than ever to envision AI empowering crypto and decentralized finance to provide enhanced features and a better user experience, which could fuel mass adoption. A symbiotic relationship Web3 introduced the power of decentralization through blockchain technology, but the next internet iteration promises to take it a step further by integrating adaptive interfaces and AI-powered smart contracts. Web4, or the “symbiotic web,” smoothly blends blockchain and AI systems to create a more positive and safe user experience that could have major implications for web3 and beyond. Imagine a future where a user’s engagement with crypto and DeFi is personalized, secure, and ultra-responsive, transforming everything from staking and trading to digital asset management. The symbiotic web builds off of web3’s decentralized model, adding an AI layer to improve user interfaces, create smart contracts capable of adapting dynamically to user needs and changing market conditions, and provide enhanced security and privacy. This could introduce trading platforms that adjust to a user’s unique trading patterns, DeFi systems that anticipate one’s next move, and smart contracts that respond in real-time to market shifts. Potential DeFi benefits In the fast-paced DeFi environment, where quick and informed decisions provide a real edge, adaptive user interfaces that provide real-time data and tailored insights not only create a better user experience but could also hold the key to mainstream adoption. Since many novel investors find crypto and DeFi’s user experience unfriendly due to a high learning curve regarding complex systems and technical know-how, creating a better and more intuitive experience will help onboard more users. A personalized trading dashboard highlighting the most relevant metrics to a given user could reduce information clutter and simplify the trading experience, empowering users to act confidently with assets known to be volatile. Beyond real-time updates, the symbiotic web’s predictive AI could make crypto platforms even more proactive. For instance, a DeFi platform might anticipate a user’s need to make a particular transaction and present relevant insights or alerts regarding critical market movements in advance. This proactive approach could make crypto trading less reactive and more intuitive, minimizing response times and further enhancing the user experience. Enhanced smart contracts While smart contracts helped bring about the web3 revolution and enabled DeFi’s existence, they are occasionally vulnerable to faulty coding that has led to hackers stealing users’ funds. The symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain could potentially see smart contracts adapt to live market data and personalized insights, creating a new type of responsive, user-centric transaction that prioritizes efficiency and security. AI-enhanced smart contracts could create real-time adjustments on rates from a lending platform, allowing users to get notified when they reach a favorable position. This adaptability also benefits DeFi platforms by fostering an environment where transactions are optimized by both fairness and liquidity. On a crypto exchange, these responsive, AI-powered smart contracts could automatically adjust margins if volatility spikes, reducing exposure or pausing a transaction during unusually extreme market conditions. This could boost user confidence and security while assisting traders in navigating a volatile market with a complex investing process. Web4 privacy and security Considering the degree of hyper-personalized data introduced by web4, there will be a need for the highest standard of privacy and security. Fortunately, AI and blockchain also have the answer to this through data privacy algorithms and decentralized storage solutions. To secure web4, privacy protocols can constantly monitor data flows, encrypting information and leveraging decentralized storage capabilities to protect user data. Furthermore, web4 could empower users with real-time control, allowing them to easily adjust privacy settings on the go and receive alerts when their data is being accessed. This level of transparency and control will empower users to feel secure and confident that their personal information will be protected in a future where data will be increasingly valuable and vulnerable. While web4 is still only a concept, it has the potential to reshape the crypto landscape for the better. The symbiotic vision where blockchain and AI collaborate to put the user’s needs at the forefront will make crypto and DeFi more palatable for a broader segment of society. With its ability to provide real-time information, adapt, and make intuitive decisions across complex DeFi platforms, web4 could be the trigger that ushers in a more intelligent, adaptable, and safe digital environment.

Leverage Calculator Assesses the leverage needed to achieve a desired trade size. Compounding Calculator Projects account growth based on periodic returns and reinvestments. 1. Forex Position Size Calculator The Position Size Calculator is an indispensable tool for risk management in Forex trading. How It Works Inputs Needed : Account size (e.g., $10,000). Risk percentage per trade (e.g., 2%). Stop loss in pips (e.g., 50 pips). Output : Optimal lot size for the trade. Example If you have a $10,000 account and want to risk 2% per trade with a 50-pip stop loss, the calculator will determine the lot size to trade without exceeding your risk limit. 2. Risk and Reward Calculator The Risk Calculator helps assess potential loss and gain for a trade. Benefits Prevents over-leveraging. Helps maintain a consistent risk-to-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3). 3. Forex Pip Calculator The Pip Calculator converts pip movements into monetary values, allowing traders to understand the financial impact of price changes. How to Use Select the currency pair (e.g., EUR/USD). Enter the lot size (e.g., 1 standard lot = 100,000 units). Input the pip movement (e.g., 50 pips).

XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month alone, it surged 212.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. However, the past week saw a downturn with a 7.32% decline, indicating short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. Traders are watching these levels closely, as movements could signal significant shifts in market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has shown mixed movements recently. Over the past week, ETH has decreased by 2.68%. However, in the last month, it has climbed by 27.26%. Over the past six months, the price has increased by 10.87%. This indicates substantial growth over the longer term despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3643 and $4233. The 10-day simple moving average is $3873.26, and the 100-day SMA is $3883.85. The relative strength index stands at 55.00, suggesting neutral market sentiment. The stochastic oscillator is at 72.74, indicating that the asset is approaching overbought conditions. The MACD level is -1.149, which may signal a bearish trend. The nearest resistance level is at $4458. If ETH rises to this point from its current price, it would be an increase of about 13%. Breaking above this could lead to the second resistance at $5047, a rise of approximately 28%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3279, a decrease of about 17%. The second support level is at $2689, representing a drop of around 32%. These levels are important for traders watching for potential breakouts or reversals. Conclusion XRP and Ethereum show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) might lead this bull run by uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for massive growth.

42416978,f534a79c-4539-43ad-b5fc-bc0613c57109,1734350455,Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Tops $106K as New Accounting Rule Takes Effect,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  Imagine you have a rare collectible. It's aged like fine wine, but only shows the original price tag. That's how U.S. companies have been told to value their bitcoin ... stuck in the past instead of reflecting its true worth. As of today, that changes.  Yes, today is when the FASB fair value accounting rule, which passed in 2023, takes effect, allowing companies to report their bitcoin holdings at fair market value instead of the purchase price. The change gives firms more control over how they classify these assets and may accelerate corporate adoption. Note, though, the new standard doesn’t apply to NFTs, wrapped tokens or internally generated digital assets.  Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at The FXPro, said, quoting a JPMorgan report, that publicly traded companies have already begun implementing a MicroStrategy-like strategy to add BTC to their balance sheets.  The rule change might also explain why BTC spiked above $106,000 in Asia, boosted further by President-elect Donald Trump's assurance to create a strategic BTC reserve and a short squeeze on Deribit.  The price has now pulled back to around $104,500, probably due to concern the Fed's much anticipated rate cut this Wednesday will come with projections for fewer reductions next year. BTC is trading at a discount on Coinbase compared with Binance, a sign of weaker demand in the U.S., a CryptoQuant tracker shows.  Looking more broadly, ETH failed to establish a foothold above $4,000 amid reports of large withdrawals of staked ether from Lido Finance. Payments-focused XRP traded more than 2% lower, weakening a bullish technical pattern. Ripple CTO David Schwartz raised concerns about FOMO-driven volatility before the debut of the company’s RLUSD stablecoin, which it plans to use for cross-border payments alongside XRP. Early price fluctuations and high pre-launch bids don’t quite reflect the true market value, Schwartz said.   On a brighter note, Solana's industry-beating revenue generation has been grabbing eyeballs. Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, said: ""Solana generated a staggering $431 million in fees over the past 30 days – more than all other Layer 1s combined!"" Solana now captures 53% of the global layer 1 fee pool, largely driven by the surge in AI activity. Still, the token dipped 3%, threatening to break below the 50-day SMA, a key indicator for near-term market trends.  Chainlink’s LINK defied the weakness in major tokens, rising 4% thanks to whale buying. Data from LookOnChain revealed that a whale withdrew 429,999 LINK, worth over $12 million, over the weekend.  Lastly, in traditional markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note looks to break out of a prolonged downtrend as observers anticipate a hawkish Fed rate cut this week. This hardening of yields could inject volatility into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. So, stay alert!  What to Watch  Crypto:  Dec. 18: CleanSpark (CLSK) Q4 FY 2024 earnings.

Revenue for the year is now around $355 million, making it the second-largest decentralized application by that metric. Only collateralized-debt protocol Sky is bigger.  The numbers belie a slowdown in the industry. Pump.fun has dropped its livestream feature and the memecoin craze has eased.  That comes through in the number of active addresses using the platform, which has dropped nearly 50% from its peak, as did trading volumes and fees. Daily revenue, which on Nov. 18 topped $2 million for the first time, is now struggling to reclaim the $1 million threshold. It was $585,000 on Dec. 15.  Even so, activity on the DEX remains elevated. Daily transactions on Raydium still hover between 10 million and 12.5 million, exploding from just over 1 million at the beginning of the year. The protocol’s native token RAY also hasn’t suffered, having risen 7% in the past month to remain above the $5 support zone.  Derivatives Positioning  The futures basis for BTC and ETH has climbed to levels we saw during the initial breakthrough of $100,000, making cash and carry trades increasingly attractive. Expect continued strong inflows into the spot ETFs as a result.  AAVE's perpetual open interest has increased 7% in 24 hours, the most among major coins. The cumulative volume delta (CVD), however, has declined, indicating net selling pressure in the market.   Looking at BTC options expiries extending to Jan. 31, we’re seeing calls trading at less than a 2.5 volatility premium to puts, a decline from last week's 4-5 premium. It seems traders aren't jumping on the latest surge to record highs quite as eagerly. It's similar in ETH options.   Notable traders include a BTC bull call spread involving $115,000 and $125,000 strikes expiring Jan. 31 and a large short position in ETH $4,100 call expiring on Dec. 20.

The MicroStrategy shares’ price is also rising as the market reacts to news that the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ) is set for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index. While the MSTR stock trades below its recent peak above $543, the pre-market surge on Dec. 16 has the MicroStrategy shares above $430. Ahead of the upcoming listing as part of Nasdaq 100, sentiment in the BTC-focused business intelligence and software company is highly bullish. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge In the announcement last Friday, Nasdaq disclosed MSTR’s inclusion in the 100 index takes effect on Dec. 23. Buying pressure that comes with the listing, often as funds scoop the new component, could fuel further gains for MicroStrategy’s price. MSTR has exploded in the past year as the surging BTC helps catalyze upside momentum for crypto stocks. MicroStrategy, which has and continues to inspire adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury for publicly-listed companies, first added the flagship cryptocurrency to its balance sheet in 2020. Since then, the Michael Saylor-led company has acquired a staggering 423,650 BTC for approximately $25.6 billion. The total holdings average purchase price is $60,324 per bitcoin and was valued at roughly $42.3 billion with Bitcoin price above $100k. Notably, the benchmark cryptocurrency has reached a new ATH of over $106k after the latest leg up. Pro-crypto comments from President-elect Donald Trump helped buoy bulls.

Its annualized performance stood at 124%, compared to 64% for Bitcoin, 15% for the S&P 500 and 10% for real estate. In this period, and as of Dec. 13, safe haven asset gold had an annualized return of just 7%. Meanwhile, bonds stood at -5%. Founder and Chairman Michael Saylor, who sees Bitcoin as ‘digital property’, shared this performance on X. On July 3, 2002, $MSTR stock fell to an all-time low of $0.42.

Solana whales are going insane with potential institutional accumulation as Dogecoin continues with bullish price action. As all this is unfolding, investors have their eyes on Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a new viral presale token prepped to take over the play-to-earn (P2E) scene. Yeti Ouro early investors are enjoying gains as they enter stage 2 of presale. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Whale Activity Points To Expansion On-chain data indicates that large investors hold SOL through the latest massive transactions. This trend suggests whales find great promise in Solana’s environment, which features high-speed transactions and low costs. 1-month Solana price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The recent increase in SOL price comes from its growing utility in DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This has made the network a strong competitor to Ethereum, attracting many developers and projects. According to analysts, whale accumulation is also viewed as long-term confidence for Solana to secure its position as a leader in blockchain technology. Dogecoin Price Analysis : Bullish Movement Observed DogeCoin (DOGE), the first meme coin, displays bullish price rally signals. Seeing the rising demand in the market, DOGE price targets $0.50, according to various analyses in the short term. Dogecoin is known for its involvement in social media buzz and renewed community engagement. 1-month Dogecoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Recently, excitement has been rekindled following the potential integration of Dogecoin into Elon Musk's projects, including Twitter payments. Investors have expressed optimism about DOGE's unique position in mainstream adoption, with the token's increasing use cases lending credence to its bullish outlook. Dogecoin may be primed for a major breakout as the year ends. Next Big Thing: Yeti Ouro Presale While Solana is pumping whales and Dogecoin is running up, Yeti Ouro is turning heads in the investment community. Yeti Ouro’s presale has already crossed $1.15 million in raised funds. Having entered stage two of presale now, early investors are enjoying 40% gains. This P2E-focused token is set to wreak havoc in the metaverse as the next big thing in blockchain gaming. The unique selling point of Yeti Ouro is its integration with an unreal engine-powered P2E game called Yeti Go, which is said to offer chaotic yet engaging gameplay. Yeti Ouro provides genuine utility in the game, such as staking rewards, token burns, and an in-game marketplace. These functionalities pick YETIO apart from the rest of the crypto coin pack — ensuring YETIO will have value far beyond speculation!

Yeti Ouro employs features different from the model and a well-defined roadmap, making the P2E model a very lucrative market.

Conclusion Solana whale action and Bullish Dogecoin momentum suggest that there are still plenty of opportunities in the crypto market. Yeti Ouro's presale isn't just another presale; it's an opportunity to buy into a token with legitimate utility and the potential to grow exponentially. With Solana gaining traction amongst institutions and Dogecoin further strengthening its community-driven appeal, Yeti Ouro is staking its claim within the P2E ecosystem.

37713896,https://crypto.news/?p=14319720,1734350342,"$300m of other tokens bridged to Solana in the last week, why?","Over the last week, a significant amount of cryptocurrency movement involved tokens from various blockchains being bridged to Solana, including over $200 million worth of Ethereum. This included assets from Ethereum ( ETH ), BNB Chain ( BNB ), and others, as evidenced by posts on X and web data indicating a total of over $300 million, according to data from deBridge Finance. https://twitter.com/solanafloor/status/1868590987154538921?s=61&t=Goh7F7TZjoAVMq_tusVLpw Based on total-value-locked, bridge tokens allow for the act of locking an original token on a native blockchain, then minting or unlocking an equivalent token on Solana ( SOL ). Often termed as “wrapped” tokens, e.g., wETH for Ethereum on Solana, bridging allows for interoperability between different blockchains. One reason for the increased activity maybe diversification, alternative strategies and/or applications not being confined to one blockchain’s limitations. In the case of the recent influx of tokens into Solana, this could include some recent speed updates that raise block limits, the advent of 120 millisecond blocktimes, as well as some feature upgrades that make the blockchain appealing to investors. You might also like: Robinhood Europe debuts 5% APY Solana staking Other than speed and efficiency, lower transaction fees on Solana compared to Ethereum may be driving the surge. In addition, investors may be attracted to Solana’s DeFi staking and yield ecosystem, which offers more attractive returns compared to similar opportunities on Ethereum. In contrast to Ethereum, Solana utilizes a combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of History, allowing for high transaction throughout. Staking on Solana can yield about 7% APR, higher than Ethereum due to its inflation rate and lower total staked supply. Moreover, Solana’s native staking is less liquid than Ethereum’s post-Shanghai, but liquid staking protocols like Marinade Finance or Jito provide liquidity through tokens like mSOL or JitoSOL. In sum, while Solana’s significantly lower fees make yield farming more viable for smaller investors compared to Ethereum, where high gas fees can eat into profits, other investors may lean more towards Ethereum based on volatility and it’s battle tested protocols, as well as Ethereum’s more established smart contracts and dApps.

37717256,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/better-buy-in-2025-lightchain-ai-dogecoin-or-bitcoin,1734350110,"Better Buy in 2025 Lightchain AI, Dogecoin, or Bitcoin?","In recent years, the world of cryptocurrency has exploded in popularity and value. With Bitcoin leading the way as the most well-known and valuable cryptocurrency, others like Dogecoin have gained attention with their unique branding and growing market cap. However, a new competitor is emerging in the form of Lightchain A I - a blockchain platform that aims to revolutionize industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics through its innovative technology. As we look ahead to 2025, many are wondering which of these three cryptocurrencies will be the better buy. In this article, we will delve into the potential of each coin and discuss their strengths and weaknesses to help you make an informed decision on where to invest your money. Why Invest In These Cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their decentralized nature and potential for high returns. Unlike traditional currency, they are not controlled by any government or financial institution, making them immune to inflation and other economic factors. Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Lightchain AI all offer unique advantages that make them attractive investment options. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage and is widely accepted as a form of payment. Dogecoin's lighthearted branding appeals to a younger demographic and has gained a loyal following. Lightchain AI's innovative technology shows promise for real-world applications and could disrupt multiple industries. Plus, with the growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrency, the potential for high returns is a major draw for investors. The Potential of Lightchain Ai Lightchain AI bridges the gap between blockchain and artificial intelligence through its groundbreaking PoI consensus mechanism, incentivizing AI tasks over traditional mining or staking. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) provides a high-performance environment for executing complex AI computations with enhanced privacy and security. Lightchain AI decentralizes governance, allowing communities to shape the platform’s future while ensuring fairness and transparency. The platform prioritizes privacy-preserving methods like federated learning and zero-knowledge proofs, making it a robust solution for decentralized AI. Its scalability strategies, including sharding and Layer 2 solutions, enable seamless handling of real-time workloads. Lightchain AI is a pioneering step toward decentralized, community-driven AI innovation. Bitcoin The Safe-Haven Asset for Stability and Long-Term Gains Bitcoin has recently been considered a potential safe-haven asset, akin to gold, due to its decentralized nature and limited supply. In December 2024, Bitcoin's price surpassed $100,000, fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency stance and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have facilitated mainstream investment. However, Bitcoin's volatility remains a concern. Analysts advise caution, recommending that investors limit Bitcoin exposure to a small percentage of their portfolios to manage risk effectively. While Bitcoin offers potential for long-term gains, its status as a stable safe-haven asset is still debated. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before allocating funds to Bitcoin. Dogecoin Meme Power, Community Hype, and Potential Volatility Dogecoin, created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, has experienced significant volatility influenced by community enthusiasm and high-profile endorsements. In December 2024, large investors, known as whales, accumulated approximately 130 billion DOGE, signaling potential bullish trends. Despite this, Dogecoin's price declined by nearly 19% after reaching a three-year high of $0.48, highlighting its inherent volatility. Analysts advise caution, noting that while community support and celebrity endorsements can drive short-term gains, Dogecoin's lack of intrinsic value and reliance on market sentiment contribute to its unpredictable nature. Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before considering exposure to such volatile assets. Lightchain AI Innovative Technology Driving Future Growth Lightchain AI is a groundbreaking platform that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to address critical challenges in scalability, transparency, and fairness. Its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism replaces traditional validation methods by rewarding nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, such as model training and optimization. At its core, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) provides a secure, efficient environment for executing AI-specific tasks while ensuring privacy through technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and federated learning. Lightchain AI also decentralizes governance, empowering token holders to shape the ecosystem collaboratively. With a robust roadmap focusing on scalability, cross-chain integration, and open-source innovation, Lightchain AI is set to drive transformative growth across industries worldwide. Key Metrics to Compare Lightchain AI, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin As of December 2024, the cryptocurrency market has experienced significant developments across various assets. Market Capitalization Bitcoin (BTC) The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached a market capitalization of approximately $1.8 trillion, solidifying its dominance in the digital asset space. Dogecoin (DOGE) Initially created as a meme coin, Dogecoin's market cap stands at around $59.47 billion, reflecting its substantial community support and speculative interest. Lightchain AI (LCAI) A newer entrant, Lightchain AI focuses on integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its market capitalization is currently unavailable, as the token is in its presale phase. Trading Volume Bitcoin Maintains a robust average daily trading volume exceeding $40 billion, indicating high liquidity and investor interest. Dogecoin Exhibits a daily trading volume of approximately $9.40 billion, showcasing active trading activity. Lightchain AI Specific trading volume data is not yet available due to its presale status. Price Performance Bitcoin Achieved an all-time high of $103,900 on December 5, 2024, driven by favorable regulatory developments and increased institutional adoption. Dogecoin Despite a 350% surge in 2024, Dogecoin trades below its 2021 peak, with current prices around $0.40. Lightchain AI In its presale phase, LCAI tokens are offered at $0.003, with projections suggesting potential value increases upon official launch These metrics highlight the diverse trajectories and investor interests within the cryptocurrency market as of December 2024. Market Trends Likely to Shape Each Asset’s Performance in 2025 While cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction and mainstream acceptance, various market trends are likely to determine each asset's performance in 2025. Firstly, regulatory developments will have a significant impact. As governments worldwide seek to regulate cryptocurrencies, favorable or unfavorable decisions can greatly influence market sentiment and prices. Secondly, the adoption of blockchain technology in various industries is expected to increase demand for tokens like Lightchain AI, which focuses on integrating AI with decentralized technologies. Additionally, institutional investors' involvement and traditional financial institutions' integration of cryptocurrencies into their services could also positively impact Bitcoin's performance. On the other hand, Dogecoin's reliance on community hype and speculative interest may lead to potential price volatility based on social media trends. Why Lightchain AI Could Be the Most Profitable Bet for 2025 Lightchain AI is emerging as a promising investment for 2025, integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence to address challenges like scalability and privacy. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enable efficient AI computations within a decentralized framework. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI offers tokens at $0.003, presenting an accessible entry point for early investors. Analysts project that, with successful ecosystem expansion, the token could reach $1 by the end of 2024 and potentially $5 by early 2025, indicating substantial returns. Its broad applicability across industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance enhances its growth potential, making Lightchain AI a compelling option for those seeking exposure to the evolving AI and blockchain sectors. Why BTC And DOGE May Be Less Appealing for Long-Term Investment Bitcoin and Dogecoin have undoubtedly made significant gains in recent years, attracting investor interest with their meteoric price increases. However, there are several key factors that could make them less appealing for long-term investment. Firstly, Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market may diminish as other innovative projects emerge and gain traction. This could lead to a potential decrease in its value and impact on overall market sentiment. Similarly, Dogecoin's reliance on community hype and speculative interest may not be sustainable in the long term. As seen with past pump-and-dump schemes, sudden drops in prices can significantly affect investor confidence and potentially lead to significant losses. Furthermore, both BTC and DOGE have slower transaction speeds compared to Lightchain AI, which utilizes advanced technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and federated learning to ensure speedy transactions while maintaining privacy. This could limit their potential for mass adoption and hinder their long-term growth prospects. Choosing the Best Investment for the Upcoming Bull Run In the highly volatile and evolving cryptocurrency market, choosing the right investment can be a daunting task. However, by considering key metrics like market capitalization, trading volume, and price performance, as well as examining market trends and potential for growth, investors can make informed decisions. While Bitcoin and Dogecoin may continue to hold their positions as two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025, Lightchain AI's focus on scalability, cross-chain integration, and open-source innovation makes it a compelling option for those seeking exposure to the fast-growing AI and blockchain sectors. With its promising Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism and potential for widespread adoption across industries, Lightchain AI could potentially offer profitable returns in the upcoming bull run with its presale and the official launch, making it a top contender for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. So, consider adding Lightchain AI to your investment portfolio today and stay ahead of the game in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37713729,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110538,1734349934,Master Forex Risk Management: Tools and Strategies for Success,"Forex risk management is an essential aspect of trading that ensures your capital remains protected while pursuing profits. By using tools like a Forex risk calculator and applying sound risk management strategies, traders can minimize losses and sustain long-term success. This guide covers the basics of Forex risks, how to calculate your risk, and proven management strategies to safeguard your trading account. What is Forex Risk? Forex risk refers to the potential for financial loss in currency trading due to market fluctuations, leverage, or other factors. Managing these risks is crucial to avoid significant losses, especially in a highly volatile market. Types of Forex Risks Market Risk : Price fluctuations in currency pairs. Leverage Risk : Amplified losses due to high leverage ratios. Liquidity Risk : Challenges in executing trades during low-volume periods. Interest Rate Risk : Changes in interest rates impacting currency values. Political/Economic Risk : Events like elections, geopolitical tensions, or economic instability affecting currencies. Forex Risk Calculator: A Must-Have Tool A Forex risk calculator helps traders determine the appropriate position size and potential loss for a trade based on their risk tolerance. Inputs for a Risk Calculator Account Size : Total capital available for trading. Risk Percentage : Percentage of capital you’re willing to risk per trade (e.g., 1–3%). Stop Loss (Pips) : Distance between your entry point and stop-loss order. Currency Pair : The exchange rate of the pair being traded. Output The calculator provides the optimal lot size and potential monetary loss , ensuring you stay within your risk limits. Example of Risk Calculation Parameters Values Account Size $10,000 Risk Percentage 2% Stop Loss 50 pips Currency Pair (EUR/USD) Exchange rate = 1.1000 Calculation Risk Amount : 2% of $10,000 = $200. Lot Size : The risk amount divided by the pip value. Lot Size=Risk AmountPip Value\text{Lot Size} = \frac{\text{Risk Amount}}{\text{Pip Value}} Lot Size = Pip Value Risk Amount ​ For EUR/USD, the pip value for a standard lot is $10. Lot Size=20050×10=0.4 lots.\text{Lot Size} = \frac{200}{50 \times 10} = 0.4 \text{ lots.} Lot Size = 50 × 10200 ​ = 0.4 lots. Forex Risk Management Strategies Effective Forex risk management involves setting clear rules and adhering to them throughout your trading journey. 1. Set a Risk Percentage Per Trade Limit risk to 1–3% of your total account balance for each trade. 2. Use Stop Loss Orders Place stop-loss orders to cap potential losses and protect against market volatility. 3. Diversify Your Trades Avoid overexposing your portfolio to a single currency pair or market condition. 4. Avoid Overleveraging Use leverage wisely, as higher leverage increases the risk of significant losses. 5. Monitor Risk-to-Reward Ratios Maintain a favorable risk-to-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) to ensure profits outweigh potential losses. Forex Risk Management Tools Risk Calculators Tools to determine position size, potential loss, and trade risk. Trading Journals Track trades and analyze performance to refine strategies. Economic Calendars Stay informed about upcoming events that may impact currency markets. Volatility Indicators Use tools like ATR (Average True Range) to gauge market volatility. Tips for Effective Risk Management in Forex Stick to Your Plan : Emotional trading often leads to poor decisions. Start Small : Begin with smaller lot sizes to minimize initial risks. Regularly Review Performance : Assess and adapt your strategy based on past results. Keep Learning : Stay updated with market trends and trading techniques. FAQs About Forex Risks and Management 1. What is a Forex risk calculator? A tool that calculates potential loss, position size, and lot size based on account size, risk percentage, and stop loss. 2. What is the safest risk percentage for Forex trading? Most traders recommend risking 1–2% of your total account balance per trade. 3. Can you trade Forex without taking risks? Trading inherently involves risk, but effective management can minimize it. 4. How does leverage increase Forex risk? Leverage magnifies both potential gains and losses, increasing the stakes for each trade. 5. Why is stop loss important in Forex? Stop loss limits potential losses, ensuring that a single trade doesn’t wipe out your account. Conclusion Managing risks in Forex trading is vital for long-term success. By using tools like the Forex risk calculator and implementing robust risk management strategies, you can protect your capital, make informed decisions, and trade with confidence.

Why These Coins Could Change Your Portfolio Forever,"Cryptocurrency has become a buzzword in today's financial market, and for good reason. With the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, many investors have been able to reap significant profits. However, if you missed out on these opportunities, don't worry - there are still plenty of other cryptocurrencies with immense potential. One such project is Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a top project that has garnered attention for its innovative approach to blockchain technology. In this article, we will delve into some lesser-known cryptocurrencies that could potentially give you 1000X returns on your investment. These coins have unique features and partnerships that set them apart from others in the market. We'll explore how they work and why they have caught the attention of investors worldwide. So buckle up and get ready to learn about some of the hottest cryptos with exponential growth potential. What Is 1000X Potential? Before we jump into discussing specific cryptocurrencies, let's first understand what 1000X potential means. Simply put, it refers to the possibility of a cryptocurrency's value increasing by 1000 times its current price. This may seem like an unrealistic goal, but with the right market conditions and a strong project behind it, it is certainly possible. However, keep in mind that investing in any cryptocurrency involves risk - there is no guarantee that you will see such astronomical returns. It's important to do your own research and make informed decisions when it comes to investing. Plus, it's worth noting that returns like these usually occur over a longer period of time, so patience is key. With that said, let's take a look at some of the cryptos with the potential to achieve 1000X growth. Top Cryptocurrencies with 1000X Potential There are several cryptocurrencies that have shown tremendous growth potential and could potentially see 1000X returns in the future. Some of these include. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Lightchain AI is a cutting-edge platform combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering innovative solutions for modern industries. Its native token, LCAI, is currently in the presale phase , priced at $0.003 per token. Market analysts are optimistic about its growth potential, with some estimates suggesting LCAI could reach $12 by 2024. This would represent an extraordinary return on investment, making it a project to watch closely. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink operates as a decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data. As of December 15, 2024, LINK is trading at approximately $25.50, boasting a market capitalization of around $12 billion. Price predictions for LINK vary, but many analysts are forecasting a rise to $35 by the end of 2025. This potential growth is fueled by increasing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and the expanding utility of Chainlink’s oracle technology. Terra (LUNA) Terra is a blockchain protocol that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to power price-stable global payments, revolutionizing the way transactions occur. As of December 15, 2024, LUNA is priced at about $85.00, with an impressive market cap of approximately $30 billion. Future projections for LUNA are optimistic, with some experts predicting it could climb to $120 by 2025. This anticipated growth is supported by the expansion of its ecosystem and rising demand for stablecoins in global markets. Worldcoin (WLD) Worldcoin is a groundbreaking digital currency project aiming to provide universal basic income through cryptocurrency distribution. As of December 15, 2024, WLD is trading at around $2.50, with a market capitalization nearing $500 million. Analysts have varied predictions for WLD’s future price. Some forecasts suggest it could reach $5 by 2025, contingent on successful implementation of its vision and widespread adoption of its platform worldwide. Mina Protocol (MINA) Mina Protocol is a lightweight blockchain designed to minimize computational requirements for running decentralized applications, making blockchain technology more accessible. As of December 15, 2024, MINA is valued at approximately $3.20, with a market cap of $1.5 billion. Price forecasts for MINA are promising, with projections suggesting it could climb to $6 by 2025. This growth potential is driven by its innovative technology and the possibility of forming strategic partnerships to further expand its reach. Why These Coins Have the Potential to Transform Your Portfolio There are several factors that make these cryptocurrencies stand out in the market and position them for potential 1000X growth . These include. Unique features Each of these coins has unique features that set them apart from others in the market, making them valuable assets with significant potential for growth. Strong partnerships Many of these projects have formed strategic partnerships with well-established companies and institutions, providing them with a solid foundation for long-term growth. Growing adoption As the world becomes more familiar with cryptocurrency and its potential uses, the demand for these coins is expected to increase. This could lead to significant price appreciation in the future. Innovative technology These coins utilize innovative technologies that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries and drive widespread adoption, leading to significant growth in their value. Why Lightchain AI (LCAI) Is A Standout Project While all of the coins mentioned have potential for exponential growth, Lightchain AI (LCAI) stands out as a project with great promise. Its unique combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology has the potential to transform several industries, making it highly sought after by investors. Furthermore, its low presale price just 0.003 per token makes it an attractive option for those looking to invest in a potential 1000X growth cryptocurrency without breaking the bank. Of course, as with any investment, there are risks involved and thorough research is always recommended before making any investment decisions. Plus, with the crypto market constantly evolving and new projects emerging, there is always the possibility for other coins to enter this list of potential 1000X growth cryptocurrencies . It's important to stay informed and keep an eye on market trends to identify these opportunities as they arise. With a solid understanding of the crypto space and careful consideration, you could potentially benefit from investing in these high-potential cryptocurrencies. Making Strategic Investments for Life-Changing Returns Investing in cryptocurrencies with 1000X potential is a high-risk, high-reward venture. However, for those willing to take the risk and do their due diligence, the potential returns could be life-changing. These coins mentioned are just a few examples of projects that have shown promise and have the potential for significant growth in the future. Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a standout project with its unique combination of AI and blockchain technology, but there are many others out there worth considering. As always, it's important to research and understand a project before making any investment decisions. So stay informed, keep an eye on market trends, and make wise investment choices for a better financial future. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Despite the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and breakout from the consolidation range, the sudden loss of momentum in the PEPE rally has resulted in price compression. This indicates a potential for increased volatility in the near term.Currently, the PEPE coin is trading at $0.00002389, marking a 4% drop over the past 24 hours. This decline has undermined the recovery from last night.PEPE Price AnalysisAmid increasing pressures, the PEPE coin price is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. As the price approaches the apex of the triangle, the meme coin appears to be preparing for a breakout that could set a decisive trend in motion. PEPE price chart Currently, PEPE's price is testing the local support trendline. Furthermore, the MACD and signal lines are struggling to maintain a positive trend, as the bearish candle signals a potential merger. This suggests a possible bearish crossover with a new wave of negative candles.According to the pivot levels, overhead resistance aligns with the center pivot level at $0.00002472. A breakout above this level would mark a key turning point for the PEPE coin price.Thus, PEPE must maintain a strong close above this critical level to trigger a decisive bullish rally. Successfully doing so would confirm short-term bullish dominance.This would also break the lower-high formation on the 4-hour chart. Conversely, a failure to break bullishly could see PEPE fall toward the local support trendline near $0.00002310.Triangle Breakout Targets for PEPEIn case of a bullish breakout, the crucial resistance levels for PEPE are at the R1 and R2 resistance pivot levels, $0.00002780 and $0.00003144, respectively.However, in case of a breakdown, the nearest support level is the S1 pivot level at $0.00002107. In such a case, traders should remain cautious as the downside risks become significant.

37715984,https://invezz.com/?p=2388775,1734349694,"SHIB, DOGE well positioned for bull run profits; viral coin at $0.15 expected to yield 32x gains in 6 weeks","The meme coin market is gaining momentum again as SHIB and DOGE indicate a potential bull run. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS) is also generating news for its aggressive growth targets and quick presale development. Here is what to expect from these coins. Rexas Finance at $0.15: expected to yield 32x gains in 6 weeks With each RXS token valued at $0.15, up from $0.03 three months ago, Rexas Finance (RXS) had a remarkable 400% increase during its presale as it progressed to Stage 10. Selling 336 million tokens, the presale attracted an amazing $26.6 million. With the price predicted to rise once more to $0.175 in the next stage, RXS is on track to yield large profits to early investors, with stage 10 already selling out fast. Rexas Finance is retargeting real-world asset (RWA) tokenization by providing a platform for tokenizing high-value assets, including real estate, commodities, and art. It advances openness, lowers transaction costs, and increases asset liquidity through smart contracts and blockchain technologies. Rexas is getting ready to play in a $500 trillion global asset market with the RXS token as the core of its ecosystem. Key features in the extensive, user-friendly Rexas Finance ecosystem include: Rexas Token Builder is a no-code platform that simplifies the tokenization process. Rexas QuickMint Bot is a mobile-first program that allows users to mint tokens using Telegram and Discord. Rexas AI Shield improves smart contract security by ensuring safe transactions and protecting user investments. Rexas Treasury is a multichain yield optimizer that automates yield farming and reinvestment processes. Recent advancements include its listing on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, raising its market visibility. Certik audit completion assures the platform’s security and compliance, boosting investor confidence. Rexas Finance is also running a $1 million giveaway, whereby the top 20 entries get $50,000 in RXS tokens. With analysts anticipating a 32x rise in the next six weeks as the presale gathers momentum, the project is projected to list on at least three of the top 10 crypto exchanges at $0.20 per RXS. SHIB: well positioned for bull run profits Shiba Inu’s burn rate has surged by more than 1000%, drastically lowering its available circulation. The recent week’s burning of more than 2.44 billion SHIB tokens leaves just 589.25 trillion in circulation. This deflationary approach has given holders hope that SHIB will experience a price rise soon. Shiba Inu is still the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization despite a recent 9% drop in price to $0.000027; analysts estimate a possible 100% increase once the burn rate stabilizes and the market catches up with the lower supply. Additionally, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer 2 network, is quite famous. Over two million wallet addresses on the platform in just sixteen months point to growing confidence in its ecosystem. Shiba Inu is positioned to increase its market share with the launch of its SHIFU token and continuous improvements like Shiboshis NFTs on Shibarium, particularly as new upgrades and products generate additional interaction. DOGE: well positioned for bull run profits Despite recent market declines, Dogecoin (DOGE) has had an amazing year, increasing more than 290% from $0.09 to its current price of $0.4. Analysts are optimistic about the future of DOGE, estimating that if market conditions align, the meme coin could reach $18. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently said that we are “very early” in the DOGE bull cycle once significant resistance is passed and might provide rather large gains. Other analysts, including Bluntz Capital, predict DOGE will shortly surpass its $0.50 resistance level, producing a “violent” upward advance and maybe surpassing Bitcoin in the last months of the bull market. DOGE’s capacity to leverage its brand and community and ongoing market demand positions it well for growth. Investors are keenly monitoring Dogecoin as it reaches its next significant resistance level; analysts estimate a big price rise once this barrier is removed. Both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are set for a bull run that might pay out handsomely, so the meme coin market is getting hot. Rexas Finance presents a fascinating opportunity for those seeking high-growth projects. Given its market scope worth multi-trillion dollars and forthcoming listings on prestigious exchanges, RXS is likely to create large profits. Rexas will be very important in this transformational field as the economy moves toward decentralized finance and RWA tokenization.

Legislation will be put in place to prohibit public offers of crypto, building on the U.K.'s promotion rules that prevent unregistered crypto firms from reaching out to U.K. clients. Only crypto asset trading platforms and offers qualifying for exemptions may not be subject to this.   CoinDesk reached out to the Treasury for input on whether or not this only applies to regulated companies as the FCA could not comment on this.  The paper asks for industry input on its market admission and disclosures as well as market abuse regime and is one of many more papers to come from the regulator as it prepares for its crypto regime.  The FCA is the U.K.'s regulator in charge of overseeing financial activities in the country including crypto. It has been watching over the sector and seeing how it will comply with its money laundering rules since 2020 but it plans to put in place a new regime in 2026 following the implementation of draft regulation that is coming out next year.  It will need industry feedback on how it can ensure consumers have the necessary information to make informed decisions as well as on their plans to reduce fraud via the market abuse regime.

37713384,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/solana-vs-lightchain-which-ethereum-alternative-offers-the-best-opportunity-for-a-28860-return-in-the-next-bull-run,1734349380,Solana vs Lightchain Which Ethereum Alternative Offers the Best Opportunity for a 28860% Return in the Next Bull Run?,"As the crypto market prepares for the next bull run, investors are turning their attention to promising Ethereum alternatives like Solana (SOL) and Lightchain AI (LCAI). Among these, the Lightchain AI Presale stands out as an exciting opportunity, offering early access to LCAI tokens at just $0.003. With groundbreaking technology and predictions of a potential 28,860% return, this presale is capturing the spotlight. Solana remains a top contender in blockchain scalability, known for its ultra-fast transactions and low fees. On the other hand, Lightchain AI is redefining the space with its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These advancements combine the power of blockchain and AI to fuel cutting-edge decentralized applications. While both tokens present strong growth potential, LCAI’s revolutionary approach and early entry advantage could give it the edge. Understanding the Need for Ethereum Alternatives Ethereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, faces persistent challenges such as high gas fees, network congestion, and scalability limitations. These issues have created a demand for alternative blockchain platforms that offer faster, more cost-effective, and scalable solutions. Developers and investors are increasingly exploring innovative ecosystems that address these pain points without compromising security and decentralization. Ethereum’s limitations, especially during peak usage, highlight the need for platforms capable of handling next-generation applications, from DeFi to NFTs. Alternatives like Solana and Lightchain AI are emerging as strong contenders, each leveraging unique technologies to attract users and investors seeking better performance and long-term growth. Solana’s Unique Selling Points Solana stands out as one of the fastest and most cost-efficient blockchain platforms, offering unparalleled scalability with its proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism. This innovation allows Solana to process over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining minimal fees, making it an ideal choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and high-frequency trading platforms. Its growing ecosystem includes a robust presence in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, with major projects and partnerships reinforcing its adoption. Solana's architecture supports seamless scalability without compromising security, appealing to developers and enterprises alike. However, challenges such as occasional network outages and centralization concerns remain. Despite this, Solana continues to lead as a high-performance blockchain, attracting significant investor attention and a thriving community of developers. Lightchain AI (LCAII) In contrast, Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain and AI landscape with its innovative technologies. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI tasks like model training and optimization, promoting collaboration and driving network security. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) layer offers real-time execution capabilities while maintaining interoperability with popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Lightchain AI addresses Ethereum’s limitations by creating a dedicated ecosystem for decentralized AI applications that prioritize speed, scalability, privacy, and inclusivity. The early entry advantage through its presale presents an attractive opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of this revolutionary project. As the hype around altcoins continues to grow, Lightchain AI’s potential for long-term growth and disruptive impact make it a top contender in the race towards mainstream adoption. With Solana and Lightchain AI leading the way, Ethereum alternatives are set to transform the blockchain landscape for years to come. Comparing Solana (SOL) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) Solana (SOL) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) represent two innovative alternatives to Ethereum, each leveraging unique technologies to address blockchain scalability and usability. Solana is renowned for its high throughput, processing over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) at low costs, enabled by its proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism. Its ecosystem boasts strong adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, supported by vibrant developer activity. However, concerns about network outages and centralization persist. On the other hand, Lightchain AI (LCAI) introduces groundbreaking advancements like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), merging blockchain with AI for automated scalability and efficiency. Unlike Solana, LCAI focuses heavily on integrating AI-driven solutions into decentralized applications, targeting diverse industries such as healthcare and finance. While Solana benefits from an established presence, Lightchain AI offers early investment opportunities through its presale, positioning itself for exponential growth with unique technological innovation and untapped market potential. Does Their Potential Match the Hype? Both Solana and Lightchain AI present strong value propositions for investors and developers, tapping into the growing demand for blockchain scalability and usability. With its established ecosystem, Solana has already attracted significant investment and adoption, making it a popular choice among developers. However, Lightchain AI's revolutionary approach and early entry advantage put it in an intriguing position for long-term growth and disruptive impact in the blockchain landscape. As with any emerging technology, there are risks involved, particularly with newer projects like LCAI. However, given their unique technologies and potential for widespread adoption, Solana and Lightchain AI have solid foundations to fulfill their hype and become leading alternatives to Ethereum. In the end, only time will tell which platform emerges as the ultimate winner in this race towards mainstream adoption. Calculating the Potential for 28860% Returns Calculating the potential for a 28,860% return requires analyzing market factors like adoption rates, use cases, and initial valuation. Solana achieved massive growth in the last bull run, driven by its low transaction fees, developer adoption, and thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Its surge from a modest valuation to a multi-billion-dollar market cap demonstrated how innovative platforms can deliver exponential returns. Lightchain AI (LCAI) offers a similar trajectory, starting at a presale price of $0.003, combined with advanced features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and AI Virtual Machine (AIVM). Its focus on AI-powered scalability and integration into high-growth sectors positions it for rapid adoption. Early-stage investments, particularly in projects like LCAI, hold immense potential for extraordinary gains. Key Risks to Consider of Solana and Lightchain AI Solana's Risks Centralization concerns due to reliance on a limited number of validators. Network outages and downtimes impacting reliability and user trust. Intense competition from other Layer-1 blockchains with similar features. Lightchain AI's Risks Being an emerging project, it faces risks related to early-stage adoption. Dependence on the successful implementation of its innovative technologies like PoI and AIVM. Market acceptance and scalability challenges for its AI-driven solutions. Market and External Factors Volatility in the cryptocurrency market is influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory uncertainties potentially impacting adoption and investor confidence. The risk of overhyped expectations leading to short-term speculation rather than sustained growth. Both projects require careful assessment of their risks and potential rewards before investment. Why Lightchain AI May Outperform Solana While Solana has a head start in terms of adoption and market presence, Lightchain AI stands out with its unique approach to blockchain scalability. By integrating AI into the core infrastructure, LCAI offers automated scalability and efficiency, potentially addressing key challenges faced by other blockchains like network congestion and high fees. Moreover, Lightchain AI's early entry advantage through its presale presents an attractive opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of a project with exponential growth potential. With its focus on diverse industries and solutions beyond just finance and gaming, LCAI opens up new avenues for widespread adoption and long-term stability. Make the Smart Choice for Your Lightchain AI Investment As a newer project, Lightchain AI carries some inherent risks. However, its innovative approach to blockchain and AI integration combined with potential for early-stage returns make it an attractive investment opportunity. By conducting thorough research and assessing the risks involved, investors can make informed decisions when considering Lightchain AI as a long-term investment in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology.

37713626,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628062,1734349377,Bitcoin new ATH pushes El Salvador’s unrealized profit over $360 million,"El Salvador’s unrealized profits on its Bitcoin investment briefly surpassed $360 million after BTC reached a new high above $106,000 earlier today. The country’s president, Nayib Bukele, shared a screenshot of its portfolio, showing that its investment has already doubled in value. According to the shared portfolio , El Salvador has invested $270.42 million in buying Bitcoin, and its acquisition is now valued at $632.65 million, a 128% increase. Although BTC has now fallen back to $104,000, El Salvador remains with significant profits, which highlights the success of the Bitcoin reserve strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Portfolio. (Source: X/Bukele) The Central American country currently holds 5,966 Bitcoins and has been buying one BTC per day, in line with Bukele’s pledge in November 2022. According to data from Arkham Intelligence , its last purchase was one BTC for $103,190 on December 15. New IMF loan could remove BTC as legal tender in El Salvador Meanwhile, the success of El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve strategy has not been enough to convince international organizations. The country might soon have to amend the laws that made Bitcoin a legal tender in September 2021. According to Financial Times , El Salvador is negotiating a $1.3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and parts of the loan’s terms could affect the Bitcoin law. The reports noted that the IMF wants the El Salvador government to remove the law mandating the acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender and instead make it voluntary for businesses to choose whether to accept BTC. Bitcoin adoption in the country could suffer a setback if this term is included. However, the impact might actually be minimal given that local adoption of Bitcoin for payment is already low and, as some experts noted, almost non-existent. A survey by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 2022 shows that only 20% of companies in the country accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, and an even smaller percentage of El Salvadorians use BTC for transactions. Still, the IMF’s opposition to El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy is unsurprising. The organization has warned that the costs and risks of making Bitcoin legal tender outweigh the benefits. It identified multiple risks at the time, including BTC price volatility, use for illicit activities, and financial instability. However, BTC has come a long way since then, with widespread institutional adoption boosting its price. El Salvador bonds have benefited from that performance, increasing in value. Still, the IMF has called for transparency in El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy. More countries eye strategic Bitcoin reserves While El Salvador’s Bitcoin law might not have boosted local adoption, the success of its Bitcoin Reserve has been enough to spark global interest in creating Bitcoin reserves. In the US, president-elect Donald Trump has already promised to create one. He reiterated this promise recently, and two states in the US – Pennsylvania and Florida – have already proposed Bitcoin reserve bills. Other states such as Wisconsin and Michigan have also shown interest in Bitcoin, mostly through the acquisition of Bitcoin investment products, Meanwhile, other countries are also considering the idea. The South Asian country of Bhutan is one of the biggest sovereign holders of Bitcoin, with over $1 billion in BTC holdings through its mining contracts. Other countries, such as Russia and Thailand, are also considering Bitcoin reserves. Several sovereign nations are considering hoarding Bitcoin in reserve. Meanwhile, demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other institutional buyers continues to increase. Analysts believe that Bitcoin could hit seven figures in the coming years.

37713270,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393633,1734349161,Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin: Why It Could Cost More Than $1 Initially,"The post Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin: Why It Could Cost More Than $1 Initially appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s highly anticipated stablecoin, RLUSD, is set to launch in 2024, and the crypto community is buzzing with excitement. As the release date approaches, there are growing expectations, especially within the XRP community. While many are eager to get their hands on the new stablecoin, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, has shared some important advice for potential buyers. Why RLUSD Might Cost More Than $1 Initially One of the key points Schwartz raised is that the RLUSD stablecoin might experience temporary price surges when it first launches. This is because, during the early stages, there could be a supply shortage. Some buyers may be willing to pay more than the intended $1 value, especially if they want to be among the first to own RLUSD. For example, during early trading, RLUSD was priced at 511 XRP, which equated to $1,231—much higher than the $1 target. Schwartz explained that this spike in price is not a sign of long-term value but a temporary situation. When a new asset is launched, especially a stablecoin, there can be an imbalance between supply and demand, which leads to price fluctuations. These spikes are not unusual, but they should not be mistaken for an opportunity to profit. Schwartz reassured that once the market stabilizes, the price will return to $1. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SBI Eyes XRP Buy Back Strategy to Boost Growth: Will It Work? , Analyst warns FOMO Possibility Ripple’s CTO strongly advises against buying RLUSD out of fear of missing out (FOMO). He emphasized that the stablecoin’s main purpose is to maintain a consistent $1 value, and any price movement above that is likely due to supply issues or short-term demand. Schwartz cautioned that if someone is willing to spend a lot of money to buy a tiny fraction of RLUSD early on, they should not expect to make a profit from it. He also mentioned that profit-taking traders—who exploit price differences in different markets—will quickly help to correct any price difference, bringing RLUSD back to its intended $1 price point.

A Promising Future for Stablecoins Despite the early price fluctuations, Schwartz believes in the long-term potential of the stablecoin market. Ripple sees RLUSD as a credible player in the space, and with stablecoins becoming increasingly popular, Schwartz predicts the market could surpass $2 trillion by 2028. In short, while the launch of RLUSD might bring some short-term price fluctuations, the stablecoin’s purpose is to maintain stability. Buyers should be patient and avoid buying in a rush, as the price will stabilize once the supply and demand balance out. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a Dec. 15 post to X, Saylor questioned whether the SaylorTracker portfolio tracker was “missing a green dot,” implying another Bitcoin purchase by the firm. Consistent Purchasing Pattern Saylor has shared the SaylorTracker chart on five consecutive Sundays since Nov. 10, with Bitcoin purchases being confirmed the following Monday each time. If confirmed for a sixth time, this purchase would mark MicroStrategy’s first acquisition at an average Bitcoin price exceeding $100,000. According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin hasn’t traded below six figures since 5:00 pm UTC on Dec. 13. MicroStrategy previously reported buying Bitcoin at average prices of $97,862, $95,976, and $98,783 over the past three Mondays, from Nov. 25 to Dec. 9, according to SaylorTracker data. A new purchase at similar levels would bring the company closer to reaching a $50 billion Bitcoin portfolio. As of Dec. 15, MicroStrategy held 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at over $43.6 billion. Bitcoin Milestones and Market Impact This potential purchase came just a day before Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $106,554. Saylor has made it clear the company won’t slow down its Bitcoin buying spree, stating he’s “sure” MicroStrategy will continue purchasing even at a price of $1 million per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s Stock Performance MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) stock has soared 496.4% year-to-date, according to Google Finance. The impressive performance has earned the company a spot in the Nasdaq-100, a prestigious index comprising the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq.

37714252,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52289,1734348891,4 Important Altcoins Other Than Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) to Know About,"Gone are the days when we used to imagine a common revolution in the ‘blockchain world’; such blockchain projects paved the way and opened new possibilities. Maintaining this steady stream of innovation is pivotal for the growth of the crypto ecosystem as numerous altcoins strive to expand the boundaries of DeFi, smart contracts, and digital assets. But even when some altcoins are poised to transform the future of finance and technology, Ethereum and Ripple often remain in the spotlight. So, it is important to remain relevant and aware of these newcomers’ potential by discussing their cutting-edge characteristics, tokenomics, and missions in the decentralized world. Rexas Finance (RXS): Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS), concentrated on real estate tokenization, allows individuals to transit from previously solid assets like buildings, commodities, and trademarks into liquefied virtual tokens. Such a new and creative solution improves investors’ liquidity, reachability, and transparency worldwide. Rexas Finance is strengthening its ecosystem with useful apps like the QuickMint Bot, which automates token minting through platforms such as Telegram and Discord, and GenAI, which makes NFT minting quicker and easier with incorporated AI. The governing factors are fairly crafted, enhancing participation without compromising the ecosystem’s vision in the long run. Rexas Finance is no longer just making an innovation; it is breaking all boundaries to the reach of wealth and assets and putting a token economy into a concrete revolution of wealth distribution. Solana (SOL): The Concept of Speed and Scalability Has Taken on a New Meaning Having it, one could highlight the Solana state aims for its rapid transactions and minimal service charge fees; this blockchain is absolutely the most efficient for apps and NFT developers who intend to make useful yet effective applications. Due to Solana’s unique implementation of Proof of History, this network’s throughput can match that of any standard FInancial transaction network, making it more tempting for industries to involve frequent trades such as gaming and decentralized finance. Turning to Solana’s economic system it centers its economics on pushing Validators while expanding the deflationary economic model. With a circulation supply of close to 500 million SOL tokens, the ecosystem is set to expand within Web 3 Applications, the NFT market, and many more. Solana has managed to put itself on the list of having the fastest transaction throughput while simultaneously being vertically scalable. Polkadot (DOT): True Blockchain Multi-Chain Polkadot is breaking the barriers to Blockchain by allowing communication between different networks, essentially creating one all-inclusive system aimed at financial and asset transactions. The architecture also has in its middle parachains opening up endless growth while operating on their own. Polkadot within para-chain auctions allows developers SoP (Something Other Than Same-Chain DApps). The approach consolidates Polkadot further as the best provider in terms of competitiveness of solutions based on interoperability and a multi-chain approach. Avalanche (AVAX): The Third Wave of Decentralization Without Harming Nature Blockchain systems were classically deemed to be technically flawed until AVAX appeared. AVAX allows sub-second finality of transactions and is exceptionally energy efficient within a decentralized system. Thanks to its Avalanche Consensus Protocol, the platform’s edge is decentralization with no performance loss, making it suitable for DeFi, enterprises, and gaming. AVAX’s tokenomics is characterized by a tri-blockchain structure whereby security and users’ rewards are provided through staking with minimal inflation shocks. Given the low energy requirements for its operations as well as the speedy transaction finality, Avalanche is setting a new standard for sustainable blockchain franchises. Such qualities attract many developers and enterprises seeking a well-balanced yet powerful decentralized platform. Conclusion It’s inspiring how these projects have innovated solutions for the same problems differently; Polkadot enables connection amongst otherwise isolated systems, and Solana allows its users to transact in a decentralized manner at incredible speed.

Which Memecoins Did It Draw Attention To? Here Are the Details,"Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has published a blog examining the cultural and thematic evolution of memecoins, focusing on their ability to connect with diverse communities through unique narratives and causes. Binance Highlights Emerging Trends in Memecoin and Decentralized Innovation The blog highlighted various tokens, such as the Chill Guy Memecoin, which has garnered a loyal following for its laid-back attitude. Binance noted that the token resonates with individuals who value a laid-back approach to life, creating a niche but deeply engaged community. Other projects have moved into more innovative areas. For example, RIF and URO were recognized for their participation in decentralized science (DeSci), a growing movement that aims to democratize access to scientific research and innovation using blockchain technology. These tokens exemplify the potential of decentralized networks to disrupt traditional scientific models and foster global collaboration. Another noteworthy point mentioned in the blog is QUANT, which has emerged as a symbol of resistance against the hype in the crypto space. The QUANT narrative focuses on promoting trust and transparency by bringing together a community that values authenticity in an industry often plagued by fraud and misinformation. The blog emphasizes that memecoins are no longer just speculative assets; they have become cultural phenomena that reflect different interests and values. Binance noted that these tokens often blend humor, ideology, and utility, creating vibrant ecosystems where communities thrive. As the memecoin world continues to mature, Binance’s views underscore the growing importance of storytelling and purpose in shaping the next wave of crypto projects. *This is not investment advice.

37712981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662922,1734348618,"Ethereum Bulls Aim For $4,100 As Key Resistance Comes Into Focus","Ethereum is once again making headlines as it edges closer to the critical $4,100 resistance level. After building steady upward momentum, the bulls seem determined to reclaim control and challenge this key barrier. Historically, this level has acted as a tough hurdle for ETH, but recent price action suggests growing buyer confidence. As ETH edges higher, traders are keenly watching to see if this rally has what it takes to finally break through the resistance and set the stage for further gains. With the stakes high and the momentum growing, the $4,100 level could be the key to Ethereum’s next big move. Will the Bulls rise to the challenge? Ethereum Price Approaches The Crucial $4,100 Resistance Level ETH is currently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), signaling a bullish trend. Following a strong rebound at $3,670, the cryptocurrency has gained steady upward strength, gradually approaching the $4,100 key resistance level. This positive price action suggests that market sentiment is shifting in favor of the bulls, with increasing buying pressure pushing Ethereum closer to this critical barrier. As the price draws closer to $4,100, traders are watching closely to see if ETH can break through this resistance and sustain its bullish momentum, possibly paving the way for more growth. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs To $4,000 Amid Historic ETF Inflows: Will It Break Previous Records? Furthermore, to support this outlook, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals strong positive sentiment for Ethereum. The RSI has risen to 63%, recovering from a previous dip to 53%. Significantly, this upward movement indicates growing buying pressure and reflects a shift toward bullish momentum. As the RSI climbs, it suggests that Ethereum is gaining strength, with potential for further upside. Thus, if ETH continues to stay above key thresholds, the crypto asset could have the strength to push through the $4,100 resistance level. Breaking Above The $4,100 Mark Could Spark ETH’s Next Bull Run A breakout above the $4,100 resistance level may serve as the catalyst for Ethereum’s next bull run, unlocking notable upside potential. This level has long been a critical barrier, representing psychological and technical resistance to ETH. Should the price break above $4,100, it would signal a shift in market dynamics, with the bulls firmly in control and poised to drive Ethereum to the $4,863 resistance level and beyond. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Barriers, Targets $6K Amid Record ETF, TVL Activity However, it’s important to note that a failure to break through $4,100 might lead to a pullback, triggering a retreat to lower support levels. A rejection at this key level would raise concerns about the sustainability of Ethereum’s bullish momentum, prompting traders to reassess their positions. Presently, Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,947, with a market capitalization of $475 billion. In the past 24 hours, ETH has seen a strong trading volume of $30 billion, indicating high investor interest and healthy market liquidity as Ethereum nears key resistance levels.

In the rough history of the alpha cryptocurrency, breaking through the key $106,000 mark on December 16, 2024, was a big moment. Investors are more confident now that Donald Trump won the election, which was based on his campaign promises. 🚀 #BTC hits $106K! The crypto sky just got brighter—what’s your next move? 📈 https://t.co/0XLTbaOUoL pic.twitter.com/VxWzZRx83M — Gate.io (@gate_io) December 16, 2024 A New Era For Bitcoin The excitement over Bitcoin stems from more than just numbers; it also comes from the possibility for a change in legislative attitudes. The victory of Trump has led to a general opinion that his government will be more open to cryptocurrencies than the previous administration. He plans to designate pro-crypto leaders to important roles, including Paul Atkins as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) new director. This has inspired hope for a more flexible regulatory framework, which many feel will help to raise the value of Bitcoin even more. Related Reading: 3-Year Peak: Chainlink Rally Fueled By Historic Open Interest Levels Bitcoin’s price has increased by nearly 50% in the span of just over a month since Trump’s election. According to experts, investors’ “fear of missing out” (FOMO) is the primary driver of this increase. The approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year was also instrumental in attracting mainstream investors, facilitating their entry into the market. Bitcoin’s aggregate market capitalization has now surpassed $3.8 trillion as a result of these developments. Managing The Volatility Though there is obvious excitement right now, experts caution investors about Bitcoin’s known volatility. Financial advisers suggest that a portfolio should include about 5% of cryptocurrencies. They underscore the significance of a disciplined approach that effectively balances the inherent risks with the potential benefits. Historical data indicates that Bitcoin is capable of experiencing significant price fluctuations, as evidenced by its 70% decline in 2021 following its previous high. Many are riding the tide of optimism, despite these warnings. Also fueling the rise of Bitcoin is the expectation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates this week. When financing costs are low, riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, tend to do well because of lower interest rates.

37713076,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628043,1734348371,ECB announces it will continue cutting rates until further notice,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is not backing down. Borrowing costs are heading south in the Eurozone, and there’s no set limit to how far they’ll go. So Christine Lagarde, the President of the ECB, made it crystal clear during a recent speech that inflation has finally been brought to its knees—or close enough to make cuts the new reality. “Even though we are not there yet, we are close to achieving our target,” she said. For the ECB, the target is simple: 2% inflation. After years of wild price spikes, inflation is finally showing signs of taming. Earlier this year, it briefly dipped below the goalpost but has since crept back over it. The eurozone is no stranger to tightening policies, but the ECB has kind of shifted gears. Inflation in the services sector—a key driver of domestic price pressures—has sharply cooled, and that’s just the start. Wage growth, often blamed for keeping inflation alive, is projected to slow to 3% next year. “That’s the level we generally consider to be consistent with our target,” Lagarde said. Borrowers win, but the eurozone struggles After four cuts, the ECB still isn’t ready to declare its policies loose. Rates remain high enough to squeeze economic activity, and the eurozone is feeling the pinch. Households are sitting tight, and businesses aren’t exactly splurging. Lagarde expects the eurozone economy to grow by a mere 1.1% next year—a fragile number in an increasingly unpredictable environment. There are global headaches too. Conflicts, political drama, and Donald Trump’s re-election in the U.S. have thrown the world into a state of unease. For European households, this uncertainty is a killer. Lagarde acknowledged the impact, saying consumer sentiment is heavily influenced by both inflation and geopolitics. “The pessimism about real incomes should dissipate as the high-inflation episode moves further into the rear-view mirror,” she said. The ECB isn’t the only one noticing the change. Investors are betting on consistent rate cuts, pushing the deposit rate to as low as 2% next year. And while no one is ruling out the possibility of a larger cut along the way, the ECB is playing it steady. Officials have hinted that policy could hit a “neutral” level by mid-2025—a point where it neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. The neutral rate debate heats up What exactly is the “neutral rate” anyway? That’s the billion-dollar question. The ECB has been chipping away at its key deposit facility rate, bringing it to 3% this week. But this might only be the halfway point. Markets are buzzing with speculation about where rates will finally settle. Lagarde threw out a range (somewhere between 1.75% and 2.5%) but no one’s putting money on the lower end just yet. The Austrian central bank’s Robert Holzmann, known for being hawkish, threw in his two cents. He told reporters there’s “no danger” in further cuts next year, provided the economy stays on track. That being said, some ECB officials are arguing for going below neutral if growth stumbles and inflation cools faster than expected. France’s central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, has said that sub-neutral rates might be on the table if the data points that way. It’s a delicate balancing act: inflation and economic growth are still closely watched, and any misstep could derail recovery efforts. The ECB staff’s latest projections don’t exactly scream confidence. Inflation is expected to average just above the 2% target at 2.1% in 2025, with higher price rises in the earlier months. Rate cuts, but for how long? “These data suggest that there is scope for a downward adjustment in services inflation, and thereby domestic inflation, in the coming months,” Lagarde has said. Policymakers are also dropping hints about how quickly cuts could happen. At a meeting in Frankfurt, the ECB’s Governing Council debated a larger, half-point cut but ultimately agreed on a quarter-point reduction. Deutsche Bank’s economists are already betting on sub-neutral rates by 2025. Their baseline prediction? A steady march to 1.5% through smaller cuts. But they’re not ruling out larger moves either. Not everyone is convinced. Moody’s Analytics expects the ECB to slow its pace after March next year. “We think that after March, the battle over how far to lower rates will start in earnest,” they said, predicting the last cut by June and rates leveling out at 2.25%.

Chainlink (LINK) Displays Massive Strength LINK price was battling the major resistance between $28 and $29, while a clean breakout triggered a strong upward move. While a rejection was expected to be fast approaching, the rise in the buyer’s strength has opened the doors for higher targets. On the other hand, the whale’s interest in the token has increased as they accumulated close to 430K LINK, and institutions like Trump’s World Liberty are spending nearly $2 million to buy over 78,000 LINK, indicating the rising bullish sentiments. The token has seen a rise in its trading volume in the past few days, which has helped it to surge above the pivotal zone between $27.5 and $28.4. Meanwhile, two major indicators have rebounded from a bearish pattern, suggesting the growing strength of the bulls. RSI & OBV have flipped, displaying a bullish reversal, and hence the token is expected to revive a strong ascending trend beyond interim resistance at $34.4, followed by a rise within the resistance zone between $36.8 and $37.7 in a few days. AAVE Price Eyes to Reach $500 The Aave price is trying hard to validate a breakout that it has been doing for over a week. Despite constant attempts, the price is failing to sustain itself within the resistance zone between $386.66 and $392.3. The crypto is about to rise back within the range, which is expected to have a major impact on the AAVE price rally for the year-end. As seen in the above chart, the AAVE price is rising, and in the short term, it has been consolidating within the pivotal resistance zone and support zone between $356.71 and $350.97. However, a breakout above the immediate resistance just above $396 may clear the path to $400. With this move, the AAVE price is expected to rise and reach the interim milestone of $500. Meanwhile, the Bollinger bands, which are going parallel to each other, suggest the token may remain within an accumulated range for a while. Therefore, the AAVE price is believed to test $395 to $398 and face a small pullback, keeping the bullish momentum intact and aiming to reach $500.",POSITIVE,AAVE | LINK,AAVE | ALTCOIN | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/chainlink-triggers-the-power-mode-to-reach-form-new-ath-while-aave-confirms-a-breakout-heres-whats-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Pepe Defies Broader Market Trends As Listings Solidify Blue Chip Status Pepe has cemented its place as the third-largest, and arguably the trendiest, memecoin in Q4. Bolstered by recent listings on Coinbase, Robin Hood, and most recently Binance US, these high-profile listings have expanded Pepe’s accessibility in the USA and contributed to Pepe’s remarkable surge this month. Whale activity has further fueled confidence for Pepe, and Pepe has recently gained blue chip meme status in the eyes of many experts. Defying broader market trends, Pepe recently traded at $0.00002725, gaining 3.5% within 24 hours while other major cryptocurrencies struggled. Increased exchange outflows indicate reduced selling pressure, supporting Pepe’s long-term growth prospects.

Investors Anticipate Solana Meme Rally For Dogwifhat Upsurge Dogwifhat has quickly risen within the Solana ecosystem, leveraging meme culture and its playful branding of a dog wearing a hat. Built on Solana’s fast, low-cost blockchain, Dogwifhat has become a viral sensation within the cryptocurrency space, attracting traders eager to capitalize on its community-driven hype. Despite lacking utility, Dogwifhat thrives on its simplicity and the emotional connection it fosters within its community as an OG pump.fun meme creation. By focusing entirely on virality and engagement, Dogwifhat taps into Solana’s inclusive blockchain ecosystem and growing meme coin trend, making it a strong contender for exponential gains in the near term, in which a Solana meme rally could send Dogwifhat to the moon.

With analysts projecting up to 50x gains by early 2025, the platform is attracting attention as a high-potential investment as a rapidly expanding utility ICO.

This strategy supports long-term value growth and rewards active participants in the ecosystem. At its presale price of $0.0044, Lunex Network presents a unique opportunity for investors to tap into the next wave of decentralized trading innovation.

It became an internet sensation through a popular Instagram account, “P.NUT Sanctuary,” which chronicled its antics. However, the creature’s story turned tragic when, on October 30, 2024, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation seized it from Longo’s home and euthanized it after testing for rabies. Allegations Against Binance In his letter to Binance, shared in a December 16 post on X, Longo accused Binance of using PNUT branding for cryptocurrency-related services without his express permission. The animal rights advocate said the crypto exchange had unlawfully exploited the “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark, PNUT logos, and associated imagery, which he has owned since he first rescued the animal. Longo is demanding that Binance stop this infringement, confirm compliance by December 17, and agree to commit no further violations in the future. He claimed that such activities led the exchange’s customers to mistakenly associate PNUT-branded meme coins sold on the platform with his conservation initiatives. If Binance fails to comply, Longo reserves the right to seek legal remedies, including claims for damages under the U.S. Copyright Act, which provides penalties of up to $150,000 for wilful infringement. The exchange had not yet responded to the cease-and-desist at the time of writing. Peanut-Themed Meme Tokens Suffer Different Fates Longo previously launched the Justice for Pnut and Fred (JUSTICE) token on Pump.fun after criticizing the crypto community for profiting from his trauma by creating the Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) coin soon after the popular rodent’s death. While PNUT’s overall worth skyrocketed to more than $1 billion when Binance listed it alongside several other meme coins, JUSTICE ended up shedding more than 99% of its $53.8 million market cap days after its introduction amid claims of significant selling pressure. Currently, the coin is up 34%, with a valuation of $373,026 per CoinGecko. On the other hand, PNUT recorded a 4.1% dip in the last 24 hours, but its market cap is still above $1 billion. Another coin launched by Longo soon after the JUSTICE debacle, dubbed Justice for Peanut (JFP), also suffered a similar fate to its predecessor, losing 67% of its price hours after going live. While its price is nearly 70% below its all-time high of $0.001705, achieved on December 13, 2024, the total value of its circulating supply stands at a much more respectable $2.2 million.

37712549,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393600,1734347821,ONDO Price Hits $2.14: Did Trump-Backed WLFI Trigger the Rally?,"The post ONDO Price Hits $2.14: Did Trump-Backed WLFI Trigger the Rally? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ONDO, a Real World Asset (RWA) token, has hit a new all-time high of $2.14, following a major purchase by World Liberty Financial, a crypto project backed by former President Donald Trump. According to Arkham Intelligence, the company acquired 134,216 ONDO tokens worth $250,000, triggering a sharp rise in ONDO’s price. This surge represents a strong market reaction to the purchase, with ONDO seeing an impressive 17% increase in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, Real World Assets (RWA) market capitalization has also touched $21.8 billion, up 2.0% over the previous day. Showing that the sector is booming and will be a best buy in the coming months. Let’s see how ONDO is moving the clock for investors. Strong Demand Drives the Rally The price surge is not just a result of speculation; it’s supported by real demand. ONDO’s price has increased by 17% in the past 24 hours, making it the top gainer in the market. Along with the price rise, trading volume has jumped by over 120%. This suggests that the rally is driven by real demand from investors, not just speculation. The surge in trading shows that more people are buying ONDO, indicating strong interest in the token. Good Time to Buy? The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator, which tracks buying and selling pressure, has reached its highest level in seven months. This is a positive sign, as it shows that the price increase is supported by strong buying interest. When OBV rises with the price, it suggests that the rally has a solid foundation and may continue shortly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chainlink Triggers the ‘Power-Mode’ to Form New ATH While Aave Confirms a Breakout—Here’s What’s Next , Looking Ahead: Can ONDO Keep Growing? ONDO’s price is currently at $2.05, just below its all-time high of $2.14. If the price breaks above this level, it could reach even higher prices. However, if investors decide to take profits, ONDO might see a pullback to around $1.79, its next major support level. Notably, Ondo has hit a new ATH after a six-week rally, marking over 200% gains since early November. The price surge followed strong support at $1.37 last week and is now targeting a potential new high of $2.51, based on Fibonacci extensions . However, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 78, there are signs of overbought conditions, hinting at a possible correction. Plus, ONDO’s futures Open Interest has surged, indicating continued market interest and potential for further gains. With backing from Trump’s crypto project and growing investor interest, ONDO is showing strong potential for continued growth. Investors will be watching closely to see if the token can maintain its upward momentum in the coming days. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-bitcoin-reserve-trumpres-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Speaking to FOX News, Maye shed light on D.O.G.E., a newly announced initiative under President-elect Donald Trump. In the interview, Maye reflected on raising one of the world’s richest men, saying Musk was a “genius” and that people didn’t believe her at the time because he was “shy.” She went on to share her insights on the current state of US government expenditures, which she described as “horrifying.” 'OUT OF CONTROL': @MayeMusk provides insight into @ElonMusk ’s and DOGE’s goals as the incoming Trump admin looks to cut wasteful spending with her billionaire son's help. She also reflects on what it was like to raise a ""genius"" boy who is now one of the world's richest men. pic.twitter.com/MwkhyDC2Ur — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 16, 2024 Last week, Maye expressed her trust in President-elect Trump’s leadership, reiterating that he just wants to help improve Americans’ lives. “I think Trump just wants everything to be honest and open so that you know where your tax dollars are going. He’s not going to be mean to people. When I see him, he just seems happy that he can make changes that will improve lives… I think we’re all going to be happier,” Maye told FOX News. Maye also said that she is happy some Democrats are concerned about how the federal government was spending money “wastefully.” Maye Musk echoed her support for her son leading The Department of Government Efficiency, abbreviated as D.O.G.E., which aims to curb what the incoming administration calls “out of control” government spending. A project meant to make significant government reforms D.O.G.E., a nod to Elon Musk’s frequent references to the crypto DOGE coin, was unveiled by Donald Trump in November. Trump likened the initiative to the “Manhattan Project”—the top-secret World War II effort to develop nuclear weapons, calling it a historic effort to streamline federal operations. “Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of D.O.G.E. for a very long time,” ~ Donald Trump Central to D.O.G.E.’s mission is the reduction of federal regulations, spending, and workforce size. The unofficial government department’s X account highlighted inefficiencies across multiple agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Education (DOE), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), all of which have faced criticism for audit failures or budgetary discrepancies. D.O.G.E. has set its sights on tackling bureaucratic inefficiency. Among its early pledges is an end to federal telework programs, with a pointed critique of the Biden administration’s recent extension of work-from-home privileges for 42,000 Social Security Administration employees. If you exclude security guards & maintenance personnel, the number of government workers who show up in person and do 40 hours of work a week is closer to 1%! Almost no one. https://t.co/4IGzbLqP3R — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 5, 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy, a co-head of the department alongside Musk, has taken issue with the government’s ownership of thousands of vacant buildings, calling it “nuts” and another area ripe for D.O.G.E.’s intervention. After the Pentagon’s seventh consecutive failed audit was revealed last month, Elon Musk took to Twitter to post “Time for D.O.G.E.,” a statement Ramaswamy echoed while pointing out the Department of Education for similar shortcomings and labeling systemic deficiencies as “utterly unacceptable.” However, both Musk and Ramaswamy have emphasized that D.O.G.E. will not propose changes to major entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. According to a report from the Economic Times, Ramaswamy believes decisions on entitlement reforms would require Congressional input and public debate. Instead, D.O.G.E. will focus on eliminating fraud and abuse in these programs, targeting individuals who improperly receive government funds. Support and criticism Critics have raised concerns about the constitutionality and practicality of D.O.G.E.’s mission. Federal budget adjustments typically require congressional approval, and many of the programs D.O.G.E. aims to address are tied to mandatory spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. budget. Constitutional experts are also questioning whether D.O.G.E.’s advisory role could overstep into policymaking, potentially clashing with established separation of powers. Elaine Kamark, a governance specialist at the Brookings Institution, expressed doubts about the feasibility of cutting one-third of government spending, a goal Musk has publicly endorsed. “You cannot touch people’s Social Security payments or their veterans’ retirement benefits without statutory changes, ” Kamark told the BBC. “They don’t have the power to enact any of those.” Kamark compared D.O.G.E.’s goals to the Clinton administration’s National Performance Review in the 1990s, which successfully reduced federal spending by over a billion dollars and cut 250,000 government jobs. While such efforts are achievable, she argued that the department’s current strategy lacks seriousness. On the other hand, some aspects of D.O.G.E. have received bipartisan support. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, endorsed Musk’s calls for Pentagon budget cuts, citing its repeated audit failures. Representative Ro Khanna and Representative Jared Moskowitz, both Democrats, have also voiced support for defense spending reductions. Moskowitz recently joined the House D.O.G.E. caucus, a bipartisan group aiming to trim ineffective government expenditures. “Reducing ineffective government spending should not be a partisan issue,” Moskowitz said in a statement.

X user Yuuu defends AI progress in crypto, citing frameworks like Eliza and G.A.M.E. as examples of meaningful development. Commenter Lijiang criticizes buzzword-driven projects, likening them to scams. A Twitter exchange between industry figures has sparked a debate about the role of AI agents in the crypto industry. The discussion revolves around whether current projects offer real innovation or simply focus on token-based incentives. AI Agents Not Adding Real Value to Crypto Cos, the founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, ignited the conversation by expressing concerns about the use of AI agents in the crypto industry. He argued that they are primarily employed to create tokens to generate short-term incentives rather than advance technological progress. Cos pointed out that large companies outside of crypto have already built advanced AI applications and interoperability protocols. Yet, the crypto world seems stuck on issuing tokens.

In a December 15 post on X, Schwartz acknowledged concerns about possible price volatility during RLUSD’s debut, citing potential supply shortages as a factor that could temporarily push its price above the $1 peg. Ripple first announced RLUSD in August, revealing plans to test the stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum mainnet. The company envisions RLUSD as a cornerstone for cross-border payment solutions, aimed at streamlining transactions for global users. However, an official release date for the stablecoin remains undisclosed. Schwartz highlighted early pre-market bids valuing RLUSD as high as $1,244—a staggering 1,200% premium over its intended parity. He attributed this enthusiasm to buyers seeking the prestige of acquiring the first RLUSD units, but he warned that these inflated valuations are unsustainable. Market Dynamics to Drive RLUSD Stability Despite the initial hype, Schwartz reassured investors that arbitragers would play a crucial role in normalizing RLUSD’s price. By buying at lower prices and selling at higher ones, arbitragers are expected to restore RLUSD to its $1 peg once supply stabilizes. “Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich,” Schwartz cautioned, emphasizing that RLUSD is designed for price stability, not speculation. He urged prospective investors to remain patient and avoid overpaying during the token’s initial market phase. The timing of this warning coincides with RLUSD’s recent regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services, clearing the way for its official rollout. Schwartz’s message underscores Ripple’s commitment to transparency as it navigates the challenges of introducing a stablecoin to the competitive digital asset market. XRP’s Recent Price Surge While RLUSD garners attention, Ripple’s native token XRP has been making headlines of its own. Earlier this month, XRP surged to $2.74, its highest price since January 2018. This represents a remarkable fivefold increase over the past 30 days, signaling renewed investor interest and optimism surrounding Ripple’s ecosystem. As Ripple prepares to introduce RLUSD, the company’s focus remains on delivering a stable and reliable product.

Despite being among the oldest and most prominent Layer 1 blockchains by several metrics, the XRP Ledger and Cardano are often regarded with disdain in the crypto community, with critics often questioning their use cases.One of the loudest voices in this campaign against these leading Layer 1 chains in recent months has been Messari co-founder Ryan Selkis. Over the past two days, the controversial crypto figure has reignited hostilities with the communities behind these blockchains with a fresh tirade.No Users?Ryan Selkis has again taken aim at the XRP and Cardano communities. In an X post on Saturday, December 14, Selkis dismissed the XRP and Cardano communities as loud and worthless ""bot groups on X."" He suggested that both blockchains lacked products and users.https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1868058418512294200The recent tirade likely follows the backlash the former crypto executive faced after a virulent attack on Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty and the XRP community on the same day.In an X post filled with references from the 1994 crime thriller ""Pulp Fiction,"" Selkis attempted to dispel any narrative that Ripple had any strong ties to the incoming Donald Trump administration in response to a picture of Alderoty with Vivek Ramaswamy. He further slammed XRP as ""a piece of shit"" while dubbing Ripple ""the drowning victim of crypto.""The weekend rants are the latest in a growing list of outbursts from the Messari co-founder against XRP and Cardano.No Love LostThere is no love lost between Selkis and the XRP and Cardano communities. The Messari co-founder has long labeled XRP as centralized, and in several posts over the past month, he has maintained that the only purpose of XRP was to enrich insiders, namely Ripple executives. The controversial former crypto executive has increasingly voiced this view, citing perceived risks to crypto from the association of Ripple with the Trump administration.https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1859716821643051318As for Cardano, Selkis has been at war with the community since Messari failed to mention the blockchain in its 200-page ""CRYPTO THESES 2024"" report.

37711779,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393551,1734346277,Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Still Worth It? 4 Tokens to Replace SHIB in Your Portfolio for Bigger Profits in 2025,"The post Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Still Worth It? 4 Tokens to Replace SHIB in Your Portfolio for Bigger Profits in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rising explosively in 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) became a fan-favorite among meme coin enthusiasts and retail investors. Its playful branding and large community helped it to take the front stage. However, many investors are wondering if SHIB can still offer massive returns as the crypto market develops. It could be time for traders trying to maximize gains in the next bull run to turn their attention to other intriguing tokens. Four cryptocurrencies—Bonk, Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui (SUI), and Rexas Finance (RXS)—could beat Shiba Inu in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) is the ideal option for those seeking explosive profits. Bonk (BONK): A Rising Meme Coin with Community Backing Dubbed the “Shiba Inu of Solana,” Bonk is a rather recent addition to the meme coin scene. Rooted in the Solana ecosystem, Bonk has become popular by presenting a low-cost, community-driven project with quick transfer speeds. With a clear increase in both acceptance and trade volume, the coin has already displayed indicators of exponential expansion. Bonk is riding on the wave of meme currency popularity, but depending on Solana’s network performance, its long-term viability could either increase or decrease. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin with Staying Power Originally the first of meme coins, Dogecoin is still beloved for its tenacity and humor. Supported by a devoted community and sponsorships from well-known people like Elon Musk, DOGE has maintained a distinctive position in the industry over the years. DOGE stands out from other meme coins in its use as tipping money and possible incorporation into payment systems. Its great circulating supply makes it difficult to achieve spectacular price gains, so competing altcoins have room to offer better returns. Sui (SUI): The Future of Blockchain Scalability Sui is a major competitor in the struggle for blockchain supremacy because it is a layer-1 blockchain meant to circumvent scaling constraints. With its Move programming language and effective architecture, Sui helps creators create scalable and safe distributed apps (dApps). Although it is not a meme coin, SUI has technological promise and a developer-friendly ecosystem. It is probably going to become rather popular as developers and institutional investors seek scalable solutions. In the long term, it presents a good chance for significant profits given its present pricing($3.63 as of this writing). Rexas Finance (RXS): The Best Replacement for SHIB Of the four tokens mentioned, Rexas Finance (RXS) is the best choice for those trying to maximize earnings in 2025. RXS has everything it needs to provide life-changing rewards with a visionary vision, robust market performance, and increasing community support. Revolutionary Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance distinguishes itself by tokenizing real-world assets, therefore enabling investors to acquire fractional ownership of valuable assets, including luxury goods and real estate. This special use closes a huge unexplored market by bridging the gap between conventional finance and blockchain. Presale Success and Strong Market Metrics At $0.15 in its 10th presale stage, RXS has already sold more than 336.7 million tokens and raised over $26.7 million as of this writing. This enormous presale success is a great indication of project investor confidence. Offering a possible 33x return for early investors, analysts estimate RXS might reach $5 or more in the next bull market. This one is unique among altcoins because of its creative approach and solid market foundations. A Secure and Transparent Ecosystem Rexas has also completed a thorough CertiK assessment, guaranteeing investors its security and adherence to industry standards. Its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko confirm its validity even more and increase its accessibility to cryptocurrency lovers. Youtube Embed Rexas Finance Have Raised OVER $24M in Their PRESALE (GET IN NOW!) Why Rexas Finance is the Smartest Investment Rexas Finance mixes the best of all worlds, whereas Bonk delivers community-driven growth, Dogecoin boasts meme coin domination, and Sui provides cutting-edge blockchain scalability. Its outstanding presale performance and pragmatic uses in real-world asset tokenization make it a top candidate for large returns in 2025. Unlike meme currencies, which are mostly dependent on hype, RXS guarantees longevity in the market by providing real value and use. Given its present pricing range and possibilities for exponential expansion, Rexas Finance is the obvious choice for investors wishing to replace SHIB in their portfolios. Conclusion Although Shiba Inu has enjoyed some fame, the cryptocurrency market is changing, and your investing plan should also change. Maximizing returns depends on concentrating on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and high growth potential as the next bull market gets underway. Among Bonk, Dogecoin, Sui, and Rexas Finance, RXS is the best choice since it provides a special mix of profit potential, cost, and inventiveness. Rexas Finance is a must-have in your portfolio if you are a clever investor trying to maximize 2025.

Cryptocurrency platform Matrixport stated that Bitcoin continues to dominate the markets, but Ethereum could become the leader in 2025. Matrixport analysts said Bitcoin has outperformed the market this year with its dominance rising to 61% but falling to 54%. In contrast, Ethereum saw its dominance drop from 18% to 12% following the launch of spot ETH ETFs. While Ethereum faces negativity in 2024, Matrixport analysts stated that the altcoin focus is shifting towards Solana, but Ethereum could make a big attack in 2025 with increasing ETH ETF inflows. Analysts also said that traditional finance (TradFi) institutions could aggressively accumulate ETH, which would support the Ethereum rally. “Ethereum appears to have largely missed the 2024 Bitcoin bull market. Bitcoin’s dominance skyrocketed from 50% to 61% and then fell to 54%, while Ethereum’s dominance fell sharply from 18% to just 12%. This decline has been particularly pronounced since the launch of Ethereum ETFs, with its dominance falling in an almost linear trend. While the attention in the altcoin space has shifted to Solana, 2025 could be a turning point for Ethereum as traditional finance (TradFi) institutions may begin to aggressively accumulate, spurred by strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin leads the rally, while Ethereum could be the underdog positioned for a significant recovery.” *This is not investment advice.

37711719,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628002,1734346047,Bank of Japan stands to gain the most from the yuan’s slump,"China’s yuan might soon be heading into a deliberate tailspin, and while that could be bad news for most Asian currencies, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) might find itself in a unique position to benefit. With Beijing weighing a devaluation of its currency to counteract Donald Trump’s tariffs, the knock-on effects across global markets could hand Governor Kazuo Ueda the advantage he’s been waiting for. Analysts are keeping an eye on Japan’s currency, the yen, which has become unusually sensitive to the yuan’s movements. This little interplay could redefine the BOJ’s strategy for navigating Japan’s stubborn inflation and volatile economy. A trade war’s ripple effect hits Japan The stage is set by Trump’s threat to slap a 25% tariff on Chinese imports by 2025. Predictably, Beijing’s response is to consider weakening the yuan to 7.5 per dollar, down from its current level of 7.27. The strategy is simple: make Chinese goods cheaper and mitigate the impact of American tariffs. But the yen, already under pressure, might slide further. BNP Paribas strategist Jain Chandresh estimates that the yen could weaken to 156 per dollar if Beijing moves forward with its plan. Without Trump’s tariffs, the yen might sit around 140 by the end of 2025. This would exacerbate an already volatile year for Japan’s currency, which saw a sharp rally in July when the BOJ raised rates to their highest level in 15 years. That rate hike triggered chaos. Investors dumped carry trades tied to the yen, sparking a global selloff and Tokyo’s worst market rout since Black Monday in 1987. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even hinted the central bank should ease up. The yuan’s decline could offer a much-needed stabilizer, taking pressure off the yen as the BOJ eyes another potential rate increase. BOJ faces tough choices As the BOJ prepares for its Dec. 18-19 meeting, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Recall that their July meeting happened in an almost identical situation, and we had to watch them nearly trigger a full-blown global financial crisis. A Reuters poll shows 54% of economists expect no change in the BOJ’s benchmark rate of 0.25%, with the central bank likely to wait until January for more clarity on wage growth and Trump’s trade policies . Inflation in Japan has stayed above the BOJ’s 2% target for 30 consecutive months, backed by wage growth of 2.5% to 3% annually. But household spending has been on the decline for three straight months, and factories output has been inconsistent. The yen’s wild ride Currency volatility is nothing new for Japan, but 2024 has been particularly brutal. When the BOJ raised rates in July, the yen surged, rattling markets. Now, the currency is trading around 154 per dollar, with traders scaling back their expectations for another rate hike this month. Teppei Ino of MUFG Bank says that markets have priced in a 77% probability of no change in December, compared to just 35% a month ago. However, he warns that the BOJ might act suddenly if the yen depreciates too quickly, especially with the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting expected to push the dollar higher. “If the yen hits 155 against the dollar, the BOJ might be forced to raise rates sooner than planned,” Ino says . Analysts agree that the yen’s behavior will be a key factor in shaping the BOJ’s next steps. Goldman Sachs found that the yen is more sensitive to changes in the yuan than any other major currency. This connection means that a weaker yuan could drag the yen down further, relieving some pressure on Japan’s exporters but potentially destabilizing the broader economy. For now though, the BOJ seems content to wait.

The tool offers valuable insights into XRP wallet distributions and labeled wallet holders, serving as a resource for anyone interested in tracking XRP ecosystem data. In his tweet, Vet highlighted key features of the platform, emphasizing its utility for casual users and industry professionals. Have you checked out this XRP Rich List ? I like how you can scroll through the labeled wallet holders + detail view. No surprise that the top wallets holding XRP are usually major exchanges. South Korean exchange Upbit with over 6B XRP. https://t.co/C8GZs8yAXl pic.twitter.com/SN2ckv0dD7 — Vet (@Vet_X0) December 15, 2024 The XRP Rich List Summary provides an extensive breakdown of wallet balances on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , categorizing them based on wallet ownership and activity. Major exchanges such as South Korea’s Upbit, holding over 6 billion XRP, dominate the top rankings. However, the list extends beyond exchanges, labeling wallets linked to Ripple executives, corporate entities, and individual investors. Features of the XRP Rich List Summary One of the tool’s standout features is its labeling system, which identifies the owners of prominent wallets. According to VET, wallets associated with Ripple, Binance, Coinbase, Chris Larsen, and Arthur Brito are marked. The platform also provides the number of wallets tied to these entities—for instance, Ripple reportedly operates 87 wallets, Binance manages 26, and Coinbase has 542. These labels allow users to understand the concentration of XRP holdings across the network. The wallet balance distribution is another critical feature, showcasing holdings over different timeframes, such as the past 7 or 30 days. This allows users to analyze trends in XRP accumulation or distribution. Additionally, the tool tracks wallet changes, offering insight into shifting balances within labeled wallets. An interactive heat map visually represents the data, aiding in understanding the spread of XRP ownership. For transparency, the platform updates hourly, ensuring users have access to the most recent data. The tool pulls its data from XRP Scan and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) directly, relying on XRP Scan’s robust labeling system for accuracy. Unlabeled and Unknown Wallets While the platform excels in providing clarity about labeled wallets, it also acknowledges the presence of unknown wallets in its rankings. For example, the second-largest wallet, holding approximately 20 billion XRP, remains unidentified. As community members or wallet owners disclose their identities, the platform updates its labels accordingly. This flexibility ensures that the tool remains dynamic and evolves with the XRP ecosystem. Importance of the XRP Rich List The XRP Rich List Summary is an essential resource for understanding the distribution of XRP holdings, especially as transparency and accountability continue to be focal points in the cryptocurrency industry. It offers investors, analysts, and enthusiasts a clear view of wallet balances and changes, which can be critical in assessing market trends and identifying key stakeholders in the XRPL ecosystem. The tool also sheds light on significant exchanges, with Upbit, Binance, and Coinbase leading the pack in XRP holdings. Understanding how these wallets interact with the XRP Ledger provides deeper insights into the overall health and functionality of the network. For those interested, the tool is accessible at xrp-rich-list-summary.shirome.net , and its evolving data will undoubtedly continue to serve as a vital resource for the XRP community.

However, most indicators are now signalling a very overbought condition for Bitcoin, which could mean that the next correction is about to begin. Sentiment, politics, and demand all favour Bitcoin Not just the price, but sentiment for Bitcoin is at an all-time high. The Fear and Greed Index is pointing to Extreme Greed at a level of 83. This indicator has been around the 80 level for the past month, showing that the bulls are firmly in control. On the political side of things, the incoming Trump administration has plenty of pro-crypto people in the highest positions, and the appointment of a Crypto Czar in David Sacks should provide much positive influence for the sector going into Trump’s second term in office. For demand, besides the distinct possibility that sovereign nations, including the US, Russia, China, etc., are about to embark on a buying race, for the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Blackrock alone has bought more than 25,000 BTC in just the last seven trading days . With such tailwinds behind Bitcoin, it is to be wondered how the price can go down. That said, this is a market, and as any asset gets to very overbought conditions, there will be counteractive forces that will only continue to get stronger as the price goes up. $BTC price touches top of ascending channel Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC does show that the price has touched the top of the ascending channel. Given the selling wick, and the fact that $BTC is overbought on most time frames out to a week, it would be expected that the price might now head back down for some kind of correction. The bottom of the channel is one area of interest, plus the $99,000 horizontal level is becoming important support/resistance. RSI points to rejection for exhausted bulls Source: TradingView Zooming out into the 5-day chart, one can see the parabolic nature of this latest surge in the Bitcoin price. However, looking at the bottom of the chart, it can be seen that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nudging right up against a descending trendline that comes from before the two peaks of the previous bull market in 2021. Given the potentially exhausted state of the Bitcoin bulls, it is unlikely that the indicator line will be able to press on through the descending trendline, and therefore a rejection does look more likely. Although this could just be a return to the 70 level before bouncing higher again. It could also take around a month for this to play out.

37711563,https://coinpaper.com/6553/ripple-s-legal-chief-calls-out-sec-for-questionable-practices,1734345879,Ripple’s Legal Chief Calls Out SEC for Questionable Practices,"Ripple and its native token, XRP, have been at the forefront of significant developments shaping the cryptocurrency landscape in late 2024. From Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticizing the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulatory tactics to XRP experiencing a historic rally fueled by political shifts and ecosystem advancements, the company and its token continue to capture the attention of investors and industry observers alike. Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty Condemns SEC’s “Lawless” Regulatory Tactics Amid Ongoing Appeals Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has once again launched a scathing critique of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), placing the spotlight on what he describes as the agency’s “lawless” approach to regulation. In a pointed tweet, Alderoty brought attention to the SEC's alleged misuse of its enforcement authority, accusing the agency of prioritizing its own agenda over adherence to the law. Alderoty’s remarks revisit themes from Ripple’s landmark legal battle against the SEC, a case that has become emblematic of the broader fight for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency sector. He noted that Ripple had made the crypto community aware of the SEC’s questionable tactics early in its litigation, prompting significant criticism of the agency’s methods. According to Alderoty, the court handling Ripple’s case observed the SEC’s habit of adopting litigation positions to achieve its desired objectives rather than demonstrating a commitment to faithfully interpreting and enforcing existing laws. Alderoty’s critique aligns with a growing wave of dissatisfaction among industry leaders and legal experts regarding the SEC’s regulatory framework. Critics have accused the agency of leveraging enforcement actions as a substitute for clear and consistent rulemaking. The SEC’s perceived lack of transparency has also fueled frustrations across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many industry stakeholders demanding actionable guidance rather than punitive measures. Ripple’s victory in its case against the SEC has further emboldened these calls, positioning the company as a leader in the fight for a more transparent regulatory landscape. Ripple’s ongoing battle with the SEC has already delivered a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. In July 2023, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in Ripple’s favor, stating unequivocally that XRP is not a security. This decision dealt a significant blow to the SEC’s broader enforcement campaign, which has sought to classify various crypto assets as securities under its jurisdiction. The ruling provided Ripple and the wider crypto industry with a strong precedent as they continue to push for greater regulatory clarity. Despite the ruling, the legal battle is far from over. In October 2023, the SEC announced its intention to appeal the court’s decision, focusing on the classification of certain XRP distributions as securities. Ripple responded with a cross-appeal. As part of its preparation for potential remedies, Ripple has set aside $125 million in an escrow account. Prolonged Legal Timeline Both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal are expected to extend the case well into 2025. Briefings for the appeals are anticipated to last through the first half of the year, with arguments likely to occur in the fall. A final decision from the appellate court could follow shortly thereafter. This extended timeline has left industry participants eagerly watching for developments, as the case’s outcome could have far-reaching implications for the regulation of digital assets in the United States. Ripple’s case against the SEC has become a litmus test for the agency’s approach to crypto regulation. The ruling that XRP is not a security was celebrated as a victory for the broader industry, setting a legal precedent that many hope will curb the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions. However, with the case now heading to appellate courts, the crypto industry remains on edge. The outcome could either cement Ripple’s win as a pivotal moment for regulatory clarity or breathe new life into the SEC’s efforts to assert its authority over the burgeoning digital asset market. As Ripple and the SEC prepare for the next phase of their legal showdown, Alderoty’s sharp critique brings attention to a critical issue at the heart of the debate: accountability. His comments are part of a broader demand from the cryptocurrency industry for a regulatory approach that prioritizes clear guidelines over litigation-driven enforcement. For now, Ripple continues to lead the charge for regulatory reform, and the stakes have never been higher. With billions of dollars and the future of crypto regulation on the line, all eyes are on the courts as this landmark case unfolds. XRP Surges Amid Political Tailwinds and Ecosystem Developments Meanwhile, XRP has captured the spotlight in late 2024, achieving its most significant rally in years, fueled by political developments, ecosystem upgrades, and growing adoption of its technology. The cryptocurrency reached a seven-year high of $2.90 on Dec. 3, 2024, before pulling back to $2.41, yet its momentum remains strong as attention shifts to what lies ahead in 2025. The rally marks a turning point for XRP, which had spent years in relative price stagnation. On Nov. 5, XRP began its sharp ascent, coinciding with Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. The President-elect’s pro-crypto stance has instilled confidence in the market, bolstering expectations for a regulatory environment conducive to innovation. Following the rally, XRP surged past Solana in market capitalization on Dec. 1, becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that XRP's market cap now stands at $138 billion, trailing only $2 billion behind stablecoin giant Tether’s $140 billion valuation. One of the most anticipated developments for XRP is the launch of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, recently approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on Dec. 10. This dollar-pegged stablecoin is overcollateralized by fiat reserves and short-term cash equivalents like US Treasury bills, ensuring a 1:1 redemption ratio with US dollars. In addition to RLUSD, several other developments have contributed to XRP’s historic rally, cementing its position as a key player in the crypto space: 1. Pro-Crypto Political Tailwinds Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024 ignited optimism across the crypto sector. Trump’s campaign featured pro-crypto rhetoric and promises of regulatory clarity, creating a friendlier climate for blockchain innovation. XRP, along with other digital assets, benefited significantly from this political shift. 2. Surge in Institutional Interest On Nov. 25, asset management giant WisdomTree filed for an XRP ETF, joining the ranks of Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares, which have also submitted applications to the SEC for similar products. The prospect of institutional-grade investment vehicles for XRP signals growing confidence in its utility and potential. 3. Market Cap Milestones By flipping Solana in market capitalization, XRP demonstrated its growing dominance in the cryptocurrency market. The achievement signals its broadening adoption and increasing relevance in the digital economy. 4. Regulatory Milestone for RLUSD The approval of RLUSD by the NYDFS represents a significant step forward for Ripple . With a secure regulatory foundation, RLUSD is poised to become a cornerstone of XRP’s ecosystem, driving adoption through remittances, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and cross-border payments. As XRP enters 2025, several factors are expected to sustain investor interest: Continued Adoption of RLUSD: The stablecoin’s integration into the XRP ecosystem is expected to drive transaction volumes, benefiting XRP holders through increased demand and token burn. Institutional Developments: The SEC’s eventual decision on pending XRP ETF applications could open the floodgates for institutional investment. Regulatory Clarity: With Trump’s administration expected to take a pro-crypto stance, Ripple and XRP could benefit from a more predictable regulatory environment. XRP’s historic rally in late 2024 suggests a perfect storm of favorable political developments, ecosystem advancements, and institutional interest. With the launch of RLUSD and the potential for greater adoption of the XRPL, the cryptocurrency is positioned for continued growth in the coming year. While challenges remain, including navigating regulatory uncertainty and maintaining momentum, XRP has emerged as a resilient contender in the cryptocurrency market, ready to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6553/ripple-s-legal-chief-calls-out-sec-for-questionable-practices,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Retail investors, particularly smaller ”shrimp wallets,” are very confident in the crypto as they are accumulating BTC, even as long-term holders sell large amounts. Analysts predict some price volatility for BTC, but still maintain a positive outlook for BTC's role in institutional portfolios. Meanwhile, Ethereum shows potential for a major rally in 2025, with analysts eyeing targets between $6,000 and $8,800. Bitcoin Hits New Heights Bitcoin’s price experienced a rally of nearly 5% on Dec. 15, which helped it reach a new all-time high above $106,000. Speculation that it may become a reserve asset for the United States also helped boost BTC’s price. CoinMarketCap data shows that Bitcoin peaked at $106,488 before retreating slightly to $104,736. This surpassed its previous high of $104,000 that was set on Dec. 5. BTC price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to CK Zheng, the Chief Investment Officer of ZK Square, Bitcoin likely entered a “Santa Claus mode,” with investors fearing they might miss out and allocating more capital to the cryptocurrency. Zheng projected that Bitcoin could hit $125,000 by early 2025 but also warned that a 30% correction might follow. This could potentially bring the price back down to around $87,500. He believes that much of the bullish sentiment from the incoming Trump administration may already be factored into the current price. Speculation was also fueled by remarks from Strike CEO Jack Mallers , who suggested that President-elect Donald Trump might issue an executive order on his first day in office to designate Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Mallers thinks that such a move could involve a large purchase, though not on the scale of 1 million coins. Additionally, the CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund Dennis Porter , revealed that a third Bitcoin reserve bill is being drafted at the state level. Porter predicted that at least 10 states might eventually introduce similar legislation. On the macroeconomic front, financial analysts expect a 0.25% interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Dec. 18, which could provide even more momentum for Bitcoin’s price in the coming months. Another contributing factor is a new rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, effective for fiscal years starting after Dec. 15, which allows institutions to more accurately record the value of their cryptocurrency holdings. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) Bitcoin’s market sentiment is also still strong as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows a score of 83, indicating “ Extreme Greed .” This is the highest sentiment level since Dec. 5 when Bitcoin first jumped past the $100,000 milestone. Small Bitcoin Holders Keep Accumulating Bitcoin wallets holding less than 1 BTC, which are referred to as “shrimp wallets,” are expected to grow by almost 9% in the near term as small-scale investors continue accumulating, even as Bitcoin’s price remains above $100,000. CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler pointed out this trend in a recent post, and shared that these smaller holders are demonstrating very strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Currently, there are about 323,000 shrimp wallets, which is a figure Adler predicts will increase to 351,000 in the near future. This will be an 8.67% rise. Adler explained that this accumulation trend started when Bitcoin was priced at $61,000, at which point there were 265,000 shrimp addresses. Since then, the number surged by 21.9%, which indicates consistent retail interest in Bitcoin despite its recent high valuations. While shrimp wallets show robust accumulation patterns, long-term holders, holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, have been selling big amounts of Bitcoin. Reports suggest that over the past 30 days alone, long-term holders sold 827,783 BTC, which could signal a market top. Despite the selling pressure from long-term holders, analysts believe Bitcoin’s near-term price dips may not be as severe as the 10% drop earlier this month. Bitfinex analysts shared in a recent report that realized profits and sell-side pressure have eased, reducing the likelihood of sharp declines like the one experienced during Bitcoin’s initial spike above $100,000. This suggests that while the market faces mixed signals, the growing retail interest from shrimp wallets may provide a stabilizing influence on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Will a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Lead to Volatility? On the other hand, a crypto analyst warned that Senator Cynthia Lummis’ proposal for the United States government to buy 5% of Bitcoin’s supply could lead to increased price volatility in the short term. Ben Simpson , founder and CEO of Collective Shift, suggested that while a move like this might cause Bitcoin’s price to surge initially, it could also result in a pullback as the market adjusts to the news. The proposal involves the U.S. government purchasing and holding 1 million Bitcoin for at least 20 years, and it especially gained a lot of traction after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory on Nov. 5. Bitcoin dominance dropped over the past 30 days. Crypto trader Momin noticed this trend, and predicted even more declines in Bitcoin dominance as altcoins gain momentum. However, Simpson believes that the transition into an altcoin season will likely be volatile rather than straightforward. Despite the potential volatility, analysts at Bitfinex are still optimistic about Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios. They noted that many altcoins have yet to achieve new all-time highs against Bitcoin. Bitfinex analysts also believe that any dips in Bitcoin’s price, even during the holiday season, are likely to be short-lived due to strong spot buying and reasonable leverage levels supporting the market. Meanwhile, global investment manager VanEck recently reaffirmed its $180,000 price target for Bitcoin in the current market cycle, and pointed out that the crypto bull market is only in its early stages. Analysts Predict Ethereum Rally in 2025 Some analysts are also excited about Ethereum’s prospects heading into the new year. Ether could even surpass its previous all-time high during the first quarter of 2025, according to market analysts. Despite its inability to hold above the $4,000 psychological threshold, ETH may be poised for a major rally. A market report by Bybit and Block Scholes revealed that the recent crypto market deleveraging could reset leveraged long positions, potentially paving the way for Ethereum to catch up to Bitcoin’s gains. Bybit analysts anticipate a new all-time high for Ethereum in Q1 of 2025, supported by strength in derivative markets and growing anticipation of price catch-up. Bitcoin, however, outperformed Ethereum as an investment in 2024 by far. BTC delivered a 54% return over the past six months compared to Ether’s 12%. Despite this disparity, analysts still believe Ethereum could rally to $8,800 based on an ascending triangle formation on the daily chart. The key level to watch is $4,100, which, if breached, could propel ETH toward its previous all-time high of $4,865 and beyond. The Long Investor, a popular crypto analyst, is just as confident in ETH’s trajectory, and gave Ethereum a target of $8,800. Historical patterns also support optimism for Ethereum. Venture Founder , a crypto analyst, pointed out that Ethereum typically underperforms Bitcoin for up to eight months after a Bitcoin halving before really gaining some momentum. As this cycle reaches the eighth month, the analyst predicts a potential ETH/BTC ratio of 0.39. Investor interest in Ethereum also continues to grow, and the creation of over 130,000 new Ethereum addresses daily in December is proof of this. New daily addresses hit an eight-month high that was last seen in April, according to data from Santiment . Despite this bullish sentiment, some market participants are still a bit cautious. VanEck, for example, set a more conservative price target of $6,000 for Ethereum.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6552/bitcoin-price-surges-to-106-k-with-market-sentiment-at-extreme-greed,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The rally came as speculations grew about it becoming a United States reserve asset. The cryptocurrency is trading at $104,638, up just over 2% in the past 24 hours. The surge is also the result of increased whale activity and markets buoyed by MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100. BTC is up almost 6% over the past week and nearly 15% over the past month. Several other cryptocurrencies registered notable gains over the weekend. Ethereum (ETH) is up almost 2% and trading just under $4,000. Solana (SOL) has also been marginally up over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Tron (TRX) , Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also made notable gains. The crypto market cap is up 2.42% and currently sits at $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) Sets New All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high, reaching $106,492, thanks to increased whale trading and MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100. On-chain data revealed several major trades by Bitcoin whales over the weekend. The trades saw the movement of millions of BTC off major exchanges and into private wallets. Whale Alert, which tracks crypto transactions, showed over 27,000 BTC worth $2.8 billion moved off exchanges like Bybit and Binance into private wallets. The move drastically reduces the supply of BTC on public exchanges, leading to a spike in price. Another major factor contributing to BTC’s surge to a new all-time high was the optimism generated by the addition of MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of BTC, to the Nasdaq 100 index. The Crypto Market Must Overcome Regulatory Hurdles The head of South Korea’s stock exchange, Jeong Eun-bo, has urged the country to institutionalize crypto and act quickly or risk losing ground to its institutional rivals. He made the comments during an interview with a South Korean newspaper, during which the exchange head highlighted that the market needs to overcome significant regulatory obstacles. “The crypto asset market has grown in size and influence to the point where traditional markets cannot ignore it. South Korea should quickly make efforts to include crypto assets in the financial sector.” He also stated that exchange chiefs agreed it would be difficult for stock exchanges to maintain profitability if they ignored the virtual currency market. “The average daily trading volume of the domestic stock market is approximately 20 trillion won ($14 billion). The virtual currency market has surpassed this since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. We must hurry to institutionalize the virtual currency market to create new added value. If we are vague with our treatment of virtual currency, and treat it as a speculative asset, we will fall behind in terms of international competitiveness.” Cryptocurrencies have gained considerable popularity in South Korea. However, the country’s crypto market is dominated by private investors, with no crypto firms listed on the Korean exchange. Companies cannot buy crypto with their balance sheets, and regulators are yet to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high during early Asian trading hours, buoyed by President-elect Donald Trump’s latest comments suggesting his plans to create a US Bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserves. Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG, stated, “We're in blue sky territory here. The next figure the market will be looking for is $110,000. The pullback that a lot of people were waiting for just didn't happen because now we've got this news.” Trump stated last week that he wants America to be at the forefront of a global crypto ecosystem. When asked if he plans to build crypto reserves similar to the country’s strategic oil reserves, Trump replied in the affirmative. “We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don't want China or anybody else - not just China but others are embracing it - and we want to be the head.” Several other countries, including Russia, are also considering creating strategic reserves. BTC is up over 16% since last month and over 55% since the US elections. According to Jack Mallers, the founder and CEO of Strike, Trump could potentially issue an executive order designating BTC as a reserve asset on his first day in office. “There’s potential to use a day-one executive order to purchase Bitcoin. It wouldn't be the size and scale of 1 million coins, but it would be a significant position.” Several Bitcoin reserve bills are being mooted at the state level as well, with Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter claiming a third bill is being considered. However, he did not elaborate on which state would follow Pennsylvania and Texas. “We had Pennsylvania, and we had Texas. And now we have another state coming on board. And they sent me the draft. So I know it’s real. It's not going to stop. We're going to see more and more of these bills come. At least 10, in my opinion.” Analysts also predict a 0.25% interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve on December 18, which could help drive Bitcoin even higher in the coming months. Let’s look at the price chart. BTC struggled to break past $100,000 before Sunday’s increase, as selling pressure kept the bulls at bay. However, developments on Sunday and the beginning of the week could have ignited a new bull run, with BTC setting a new all-time high earlier today. BTC began the previous week positively, registering an increase of 1.32% on Sunday and settling at $101,043. However, it fell considerably on Monday as sellers drove it to an intraday low of $94,185. BTC recovered from this level and ultimately settled at $97,434 after a drop of 3.57%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $96,912, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $94,313. Source: TradingView Despite the prevailing selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising just over 4% to go above $100,000 and settle at $100,900. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping almost 1% and settling at $99,923. BTC’s seesaw price action continued on Friday as it recovered after registering an increase of 1.47% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,394. The weekend began with BTC registering a marginal drop on Saturday. However, it rallied on Sunday, registering an increase of almost 3% and settling at $104,182. BTC set a new all-time high during the ongoing session as it peaked at $106,554 before declining to its current level of $105,017. Analysts believe BTC is in uncharted territory as market sentiment shifts to “extreme greed.” If bulls retain control, BTC could continue pushing higher and reach $110,000. On the other hand, sellers will look to reclaim control and push BTC below $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Analysts have predicted that Ethereum (ETH) is poised for record highs in Q1 2025, and an imminent breakout could see the asset set a new all-time high. However, ETH struggled to stay above $4,000, a key psychological level, even as BTC registers substantial gains. As we can see in the price chart, ETH has repeatedly been rejected from the $4,000 level, as it encounters a formidable sell wall. Despite recent struggles, ETH has reversed considerable bearish sentiment as it recovers from a low of $3,521, a level it dropped to during the previous week. ETH started the previous week in the red, dropping over 7% to plummet to an intraday low of $3,536 before settling at $3,715. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell by 2.30% and settled at $3,630. However, the price bounced back on Wednesday, registering an increase of almost 6% to go above $3,800 and settle at $3,834. ETH continued to push higher on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $3,988 before declining to settle at $3,882, an increase of 1.26%. The price climbed above $3,900 on Friday after registering a marginal increase and settling at $3,907. Source: TradingView Despite the prevailing positive sentiment, ETH was back in the red on Saturday, dropping almost 1% and settling at $3,869. However, buyers returned to the market on Sunday, pushing ETH up just over 2% to $3,956. ETH is marginally up during the current session and trading at $3,977 as it looks to build momentum and go beyond $4,000. Despite its struggles to conquer $4,000, analysts are bullish on ETH and predict it will soon begin catching up to BTC’s gains. Analysts from Bybit have predicted ETH could set a new all-time high in Q1 2025, adding that it is showing strength in derivatives markets. One analyst on X believes ETH is setting up for a move above $8,800, based on the formation of an ascending triangle on the daily chart. Popular crypto analyst Venture Founder highlighted ETH’s historic correlation with Bitcoin’s halving cycle, potentially eclipsing the latter’s momentum by December. “Every cycle, following the Bitcoin halving, Ethereum underperformed BTC for no more than 8 months until it explodes against BTC. We are in the 8th month now. Right on track. Then ETH/BTC Ratio since halving goes to no less than 700% after, which for this cycle means ETH/BTC = 0.39.” Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continues to be bogged down by the 20-day SMA, which is acting as a dynamic level of resistance. As a result, buyers have been unable to push towards $250, with resistance at key levels increasing substantially. SOL’s inability to go above the 20-day SMA dates back to the beginning of December. SOL has repeatedly attempted to go back above the moving average but has been unable to consolidate above it, with selling pressure pushing the price down. The same scenario played out during the previous week, as SOL plummeted almost 9% on Monday, dropping to an intraday low of $203 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL dropped by 1.47% and settled at $213. Source: TradingView SOL rebounded on Wednesday after finding support at this level and registered an increase of 6.38% to settle at $227. Buyers attempted to go above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as SOL reached an intraday high of $234. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and SOL dropped to settle at $227 after a marginal decline. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as SOL dropped 0.96% to $224. Sellers attempted to drag SOL below the 50-day SMA on Saturday as the price dropped to an intraday low of $215. However, buyers prevented a further decline, and SOL ultimately settled at $219. SOL recovered on Sunday as buying activity registered a substantial increase. As a result, SOL rose by almost 2% and settled at $224. The current session sees SOL back in the red, down by just over 1% and trading at $221. If sellers retain control and push SOL below the 50-day SMA, it could drop to $200 before recovering. On the other hand, buyers will look for a way past the 20-day SMA. If SOL can move above this level, it could retest key resistance levels at $240 and $260. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) started December on a bullish note, surging to a high of $2.90 on December 3. Momentum has waned since, with the price unable to go beyond $3, thanks to considerable selling pressure at upper levels. As a result, XRP dropped to $2.17 by December 5 before rising to $2.60 last weekend. However, XRP plummeted at the beginning of the previous week, falling almost 15% to $2.21. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price dropped to an intraday low of $1.90, briefly going below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of just over 7% and settle at $2.37. XRP experienced considerable volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand, and XRP registered an increase of 0.92% and settled at $2.39. Source: TradingView Sellers retired to the market on Thursday as XRP dropped 2.37% to $2.33 before recovering on Friday to register an increase of 3.60% and settle at $2.42. The weekend was mixed for XRP as it fell 0.97% on Saturday after a failed attempt to go above $2.50. However, it recovered on Sunday to register an increase of 1.93% and settle at $2.44. The current session sees XRP back in the red, down by 2.38% and trading around the $2.40 mark. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) has been trading in a narrow range since Monday when it plummeted over 11% to slip below the 20-day SMA and hit an intraday low of $0.382 before recovering to settle at $0.414. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as DOGE dropped to an intraday low of $0.365 before settling at $0.394 after registering a decline of almost 5%. DOGE was back in positive territory on Wednesday, rising by 5.20% and settling at $0.414. However, despite the strong showing, it could not go above the 20-day SMA and fell back on Thursday, dropping just over 2% to $0.406. Source: TradingView DOGE recovered on Friday thanks to support around $0.40 but could not build momentum to go past the 20-day SMA. As a result, it could only register a marginal increase and settle at $0.409. Sellers drove DOGE to an intraday low of $0.387 on Saturday as selling pressure intensified considerably. However, it pushed back from this level to settle at $0.397 before recovering on Sunday and settling at $0.406 after an increase of just over 2%. The current session sees DOGE back in the red as sellers look to drive it below $0.40. DOGE is currently down by 1.35% and trading around $0.404. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) registered a substantial drop last Monday as it fell almost 16% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $1, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $0.91. Despite starting the week in the red, ADA recovered on Tuesday, rising from an intraday low of $0.91, registering an increase of almost 2%, and settling at $1.02. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ADA rose over 6% and settled at $1.08. Buyers pushed ADA above the 20-day SMA on Thursday, registering an increase of 3.22% to $1.12. Source: TradingView However, sentiment changed on Friday as it registered a marginal decrease. Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as ADA dropped below the 20-day SMA, falling over 5% and settling at $1.06. Despite considerable selling pressure, ADA recovered on Sunday to register an increase of 3.58% and settled at $1.09. However, it could not go above the 20-day SMA. The current session sees ADA down almost 2% and trading at $1.07. Injective (NJ) Price Analysis Injective (INJ)’s surge towards $35 halted abruptly last Friday as it lost momentum after reaching $34. The weekend saw a considerable shift in sentiment as INJ dropped just over 3% on Saturday and settled at $32.99. Sunday saw a recovery, with INJ registering an increase of 0.98% and settling at $33.31. However, the price plummeted on Monday, dropping almost 16% to slip below the 20-day SMA and drop to an intraday low of $24.73, where the 50-day SMA prevented a further decline. INJ made a partial recovery from this level to settle at $28.05. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as INJ dropped to a low of $25 before settling at $27.07, registering a decline of 3.49%. Source: TradingView INJ recovered on Wednesday despite overwhelming bearish sentiment, rising by 6.57% and settling at $28.85. The price surged to an intraday high of $30.79 on Thursday, briefly moving above the 20-day SMA. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and INJ ultimately settled at $29.07 after a marginal increase. Buyers maintained control on Friday, with the price rising marginally and settling at $29.27. Bearish sentiment returned on Saturday as INJ dropped by 6.26% and settled at $27.43. It recovered on Sunday, registering an increase of just over 4% and settling at $28.56. The current session sees INJ down almost 3% and trading around $27.80 as sellers look to drive the price toward the 50-day SMA. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Distributing 205 million XAND tokens in rewards, the program saw more than 68% of available XAND staked by users, who were able to earn a 16% APY. Xandeum’s liquid staking program was able to achieve this level of APY through a quadruple rewards system that includes staking rewards, MEV rewards, block rewards, and XAND incentives. By distributing these rewards equitably, Xandeum has shown that there’s scope for liquid staking to grow on Solana and become a mainstay of its decentralized finance economy. What Xandeum does differently By sharing MEV and block rewards with its stakers, Xandeum’s staking model goes beyond traditional reward mechanisms to include features designed to maximize both user value and network resilience. Indeed, this approach has attracted over $7 million worth of SOL to its staking pool. Participants in the program also benefited from transparent governance, with all pool fees directed to the Xandeum DAO treasury, where XAND token holders have decision-making power. By making staking more accessible and rewarding, protocols like Xandeum are playing their part in strengthening the Solana network. The growth of LSTs also deepens liquidity and creates new opportunities across DeFi protocols, allowing for yield to be stacked. From staking to storage Xandeum isn’t stopping with staking. The protocol is preparing to launch its scalable storage layer in early 2025, a development poised to enhance how Solana handles data-intensive applications. Designed to integrate with Solana RPC nodes, Xandeum’s storage layer will enable decentralized storage for exabytes of data. This innovation addresses a critical challenge in blockchain infra: the storage trilemma. By offering a solution that is scalable, cost-effective, and smart contract-native, Xandeum’s storage layer will unlock new use cases for Solana dapps. This will include porting data-rich web2 applications into a decentralized web3 environment and supporting advanced functionalities like machine learning and data analytics onchain. The storage layer also introduces new revenue streams for stakers. Applications using Xandeum’s storage solution will pay fees, a portion of which will be distributed to stakers. Liquid staking as a catalyst for Solana growth Xandeum’s achievements in liquid staking are part of a broader trend within Solana’s growing LST ecosystem. Liquid staking enables greater participation in staking by eliminating the traditional trade-off between earning rewards and maintaining liquidity. For Solana, prized for its speed and efficiency, liquid staking adds another layer of utility, enhancing both user participation and network decentralization. The next step for Solana developers working within this sector is the creation of dapps and protocols that make better use of LSTs. From collateralizing stablecoins to providing liquidity for onchain perps, prediction markets, and DEXes, the possibilities are endless.

37717768,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/decentralized-frameworks-are-the-key-to-make-ai-accessible-to-all,1734345453,Decentralized Frameworks Are The Key To Make AI Accessible To All,"The rapidly growing convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain promises to transform how AI technologies are developed, used and monetized, ensuring their benefits are made available to everyone. To date, the most powerful AI models developed today, such as OpenAI’s GPT models, Anthropic’s Claude and Meta Platform’s Llama 3, are controlled by powerful corporations with vast resources. That’s because these models demand immense computing power, enormous amounts of data and substantial funding that’s unavailable to smaller companies and individual developers, limiting the ability of smaller players to compete. The downside of this has already become apparent, as the most powerful AI tools are already inaccessible to the vast majority, with their creators demanding users pay for “credits” to access them. But with blockchain, this will change, and more people will be able to contribute. The emergence of decentralized AI frameworks supports a greater diversity of contributors to the AI industry, enabling everyone to participate in this exciting and dynamic technology landscape. And with more contributors in the AI space, we will hopefully see the paywalls that have sprung up to access this technology quickly crumble away. How can AI be decentralized? By integrating AI with blockchain, it’s possible to democratize access to both the development of AI models and the use of the applications that leverage them. Decentralized AI frameworks can facilitate collaborative development of large language models, as well as secure and transparent access to those models, plus the underlying data that’s used to train them. By decentralizing these areas, the industry is expanding the opportunities for anyone with AI skills to contribute to the technology’s development. In addition, the transparency of blockchain can ensure that the data used to train new LLMs is verifiable and traceable, paving the way for fair compensation and reducing the risks of AI bias or manipulation. For everyday users, decentralized AI-powered tools such as chatbots, image generators and predictive software will become more accessible, and either free or very affordable to use. It will likely increase the penetration of AI in our everyday lives. Just as important, blockchain enables new ways for AI projects to seek funding. By tokenizing AI models, the infrastructure that runs them and the data used to train them, it’s possible for individuals to invest in the future of AI, and obtain a share of the future revenues generated by these technologies. Decentralized AI supports the community ownership of AI, making it a more inclusive technology that reflects a more diverse range of needs. Most of all, decentralization can lay the groundwork for more widespread adoption of AI. The potential of AI is clear enough, with almost three-quarters of businesses implementing the technology in at least one use case thus far, and 64% reporting that it increases their productivity. If AI becomes more accessible, it stands to reason that even more businesses, and individuals, will want to use it. Who is decentralizing AI? While private companies have taken an early lead in generative AI, there are a number of players who are laying the foundations of decentralized frameworks that will change the game. One of the most promising developers involves a recent partnership between Kite AI and GAIB , who plan to collaborate on a decentralized AI ecosystem that will make high-quality AI models, data and computing resources accessible to AI researchers. Their ecosystem will be built on the blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent data indexing. The blockchain will also support a decentralized marketplace through which anyone can access computing infrastructure, such as graphic processing units, at lower costs. In this partnership, Kite AI provides a coordination layer that integrates blockchain with powerful AI computing resources, as well as enormous datasets for training AI, and pre-built foundational LLMs and AI agents. Meanwhile, GAIB provides access to compute infrastructure through its tokenized GPUs , which are a novel asset class backed by genuine demand. With GAIB, anyone can invest in its tokenized GPUs, which are a yield-bearing asset that generates revenue from those who utilize the resources. Ultimately, Kite AI and GAIB aim to build an ecosystem that supports the monetization of AI assets through DeFi tools such as GPU-backed stablecoins and lending markets. By transforming illiquid GPUs into a liquid asset, GAIB is creating new financial opportunities that anyone can participate in. That’s just one innovative project, but there are many other movers and shakers in decentralized AI. For instance, ORA Protocol is pioneering the concept of “Initial Model Offerings” or IMOs, which involves tokenizing AI models so people can invest in them. It leverages blockchain as the foundation of a marketplace where transparent, collaboratively-developed AI models can be bought and sold by anyone. ORA’s technology is the foundation of an AI chatbot called ChatOLM , which leverages decentralized and distributed GPUs for inference. It’s accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and because it’s built on the blockchain it’s also censorship-resistent, showcasing how decentralized AI applications can better support free speech. Other emerging players include Sentient , which is focused on providing enterprises with blockchain-based tools for the secure, scalable and collaborative Ai development. Meanwhile Sahara AI has built a decentralized AI blockchain to host an open and collaborative AI economy. It provides a way for individuals to monetize their personal knowledge by making it available for AI training, encouraging everyone to participate in this new economy. The Future of AI and Blockchain Decentralized AI is setting the stage for a future in which AI applications are more inclusive, more accessible and more secure. By reducing the barrier to AI development, it will foster collaboration on a global scale, enabling anyone with a vision to put their ideas into practice, no matter where in the world they live. It will transform the AI industry from one where innovation is driven by a handful of corporations to a place where anyone can succeed. The impact of more accessible AI models will be immense, transforming everything from healthcare and education to government and smart cities. It will put more advanced AI tools into the hands of everyone, rather than limiting access to those who can afford to use them. Doing this is key, for most of the world’s most powerful AI models are already sitting behind paywalls, where they only benefit their creators and people with money to pay.

Ethereum has shown remarkable recovery in the past week amidst a bullish uptick to the $4,000 price mark. The altcoin king had been a contrarian play for most of the year but recently gained bullish momentum.However, a new development has raised skepticism within the Ethereum community. Just when the market was relieved from the Ethereum Foundation and co-founder Vitalik Buterin's incessant dumps, Justin Sun might be looking to carry out his own sales.Sun Plans Ethereum DumpOn-chain tracker Spotonchain drew the crypto community’s attention to Sun’s latest attempt to unlock his staked Ethereum.

The world’s premier cryptocurrency has recorded multiple highs since Friday and even briefly crossed above $106,000 on December 15. BTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold BItcoin Sunday-Monday price action in late 2024 Looking at Bitcoin’s recent price history, the truth behind the saying appears, at best, dubious. Through most of November, BTC’s price action was driven by a strong upward momentum that ensured that day over day – whether it be Sunday to Monday or any other part of the week – the cryptocurrency was on the rise. The first notable demonstration of the ‘pump-dump’ dynamic came at the very end of November. Specifically, Bitcoin closed above $98,000 on Sunday, November 24, and, within 24 hours, plunged to $93,102. The same principle – albeit less stark – could be observed on December 1 and 2 – $97,200 to $95,800 – and on December 8 and 9 – $101,236 to $97,400. Considering the performance, it appears plausible that, on Monday, December 16, Bitcoin could retrace toward its nearest support zone just above $102,000. Such a move appears particularly likely as the cryptocurrency is, at press time, halfway between the recent high and the likely short-term bottom at $104,584. While a plunge toward lower supports near $100,000 and $98,000 is possible, it appears unlikely, barring a major market shock both due to the historical price action and the fact that BTC’s relative strength index ( RSI ) is neutral at 69.53, hinting that no particularly decisive move is imminent. What could drive Bitcoin below $100,000 this week? One possible development that could trigger a Bitcoin move below $100,000 would be the news that Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) made another massive cryptocurrency purchase. Indeed, the company has been using the weekends to purchase additional cryptocurrency and one of the biggest ‘Sunday pump-Monday dump’ events coincided with the company’s biggest BTC purchase to date, unveiled on November 25. Another possible danger, despite the generally bullish forecasts, could arise from an observation made by Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency expert on X and one of the analysts responsible for popularizing the ‘rally-downturn’ dynamic.

37719777,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105275,1734344448,Shiba Inu DEX ShibaSwap Prepares to Welcome Liquid Staking,"The Shiba Inu decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap is gearing up for a major upgrade with the anticipated introduction of liquid staking. Shibarium Updates (@Shibizens), an X channel focused on Shibarium ecosystem disclosures, alerted the public to the upcoming upgrade over the weekend. “Liquid staking is coming to ShibaSwap,” the channel remarked , describing the upgrade as the next level of DeFi. According to the latest disclosure, the development was unveiled on Shiba Inu’s rebranded website. Liquid Staking on ShibaSwap Notably, the liquid staking feature will enable ShibaSwap users to stake their tokens on the DEX while retaining liquidity. Through the feature, users can earn rewards on their staked assets and still gain access to their locked assets. Upon staking their tokens through the liquid staking feature, users will receive liquid tokens representing their staked assets. Interestingly, users can utilize the liquid tokens for trading and as collateral on DeFi platforms. In the ShibaSwap case, @Shibizens disclosed that users will receive liquid Treat tokens (veTREAT) when they stake their TREAT tokens using the liquid staking feature. Aside from representing users’ stakes, veTREAT also grants holders governance power to control the allocation of rewards for liquidity mining. It bears mentioning that TREAT is not yet available for public use. Karma Point System Another upcoming feature from the ShibaSwap update is a Karma Point system, where users earn points by participating in certain activities. One such activity is transferring Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens, such as SHIB, BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. Furthermore, providing liquidity on ShibaSwap is another way to earn Karma points on the DEX. The points users earn in the Karma system help to enhance their voting power within the Shib Doggy DAO. It bears mentioning that the Shib Doggy DAO is not live yet. Nonetheless, the team plans to launch the decentralized autonomous organization before the end of next year, potentially allowing token holders to vote on key initiatives related to Shiba Inu. No Official Launch Date for Liquid Staking on ShibaSwap Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team has yet to reveal a timeline for liquid staking launch on ShibaSwap. In the meantime, users who wish to stake their tokens using the liquid staking feature can do so on K9 Finance, a Shibarium-based liquid staking and derivative platform. The team behind the project remains the official liquid staking partner of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Since its September 18 launch on Shibarium, K9 Finance has registered 248 stakers, who have successfully staked 2,426,390 (2.42 million) BONE. At press time, K9's liquid staking token, knBONE, has a market cap of $1.45 million. ShibaSwap UpgradesShibaSwap has welcomed significant upgrades since it launched on Ethereum in July 2021. It transitioned to Shibarium earlier this year, making the DEX a multi-chain decentralized crypto exchange. The migration allows users to swap their tokens between the Ethereum and Shibarium networks while enhancing SHIB burns. In October, the development team behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem launched the highly anticipated ShibaSwap 2.0, introducing new features like seamless migration and centralized liquidity pools.",POSITIVE,SHIB,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | SHIB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/16/shiba-inu-dex-shibaswap-prepares-to-welcome-liquid-staking/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-dex-shibaswap-prepares-to-welcome-liquid-staking,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37712057,https://invezz.com/?p=2388755,1734344313,Four tokens that will deliver 30x returns in the next 60 days,"Driven by invention, utility, and growing acceptance across many industries, the crypto market is once more heating up. Smart investors realize that cryptocurrencies with strong ecosystems and transforming potential may often yield large gains. Four tokens stand out as the best candidates to provide explosive expansion in the next months: Rexas Finance (RXS), Tron (TRX), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT). These initiatives are highly sought after in the market and profit from technology developments and growing user demand. Rexas Finance (RXS) changes asset tokenization Leading the drive in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—a novel idea that democratizes access to investments like real estate, commodities, and other physical assets— is Rexas Finance. Rexas removes conventional constraints such as expensive entrance charges and complicated procedures by allowing fractional ownership, therefore enabling worldwide involvement in once-restricted businesses. With about $25.33 million raised out of its $26.38 million target, the RXS token is presently in its ninth presale stage at $0.125. Strong demand is shown by investors having already bought over 97% of the accessible tokens. The token price will next rise to $0.15, and RXS is expected to list for $0.20. As the real-world uses and ecosystem utilities of the token acquire traction, early investors could perhaps witness 30x returns. Comprising a whole platform with creative tools like the Rexas Token Builder, which streamlines asset tokenization, and the Rexas Launchpad, which facilitates safe and distributed token funding, the Rexas ecosystem Added great value are other features such as Rexas GenAI for NFT generation, Rexas DeFi for multi-chain crypto trading, and Rexas Estate, which lets co-ownership of real estate possible. Rexas Finance is also holding an interesting $1 million giveaway with 20 winners who will get $50,000 in RXS tokens. Participants can start by doing assignments and increasing their entries with referrals. This program not only honors early adopters but also promotes community development, hence raising the profile and attraction of the platform. Tron (TRX): Leading scalable blockchain innovations Long a mainstay of the crypto scene, Tron (TRX) is well-known for stressing distributed content sharing and scalable blockchain technology. Having a market capitalization of more than $7 billion and a price of $0.20, TRX has proven durability and a steady increase over time. Tron’s strength resides in its capacity to minimally process enormous volumes of transactions. Adopted mostly for distributed apps (dApps), it offers a vibrant ecosystem supporting gaming, DeFi, and NFT initiatives. Moreover, Tron is a pillar of blockchain-based payments because of his relationships with important companies and the integration of USDT (Tether). Particularly in relation to a larger market rise, TRX is probably going to experience big gains as the blockchain field keeps growing. Its established infrastructure and continuous advancements make it a top prospect for a 30x return. Toncoin (TON) expands Telegram’s crypto ecosystem Benefiting from a direct connection with Telegram, one of the most used messaging programs worldwide, Toncoin (TON) is another strong rival for fast expansion. TON offers a seamless ecosystem for payments, dApps, and other blockchain applications using Telegram’s enormous user base. TON’s value inside Telegram’s infrastructure places it as a major participant in the crypto scene given a present price of roughly $6.3. TON has a special advantage because of features such as in-app crypto transactions and connections with distributed exchanges. Toncoin is poised to explode as Telegram keeps releasing blockchain-enabled products since it provides consumers with a quick and easy approach to interacting with cryptocurrencies. Especially in a crypto bull market, TON’s real-world value and strong support from Telegram make it a high-potential token capable of attaining a 30x return in the next 60 days. Polkadot (DOT): constructing blockchain internet Polkadot (DOT) is among the most creative initiatives in the crypto scene, designed to allow interoperability between blockchains. Its multi-chain design solves one of the main problems in the sector by letting several blockchains exchange and share data. Trading at $8.64, DOT has a market capitalization of almost $7 billion. Both businesses and developers love it because of its scalability and support of a broad spectrum of applications. With more parachains produced and included in its system, the Polkadot ecosystem keeps expanding. Polkadot’s usefulness and acceptance should surge as demand for interoperable solutions rises. Driven by DOT’s technical prowess and expanding ecosystem, its price may potentially rise thirty times. Every one of these tokens—Rexas Finance (RXS), Tron (TRX), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT)—adds something special to the mix. These currencies position themselves to provide outsized gains as the crypto market gets ready for yet another bull run. These ventures should be taken under consideration by investors wishing to profit from the next wave of crypto acceptance since their robust foundations and creative applications make them perfect candidates for exponential expansion.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

Analysts Explained!,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records by reaching an all-time high above $106,000 in the first hours of the new week. What are the reasons for the rise? The catalysts behind this rise include increasing speculation that US President-elect Donald Trump will create a Bitcoin reserve and large companies such as Riot Platforms and MicroStrategy purchasing billions of dollars worth of BTC. Apart from these, it was stated that historical data and expectations regarding the interest rate decision of the US Federal Reserve, which will be announced this week, are also included. Bitcoin rose above $106,000 today to reach an all-time high as investors grew more hopeful of a Fed rate cut over the weekend, experts told CNBC. According to experts, the BTC rally is being driven by expectations of a 97% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut, which is considered positive for Bitcoin due to its correlation with lower interest rates, a weaker dollar, and an expanding money supply. Data Shows Bitcoin Rally Will Continue! Analysts speaking to Coindesk said that BTC rose on optimism regarding changes in US crypto policy. Augustine Fan, senior manager at SOFA, said that optimism in US crypto policies has increased inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, thereby accelerating the BTC rally. Fan said that unlike previous crypto cycles, traditional finance (TradFi) inflows have dominated the BTC rally in the current cycle. Fan said that he thinks that more and more traditional companies will need cryptocurrencies in light of the huge revenue opportunities and changes in the political environment. “This effect will only grow and accelerate the rally. Also, Bitcoin’s recent price action has shown that BTC is forming higher lows, which is an indication of a sustainable uptrend.” Crypto exchange BTSE COO Jeff Mei also evaluated the recent rise in Bitcoin, stating that BTC still has a great potential for growth and that he expects more growth. Mei stated that Bitcoin is ready for a rise called the “Santa Claus Rally” according to historical data and said that according to data from the last eight years, Bitcoin has closed December in the green six times since 2015 and increased by up to 46 percent. “We still think Bitcoin has tremendous upside potential and could easily reach $125,000 by 2025. While some say the upside has been priced in over the last month, we believe the upside is just beginning. The idea of institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals allocating 1%-3% of their portfolios to Bitcoin and crypto may take some time, but when it happens, prices will skyrocket. “There are also many reasons to be optimistic about the continued rally, given Trump’s pro-crypto appointments, continued rate cuts, and stimulus spending from China.” *This is not investment advice.

37710653,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393537,1734344209,Traditional Commodity Trading vs. Cryptocurrency Trading: An In-Depth Analysis,"The post Traditional Commodity Trading vs. Cryptocurrency Trading: An In-Depth Analysis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cryptocurrency trading has transformed the financial landscape, introducing new asset classes alongside long-standing traditional commodities. This article will explore the differences between conventional commodity trading and cryptocurrency trading, focusing on investor perceptions, particularly regarding assets like gold and digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will also investigate whether these assets are considered safe havens or risk-on options in modern portfolios. Understanding Traditional Commodity Trading Traditional commodities are raw materials or primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold, such as oil, natural gas, copper, and metals like gold and silver. Commodity trading, such as gold trading , can occur on exchanges or through contracts for differences where standardized agreements are used. Types of Commodity Assets Crude oil and natural gas are vital for global energy supplies and directly influence economic activity and inflation. Softs(Cocoa and coffee) are essential for food supply chains and are closely tied to weather patterns and seasonal cycles. Precious metals (gold, silver) are often viewed as stores of value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. A store of value is an asset that maintains its value over time and can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged in the future without significant loss in purchasing power. The primary characteristics of a good store of value include stability, durability, divisibility, and transferability. Market Dynamics Supply and demand factors, geopolitical events, and macroeconomic indicators influence commodity markets. For instance, disruptions in oil supply due to political unrest in oil-producing regions can drive prices up, while bumper harvests can lower prices for agricultural commodities. The Emergence of Cryptocurrency Trading Cryptocurrency trading involves the buying and selling digital currencies that utilize blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions. Bitcoin, often dubbed digital gold, was the first cryptocurrency, and others like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple have followed. Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger system that enables secure, transparent, and verifiable transactions across a network of computers. A blockchain consists of a series of linked “blocks,” each containing a list of transactions. Each block is secured using cryptographic techniques, making it tamper-resistant and ensuring the integrity of the data. Types of Cryptocurrencies The first and most recognized cryptocurrency is often seen as a store of value similar to gold. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network and is capped at 21 million coins. Other cryptocurrencies, collectively known as altcoins, include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC), each with unique use cases, technologies, and market dynamics. Market Dynamics High volatility , unregulated exchanges, and a developing regulatory framework characterize cryptocurrency markets. Prices can swing dramatically based on market sentiment, technological advancements, regulatory announcements, and macroeconomic factors. Investor Perspectives on Gold and Cryptocurrency For centuries, gold has been viewed as a safe-haven asset. Investors flock to gold during economic downturns or periods of geopolitical instability due to its intrinsic value and limited supply. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation. When fiat currencies lose value, gold’s value tends to remain stable or appreciated, making it an attractive option for risk-averse investors. The price of gold tends to rise when stock markets falter, establishing it as a counterbalance within investment portfolios. During significant financial crises, such as the 2008 financial crash or the COVID-19 pandemic, gold prices saw substantial increases. The New Contender for Safe Haven Status Unlike gold, cryptocurrencies are notorious for their volatility, often experiencing sharp price swings within short time frames. This volatility has led many conservative investors to categorize cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, as high-risk assets. Some proponents of Bitcoin argue that it represents “digital gold,” suggesting that its scarcity (due to the capped supply of 21 million BTC) and decentralized nature equip it with similar characteristics to gold as a reliable store of value. However, this belief is contested, particularly when Bitcoin’s price experiences rapid fluctuations. Encouraging parallels with gold, several investors view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. With central banks engaging in quantitative easing and increasing money supply, some believe Bitcoin’s algorithmically controlled supply makes it resilient to inflationary pressures. Comparing Safe-Haven Status Gold has universally held its status as a haven. It has a proven record of preserving value during economic downturns and geopolitical uncertainties. Traditional investors often use gold to protect their wealth, especially in turbulent times. Risk-On Behavior Investors often categorize cryptocurrencies as “risk-on” assets due to their high volatility and speculative nature. Unlike gold, the cryptocurrency market is still developing, and its long-term resilience in crises remains to be comprehensively tested. Cryptocurrencies can thrive in bullish market conditions, experiencing rapid price appreciation driven by investor enthusiasm. However, they may swiftly decline during market sell-offs or when regulatory scrutiny increases, leading many to treat crypto as a speculative investment rather than a reliable safe haven. Investor sentiment significantly influences cryptocurrency prices. Positive news can drive investments and inflows, leading to price surges, while negative news—such as regulatory crackdowns or technological setbacks—can cause widespread panic selling. Younger investors tend to be more attracted to cryptocurrencies, viewing them as innovative and a means to achieve financial independence. In contrast, older investors are more likely to trust traditional commodities like gold, which have stood the test of time. Risk Profiles, Gold vs. Cryptocurrency Gold prices do experience fluctuations, but they tend to be more stable than cryptocurrencies. Market interventions, central bank purchases, and established trading history contribute to a more controlled risk environment for gold. Gold is heavily regulated, adding a layer of security and predictability that cryptocurrencies lack. High-Risk Terrain Cryptocurrencies are susceptible to speculative trading, leading to substantial price swings based purely on investor sentiment rather than fundamental economic indicators. The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies adds a layer of uncertainty. Potential government actions and regulations could significantly impact market dynamics, making cryptocurrencies riskier than traditional commodities. While blockchain technology is secure, crypto wallets and exchanges are not impervious to hacking. Security breaches can lead to significant losses for investors, a risk factor that does not exist with physical commodities. The Investment Strategies: Allocating Assets Investors engaging in commodity trading often diversify their portfolios across various commodities to mitigate risk. For instance, combining investments in agricultural products, metals, and energy commodities can buffer against price fluctuations in any single commodity. Many commodity investors use futures contracts to hedge against price fluctuations. Companies that produce or rely on commodities can lock in prices to stabilize their financial performance. Given gold’s historical nature as a store of value, many traditional investors adopt long-term holding strategies, especially during uncertain economic periods or significant geopolitical events. Cryptocurrency Investors The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies attracts many traders who engage in short-term trading strategies, aiming to capitalize on price swings. This approach requires keen market insights and often involves technical analysis. Conversely, some investors buy and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, believing in their long-term potential to disrupt financial systems and act as reliable stores of value akin to gold. With the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi), many cryptocurrency investors seek to yield farmers, staking their coins to earn interest or rewards. This strategy adds complexity to cryptocurrency investment and shifts focus from simply holding onto price appreciation. The Future of Gold and Cryptocurrency Trading Despite growing competition from cryptocurrencies, gold will likely retain a significant role in investors’ portfolios as a haven and inflation hedge. Its historical and intrinsic value continues to attract a portion of investors, especially during times of crisis. Expanding Horizons As cryptocurrencies evolve, they could solidify their position in modern investment strategies. Innovations in blockchain technology and the push for regulatory clarity across jurisdictions could foster a more stable environment for crypto investments. Integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems could provide legitimacy and a more stable market for these assets. Increasing institutional investment in cryptocurrencies could lead to broader acceptance and pave the way for future growth, paralleling how institutional investments have historically benefited gold. With governments worldwide increasingly focusing on regulating cryptocurrencies, clarity could lead to a more secure environment for investment, thus potentially broadening their appeal as more than just speculative assets. Conclusion The comparison between traditional commodity trading and cryptocurrency trading reveals profound differences in investment characteristics, risk profiles, and investor perceptions. Gold remains a time-tested safe haven while assets like Bitcoin still navigate their place in modern portfolios, oscillating between risk-on investment and a potential store of value. As investors increasingly seek diversification in their strategies, understanding the unique attributes of gold and cryptocurrencies will be critical for making informed decisions. While gold’s status as a refuge during economic tumult persists, cryptocurrencies introduce a new dimension of opportunity and risk, reflecting the continually evolving landscape of financial assets. Ultimately, whether viewed as a risk-on asset or a haven, both gold and cryptocurrencies will continue to play essential roles in shaping the future of investment. As markets develop, the relationship between traditional commodities and digital currencies will evolve, offering new avenues for exploration in the complex world of finance.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/guest-post/traditional-commodity-trading-vs-cryptocurrency-trading-an-in-depth-analysis/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The Filecoin ICO is one such example. When it first launched, Filecoin was met with great anticipation. Investors saw it as a potential game-changer in decentralised storage, and they weren’t wrong. Early adopters of Filecoin were reaping massive rewards, with the price rising exponentially from the ICO stage to its peak in the market. Those who managed to get in during the early days had nothing short of staggering returns. However, if you missed out on Filecoin, there’s no need to feel left behind. A new opportunity on the horizon is already making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). The Journey of Filecoin: A Story of Missed Opportunities and Huge Gains Back in 2017, Filecoin’s ICO raised over $200 million, marking one of the largest fundraising events in the cryptocurrency space. The price was modest at launch, and many investors jumped on board, believing in the project’s long-term potential. Fast forward a few years, and Filecoin’s token skyrocketed in value, rewarding early backers handsomely. Filecoin’s story is one of early vision, calculated risk, and incredible success. Its price surged as high as $200 per token, leaving those with significant gains. The regret is palpable for those who missed the boat, and the search for the next big opportunity is ever-present. Unlock Big Potential with Qubetics: The Best Altcoin to Buy Now For those still lamenting their missed opportunity with Filecoin, here’s your chance to get ahead of the curve with Qubetics. If you’re looking for the best altcoin to buy now, Qubetics might just be the answer. The project is currently in its presale, with impressive success that rivals some of the most well-known ICOs in crypto history. Qubetics is on Phase 12 of its presale , and with each passing week, the price is set to increase by 10%. As the presale moves towards its final stage, expect a 20% price hike, meaning early investment could pay off significantly. With $TICS tokens currently priced at $0.031 , the presale has already raised over $6.4 million, with more than 9,700 holders and 334 million tokens sold. Analysts predict a post-presale price target of $0.25 per token, representing a massive potential ROI for early adopters. But that’s not all. Once Qubetics goes live with its mainnet, analysts are forecasting that the price could hit anywhere between $10 and $15 per token.

37710566,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312952,1734344102,"This Crypto Sector Is About To Do a Repeat of 2021 Explosion, According to Top Trader","A veteran crypto trader says that one digital assets sector is about to pull off an under-the-radar repeat of its 2021 rallies. The pseudonymous trader known as Bluntz tells his 304,000 followers on the social media platform X that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is “de-risked” following news that the crypto project linked to President-elect Donald Trump has accumulated tokens. Says Bluntz, “The president is accumulating DeFi coins and is making his own DeFi company. I think it’s safe to assume DeFi is now de-risked and due for a 2021 repeat.” Crypto intelligence platform Arkham recently reported that Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) platform purchased $50 million worth of DeFi coins, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Chainlink ( LINK ), and Aave ( AAVE ). Taking note of WLFI’s purchases, Bluntz says he’s bullish on the decentralized stablecoin protocol Ethena ( ENA ), noting that traders are shorting the altcoin. “The president is buying ENA and funding is negative -0.05. I seriously wonder what goes through people’s brains sometimes. Who is shorting that?” Similarly, the trader is bullish on AAVE after a very lengthy accumulation period. He says that a shot to all-time highs for AAVE is now a near-certainty. “Aave has an amazing high time frame chart here in my opinion. It accumulated for 833 days of hell, that’s a long-a** accumulation and is now well and truly in the markup phase. There is no way this isn’t seeing all-time highs. The president-elect is literally green-lighting DeFi with his actions and he’s not in office yet. Skate to where the puck is going.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, AAVE is worth $367.87.

37710534,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393514,1734344030,Could Ripple’s XRP Become SBI Holdings’ Secret Weapon for Growth?,"The post Could Ripple’s XRP Become SBI Holdings’ Secret Weapon for Growth? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SBI Holdings, one of Japan’s financial giants, is under growing pressure to go all-in on XRP. GAM Investments, a global asset manager, has urged SBI to focus more on its XRP holdings, suggesting that the company adopt a bold strategy to realize its hidden potential. Meanwhile, Ripple’s native token, XRP, has become the center of attention, surging an incredible 500% in just one month. Why XRP Matters to SBI? For years, SBI Holdings has been a strong supporter of Ripple and blockchain technology. The company holds an 8% to 9% share of Ripple Labs and owns a substantial amount of XRP tokens. Despite this, SBI’s market value doesn’t seem to reflect the true worth of these crypto assets. GAM pointed out that SBI’s current market capitalization of JPY 1.2 trillion is far below the estimated JPY 1.6 trillion value of its Ripple and XRP investments. This creates a significant gap between the company’s actual net asset value (NAV) and its perceived market value. A Game-Changing Proposal GAM believes SBI has a unique opportunity to follow in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy, which made headlines by heavily investing in Bitcoin. They suggested that SBI start buying XRP directly from the market, creating a buyback program that could boost the token’s value while showcasing SBI’s commitment to cryptocurrency. With this approach, GAM believes this strategy could increase SBI’s market value, bringing it closer to its estimated worth of JPY 3.9 trillion. By reducing the supply of XRP in circulation, the program might push up its price, benefiting both SBI and the crypto market as a whole. Ripple’s XRP Growing Popularity XRP has become one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market recently. The token is attracting a lot of attention, thanks to the launch of RLUSD and growing excitement around a potential XRP ETF approval. As of now, XRP is trading at around $2.39 , showing a slight dip of 1.2%, with a market cap of $136.76 billion.",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/could-ripples-xrp-become-sbi-holdings-secret-weapon-for-growth/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37710431,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393530,1734343771,Are Desktop Platforms Better For Online Trading?,"The post Are Desktop Platforms Better For Online Trading? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mobile phones started off as a convenient way to make a phone call when you’re away from home. However, it’s clear that, since then, they have morphed into something entirely different. This seems apparent from the fact that, on average, we touch our phones 3 times per minute. Or, if you prefer another statistic: Over half of American adults testify they “couldn’t live without” their smartphones. This doesn’t sound quite like a casual or utilitarian sort of relationship. Psychologists have suggested that our connections with our phones have become an “attachment relationship”, meaning that they take on the role of a significant other in our lives – one that is always available, controllable, and touchable. This explains our emotional responses to their being lost or broken, which seem completely out of proportion. At the basis of this issue, so they say, is a lack of self-esteem, from which about nine in 10 of us are said to suffer. Like any relationship, this one has its limits. It’s not healthy to bring it into every single corner of our lives. The focus of this article is on the extent to which you should bring it into the arena of online trading. The alternative, in this case, is a desktop platform which sits in a corner of your office, patiently waiting for the daily attention you bestow on it. Is your well-mannered PC, perhaps, a better partner in your battles with the markets than that frenzied mobile phone, which ceaselessly beeps and rings for your attention throughout the day? Let’s find out. Real Time There’s one clear advantage which mobile trading apps have over their desktop counterparts: You can carry them around with you. This quality might not be valuable in many of your other relationships, say with your spouse, but, in this case, it really is. That’s because it allows you to check on asset prices whenever and wherever you want, which can give you an edge in planning and executing your deals that you couldn’t get in any other way. By the time you get home, that perfect entry price may very well have slipped away. Securities are volatile, fluctuating all the time in response to various factors that act in complex ways. There’s no way of knowing what will be ahead for them, even on the immediate horizon. The only thing for it, at least if you’re in the business of short-term trading, is to carry around a mobile version of your trading app. On the other hand, you know what they say about too much of a good thing. Having a device in your purse that (a) never stops sending you price alerts, and (b) actually allows you to act on them, can sometimes be detrimental. The endless series of ringings can increase your nervousness and stir you to trade inappropriately and excessively. Deal making requires a calm spirit and a steady mind, which is difficult to maintain while hailing a taxi or paying your restaurant bill. Yes, there may come times when you must open trades on the go, but the concern is that you’ll become trigger happy if you get into the habit. And this concern should be taken seriously because you’ll often have a strong initial reaction to new data – one that may not be the wisest when considered in the quiet solitude of your office. The Interface Mobile trading apps often need to cut down on features in order to adapt the platform to their reduced storage and processing capabilities. To the extent that this is true for you, you need to shoot for desktop to ensure you are employing your app to the utmost. Mobile app developers have indeed made a lot of progress in adapting their products to the smaller physical scale, and this is likely to continue as more and more crafty minds are put to the task. When it comes to trading online, however, they face a unique problem: It just ain’t the same. Many traders like to keep several screens facing them simultaneously in order to monitor global news, check up on other assets, and peruse price charts. The process of staying on the ball with respect to the factors affecting price movements requires clear, compartmentalized thinking. For instance, you have to know whether or not the stock information you received yesterday came from a reliable source, and not some random voice on social media, and you need to confirm this quickly. Alternatively: Was the Head and Shoulders pattern you saw a few minutes ago on the price chart for USD/JPY or EUR/USD? Keeping things like this clear in your mind is more easily done on a desktop platform than a mobile one. Besides, toggling between different windows on your mobile phone in order to stay abreast of the markets is not exactly ideal. Online trading is like walking a tightrope, which you wouldn’t do while playing a game of chess. Therefore, make life easier for yourself and, even if you can’t afford to buy several screens, at least trade from a desktop workspace. A sense of spaciousness improves your psychological wellbeing, inspires creative thinking, and gives you the chance to focus intently on a single task for long periods. Each one of these things can literally make the difference between success and failure in your trading efforts. Add to this the fact that desktops work well when you’re collaborating with several other people, allowing you all to look at the same data together, which we cannot say for smartphones. Power Since the technological frameworks in our times exist on a tiny scale, you might think that your smartphone packs as big a punch as a desktop PC. This is not quite the case, especially in online trading, where specialized and complex software is put to use. Inside a desktop computer, you’ll find all kinds of specialized items like the CPU (central processing unit), RAM (random access memory), SSD (solid state drive), and GPU (graphics processing unit), and the list goes on. All of these are carefully selected and calibrated to work together harmoniously. The extra spaciousness in your desktop PC does make a difference to your processing power because it houses a larger CPU, which takes care of all the processing. The same goes for your RAM, which is considerably inferior on a mobile phone. What does RAM do? It lodges the short-term memory which the computer needs for daily functions like running apps. The CPU utilizes the RAM in order to run your applications. When RAM is fast, it implies the CPU can channel data more quickly and efficiently. Weaker RAM means you’ll be sitting and waiting longer for apps to open. Advanced trading software can be particularly demanding on the RAM, so it will work better on a desktop system than a mobile phone. Other Considerations Mobile phones run on batteries, which run out, and this can be rather frustrating when you’re trying to close a sensitive deal. By contrast, your desktop PC enjoys a more stable power supply. Similarly with regard to your internet connection, you’re likely to experience less trouble when operating from your home setup. Besides this, consider the fact that your phone can be stolen fairly easily, while your desktop sits obediently in your office, staying out of trouble. Needless to say, you don’t want a thief to able to take control of the deals you were setting up, (unless he has some really good ideas). In terms of damage, your phone is much more vulnerable than your desktop and can find itself out of commission after a single drop to the floor. The types of things that need repairing or replacing in your desktop, though, are comparatively cheap, for example the mouse and keyboard. Thus, when doing something as work intensive as online trading, it makes sense to go desktop. Wrapping Things Up As you may have gathered, we tend to favour desktop setups over mobile phones for active online traders. At the same time, we’ll say this: Why not use the mobile app to get price updates when you have to be on the move? After all, doing that doesn’t require much of a calm mind. Certainly though, for any type of research or analysis, it’s hard to see how you could do as good a job on a smartphone (even a big one) as on a high-fidelity computer monitor. Instead of pitting one against the other, let the phone and the PC do their designated jobs in peace and harmony together!

37710498,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627993,1734343622,"Ripple CTO drops RLUSD bombshell, “Don’t FOMO into this stablecoin”","David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO, issued a warning regarding potential price volatility for RLUSD, a new USD-pegged stablecoin. This comes in when the RLUSD is heading toward its market debut while Ripple Labs gains regulatory clarity in the United States. Bullish sentiments emerging from investors for Ripple can be seen in the recent XRP price action. Ripple’s native crypto price has surged by 142% in the last 30 days and more than 335% over the past 60 days. A major boost came in for the blockchain firm after US Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gensler decided to step down after Donald Trump’s presidential election win. Ripple CTO spots risk among investors Schwartz in a post addressed the risk of RLUSD trading above its $1 parity due to early supply shortages. He cited that pre-market bids valuing RLUSD as high as $1,200 are driven by buyer excitement. He added that the tools will show you the highest price that anyone is willing to pay, even if it’s just for a tiny bit. He suggested that this may be someone who wants to brag about the honor of buying the first bit of RLUSD on the DEX. The Ripple CTO clarified that such inflated prices would be short-lived and stated that the price would come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. He cautioned that If it doesn’t happen then something is seriously very wrong. He led out a warning and clarified that if one wants to spend a lot of money to get a tiny bit of RLUSD before anyone else does, they can. However, they don’t need to expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize. Schwartz also urged investors not to FOMO into RLUSD and highlighted that this is not an opportunity to get rich. He further added, “Please remember, that a stablecoin’s purpose is to have a stable price.” Ripple riding the bullish wave Ripple plans to use RLUSD to power cross-border payments on XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum. The New York Department of Financial Services approved the stablecoin on December 11, but a launch date has not been announced yet. Meanwhile, XRP price has surged to a seven-year high of $2.74, marking a fivefold increase in just 30 days. This rally marks renewed investor confidence in the ecosystem. XRP has beaten Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptos with a massive 290% year-to-date (YTD) jump. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.39, at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 67% to stand at $64.71 billion. With ongoing bullish momentum for Ripple, XRP has managed to climb up in the tally of the biggest cryptos. XRP displaced Solana (SOL) and BNB to bag the 4th spot in the rankings. It is holding a market cap of $136.3 billion, standing just short of Tether (USDT).

37710119,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662796,1734343227,Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Coins To Watch This Week,"The crypto ecosystem is on the cusp of yet another significant week, ushered in by several major developments taking place across different networks. This week’s spotlight falls on Bitcoin, Fantom, Avalanche, Stacks, and LayerZero, each of which is facing a pivotal milestone. The broader macro backdrop is also critical, particularly the December 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest-rate decision in the United States. #1 Bitcoin And Crypto Await The FOMC Decision Bitcoin traders and investors are watching the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday, December 18, at 2:00 pm ET, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference to follow at 2:30 pm ET. Saxo Bank writes in their latest investor note, “The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver a 25 basis-points (bps) rate cut this week, reducing the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.25-4.50%.” According to futures data, there is a 95% probability of this move, which follows a similar cut in November. While the rate cut is seemingly priced in, the market will scrutinize the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and its “dot plot,” which depict the expected path of policy rates for 2025 and beyond. Any signal that the Federal Reserve could limit the pace of future cuts—particularly if it revises the dot plot from four rate cuts in 2025 down to three or even two—might weigh on risk-on assets such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Many analysts point to the labor market, which has been softening, and to easing shelter inflation, evidenced by slowing rental price growth, as key justifications for additional rate cuts. Related Reading: Crypto Market Hit Hard With $1.7 Billion Liquidated, Largest Event Since 2021 However, the Fed may convey a more cautious stance and highlight so-called “Trump-flation” risks, referencing the possibility of renewed trade tariffs under the incoming Trump administration that could push inflation higher. If such inflationary risks remain persistent, the Fed might pause or reduce the pace of cuts in 2025, which would be viewed as a hawkish twist. The new dot plot for 2025 is currently expected to show around 3.625%—a baseline assumption of three rate cuts next year—but the market has speculated that this could move to 3.875% if the Fed becomes more cautious. The immediate reaction in Bitcoin will likely hinge on the meeting’s tone, with a less dovish Fed potentially introducing volatility to BTC price action. #2 Fantom (FTM) Fantom is entering a new era with the upcoming Sonic L1 mainnet launch, a transformative upgrade that will dramatically improve network throughput and cost efficiency. Developers behind Fantom have highlighted that Sonic is capable of processing approximately 10,000 transactions per second, with near-instant finality—a marked leap from current network capabilities. The planned modifications are also set to cut operational expenditures, with a reported 66% decrease in validator node costs and minimized storage requirements. Another important detail is Fantom’s decision to maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which should make it straightforward for EVM-based applications to migrate to the upgraded chain without modifying their underlying code. Sonic will also debut a new token, denoted as S, which will replace the existing FTM token at a one-to-one ratio. The crypto trader Jacob Canfield stated via X, “Shared this setup x subs last week, but FTM is close to a price discovery break. Needs to clear the bearish impulse base and close a 4 hour candle and we will probably see swift price discovery. The chart coincides nicely with the SONIC launch.” #3 Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche will be another focal point in the crypto industry, as the Avalanche9000 upgrade is set to go live on the mainnet today, on December 16. This follows a testnet debut on the “Fuji” testnet on November 25. Related Reading: Crypto Market Outlook: VanEck Issues 10 Predictions, Including Bitcoin Nearing $200,000 The highly anticipated mainnet launch is described by Avalanche’s core developers as the most significant upgrade in the chain’s history. Compounding the buzz is Avalanche’s December 12 announcement of a $250 million private token sale led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital, with more than 40 other entities participating. According to official statements, this fundraising round strengthens Avalanche’s treasury, already valued at around $3 billion in AVAX tokens, and comes on the back of a previous $230 million token sale in 2021. Avalanche9000 incorporates the Etna Upgrade and key community proposals ACP-77 and ACP-125, altogether reimagining how Avalanche’s subnets function—now referred to as layer-1s. In doing so, Avalanche transitions from a costly validator system requiring 2,000 AVAX per instance to a more subscription-like model that charges 1.33 AVAX per month. The upgrade also focuses on cross-chain connectivity, enabling more sophisticated interchain communication within Avalanche’s broader ecosystem. #4 Stacks (STX) Stacks is another name to keep on the radar as it prepares to launch sBTC on Tuesday, December 17, at 11:00 am ET. This new BTC-backed asset is designed to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity directly into the DeFi sphere on Stacks, offering a rewards program that is notably free of staking requirements. According to the project’s official announcement, the sBTC Rewards Program provides a 5% annual Bitcoin reward, paid out in bi-weekly installments, and the distribution is made in actual Bitcoin, not third-party tokens. The program’s first phase, commencing on December 17, will focus on deposit functionality and immediate rewards accrual for sBTC holders. The second phase, currently planned for March 2025, is expected to layer in more advanced DeFi capabilities and reward structures, thereby broadening the utility of sBTC. #5 LayerZero (ZRO) LayerZero rounds out the week’s watchlist with a governance milestone. On December 20, 2024, at 00:00 UTC, ZRO token holders will engage in the network’s first-ever fee switch referendum, a vote that could activate a protocol fee on every LayerZero message. The referendum is straightforward, posing the single question, “Turn the fee switch on?” A majority vote of “Yes,” assuming quorum is met, would enact a fee that matches the underlying DVN and Executor costs for each message, effectively doubling the cost of each cross-chain transmission. The collected fees would then be used to buy back and burn ZRO, potentially reducing the circulating supply and impacting the token’s economics. ZRO balances across Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum are all factored into each holder’s voting power, consolidated seamlessly through LayerZero’s lzRead feature. The referendum will last seven days, concluding on December 27, 2024. A 60% quorum of the circulating supply is required for the vote to be valid; if that threshold is not met, the outcome defaults to “No.” If the referendum passes, the protocol fee would be immediately activated, potentially shifting the dynamics of how developers and users manage cross-chain communications. This governance mechanism is set to repeat every six months, though the quorum requirement would decrease by 5% each time if it is not met, down to a minimum floor of 20%. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $104,748.

37710141,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393490,1734343196,Hidden Gem Alert: This Token Could 3x Before the Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Dogecoin (DOGE) Prices Reach $1,"The post Hidden Gem Alert: This Token Could 3x Before the Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Dogecoin (DOGE) Prices Reach $1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many crypto coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are currently spiking. However, discovering the next token that could skyrocket during this time may bring life-changing returns. Experts think that one such crypto coin is IntelMarkets (INTL) – a phase seven presale star that has already experienced a 610% price surge. Even if SHIB and DOGE work hard to break the $1 threshold, analysts expect that INTL will bring 3x returns long before these meme coins achieve their target price. This is why IntelMarkets is becoming the talk of the crypto market. IntelMarkets (INTL) Seen as a Disruptive Force in Crypto Trading As Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are soaring on the price charts, IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making headlines. Its crypto ICO event performance has been excellent, having raised over $4.3M and sold nearly 40M INTL tokens. Demand for this crypto coin is sky-high. IntelMarkets will introduce something never seen before – an AI-powered smart trading platform. With this platform, IntelMarkets will tap into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. Not only that, traders will get to experience features not seen anywhere else. Features like: Self-Learning Trading Robots: Access to self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time. Omnichannel Processing: Instead of mixed signals, the Intell-Array monitoring system will provide one holistic signal backed by 100,000 data points. Autopilot Trading Robots: Trading robots automatically take up positions based on trader objectives or goals. INTL will be a big part of the IntelMarkets ecosystem. From its starting presale price of $0.009, this altcoin has seen an increase of 610% – giving early buyers massive returns. Since it is now valued at only $0.064 countless traders are stocking up on it as the next presale stage will trigger a jump to $0.73. Not only that but a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is expected to push this price to $0.11, a 71% increase from its current price. Those who buy INTL now will capitalize on this growth and get governance voting rights, discounts on trading fees, and more. This could make INTL one of the best cryptos to watch. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Rises, Analyst Hints at More Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the meme coin titans that has had big price gains. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Shiba Inu has jumped over 15% in the past month alone. In that period, its value moved between $0.000024 and $0.000028. Crypto analyst The CryptoBull also made an exciting Shiba Inu (SHIB) statement. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this meme coin looks ready to skyrocket soon. His Shiba Inu price prediction points to a rise to $0.000088 soon. The technicals for the Shiba Inu coin also show bullish signs. This meme coin is currently valued above its 20-day EMA ($0.000028). However, its market cap also sits at $16B, which means it may need a lot of money to surge, a problem IntelMarkets will not face. Hardy: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) May Hit a New ATH Market analyst Hardy has also made some waves in the crypto market with his Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction. According to his recent X post, this meme coin could see a new ATH in its value. This could mean Dogecoin soaring past $0.73. Regarding the Dogecoin price, CoinMarketCap shows its value soared nearly 5% in the past month alone. During that time, it saw movement between the $0.40 and close to the $0.50 levels. Although the Dogecoin crypto may see big price gains soon, IntelMarkets has some advantages. For instance, INTL will have actual utility, which means it could see more considerable adoption while DOGE focuses on meme hype. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Faster Than Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Dogecoin (DOGE)? Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are seeing green price charts. However, these meme coins have huge market caps, meaning that they will not give you the high returns they used to offer. But unlike them, IntelMarkets (INTL) is right at the beginning, needing less money to see big price gains. Therefore, many experts hint that a 3x surge could come for INTL in 2025.

On Dec. 15, the Solana network accumulated net inflows of $12 million. According to data from Artemix.XYZ , Solana ( SOL ) recorded the highest number of daily net inflows among the top 20 major blockchains on Dec. 15. Solana’s net inflow of $12 million was larger than the other two blockchains in the top 3, Arbitrum ( ARB ) and Sui ( SUI ), combined. Solana regained the top spot a month after the blockchain last held it on Nov. 17 with $17.6 million. On Dec. 15, Solana dethroned Arbitrum, yesterday’s reigning champion, which held the number two spot with a daily net inflow of $5.9 million. Data from Artemis.XYZ showed Solana gained the top spot for daily net inflows on December 16, 2024 | Source: Artemis.XYZ In third place, Sui accumulated a daily net inflow of $5.3 million, followed by OP Mainnet with $2.2 million and Base with $2.1 million. At the very bottom of the list is the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain with a net outflow of $25.4 million. A recent surge in Solana revenue is often linked with a similar surge in the meme coin sector, specifically from pump.fun, a launchpad site for Solana-based meme coins. But that is not the case this time around. According to data from Dune analytics, pump.fun saw its daily revenue dip slightly by 6% from $2.67 million on Dec. 14 to $2.51 million on Dec. 15. Pump.fun’s revenue peaked on Nov. 23 with $14.3 million, but has failed to pass the $5 million mark ever since.

37709970,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393521,1734342876,Will Ethereum Price Hit ATH This Week? Key Levels to Watch,"The post Will Ethereum Price Hit ATH This Week? Key Levels to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After an impressive performance in the past two months, Ethereum (ETH) price has reached a crucial resistance level above $3,953, which could either delay or confirm further bullish sentiment. The largest altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $476 billion and a daily average traded volume of about $30 billion, successfully retested its bullish breakout from the multi-year falling logarithmic trend. However, Ethereum price could consolidate in the near term to attract more buyers, especially as Bitcoin (BTC) price steals the show with a rally beyond $105k earlier today . Consequently, the highly hyped altseason could take much longer to materialize as large-cap altcoins take time to attract new liquidity amid slow cash rotation from Bitcoin. Ethereum Whale on the Move According to on-chain data analysis provided by Glassnode , the number of Ethereum whale addresses, with a balance of above 10k ETH, has continued to increase exponentially in the recent past. The notable rise of Ethereum whales coincides with the ongoing decline in Ether supply on centralized exchanges ; more than 95k ETH units were withdrawn from CEXes in the past seven days. Remarkably, the US spot Ether ETFs have registered more than $2 billion in net cash inflows during the past three weeks. Led by BlackRockms ETHA, the US spot Ether ETFs registered the highest cash weekly inflow of about $854 million last week. Ethereum nears key resistance at $3,953 will the rally continue? Read Ethereum price prediction for insights on the next move! What Next? Amid the rising demand for Ether by institutional investors , especially as a measure to diversify their respective crypto portfolios, the bullish prospects have significantly spiked. From a technical analysis standpoint, ETH’s price is aiming for $5,250 in the near term, which coincides with the daily Fibonacci extension. The parabolic rally for Ether will however be confirmed after the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) surges above the 70 percent level again since earlier this year. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37710327,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52279,1734342776,Ripple Stock Now Valued at $114.51 Per Share. Here’s the Significance,"According to the online investment platform Linqto, the blockchain company Ripple continues to garner attention in the investment community, as its private stock now trades at $114.51 per share. This valuation implies $19.6 billion, reflecting Ripple’s strong position in the blockchain and financial technology (fintech) sectors. #Ripple stock is now valued at $114.51 per share with an implied Valuation of $19.6 Billion on Linqto pic.twitter.com/mvxkqfIgxw — XRPDAILY (@XRPXLMVERSE) December 15, 2024 Ripple, headquartered in San Francisco, is best known for its payment protocol. The company’s private stock is not publicly traded but is made available to accredited investors through platforms like Linqto. The rise in Ripple’s stock price and valuation underscores growing investor confidence in the company, despite its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Understanding Ripple’s Current Valuation The implied valuation of $19.6 billion positions Ripple as one of the leading companies in the blockchain and fintech industries. This figure reflects the company’s significant technological advancements, partnerships with financial institutions, and market adoption of its payment solutions. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, has been a key driver of its adoption, enabling faster and more cost-efficient international payments. This valuation also places Ripple in competition with other major fintech and cryptocurrency firms, further highlighting its market influence. While Ripple’s exact revenue figures remain private, the company has disclosed robust growth in the use of its ODL platform. The valuation could also be influenced by speculation about Ripple’s potential for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), a move that the company has hinted at in the past but has not yet confirmed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of the SEC Lawsuit Ripple’s valuation increase comes amid a legal battle with the SEC, which began in December 2020. The lawsuit alleges that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. While the case has created regulatory uncertainty, recent developments have impacted the market positively. In July 2023, a U.S. District Court issued a partial ruling stating that XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities offerings. However, institutional sales were deemed to fall under securities laws. This decision provided some regulatory clarity and led to a resurgence in interest in both XRP and Ripple as a company. Investor Sentiment The rising valuation of Linqto signals continued interest in Ripple from institutional and private investors. Platforms like Linqto cater to a growing demand for access to private equity in tech and fintech companies before they go public. Ripple’s consistent presence on such platforms suggests strong demand among accredited investors, even amid regulatory challenges.

37712056,https://invezz.com/?p=2388612,1734342775,Ripple CTO warns of potential RLUSD supply constraints and price swings,"David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, has issued a warning to investors regarding the anticipated supply constraints and potential price volatility for Ripple’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, upon its launch. Schwartz emphasized that while RLUSD is expected to settle close to its planned $1 parity once supply and demand return to normal, there could be significant price swings in the early days due to these market conditions. Likely RLUSD supply shortages and price volatility Schwartz highlighted that there may be supply shortages in the early days of RLUSD’s launch, which could lead to significant price fluctuations before the market stabilizes. “As RLUSD goes live, there may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes,” Schwartz stated in an X post . “But rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn’t, something is very seriously wrong.” Schwartz emphasized that these short-term price changes due to supply or demand imbalances are typical around launch but are expected to be temporary as arbitragers step in to fix the market. He explained that the early price swings will likely be driven by the novelty of acquiring the first RLUSD tokens. For instance, one bid on a Ripple XRP wallet called Xaman, for instance, priced a portion of RLUSD at 511 XRP—more than $1,200—reflecting a speculative interest rather than its true market value. This kind of high-priced transaction, Schwartz noted, is more about the “honor” of buying the first RLUSD tokens than an actual indication of market worth. The CTO urged caution against “FOMO” (fear of missing out) into RLUSD, warning that this is not an opportunity to get rich. “Please don’t expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize,” he advised. “The whole point of a stablecoin is to have a stable price. Short-term changes are certainly possible around launch but should not remain for long.” Schwartz explained that the primary goal of RLUSD is to complement Ripple’s XRP and increase its utility. The stablecoin will leverage XRP’s extensive exchange availability to maintain a stable price. Executives at Ripple have indicated that beta testing has shown promise in preventing de-pegging and enhancing global liquidity, which aligns with the company’s focus on supporting institutional participants. RLUSD’s launch The RLUSD stablecoin is expected to launch soon after it receives the final regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services.

37709842,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393513,1734342692,Bitcoin Wallets Holding Over 100 BTC Spike Amidst $106K Milestone,"The post Bitcoin Wallets Holding Over 100 BTC Spike Amidst $106K Milestone appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin confidence is above the sky this month. Today it jumped to another high at $106,533 marking a 77% rally since the bull run started on October 10. With the rise in price, the number of BTC wallets are also taking a spike. Major Bitcoin Players Here’s a wild fact: the number of wallets holding at least 100 BTC jumped significantly in just nine weeks. According to blockchain data from Santiment, these large wallets went from 16,072 to 17,644. That’s nearly a 10% increase. Bitcoin has climbed to $106.5K for the first time in its 16+ year history. Since the bull rally began back on October 10th, there has been a net increase of 1,582 more wallets that hold at least 100 BTC, a jump of +9.9% more wallets in the relatively short period of time! pic.twitter.com/261LfRd776 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 16, 2024 But not all big holders are the same. There are only 4 addresses that hold between 100k and 1 million bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto , the anonymous creator of the first crypto is supposed to hold around 1.1 million coins. Another big player is the public traded company Microstrategy that now own 423,650 BTC. There is one more known whale – Roger Ver, aka “ Bitcoin Jesus .” He owns 131,000 BTC. Apart from his crypto holding, he also got famous for getting arrested on charges of U.S. tax evasion in April this year. There are 17,671 wallet addresses that hold more than 100 Bitcoin. This is a very tiny number as compared to the 85 million addresses that own between $1 to $1000 worth of BTC. Now compare these numbers to approximately 460 million total bitcoin addresses. Source : bitinfocharts More than 88% of the circulating supply is controlled by retail investors. This ensures Bitcoin stays decentralized. It’s not controlled by a few wealthy players, so fears of market manipulation are minimal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today (Dec 16, 2024): Bitcoin Hits New ATH Above $106k | Market Goes “Extreme Greed” , Dormant Wallets Come to Life Another more interesting thing that adds fuel to the confidence of Bitcoin is the awakening of Dormant wallets. Some of them have been inactive since 2009. They are suddenly back in action. Many of these hold massive amounts, like 10,000 BTC or more. Traditionally, only crypto exchanges manage balances this large, but some investor holding this much amount, must be a great HODLER. Source : bitinfocharts However, many unknown wallets moved significant amounts of Bitcoin during Q4 2024. This renewed activity shows that long-term holders still believe in Bitcoin’s potential. What to Expect What does this mean for Bitcoin? The rise in large wallet holders and reactivation of old wallets signal growing trust in its long-term value. Retail investors still hold most of the supply, keeping Bitcoin decentralized and free from manipulation by a handful of players. As adoption grows and confidence remains strong, Bitcoin’s position as a leading digital asset only seems to strengthen. Whether you’re a whale, a sub-whale, or just getting started, the message is clear: Bitcoin’s future looks brighter than ever. We told you the names of 3 out of the top 4 bitcoin wallet addresses. Do you know who the fourth one is? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37709686,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374760,1734342468,Major Warnings Issued by the Pi Network Team: Details,"TL;DR Pi Network advised users to rely on official channels and use only the authentic Pi Wallet in the Pi Browser. With 14 million users verified and only 1 million left, Pi Network aims to launch its open network by December 31. However, delays and skepticism around the project continue to spark controversy. ‘Stay Safe,’ Pi Network Users The team behind the controversial cryptocurrency project Pi Network recently issued two important alerts for its users. First, the developers warned “pioneers” to rely only on information provided by official channels. They also provided a dedicated safety page showing all the sources and URL links the community can refer to. Shortly after, Pi Network reminded people to use only their Pi Wallets in the designated Pi Browser. “Ensure you’re in the correct Pi Wallet, not any fake one, to safeguard your Pi. The authentic Pi Wallet is also visually identified by a purple color in the navigation bar of the Pi Browser with a Pi logo featuring the Core Team apps logo,” the warning reads. Alerts of that type are essential for projects with a vast community base and, for that reason, are often targeted by scammers. Pi Network has amassed millions of users over the past few years, while its application recently hit the milestone of 100 million downloads. The project has a solid presence in Asia, with China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Singapore, and more turning into strongholds. Not long ago, Wu Blockchain revealed that the number of Pi Network’s users in South Korea has reached 1.34 million. The only two local crypto-related entities having more users are the popular exchanges Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). Moreover, the figure outnumbers the domestic client base of leading crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Major Developments on the Horizon? Despite becoming quite popular and being around for over five years, Pi Network has yet to launch its native token and mainnet. This , combined with the numerous delays and broken promises, has caused some to label the project a scam, claiming such huge developments will never see the light of day. For its part, Pi Network’s team previously said it will launch its open network once 15 million users complete the necessary verifications. Not long ago, Pi News revealed that 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with only one million left to do so . The final deadline is December 31 (a date moved numerous times in the last few months). Additionally, the Pi Core Team promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap in December, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or if the pessimists will turn right.

37712239,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319712,1734342396,New Zealand’s FMA Warns of Rising Crypto Scam Targeting Users via YouTube and Messaging Platforms,"New Zealand’s Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has issued a warning about an increasing wave of crypto scams targeting social media users. In a Monday warning , the watchdog said that the fraudsters operate primarily through YouTube channels and messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, where they lure unsuspecting users with promises of lucrative investment opportunities. Scammers Set Up YouTube Channels to Look Legite Scammers set up YouTube channels that present themselves as trustworthy sources of cryptocurrency trading advice. Viewers are encouraged to join private messaging groups on WhatsApp or Telegram, where the fraudsters pose as experienced investment experts. Once inside these groups, victims are directed to fraudulent trading platforms designed to look like legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges. The scam follows a calculated strategy. Initially, victims are asked to make small deposits, fostering a sense of trust. They are then presented with fake profit statements to encourage larger investments. However, when users attempt to withdraw their funds, they are met with demands for additional fees, and no money is ever returned. The FMA has flagged more than 40 suspicious trading platforms, including bi-investments.com, phoenix-trades.com, and bricsinvestlimited.com. A full list of the flagged platforms is available on the FMA’s official website. 226,000 people are currently being scammed on YouTube by an AI Elon Musk – asking for their crypto. The account looks like a legit @Tesla account, but it is clearly not, as the username is ""tesla.elon-US"" They are using an AI generated Elon talking about the robotaxi and… pic.twitter.com/fAiFVpt1tX — Zoli (@zolihonig) October 11, 2024 The FMA advises anyone who suspects they have fallen victim to a scam to cease all contact with the fraudsters, report the incident to the appropriate platforms, and seek help from their bank to attempt a reversal of the transaction. As of late, scammers have been increasingly using WhatsApp and Telegram to promote unauthorized investment schemes. These platforms offer direct access to users, making it easier for scammers to maintain communication and pressure their targets. A recent survey of 631 traders revealed that Telegram is considered the riskiest platform for trading scams, with 60% of respondents reporting financial losses. WhatsApp closely follows with similar loss rates, while platforms like Facebook (56%), Instagram (51.8%), and SMS (50%) also pose significant risks. Even X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn, known for their professional user base, reported loss rates of 43.7% and 45.4%, respectively. FMA Continues to Issue Crypto Scam Alerts The FMA’s latest warning builds on previous alerts about fraudulent investment schemes. In May, it cautioned against scams using fake celebrity endorsements. Scammers were found promoting investments using images of New Zealand celebrities in fabricated news articles that appeared to be from reputable local media outlets. Additionally, in March, the FMA flagged a “clone scam” impersonating BTSWE, a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange in New Zealand. Last week, a California court fined five individuals involved in IcomTech’s fraudulent Bitcoin Ponzi scheme $5 million. The court ruling found the defendants guilty of fraud and misappropriation of funds through a fake cryptocurrency trading operation. The ruling targets David Carmona, Juan Arellano Parra, Moses Valdez, and David Brend, who were found in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.

37709551,https://crypto.news/?p=14319685,1734342220,"Justin Sun withdraws $209M ETH from Lido Finance, profits $349M","The founder of TRON, Justin Sun, has applied to withdraw 52,905 ETH, worth $209 million, from Lido Finance. This could affect Ethereum’s prices, says historical data. The withdrawal has been part of a larger Ethereum ( ETH ) accumulation strategy under which Sun allegedly purchased 392,474 ETH at an average price of $3,027, now showing an estimated profit of $349 million. This is not the first time that Sun has withdrawn large chunks of ETH. On Oct 4, 2023, Sun withdrew unstaked 80,253 ETH, coming around $131 million from Lido, and moved it to Binance within four days, around mid-October. Soon after, a 5% drop was observed in ETH prices. Analysts wonder if Sun will employ something similar when withdrawn assets are ‘delivered’ to exchanges for possible sell-offs. The $209 million withdrawn from Lido Finance is noteworthy because it stresses the magnitude of Lido’s importance to Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake infrastructure. As a liquid-staking protocol, Lido solves traditional staking problems, resource inaccessibility, and illiquidity by allowing users to stake ETH and remain liquid with traded stealth tokens. Justin Sun ( @justinsuntron ) applied to withdraw 52,905 $ETH (now $209M) from #LidoFinance an hour ago. This is part of the net 392,474 $ETH he allegedly bought at ~$3,027 ($1.19B) via 3 wallets from Feb-Aug, now having an est. total profit of $349M (+29%). Note that on Oct 4,… https://t.co/r5z7l8YSUq pic.twitter.com/GAalq1imjO — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 16, 2024 Lido enables more than 30% of all staked ETH on the network, making it one of the backbones of Ethereum’s PoS mechanism. Big withdrawals such as Justin Sun ‘s withdrawal raise questions about staking liquidity and possible market effects. Though Lido’s liquid staking solution does make tokens more accessible, the fear of sudden large-scale withdrawals reveals a critically vulnerable point in staking protocols. Such moves can fuel fears of reduced liquidity. One such incident can be traced back to Aug. 5 of this year, when withdrawals, possibly by whales, dropped ETH’s price from $3317 to $2419.

Spikes in outflows often align with volatility, while Ethereum’s price surged to $3.9K in December, reflecting increased activity amid market movements. Although Lido withdrawals are not immediate, given that they must go through the Ethereum staking queue, such large moves can be indicative of market changes, especially if multiple large stakeholders follow suit, causing an imbalance between staked and unstaked assets.

This deposit further indicates that he aims to diversify the liquidity across established tokens and other high-risk tokens he might own.

37719776,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105231,1734342145,Binance (BNB) Coin Price Triangle Breakout Targets $850,"As the bull market regains momentum over the weekend, Binance (BNB) is preparing for a triangle breakout that could lead to a potential new all-time high. With Bitcoin recently setting a new all-time high of $106,533, the crypto market is seeing a significant surge in buying pressure. Amid this recovery, BNB is gearing up for a potential breakout rally.Will this breakout rally in Binance (BNB) price result in a new all-time high above $800? Let's find out.BNB Coin Price AnalysisThe price action of the Binance coin currently exhibits a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern suggests market indecision but also signals the possibility of an upcoming breakout. The positive cycle within the triangle has tested the resistance trendline. Binance Price Chart The BNB coin price is struggling to overcome the overhead supply, maintaining a declining trend near the resistance level. Amid the formation of a morning star pattern, BNB continues to hold above the psychological $700 mark.Currently, the BNB coin price is trading at $712, up 0.28% over the past four hours. The bullish momentum is challenging the recently formed bearish engulfing candle.Despite this, the BNB price remains resilient, staying above the center pivot level of $703.8. Supporting the bullish outlook, the 4-hour RSI line shows a bullish diagonal trend and is preparing for a double-bottom reversal from the halfway line.Binance (BNB) Coin Price TargetsIf a bullish breakout occurs, BNB's price could soar above the current all-time high of $794.3. According to the pivot levels on the 4-hour chart, the immediate target for a new all-time high is the R3 resistance level at $850, indicating a potential upside of nearly 20% for BNB.However, if the breakout fails, traders should be prepared for a retest of key support levels. Specifically, a failure to maintain dominance above the $800 mark could trigger a retest of the critical support trendline of the triangle pattern. This bearish scenario has a downside risk of 5.7%, potentially testing the $672.6 level.",POSITIVE,BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/16/binance-bnb-coin-price-triangle-breakout-targets-850/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=binance-bnb-coin-price-triangle-breakout-targets-850,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37709602,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628021,1734342076,"More value flows into Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperliquid and liquid restaking","As the 2024 bull market extends, fund inflows are reaching new records. Stable Ethereum (ETH) prices and new Bitcoin (BTC) price records are already reflected in DeFi. More value is getting locked through Bitcoin and Ethereum, as their value grows at the end of the year. The effect of the bull market led to an overall recovery of DeFi in the past month. Funds are flowing into BTC staking protocols and ETH-based DeFi. Inflows were even more noticeable in liquid restaking, one of the growth sectors for the whole year. Additionally, Hyperliquid’s rise to prominence turned it into the biggest hub for value locked after BTC and ETH. Value inflows favored BTC, ETH, and the Hyperliquid DEX. | Source: Lookonchain Based on the change of total value locked, Hyperliquid accelerated its inflows. The value locked in BTC and ETH is growing as a result of the price rally, while also increasing the value of collaterals. Fund inflows into those top projects range from user deposits to DeFi and ETF buying. Fund inflows may differ for the various ecosystems, but the overall trend remains positive. The biggest outflow of funds is from TRON, while smaller inflows continue for the most active L1 and L2 chains with developed DeFi and Web3 apps. In the past week, BTC staking expanded after the Cap-3 event by Babylon Labs. The event wraps up on December 16, after drawing new non-custodial staking for 1,000 blocks. The event drew in an additional 59,983 BTC, valued at $5.38B. Those inflows will be counted in the coming weeks, reflecting the vertical expansion of TVL for Bitcoin’s network. The total value of locked BTC is now $6.92B , at prices above $104,000 per coin. Most of the value is locked with Babylon Labs, which carries $5.63B total liquidity. Hyperliquid grows TVL with new trading offers Hyperliquid is in the process of growing its decentralized futures trading platform. The DEX is adding new trading options, starting out with low leverage. Hyperliquid is also constantly expanding its open interest, drawing in inflows of stablecoins. The exchange does not carry spot markets, and only offers derivative pairs. Hyperliquid reached a new all-time high in open interest of >$4.3B. pic.twitter.com/8YUwBEEWEU — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) December 16, 2024 According to other metrics, Hyperliquid locks in $3.19B with vertical growth since its launch in December. The rise of the HYPE token and the potential for high-speed trading is boosting the positions of Hyperliquid as one of the actively growing protocols. As a result of the growth, the native HYPE token has been on an expansion track. HYPE trades at $26.50, with no drawdowns since the token generation event. HYPE holders are also not selling, unlike early Magic Eden (ME) recipients. Ethereum liquid staking and restaking boost DeFi The other source of liquidity and locked ETH are DeFi apps with requisite collaterals. Liquid staking now carries a total of $70.69B, producing $7.68M in daily fees. LidoDAO is still the leader with more than $39B in value locked. The other big source of inflows are liquid restaking protocols, which build another layer of liquidity. Over the course of 2024, liquid restaking expanded by more than 6,000%, with total value locked increasing above $17B. EtherFi is the leader, holding more than $9.37B, followed by KelpDAO. The sector started out with just $284M in January. Overall, the DeFi sector now locks in more than $140B, a level not seen since April 2022. DeFi value crashed since 2022, while protocols had to rebuild and liquidity flowed to new apps. One of the growth apps in 2022 was Aave (AAVE), which now holds upward of $22B in various assets. The creation of $196.8B worth of stablecoins is also adding to the available liquidity for pools, staking and lending.

According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, the project’s latest purchase included $250,000 worth of Ondo (ONDO) on Dec. 15, following a $500,000 buy of Ethena (ENA) just a day prior. World Liberty on a Spending Spree Since November 30, the World Liberty wallet has amassed $30 million in Ether (ETH) and $10 million in Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC), alongside $2 million each in Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE). These acquisitions align with WLFI’s efforts to establish itself as a major player in decentralized finance (DeFi), with Trump serving as the platform’s “chief crypto advocate” and his sons Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron listed as “ambassadors.” Despite its high-profile endorsements, the project has struggled to achieve its $300 million fundraising target through its WLFI token sale , having sold less than 25% of the offering. However, WLFI received a significant boost last month when Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, invested $30 million and joined the project as an advisor. Ambitious Goals Amid Stiff Challenges Notably, World Liberty’s recent token purchases have sparked speculation. Nicolai Søndergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, suggests the acquisitions may serve as a strategy to instill trust or highlight the value of specific assets linked to the project. The project is also expanding its DeFi footprint, as evidenced by the recent approval of its proposal by AaveDAO. This move allows WLFI to launch its own version of the Aave protocol for borrowing and lending popular assets like Ether, Wrapped Bitcoin, USD Coin, and Tether. Justin Sun, WLFI’s largest investor , has previously been accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of selling unregistered securities. This regulatory shadow looms over the initiative, despite Trump’s promises to overhaul the SEC to be more crypto-friendly. As World Liberty Financial continues its ambitious journey in the volatile crypto space, the stakes are high. I ts December spending spree and strategic partnerships underscore its commitment to carving out a significant role in DeFi, but challenges remain pivotal hurdles.

Recently Google announced its revolutionary “Willow” chip , which has quantum power to solve problems in a mere 5 minutes that would take classical supercomputers billions of years. These advanced machines could one day break the encryption that secures traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum . While crypto assets are safe for now, the risk grows as quantum technology advances. So if you think only Bitcoin can give you a safety net think again the threat of Quantum Community is giving chills to the crypto investors who are diving into the future with Quantum-resistant coins. Quantum-resistant coins use cutting-edge cryptography , like one-time digital signatures, to ensure security even against quantum computing. They act like locks that can’t be reused or easily broken, making them a safer choice for the long term. For investors Altcoin Daily has charted these coins that offer peace of mind, ensuring their holdings remain secure in the upcoming quantum computing threat. Algorand (ALGO) First up on the list is, Algorand leads the way in quantum resistance with its innovative use of Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature technology. Every 256 blocks, Algorand cryptographically signs its blockchain history, ensuring past transactions remain secure even against quantum threats. While it doesn’t yet secure future transactions, protecting the chain’s history is a crucial step in preparing for the quantum era. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin at $104K: Here’s Why Sustaining Above $102K is Very Important for the BTC Price Rally to Reach $110K , Cellframe (CELL) Next comes, Cellframe with a raking of 698 is a third-generation blockchain designed for quantum safety from the ground up.

37709396,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-at-106k,1734341864,Bitcoin Hits New Record High at $106K,"Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, crossing $106,368 and marking another milestone for the cryptocurrency. The rally reflects growing institutional interest, expanding adoption, and favorable market conditions that continue to drive momentum. Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas from BTC Markets noted that this record high signifies a turning point for Bitcoin. “This achievement highlights Bitcoin’s shift from being a retail-dominated asset to one increasingly shaped by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate adoption,” Lucas explained. This evolution is solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream financial asset. Key events have contributed to Bitcoin’s latest surge. US President-elect Donald Trump recently announced plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, sparking optimism in the market. His pledge to “do something great” with crypto has bolstered confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Additionally, MicroStrategy , one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, has added to the excitement. On December 23, the company announced its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, a significant milestone for both the firm and Bitcoin. Co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at further Bitcoin acquisitions, amplifying investor enthusiasm. MicroStrategy’s reserves, valued at billions, continue to underscore institutional support for Bitcoin. Another major factor is Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining company, which recently revealed its purchase of thousands of Bitcoins. This move not only strengthens its position in the market but also reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. These high-profile actions have fueled positive sentiment, further driving demand. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors also play a crucial role. The Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting is being closely monitored by investors. Expectations of a rate cut are seen as favorable for Bitcoin, as such measures typically boost risk assets. Market participants are optimistic that these developments will continue to support Bitcoin’s growth. With Bitcoin breaking records, the market is now watching for its next move. Whether it can maintain its upward momentum or face a correction will depend on both market sentiment and broader economic conditions. Bitcoin’s latest milestone highlights its growing maturity and its increasing role in the global financial landscape.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-at-106k,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37709396.jpeg
42389762,77b783c8-bbc7-4f3d-85d6-9e9ccf350939,1734341472,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Put Options at $30, $35 Price Levels See Volume Spike","Surging volumes in put options linked to BlackRock's Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could be interpreted as bearish sentiment. That's not necessarily the case.  On Friday, more than 13,000 contracts of the $30 out-of-the-money (OTM) put option expiring May 16 changed hands as the ETF rose 1.7% to $57.91, according to data from Amberdata. Volume in the $35 put option expiring Jan. 16, 2026, topped 10,000 contracts.  Most of the activity probably stems from market participants looking to generate passive income through ""cash-secured put selling"" rather than outright purchase of the options as bearish bets, according to Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives.  A put seller, offering insurance against price drops in return for a premium, is obligated to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. (That's opposed to the buyer of the put, who has the right but not the obligation to sell the asset.)  That means savvy traders often write OTM puts to acquire the underlying asset at a lower price while pocketing the premium received by selling the put option. They do so by continuously maintaining the cash required to purchase the asset if the owner of the put option exercises their right to sell the asset.  Hence, the strategy is called ""cash-secured"" selling of puts. In IBIT's case, sellers of the $35 put expiring in January 2026 will keep the premium if IBIT stays above that level until expiry. If IBIT drops below $35, the put sellers must buy the ETF at that price while keeping the premium received. The sellers of the $30 put expiring in May next year face a similar payoff scenario.  ""The $35 Puts for Jan 2026 traded +10k contract with an IV range of 73.52% to 69.94%, VWAP at 70.75% suggests net selling from the street… potentially Cash Secured put selling flows (for traders who missed the rally),"" Magadini said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  Saxo Bank's analyst suggested cash-secured put selling as the preferred strategy in Nvidia early this year.   Calls are pricier than puts  Overall, IBIT call options, which offer an asymmetric upside to buyers, continue to trade pricer than puts.  As of Friday, call-put skews, with maturities ranging from five to 126 days, were positive, signaling relative richness of implied volatility for calls. The bullish sentiment is consistent with the pricing in options tied to bitcoin and trading on Deribit.  On Friday, IBIT recorded a net inflow of $393 million, representing the majority of the total inflow of $428.9 million across the 11 spot ETFs listed in the U.S, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/16/black-rock-bitcoin-etf-put-options-at-30-35-price-levels-see-volume-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfe5a5c97a21153218885574b0c00c549eb1a00b-1280x884.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The market trend flipped heavily with a major change in the leadership set to happen. Donald Trump won the election and was chosen to be the next president of the U.S., which triggered bullish waves across the market. This led the rally close to $100K in the first attempt and later rached the current highs, maintaining an ascending consolidation. In a recent update, Trump reportedly confirmed Bitcoin reserve plans that have increased the trading volume, which was slowly draining after reaching the highs close to $150 billion. Meanwhile, the participation of the bears remains within restricted levels, suggesting they could be waiting for the start token to reach certain highs. Although the price rose above $106K, no major liquidation was recorded that validates the above claim. Now the question arises: whether the BTC price will continue to surge beyond $107K? If yes, where are the trigger points for the bears? Above the chart is the Bitcoin liquidation heatmap, which shows the potential range where the shorts or the longs have been accumulated. The price is trading just above the interim support zone between $103,726 and $104,300, where nearly $250 million worth of shorts have been accumulated collectively. Although breaking these levels may certainly not drag the levels below $100K as a strong base of longs has been formed at $102K of an accumulated $190 million. Hence, these levels are expected to halt the bearish trend if bearish activity intensifies and also trigger a strong rebound. What’s next? How high can the Bitcoin price go if the bulls trigger a rebound from here? The above chart shows the potential leverage trades placed on multiple ranges, and the latest pullback from highs appears to be a result of the 100x & 50x being placed around those levels. Meanwhile, the long liquidations have started to accumulate at $106.8K & $107.2K. However, the $107.5K range is more attractive with close to $500 million cumulative short liquidation leverage with a ratio of 25%, 50%, and 100%. Therefore, this range currently appears to be tiny, but if the BTC price proceeds higher, the accumulation around this range may intensify. Therefore, the levels around $107.5K may be considered the next highs for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally that could be achieved before the 2024 end.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-at-104k-heres-why-sustaining-above-102k-is-very-important-for-the-btc-price-rally-to-reach-110k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

ONDO price surged by almost 20% following the purchase news, hitting a new all-time high of $2.14, before slightly pulling back to around $2.09 at press time. Source: CoinGecko World Liberty Financial adds 134,216 ONDO tokens to its portfolio The transaction, which took place on December 16th at 6:51 UTC+8, was facilitated through the Cow Protocol, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence . The acquisition marks a notable expansion for World Liberty Financial, which has been actively acquiring digital assets in recent weeks. The purchase comes amid a broader strategy to bolster the platform’s crypto portfolio, which now stands at $83.98 million. The platform’s recent purchases include Ether, Aave, and Chainlink, adding significant digital assets to its portfolio. On December 12th, World Liberty Financial purchased 2,631 ETH for $10 million, 41,335 LINK for $1 million, and 3,357 AAVE for $1 million. According to Arkham, World Liberty Financial’s portfolio currently includes a significant holding in Ether valued at $58.51 million, alongside smaller amounts of CBBTC, USDC, and USDT stablecoins. The DeFi platform also owns tokens like LINK, valued at $2.27 million, and AAVE, valued at $2.30 million, and ENA tokens worth $627.25K. Source: Arkham The purchase of ONDO by World Liberty Financial is part of a larger trend of increased investment in digital assets by prominent figures in the crypto space. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, recently invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial by purchasing its native token, WLFI. Sun’s investment came after the platform struggled to meet its presale goals, indicating confidence in the project’s potential. The Trump-linked crypto venture has been making waves since its launch in September, particularly following the involvement of major investors like Sun. The presale of WLFI tokens is still ongoing, with the Trump family aiming to sell 20 billion tokens. The sale has already seen 4.97 billion tokens sold at $0.015, with the remaining 15 billion still available. The DeFi platform’s strategy seems to be focused on attracting a wide range of investors, including accredited US investors who were offered the opportunity to participate in the presale starting October 15th. As World Liberty Financial expands its footprint in the DeFi space and continues to make strategic investments in digital assets, the market will be watching closely to see how ONDO and other tokens in its portfolio perform in the coming weeks and months.

The buying pressure in Bitcoin has significantly surged overnight, pushing the price to an all-time high of $106,533. Amid this strong rally, BTC registered a notable recovery, with a 3% surge on Sunday.As the residual momentum hints at a potential breakout from its current channel, Bitcoin finds itself at a crossroads. Will the price push beyond $110,000, or will resistance cause a pullback?Bitcoin Price AnalysisWith a streak of bullish candles in the 4-hour chart, the BTC price tests the rising channel's resistance. The boost in trend momentum comes after the breakout of an inverted head-and-shoulder pattern. Bitcoin Price Chart This breakout resulted in a massive bullish engulfing candle, driving the 24-hour high above $106,000. However, despite the surge in demand, the overhead supply led to a swift bearish reversal, delaying a full bullish breakout.Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $104,842 after failing to close above the resistance trendline. Along with the trendline, the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $105,587 remains a critical resistance point.Additionally, a modest 0.27% recovery over the past four hours brings Bitcoin closer to this crucial resistance. The exponential moving averages (EMAs) remain positively aligned, supporting the likelihood of a breakout rally.Furthermore, the MACD and signal lines maintain a bullish trend, with new positive histograms indicating a continuation of upward momentum. As a result, technical indicators suggest a bullish bias for Bitcoin.BTC Price TargetsIf Bitcoin closes strongly above the 38.20% Fibonacci level on the 4-hour chart, the price will likely surge, potentially setting a new all-time high. Additionally, with the release of trapped momentum from the rising channel, the immediate target for Bitcoin is the 50% Fibonacci level at $110,375.However, if the bulls fail to break through the crucial Fibonacci resistance, a downside risk of 2.5% could materialize. In that case, the key support trendline, combined with the 20-EMA at $102,264, could offer the next potential reversal point.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/16/as-bitcoin-rally-stalls-at-106k-could-110k-be-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=as-bitcoin-rally-stalls-at-106k-could-110k-be-next,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE.

As the world’s leading cryptocurrency gained almost 200% this year, there was a key contributing factor to this price surge. The latest data suggest a notable increase in whale wallet activity that has pushed it to a new milestone. Bitcoin’s Record Finds Support From Whales Since the bull rally began on October 10th, the number of addresses holding at least 100 BTC has climbed from 16,062 to 17,644 – a net gain of 1,582 wallets, reflecting a substantial 9.9% increase in just nine weeks. According to Santiment analysis on Monday, this surge in whale accumulation has coincided with a 77% jump in Bitcoin’s price, highlighting the strong correlation between growing investor confidence among large holders and the asset’s upward momentum. The latest BTC rally followed comments from President-elect Donald Trump indicating his intention to form a US Bitcoin strategic reserve similar to the country’s oil stockpile. The announcement ignited excitement among cryptocurrency bulls, fueling the record-breaking rally. Many industry watchers suggest Bitcoin has entered “Santa Claus mode,” with a surge in buying as investors fear missing out and aim to allocate more funds to the asset class. Bitcoin’s Santa Claus Rally Since the November 5 election, where Trump and numerous pro-crypto candidates won, Bitcoin has gained more than 50%. Historically, December is viewed as a bullish month for the asset, but the “Santa Claus Rally”—defined as gains during the last five trading days of the year and the first two of January—has shown mixed performance in the crypto market. Between 2014 and 2023, Bitcoin rallied seven times before Christmas and five times afterward, recording returns of 0.20% to 13.19% pre-Christmas and 0.33% to 10.86% post-Christmas. Yet, the pattern remains inconsistent; for instance, in 2017, Bitcoin plunged 21.30% pre-Christmas during the post-ICO market correction. Still, December as a whole has averaged returns of 9.48%, as per CoinGecko’s findings .

37708471,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52276,1734339455,"If History Repeats Itself, XRP Could Be on the Verge of a Massive Breakout","Crypto influencer Amelie recently stirred considerable excitement in the cryptocurrency community with a tweet highlighting XRP’s current price trajectory. Sharing an image of a detailed technical analysis chart, Amelie suggested that XRP might be on the brink of a massive breakout. Her prediction emphasized that if historical trends repeat themselves, XRP could achieve a new all-time high in the coming days or weeks. The chart accompanying Amelie’s tweet showcases XRP’s price movements on a multi-year scale. The analysis draws parallels between the current price structure and the period preceding XRP’s previous significant breakout in 2017. During that time, XRP experienced a massive rally that took its price to an all-time high of $3.317. Amelie’s analysis suggests that XRP is again positioned in a similar “breakout zone,” based on a symmetrical triangle chart pattern—a bullish indicator often seen before substantial upward movements. WOW! IF HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF, WE COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF A MASSIVE BREAKOUT FOR #XRP – A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH COULD BE REACHED IN A FEW DAYS/WEEKS! GET READY FOR EVERYTHING! pic.twitter.com/CuUrARaBUt — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 15, 2024 Historical Context and Technical Setup The chart shared in Amelie’s tweet identifies two primary moments of price consolidation and breakout in XRP’s history. The first occurred between 2014 and 2017 when XRP’s price hovered in a tight range before experiencing exponential growth. Notably, a similar symmetrical triangle pattern was observed, signaling a period of accumulation before a breakout to $3.317. In the present setup, spanning the last six years, XRP has again moved within a consolidating triangle pattern. The breakout point, marked clearly in the analysis, signals a potential beginning of another bullish phase. The upward movement indicated in the chart reflects a speculative future target as high as $99, representing extreme optimism among XRP supporters. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Market Sentiment Amelie’s tweet quickly garnered attention, with users expressing support and skepticism. In response, another X user, Sydney, argued that XRP’s recent developments extend beyond historical trends. Sydney pointed to XRP’s recent legal victories, particularly its high-profile case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This outcome boosted investor confidence and set a critical precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry, clarifying XRP’s regulatory standing as not being a security. Additionally, Sydney mentioned Ripple’s ongoing success with its stablecoin (RLUSD) which could further strengthen XRP’s utility and demand. This view highlights a divergence in opinion within the crypto community where technical analysts focus on chart patterns and historical trends, while others emphasize XRP’s evolving fundamentals and real-world adoption. These factors have created a bullish narrative for XRP as it heads to 2025. Amelie’s tweet and accompanying analysis underscore the strong potential for XRP to achieve significant price appreciation if historical patterns play out. While chart patterns suggest an impending breakout, it is essential to consider the broader market environment and XRP’s ongoing adoption, particularly in cross-border payments and stablecoin infrastructure.

In October 2023, Sun unpledged 80,251 ETH (worth $131 million at the time) from Lido and transferred it to Binance within four days. Following this transaction, Ethereum’s price dropped by 5% mid-month. This recent withdrawal has reignited similar fears, with some analysts anticipating short-term price pressure on Ethereum as markets keep an eye on Sun’s actions. Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin in 2024 gains Ethereum has experienced a 71.5% uptick since the beginning of the year. However, it has underperformed compared to Bitcoin’s, which posted an impressive 142% gain over the same period. While Ethereum’s performance is commendable, its growth trajectory has not mirrored Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to new highs, leaving some investors questioning whether ETH can even achieve a new all-time high level. Per Chinese reporter Colin Wu, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) increased by $2.22 billion in the past week, slightly trailing Bitcoin’s $3.09 billion increase.

Analysts believe that increased ETF inflows could bolster Ethereum’s price stability, even amid short-term market fluctuations. Technical indicators point to a potential breakout Meanwhile, ETH’s technical chart patterns are providing reasons for investors to be bullish. According to several analysts on X, ETH charts are showcasing similar patterns to when it last hit an ATH in 2022, with the recent appearance of a “Golden Cross” on Ethereum’s weekly chart, a technical indicator signaling potential upward momentum. 🚨 Ethereum Golden Cross!!

The EMA50 trend line, which has been reinforcing Ethereum’s price from below, further supports the optimistic outlook. Analysts believe that breaking through the $3,845 resistance level could pave the way for a move towards $4,000 and beyond. Source: X However, a dip below this level might trigger a short-term correction, with potential downside targets around $3,680 before another rally attempt. Long-term price projections for Ethereum Ethereum’s long-term potential continues to attract speculative forecasts. Bybit and Block Scholes, for instance, have projected a price goal of $8,800 by the first quarter of 2025. These predictions are supported by ETH’s solid performance in the derivatives market and its rising triangle chart formation, which suggests sustained upward momentum. Even more optimistic is the forecast from Titan of Crypto, who told FX Business that ETH could climb above $5,000 by 2025. These projections largely hinge on historical technical patterns and the increasing institutional adoption of Ethereum.

37719774,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105244,1734339097,Shiba Inu Officially Issues New Warning About Shiro Neko,"Susbarium, the Shiba Inu community-driven scam alert channel, issues a new warning, distancing SHIB from the newly launched cat-themed memecoin Shiro Neko (SHIRO). The controversy surrounding Shiba Inu’s relationship with Shiro Neko continues to gain momentum, with Susbarium adding a new twist. Expert Claims Shiba Inu Is Backing Shiro Neko, But Susbarium Says Otherwise Over the weekend, widely followed market observer Ash Crypto promoted SHIRO on X, linking Shiba Inu to the project. Ash claimed that Shiba Inu is backing the Shiro project, indicating that SHIRO has room for growth based on its market cap difference with SHIB.The expert anticipated an upcoming bull cycle for memecoins, noting that SHIRO could emerge as one of the top beneficiaries. Despite promoting SHIRO, Ash issued a disclaimer, revealing that they have an advisory partnership with the token. Ash’s post elicited reactions from the broader crypto community, with Susbarium correcting a misconception about Shiba Inu’s relationship with SHIRO. According to Susbarium, Shiba Inu does not officially support nor back SHIRO. It suggested that even though top Shiba Inu influencers and the handler of SHIB’s official X account, @shibtoken, have promoted SHIRO, the developers of shib.io, the cryptocurrency’s website, have already distanced themselves from the cat-themed memecoin. SHIB Is Not an X Account Furthermore, the community-driven scam alert channel made clear that millions of SHIB holders do not back SHIRO. It also highlighted a distinction between the Shiba Inu project and @shibtoken, emphasizing that ‘SHIB is not an X account’. https://twitter.com/susbarium/status/1868037102262198453This suggests that information emanating from @shibtoken does not represent the views of the entire Shiba Inu ecosystem. Hence, @shibtoken’s endorsement of SHIRO or any other project does not imply that Shiba Inu backs them. Shiro Neko's Controversial Relationship with Shiba Inu For context, the relationship between Shiba Inu and Shiro Neko has been marred with controversy. Shiro Neko made its presence known to the Shiba Inu community after it initiated a massive burn of 5.58 billion SHIB in a single transaction on October 31. Afterward, it requested to form an alliance with Shiba Inu. However, Susbarium warned the community to be cautious when interacting with SHIRO, advising investors to only invest in the token after conducting due diligence. A month later, @shibtoken promoted Shiro Neko on its account, indicating that the project has collaborated with Shiba Inu for a dual-staking initiative. The staking exercise, which involves staking SHIRO to earn SHIB and vice versa, went live after the token’s December 2 launch. Despite @shibtoken’s promotion, Shiba Inu’s leader, Shytoshi Kusama, still denied affiliations with Shiro Neko. He issued the clarification after some community members taunted him about SHIRO’s legitimacy, given Susbarium’s warning about the project. At press time, SHIRO is trading at $0.0000003843, with its market cap standing at $384.02 million. The token is down 56.47% from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.0000009038, registered on December 2. On the other hand, SHIB is priced at $0.00002754.

The S&P Flash Services and Manufacturing PMI data will kick off the week, providing key insights into the health of the economy. A PMI above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 signals contraction. Strong data may boost market confidence, increasing demand for riskier assets like Bitcoin, though economic concerns remain due to lingering recession fears. Retail sales data will follow, offering a snapshot of consumer spending and confidence. Economists anticipate a slight improvement from the previous month, which could signal stronger consumer activity. Positive retail figures might encourage optimism, benefiting traditional markets and crypto alike. However, increased spending could also raise inflation concerns, prompting some investors to turn to Bitcoin as a hedge. The Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday is the highlight of the week. Markets expect a 0.25% rate cut, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference providing additional insights into future monetary policy. Any unexpected moves or comments from the Fed could trigger major market swings, especially for crypto. Investors will watch for signs of either a more aggressive or cautious stance toward future rate adjustments. To close out the week, the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data will be critical. This measure of consumer spending and inflation is closely followed by the Fed in shaping its policy. Rising PCE inflation could signal persistent pressure on consumers, increasing market volatility and influencing crypto sentiment. With inflation trends and rate decisions in focus, the crypto market may experience heightened activity and potential price swings.

Longo claims that Binance used images and stories of Peanut without his consent, undermining the originality of his work. The legal action, according to Longo, is part of a broader effort to protect his creations, with additional cease-and-desist letters planned. Despite the lawsuit, the value of Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) token has shown little change, reflecting minimal market impact. Longo, meanwhile, has shifted his focus to promoting a new cryptocurrency, Justice for Peanut (JFP), branding it as the ""only real PNUT coin."" While the token initially gained significant attention, its value has since plummeted. This move has drawn criticism from the crypto community, with some accusing Longo of using the controversy for personal profit. Critics argue that Longo has launched multiple tokens in the past, allegedly earning millions, while contributing to instability in the market. Peanut the Squirrel’s story gained national attention during the U.S. presidential election when New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) confiscated Peanut and another animal from Longo. Tragically, Peanut died in state custody, sparking outrage and gaining support from public figures, including Elon Musk. The incident triggered a wave of Peanut-themed meme coins, with PNUT becoming one of the most notable, achieving a listing on Binance and significant market recognition. The rise of PNUT has been part of a broader trend in meme coins, showcasing their ability to achieve rapid market milestones. PNUT reached a milestone market valuation in just days, a feat that took significantly longer for established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE). This highlights the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, where meme coins tied to viral stories or public figures can attract substantial attention and investment. Longo’s legal battle and involvement in meme coin launches have intensified debate within the crypto world. While some see his efforts as a fight for intellectual property, others remain skeptical of his intentions. The situation reflects both the risks and the speculative appeal of meme coins, which continue to dominate discussions in the cryptocurrency market.

The fraudulent post included a smart contract address and promotional content to make the scam appear credible. While the post was quickly deleted, and the fraudulent account tied to the coin was suspended, the incident highlights the rising wave of crypto scams targeting high-profile users on X. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT exposed the hack, which is part of a growing trend of social media scams exploiting the popularity of celebrities and influencers. Drake’s involvement in cryptocurrency may have given the fake coin more credibility, making it easier for hackers to deceive users. This case is one of several recent examples where prominent accounts, such as the Cardano Foundation’s, were used to push fake tokens or bogus airdrops. These scams aim to manipulate followers into trusting fraudulent schemes. The rise in crypto scams on X has been significant. According to Scam Sniffer, a blockchain security firm, fake crypto-related accounts on the platform have jumped from 160 daily in November to over 300 fake accounts per day. Many of these impersonate influencers, tricking users into joining fraudulent Telegram groups. In these groups, victims are urged to verify their identity using a bot called OfficialSafeguardBot. This bot employs social engineering techniques to create urgency, convincing users to perform harmful actions. During the verification process, the bot discreetly inserts malicious code into the victim’s clipboard. If executed, this code installs malware capable of accessing crypto wallets and stealing private information. Scam Sniffer reported that this malware, identified by VirusTotal, has already caused several confirmed thefts of private keys, resulting in financial losses for victims. The combination of phishing, malware, and social engineering represents a more dangerous wave of crypto scams, putting users at greater risk .

This move has positioned MicroStrategy as a prominent player in both the tech and financial sectors. Saylor also hinted that Marathon Digital Holdings could be the next crypto-focused company to join the prestigious index. On December 15, Saylor cryptically referred to the SaylorTracker, a tool that highlights MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions. He questioned whether it was missing a green marker, traditionally used to signify a new Bitcoin purchase. This raised speculation in the crypto community about whether a fresh acquisition is imminent. Over the last month, Saylor has subtly suggested Bitcoin purchases on social media, often followed by official announcements of large acquisitions. MicroStrategy recently grew its Bitcoin holdings to over 171,000 BTC, investing more than $15 billion . If a new purchase is confirmed, it would be the company’s first since joining the Nasdaq-100 Index on December 13. Analysts believe this inclusion could pave the way for MicroStrategy’s eventual entry into the S&P 500, which tracks the top 500 U.S. companies. According to CoinDesk’s James Van Straten, the final requirement for S&P 500 eligibility is achieving positive earnings over the past four quarters. Van Straten predicted that with new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regulations in early 2025, and if Bitcoin reaches $120,000, MicroStrategy could report $25 billion in net income , potentially qualifying for the S&P 500 as soon as Q2 2025. Meanwhile, Marathon Digital Holdings is working toward joining the Nasdaq-100 Index. Saylor suggested Marathon is the most likely candidate after congratulating Marathon CEO Fred Thiel on his company’s progress. However, Marathon has challenges to overcome, with its market capitalization still far below the $10 billion threshold that MicroStrategy met before its inclusion. Despite this, Marathon has aggressively increased its Bitcoin reserves, spending over $1 billion in December to grow its holdings to 40,435 BTC , valued at nearly $3.9 billion. This makes Marathon the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, following MicroStrategy. As Marathon continues expanding its portfolio, it is cementing its position as a key player in institutional crypto investment. These developments highlight the evolving landscape of corporate Bitcoin adoption, with MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital leading the way. Their efforts underscore the growing importance of digital assets in the institutional investment space, as companies leverage Bitcoin to strengthen their market influence and prepare for greater opportunities in the future.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-hints-at-new-bitcoin-buy-after-nasdaq-milestone,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37707538.jpeg
37707637,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627994,1734337991,The US dollar’s biggest threat is actually America itself,"Donald Trump loves a fight, especially when he thinks he’s protecting something “mighty.” His latest battle? Demanding the BRICS nations promise never to create a currency that could rival the U.S. dollar. This time, the warning included a 100% tariff. The BRICS group, originally made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded to include Iran, the UAE, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Some members scrambled to calm the situation. South Africa publicly denied any plans for a shared currency. India’s foreign minister followed up, insisting BRICS countries weren’t out to weaken the dollar. But this drama glaringly points at something deeper: the U.S. dollar’s dominance is facing a real threat—and the enemy is internal. BRICS isn’t killing the dollar — it’s protecting itself The truth is, BRICS nations aren’t plotting some grand dollar takedown. What they’ve always said they want is financial independence. Trade between these nations is complicated, and relying on the dollar exposes them to U.S. power. South Africa explained the group is only looking to trade in their own currencies, which they described as “de-risking.” India’s case shows why this matters. For years, the country has struggled with U.S. sanctions. India stopped importing oil from Venezuela because Washington said so. Then it turned to Iran, only for the same restrictions to hit. Now, with Russia, India’s finding itself tangled in yet another web of U.S. controls. Even the most pro-West voices in New Delhi see the need for payment systems outside of U.S. oversight. But here’s the thing: trading without dollars is a nightmare. Let’s say India buys oil from Russia using rupees. What would Russia do with all that Indian cash? Spend it on Indian goods? Sure, but if there’s no balance in trade, Russia ends up with a pile of rupees it can’t use. That’s the problem. Despite these obstacles, the BRICS boys are determined to reduce dollar reliance. They’re not trying to crush the U.S. economy, as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin explained in the past. They’re just building systems that give them more control. Countries like the UAE have been working on alternatives for years, serving as middlemen between rival blocs. America’s overreach needs to be stopped More companies and countries find themselves caught up in sanctions almost monthly. Dual-use goods, financial institutions, entire industries—nothing is off-limits. When markets face restrictions, someone always steps in to keep trade flowing. Even organizations aligned with the West are exploring ways to bypass the dollar. The Bank for International Settlements, controlled by central banks worldwide, started a project to move money outside the dollar system. It didn’t last long. Western governments pressured the BIS to pull the plug. But the fact that they even tried speaks volumes. The dollar didn’t always face this kind of backlash. It used to be seen as a global public good—neutral, stable, trusted. Countries traded in it, invested in it, and converted it freely. In return, the U.S. got the “exorbitant privilege” of printing the world’s reserve currency. This allowed America to rack up deficits that would sink any other nation. But things have changed since then. American overreach is the problem. From endless sanctions to Federal Reserve meddling, the U.S. keeps using the dollar as a political weapon. Every time it does, trust erodes. And trust is the real foundation of the dollar’s dominance. Trump, of course, doesn’t see it that way. His solution has evidently been threats, as usual. Nigeria calls Trump’s bluff Meanwhile, Nigeria joined as a partner country in October and has publicly dismissed Trump’s threats as nothing empty bluster. “Nigeria is a sovereign nation that can decide its alliances,” they said. The ‘African Giant’ will continue pushing for global representation, including joining the G20 and United Nations Security Council. They added that, “Trump has threatened so many countries, not only BRICS. He threatened Canada and China, so Nigeria should not allow any country to dictate for it. It will pay Nigeria more to be a member of BRICS.” Clearly, America isn’t as scary as it used to be. Some economists had warned of this as an outcome if Trump keeps being aggressive. They predicted that he’ll end up pushing the BRICS members to spitefully launch a new currency way sooner than expected. The way we see it, the future of USD is in the hands of its maker. Starting a fight with Putin and the BRICS when he himself said he wasn’t interested in dethroning the dollar anymore after Trump won was probably not the best idea. But hey, that’s just Trump.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-dollars-biggest-threat-is-america/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37707637.jpeg

In a December 15 post on X, Saylor teased the absence of a “green dot” on the Bitcoin portfolio tracker , known as SaylorTracker, sparking speculation about a new buy. Over the past five Sundays, Saylor has posted similar updates, each followed by official confirmation of Bitcoin purchases the next day. If the trend holds, this would mark MicroStrategy’s first Bitcoin acquisition with an average purchase price exceeding $100,000 per coin. Bitcoin prices have stayed above the six-figure mark since December 13, according to CoinGecko data . A $50 Billion Bitcoin Portfolio Within Reach MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisition over recent weeks has seen the firm pay average prices ranging between $95,976 and $98,783 per BTC. The latest hint suggests the company’s holdings may now approach the $50 billion milestone. As of December 15, MicroStrategy holds 423,650 Bitcoin valued at $43.6 billion. The timing aligns with Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to a new all-time high of $106,554 on December 14, as investor optimism surges amid broader market rallies. Saylor, known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, has made it clear that the firm’s buying spree is far from over. In previous interviews, he confidently stated his intention to continue purchasing Bitcoin even if its price soars to $1 million. MicroStrategy Stock Shines MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has been a star performer this year, with its share price skyrocketing by 496.4% year-to-date, according to Google Finance data. The impressive performance has earned it a spot in the prestigious Nasdaq-100 index , which tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. The firm’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin has solidified its reputation as a trailblazer in corporate crypto adoption. This latest move, if confirmed, will further underscore Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation. MicroStrategy’s growing portfolio and Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally signal that the cryptocurrency remains a dominant force in the financial world.

37710096,https://invezz.com/?p=2388417,1734337912,"Bitcoin surges to $106K, up 50% since US election: will the rally last?","Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has captured global attention as it surged past $106,000, marking an unprecedented 50% gain since the US election earlier this month. The cryptocurrency market has been electrified by speculation that President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will adopt a friendlier stance toward digital assets. Analysts at Reuters suggest this rally is buoyed by expectations of a pro-crypto regulatory environment and the potential creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve, similar to the United States’ strategic oil reserve. With the total cryptocurrency market value surpassing $3.8 trillion, questions arise over the sustainability of this extraordinary rally. Bitcoin rallies 50% post-election Bitcoin price reached $106,533, before settling at $104,462, a 3.2% gain on Monday. This significant milestone comes as Trump’s administration signals a shift in the nation’s cryptocurrency strategy. In his recent remarks, Trump hinted at establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve, a move aimed at reinforcing US dominance in the digital asset space. This announcement coincides with the increasing global adoption of cryptocurrencies. The United States already holds nearly 200,000 Bitcoins, valued at over $20 billion. Other nations, including China, the UK, Bhutan, and El Salvador, have also amassed substantial bitcoin reserves, further underscoring the growing role of crypto in national financial strategies. Global interest in crypto grows The prospect of a Bitcoin reserve is not unique to the United States. Countries like Russia have shown interest in diversifying their reserves to reduce reliance on the US dollar, which President Vladimir Putin criticized as being wielded for political leverage. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are seen as an alternative asset immune to direct control by any single government. However, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell remains skeptical. Jerome Powell recently compared Bitcoin to gold, highlighting its speculative nature. Despite this, the momentum in the crypto market suggests a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value. Crypto-friendly policies boost market sentiment The anticipation of crypto-friendly policies has played a crucial role in the current rally. Trump’s pro-crypto stance during his campaign included promises to make the United States a “crypto capital.” His administration has already taken steps to deliver on these pledges, such as appointing David Sacks, a former PayPal executive, as the White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Trump is expected to nominate Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto attorney, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. The inclusion of MicroStrategy, a company with substantial bitcoin holdings, in the Nasdaq-100 Index has further fuelled optimism. Shares of MicroStrategy have surged six-fold this year, reaching a market value of $94 billion. Analysts believe its inclusion will attract significant inflows, amplifying the company’s ability to purchase more Bitcoin. Can the rally sustain its momentum? Despite the bullish sentiment, analysts caution that the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve could take considerable time and may face regulatory hurdles. Some market watchers also point out that the rapid price increase might lead to profit-taking, resulting in temporary pullbacks. Nevertheless, the broader market appears optimistic. Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains of 192% reflect its growing appeal among both retail and institutional investors. With Trump’s administration poised to introduce measures favoring digital assets, the question remains: Can Bitcoin sustain its record-breaking rally, or will it face a reality check as regulatory complexities come into play?

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

Following its recent surge to an all-time high (ATH) above $106,000, the Bitcoin price has played out an interesting pattern on the 1-day candlestick timeframe, which points to an extremely bullish outlook for the leading cryptocurrency. Notably, Master Kenobi, a popular crypto analyst on X, revealed an extremely bullish 88-day pattern on the Bitcoin price chart, drawing parallels to a similar pattern from late 2023. 88-Day Pattern Resembles Historical Symmetry On Bitcoin Price Chart Master Kenobi’s analysis begins with the identification of an 88-day structure that bears a striking resemblance to Bitcoin’s price movements in Q4 2023, just before the current bull market phase began. Taking to social media platform X, the analyst noted that the initial 37 days of the current pattern since November 2024 mimic a similar hidden distribution phase observed last year. Furthermore, both the price action and the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator align closely with the previous cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Fails To Follow Bitcoin’s Recent Uptick: Is A New ATH Still Feasible This Cycle? To visualize this, he connected critical points A1 to A2 and B1 to B2 on the relative strength index, which highlighted the symmetrical nature of the formations. According to Master Kenobi, the symmetry between these sequences suggests that Bitcoin’s ongoing trajectory could mirror its past, particularly in the next 51 days. While the analyst emphasizes that this observation is not a precise prediction, he believes it offers a framework for understanding Bitcoin’s behavior based on past behavior and the current structure. Projection Points To $124,300 By Early 2025 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been known to repeat their previous price performance from time to time. By analyzing historical price playouts and current patterns, analysts and traders are provided with a context of what to expect. Expanding on his analysis, Master Kenobi ventured into speculative territory by sketching a predicted price path for Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price In Motion: Analyst Reveals The Next Major Supports And Resistances The analyst speculated that the next 51-day sequence could follow a similar trajectory to the past 51 days in late 2023, culminating in a price of $124,300 by January 31, 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, having recently reached an intraday high and all-time high of $106,352 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The leading cryptocurrency is already up 12% this month, and reaching the projected price target of $124,300 would translate to a further 18% increase. Whether Bitcoin repeats its price pattern in late 2023 remains to be seen, but current price action and crypto market sentiment suggest that the Bitcoin price has a lot of room to run in 2025.

In an interview with South Korean media outlet Maeil Kyungjae , Eun-bo argued the crypto market needs to be institutionalized in the same way that traditional finance has in order to overcome regulatory roadblocks. If they fail to do so, Eun-bo believes South Korea will not be able to compete with countries that have already embraced crypto and put forth regulations that place virtual assets on equal standing with traditional assets. “If we are vague with our treatment of virtual currency and treat it as a speculative asset, we will fall behind in terms of international competitiveness,” he said. He emphasized how crypto adoption in the global market has developed at such a rapid pace that it even managed to surpass the domestic stock market in terms of trading volume. “The average daily trading volume of the domestic stock market is approximately 20 trillion won ($13.9 billion). But the virtual currency market has surpassed this since Donald Trump was elected as U.S. President,” said Eun-bo. You might also like: South Korean martial law catapults crypto trading volume to new record high with $34b The Chairman’s remarks came after he recently attended the World Exchange Market summit, where crypto-relates issues were “seriously discussed” during the conference. At the time of writing, there are no crypto firms formally listed on the South Korean Stock Exchange and local companies are still unable to add crypto investments to their balance sheets. Not only that, the nation’s government has yet to approve the launch of Bitcoin ( BTC ) spot exchange-traded funds . According to the report, some insiders in the financial investment industry pointed out that banning spot ETFs that track the price of Bitcoin while allowing leveraged trading for conventional ETFs “makes no sense from an investor protection standpoint.” Unfortunately, financial investors will have to wait a little longer before any major changes can be made for Bitcoin spot ETFs or the wider crypto market in South Korea.

After the vote passed, the National Assembly passed motion 204-85 and Yoon’s presidential powers and duties have been suspended.

Back then, it seemed like just another blockchain experiment. Fast forward, and Hedera has become a cornerstone of enterprise-level blockchain solutions, leaving many wishing they had paid attention. If you’ve been waiting for another opportunity, the crypto space might just have handed you one. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a Layer One blockchain that blends innovation with practicality. Qubetics is more than a token; it’s a platform poised to change how businesses and developers interact with blockchain technology. With its presale in full swing and potential for significant returns, Qubetics could very well be the best crypto to buy for significant returns. Qubetics Transforms Blockchain Development With QubeQode IDE and a Promising $TICS Presale Qubetics isn’t just about tokens and transactions. At the heart of its ecosystem lies the QubeQode IDE, a game-changing tool for blockchain development. Think about how complex it can be for businesses to incorporate blockchain—teams of developers, endless coding, and months of trial and error. QubeQode flips that narrative by offering a drag-and-drop interface. Businesses and developers can create applications with pre-built components for things like user authentication, token management, and data storage. It’s all done through an intuitive interface that even non-tech-savvy users can navigate. Picture a small business wanting to reward customers with loyalty tokens. Normally, they’d need a developer and weeks of work. With QubeQode, they can have their own token system set up in hours. Even freelance developers can expand their offerings, using QubeQode’s code snippet library to implement complex blockchain functionalities in just a few clicks. It’s designed to lower the barrier of entry, making blockchain accessible to everyone. Now, about the presale. Qubetics is in its 12th stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.031. Over 334 million tokens have already been sold, raising $6.4 million from more than 8,000 holders . Each presale stage lasts only 7 days, ending every Sunday at midnight. With a 10% price increase at the start of each stage, the window to buy at the current price is closing fast. Hedera’s Quiet Rise: How Hashgraph Technology Is Redefining Blockchain Efficiency and Enterprise Adoption Hedera’s story is one of quiet dominance. When it first launched, it was marketed as a blockchain alternative for enterprises. Hedera’s focus was on scalability, security, and speed—all essential for businesses adopting blockchain. Early sceptics saw it as yet another blockchain project in an already crowded space. But today, Hedera has partnerships with some of the biggest names in tech and finance, from IBM to Google. What makes Hedera unique is its Hashgraph technology. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hashgraph is faster and more efficient, allowing for thousands of transactions per second. This efficiency has made it a favourite for enterprises needing high throughput and low costs. While Hedera’s initial token price during its ICO was modest, its consistent growth has turned it into a heavyweight in the crypto world. For those who missed Hedera’s early days, it’s a painful reminder of how timing is everything. But the lesson here isn’t about regret; it’s about recognising the next opportunity. Qubetics, with its cutting-edge tools and growing ecosystem, has the potential to follow a similar path of adoption and success. Conclusion For those searching for opportunities in the crypto world, Qubetics is making a strong case as the best option for significant returns today. Its QubeQode IDE is transforming blockchain development, enabling businesses and developers to build applications with ease and efficiency. Hedera proved the value of spotting innovation early, and Qubetics is paving the way for another chance to capitalise on groundbreaking technology. This isn’t just an investment—it’s a leap into the future of blockchain. Take a moment to see if Qubetics could be the key to unlocking your next big financial move.

The rising bearish pressure of the token raises concerns over the year-end targets as a significant shift in the liquidity. The trading volume has dropped by over 5% compared to the previous week, which indicates a huge contraction incoming. After marking itself as one of the top chains, Solana has gained huge attention, which has now become the home for developers too. This has made the investors more confident and optimistic about the SOL price. As per some data, Solana’s long-term asset retention rates have increased notably. With this, the market participants now expect a significant rise in the token’s value in the months ahead. The SOL price is holding one of the pivotal levels around $216 as support, which has offered a strong base throughout the past week. Although the bulls are trying to keep up the rally, the growing upward pressure is weakening them. Hence, defending these levels could be extremely crucial, which may help the tokens to close the yearly trade on a bullish note. In the larger timeframe, the SOL price has completed a massive cup & handle pattern and also a retest after breaking the neckline. Therefore, now it appears to be pretty obvious that the token may now trigger a strong rebound. However, the drop in the buying pressure, as indicated by MACD, raises some concerns as the volume has also dropped to some extent. Moreover, the levels display a potential bearish crossover, which could worsen the SOL price rally by dragging it below the crucial support. On the other hand, the +Di & -Di of DMI were heading towards a bearish crossover, but both have halted and are trying for a bullish reversal. Besides, the ADX, which records the strength of the rally, is rising. Therefore, the price is believed to hold support at $216 and trigger a rebound, which could pave the way for a new ATH above $400. In case of a failure, then the Solana (SOL) is feared to drop below $200, which is unlikely with the growing bullish sentiments within the markets.",NEGATIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bearish-signals-flash-for-solana-sol-price-rally-is-300-target-viable-for-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Saylor’s proposal, outlined at a recent meeting, is based on the idea that Bitcoin has emerged as the ultimate global reserve capital network. “Bitcoin is better than real estate, better than stocks,” Saylor said, adding that no corporate or real estate asset can rival Bitcoin as a long-term investment. He suggested that the U.S. could catalyze Bitcoin’s growth by purchasing 20-25% of the network on behalf of the government. Saylor has viewed Bitcoin as a transformative financial instrument that could strengthen the U.S. economy while diminishing the value of rival countries’ gold reserves. He argued that by selling all of its gold holdings and buying Bitcoin, the U.S. could cash in on Bitcoin’s growth while weakening the finances of countries with significant gold reserves, such as China and Russia. Related News: Watch Out: Very Important Week Ahead - Major Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up! Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List “Dump your gold,” Saylor urged, adding: “Sell all US gold, buy Bitcoin. This transaction is essentially free because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the price of gold.” Saylor also noted the broader implications of such a move, suggesting that demonetizing gold could reduce its value to near zero, which could significantly impact countries that rely on gold reserves, while Bitcoin’s value could skyrocket. “Our assets will reach $100 trillion, and we will control the world’s reserve currency network as well as the world’s reserve capital network,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

37706741,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393446,1734336448,Strategic CEX Listings and Market Making: PrimeLink’s Integrated Approach,"The post Strategic CEX Listings and Market Making: PrimeLink’s Integrated Approach appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While ICOs and token launches can yield returns exceeding 100% within two weeks , the process is far more nuanced. Many projects use metrics like total funds raised as a KPI for success, but investor gains and the sustainability of these returns are what truly define a successful listing. Token launches are not inexpensive. With costs ranging from $40,000 to $200,000 , a well-executed exchange listing is not just desirable but essential. As major exchanges continue to refine their requirements and regulations in 2024, navigating these complexities has become increasingly challenging. Fortunately, PrimeLink excels in helping projects achieve listing success. Exchange Listing: Why It Matters A token—and the project it represents—is only as strong as its availability and liquidity for investors and traders. PrimeLink’s team deeply understands the dynamic nature of the crypto space, focusing on innovative strategies for exchange listings. Key Factors for a Successful Listing Timing and Strategy : Selecting the right exchange(s), determining whether to launch on one or multiple platforms, and choosing the optimal launch date and time are crucial decisions. Price Discovery : Establishing an accurate initial price helps stabilize the token and foster investor confidence. Liquidity Management : Adequate liquidity ensures smooth buying and selling. For multi-exchange launches, maintaining balanced liquidity across platforms is essential to minimize price discrepancies. PrimeLink addresses these challenges with precision, ensuring clients achieve maximum visibility and trading volume. Market Making: Overcoming Launch Challenges Choosing the right market maker is critical to a successful token launch. PrimeLink identifies key considerations for selecting a market maker: Exchange Partnerships : Collaborations with top-tier exchanges ensure wider exposure and access to high-volume trading demographics. Liquidity Balancing : Allocating the right liquidity across multiple platforms creates a seamless trading experience for users. Premier Exchange Liaison : Leveraging VIP relationships with exchanges enables faster listings and tailored solutions to overcome potential hurdles. How PrimeLink Achieves Results PrimeLink’s Stage III market-making strategy integrates expertise, partnerships, and bespoke solutions. With established relationships with Tier-1 exchanges such as Binance, ByBit, OKX, and KuCoin, PrimeLink provides planned and balanced launches across multiple platforms. The experienced listing team addresses technical issues, ensuring a smooth process. Additionally, PrimeLink tailors trading strategies to the unique needs of each project, enhancing the sustainability of post-launch gains. Metrics That Matter PrimeLink evaluates exchange listing success using actionable metrics: Launch Stability : Assessing token performance immediately post-launch. Volume Distribution : Analyzing how trading volume is spread across platforms. Price Discovery Speed : Measuring how quickly the token achieves its fair market value. Community Engagement : Monitoring activity levels to gauge user interest and adoption. These metrics provide clients with clear, focused insights, avoiding distractions from irrelevant data. PrimeLink: One-Stop Exchange Launch Solution No two projects are the same. PrimeLink delivers customized Stage III solutions tailored to each token’s unique requirements. Notable successes, such as Kalichain’s 24x post-listing growth, underscore PrimeLink’s expertise.

37706664,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312942,1734336272,"Bitcoin Could Become Neutral Reserve Asset As BTC Now a National Security Issue, Says Investor Luke Gromen","Macro guru Luke Gromen believes the US has minimal choice but to seriously consider elevating Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a neutral reserve asset. In a new interview with Bitcoin firebrand Robert Breedlove, Gromen says the country is facing a national security crisis after Russia crushed US and NATO forces in Ukraine. Gromen believes that the defeat has changed the rules of the game, forcing the Department of Defense and the national security apparatus to abandon the fiat currency system. According to the macro guru, the US dollar system drove the country to shutter its factories, crippling America’s ability to manufacture armaments for national defense. But Gromen says the national defense and intelligence establishment now sees an opportunity to revitalize its industries by debasing the dollar and using Bitcoin to back the Treasury market. “The game theory has changed around this: for national political stability, for bringing back the middle and working class for defense base re-establishment. All of these things are pointing to a neutral reserve asset… Bitcoin has gone from an eye-roll laugh in this sentence a year ago… but I don’t think there should be. Treasury [Department] is talking about how to use stablecoins to create a balance sheet basically for T-bills to finance deficits. Paul Ryan, former speaker of the House [and] VP candidate, [wrote an] op-ed about how stablecoins could be used to create demand for T-bills. Trump saying Bitcoin is the new oil, reportedly, [and] the strategic [Bitcoin] reserve.” Gromen says the statements of politicians and the Treasury Department tell him that the US is gearing up to massively boost the market cap of Bitcoin, similar to what happened to oil in 1973 when it surged 400%. “What that oil price did by moving up that way was it effectively made oil big enough to back the dollar, to back the US deficits.” According to Gromen, elevating Bitcoin as a neutral reserve asset will allow the US to finance the re-establishment of its industries for national defense without making Americans poor. “The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee report has a chart: here’s the market cap of crypto, here’s the market cap of stablecoins, here’s how many T-bills stablecoins have bought, and it’s linear. That’s how they’re looking at it… When you think about it that way in the context of political stability issues that you need to address, the national defense issues you need to address, the game theory is turned on its head… Bitcoin isn’t a threat that is rising. It needs to go up faster so that we have more balance sheet capacity and so that our people, as we reinflate to re-shore all of this stuff because it is going to be inflationary, that’s not a bad thing to compensate your people to keep them whole on a real basis while that happens.” Source: Treasury Department At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,063.

37708467,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319701,1734336263,Peanut the Squirrel’s Owner Sues Binance Over Alleged IP Infringement,"Mark Longo, the owner of viral internet sensation Peanut the Squirrel, has filed a lawsuit against global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, accusing the company of intellectual property infringement. Longo claims Binance used images and narratives featuring Peanut without his permission. “My legal team initiated action against Binance for the unauthorized use of my intellectual property, including images and stories featuring my beloved animals,” Longo stated on his X account , Squirrel_Dad. Longo Warns of More Upcoming Lawsuits In his post, Longo warned that he might pursue more lawsuits in a bid to protect his “creative work.” “This is the first of multiple cease and desist letters to be issued. I’m committed to protecting my creative work and sending a clear message: unauthorized use of my IP will not be tolerated.” The lawsuit comes amid rising tensions in the Peanut-themed meme coin ecosystem. Longo recently launched the “Justice for Peanut” (JFP) token, branding it as the “only real PNUT coin.” The token initially surged to a market cap of $116 million earlier this month but has since seen its valuation plummet by more than 95%, now sitting at $3 million. The legal battle and Longo’s involvement in meme coin launches have drawn mixed reactions from the online crypto community. On platforms like X, some users questioned his intentions, alleging that he’s using the controversy for financial gain. “You rugged 5 separate contracts and made millions of dollars already and we have all the proof. Everyone knows your a scamming value extractor,” one user commented. You rugged 5 separate contracts and made millions of dollars already and we have all the proof. Everyone knows your a scamming value extractor — flooksta (@flooksta) December 16, 2024 Peanut the Squirrel’s name gained widespread attention during the U.S. presidential election after a clash between Longo and New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC). The agency confiscated Peanut and a raccoon from Longo’s care, and it was later revealed that Peanut had died in custody. The incident sparked public outrage, drawing support from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. The controversy around Peanut inspired the creation of numerous meme coins, with PNUT emerging as the most notable. On November 11, PNUT secured a listing on Binance, further elevating its market status. Within 11 days of launch, PNUT’s market cap soared to $1 billion—a milestone that took Dogecoin (DOGE) 1,487 days to achieve. Just a Chill Guy Character Creator Moves to Enforce Copyright In a similar incidnent, artist Phillip Banks, the creator behind the viral “Just a Chill Guy” meme, revealed plans to enforce copyright protection on his popular character last month. The announcement came as the meme, a laid-back, anthropomorphic dog with a signature smirk and hands in pockets, had taken over the crypto world with its meteoric rise in value. “Just putting it out there, chill guy has been copyrighted. like, legally. I’ll be issuing takedowns on for-profit related things over the next few days,” Banks said at the time. He added that this does not include brand accounts using the meme as a trend. “Mainly unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins,” he added.

The ASU’s amendments improved the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring entities to measure them at fair value and recognize fair value changes in net income each reporting period. Richard Jones, the FASB Chair, said the new standard responded to feedback from stakeholders of all backgrounds who indicated that the Board should prioritize improving crypto assets’ accounting and disclosure. The amendments also required entities to improve the information provided to investors about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes between reporting periods. FASB enhances corporate Bitcoin accounting rules HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 FASB’s fair value accounting standard, which will be officially implemented starting today, allows companies like MicroStrategy to use fair value measurement methods to more accurately reflect the real value of Bitcoin assets. Previously, companies had to use the impairment loss accounting method, which reflected the falling value of Bitcoin as a loss in their accounting books. It was also difficult to reflect the actual increase in Bitcoin’s market value in accounting. Applying fair value accounting standards would allow Bitcoin’s market value fluctuations to be reflected in real time. The regulatory shift improved investor confidence and aligned Bitcoin valuation with market conditions. Many analysts expected this clarity to further increase institutional interest in Bitcoin. “It will provide investors and other capital allocators with more relevant information that better reflects the underlying economics of certain crypto assets and an entity’s financial position while reducing cost and complexity associated with applying current accounting.” ~ Richard Jones Early adoption of the ASU amendments would also be permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that still need to be issued. The ASU’s amendments will apply to all assets that meet the definition of intangible assets under the FASB accounting standard codification. Bitcoin to gain appeal as treasury reserve asset According to the FASB, the fair value rule marked a critical point for the role of digital assets like Bitcoin in corporate finance. Under the new standard, companies would be able to hold Bitcoin without concerns over impairment-driven reporting issues. MicroStrategy’s founder and Chair, Michael Saylor, said that upgrading accounting standards would facilitate corporations adoption of BTC worldwide, as a treasury reserve asset. He expected MARA to be the next Bitcoin company to be added to the Nasdaq 100. Saylor identified the FASB fair value rule as one of the three factors pushing Bitcoin’s price towards $1 million. He also emphasized that traditional bank custody would drive Bitcoin’s bullish trend. The MicroStrategy Chair added that bank custody services increased mainstream confidence and Bitcoin adoption by providing secure investment channels. While the new guidance applied to assets that met the scope criteria under ASC 350-60, not all assets would meet these criteria. Deloitte reported that wrapped tokens such as WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) would not be included in the scope of the new rule since such tokens provided their holders with the right or claim to the underlying wrapped crypto assets. Entities would need to use ‘judgment’ in accounting for wrapped tokens even if the underlying token was within the scope of the amendments.

Between December 10 and 12, Riot bought roughly $510 million in Bitcoin, bringing the total value of its BTC holdings to nearly $1.7 billion. Leading bitcoin mining company Riot Platform recently raised $525 million to fund a significant addition to its BTC holdings, which now totals nearly $1.7 billion.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 13, 2024 The purchase comes after activist investor Starboard Value took a “significant position” in the company. According to the Wall Street Journal , no financial details were disclosed, but the news of Starboard’s stake boosted Riot’s shares significantly. The WSJ reported that Starboard urged Riot Platforms to repurpose some of its Bitcoin mining capacity to service artificial intelligence models, and Riot’s purchase may have been due to pressure from Starboard as buying BTC has shown itself to be a way for miners to win over their investors. Riot reportedly told the WSJ: “We are committed to creating value for all shareholders, and we look forward to constructive dialogue with Starboard on ways to achieve this shared goal.” Shifting Focus to Artificial Intelligence The burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) market has progressed and become more integrated into most business and technology aspects. As the sector continues to expand, the demand for computational power from AI is rising, and the Bitcoin mining industry is well-equipped to service this need. To service their own enterprise, Bitcoin and crypto miners are equipped with expansive data centres and captive power supplies, making them the ideal candidates for AI involvement. According to the reports from the WSJ, Starboard Value wants Riot to convert some of its bitcoin-mining facilities into space for big data centre users. According to a report from asset fund manager VanEck, Riot could gain an estimated $4.8 billion in market capitalization by pivoting to AI businesses, which would more than double the company’s current market cap. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, explained the logic behind pivoting to AI, “The synergy is simple: AI companies need energy, and Bitcoin miners have it.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37705603,https://nulltx.com/?p=135781,1734334210,Top 3 Coins to Invest in This Weekend to Boost Your Financial Standing,"When it comes to cryptocurrencies, timing is everything. If you’re looking to shake up your financial game and make some bold moves, the market this weekend offers some tantalising options. With the crypto market buzzing from price surges and exciting developments, these coins have positioned themselves as the ones to watch. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just testing the waters, you’ll want to join the bandwagon before it’s too late. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a groundbreaking project that’s turning heads with its presale momentum and real-world utility. Add Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for portfolio gold. Let’s break down why these are the best coins to invest this weekend and how they could boost your financial standing. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Innovation Redefined Let’s start with the breakout star of the moment: Qubetics ($TICS) . Forget what you know about presales—Qubetics is rewriting the playbook with its innovative QubeQode IDE , a game-changing platform that simplifies and streamlines blockchain development for everyone. Imagine you’re a freelance graphic designer in Portland looking to tokenise your digital assets for passive income. With QubeQode, all that’s as easy as pie. You don’t need a PhD in blockchain; this platform makes it as simple as dragging and dropping. Qubetics isn’t just about promises; it’s delivering results. The presale is in its 12th stage, with over 334 million tokens sold to 9,700 holders, raising a whopping $6.4 million. The current price of $TICS is $0.0311, but here’s the kicker—come the weekend, the price will spike by 10%. Don’t sleep on this one, because analysts are calling for insane ROI figures: 703% by presale end, 3,112% post-presale, and a jaw-dropping 48,092% after the mainnet launch. Yeah, you read that right—48,092%. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s not just about hype. Qubetics solves real-world problems that traditional blockchains never could, all while delivering mind-blowing growth potential. Plus, the FOMO is real—missing out on $TICS now could be the financial regret of the decade. 2. Cardano (ADA): The Scalablity and Sustainability Champion Next up, we’ve got Cardano (ADA) , the OG of sustainability and scalability. Cardano has always been the cool, calculated sibling in the crypto family, focusing on getting the fundamentals right before chasing flashy trends. Its recent developments are proof that patience pays off. Just last week, the network rolled out a hydra-head scaling upgrade , making transactions faster and cheaper. If you’ve been annoyed by Ethereum’s gas fees, Cardano might just be your saving grace. Cardano’s versatility is what makes it stand out. Picture a startup in Austin looking to launch a decentralised app or a social enterprise in Denver aiming to bring blockchain to underserved communities—Cardano provides the tools, the network, and the reliability. No wonder it’s gaining traction with developers and big-name partnerships alike. Analysts predict ADA could hit $1.50 by Q1 2025 , driven by its steady adoption and robust ecosystem. Trading at just $0.29 right now, this weekend is a prime time to snag ADA before it makes its next move upward. Remember, in the crypto world, slow and steady often wins the race. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano combines solid tech with tangible use cases, making it one of the best coins to invest this weekend . Plus, its steady climb means you can invest without losing sleep over wild volatility. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Your Trusted Powerhouse Rounding out our list is Binance Coin (BNB) —the powerhouse that’s as reliable as your grandma’s apple pie recipe. As the native coin of Binance, the largest crypto exchange on the planet, BNB is a cornerstone of the digital finance world. But don’t think for a second that BNB’s story is boring—it’s been making waves with recent updates. Binance is expanding its ecosystem with BNB Greenfield , a decentralised storage network that’s set to rival Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. Imagine a world where your data isn’t controlled by tech giants but is instead secure, private, and decentralised. That’s where BNB is headed. For crypto investors, this means more utility and higher demand, translating into price growth. Currently trading at $232 , BNB has held its ground during market downturns and is primed for a rally as market sentiment improves. Analysts are bullish, forecasting BNB to hit $450 by mid-2025 . Its deflationary mechanism (regular coin burns) ensures a steady increase in value over time. BNB is the Swiss Army knife of cryptocurrencies—practical, dependable, and always in demand. If you’re serious about boosting your portfolio this weekend, this one’s a no-brainer. Conclusion: Time to Make Your Move There you have it—three powerhouses poised to supercharge your portfolio this weekend. Whether it’s the mind-blowing ROI potential of Qubetics ($TICS), the steady growth of Cardano (ADA), or the multifaceted strength of Binance Coin (BNB), these coins are your ticket to financial gains. The crypto market waits for no one, and neither should you. Don’t let this weekend pass you by while others are cashing in. Qubetics’ presale is closing fast, and with analysts calling for explosive growth, this could be your shot at life-changing profits. Head over to the presale page, secure your $TICS tokens, and set your portfolio on fire. So, what are you waiting for? The best coins to invest this weekend won’t stick around forever.

37706658,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52274,1734334082,ChatGPT Says Stellar (XLM) Will Hit This Price On Christmas Day,"As the cryptocurrency market wraps up a turbulent year, there’s renewed speculation surrounding Stellar Lumens (XLM), with ChatGPT predicting a notable rally for the digital asset during the holiday season. According to the AI model’s forecast, Stellar is poised to climb approximately 20% from its current value of $0.4164 to hit $0.50 by Christmas Day. This projection emerges despite XLM’s recent dip of 3.59% over the last 24 hours, suggesting the market may be primed for a short-term recovery. “Stellar’s consistent strides in fostering real-world blockchain adoption, combined with strategic partnerships and an optimistic market sentiment, make a 20% rally plausible as 2024 concludes,” ChatGPT stated. What’s Fueling the Optimism Around Stellar (XLM)? Several factors ChatGPT’s bullish forecast, including broader market sentiment and key developments in the Stellar ecosystem. Notably, cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG Crypto has also presented an ambitious outlook for XLM, predicting its value could surge to $2–$3 soon. EGRAG’s analysis, built upon his bullish stance over the last three years, continues to spotlight XLM’s potential as a transformative digital asset. Another thing that adds momentum to Stellar’s growth trajectory is the network’s recent announcement at the Meridian 2024 event in London. The event underscored Stellar’s commitment to expanding blockchain usability through innovative solutions and partnerships. Of particular note is the collaboration between Stellar and Mastercard , as revealed in a recent tweet from Stellar’s official X account. This partnership integrates Mastercard’s Crypto Credential solution with the Stellar network. This is a move to enhance security, trust, and usability for blockchain-based transactions. By ensuring verified and authenticated interactions on public blockchain networks, Stellar positions itself as a leader in the evolving digital payments space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can Stellar Reach $0.50 by Christmas? The $0.50 target would mark a significant milestone for XLM, reflecting renewed investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The prediction comes amidst broader market volatility but aligns with a growing consensus among analysts that blockchain assets with strong fundamentals, like Stellar, are well-positioned for growth. ChatGPT elaborated, “XLM has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market. Its partnerships with financial giants like Mastercard and focus on real-world applications make it a strong contender for price appreciation during seasonal bullish trends.” Historically, the cryptocurrency market experiences heightened activity during the final weeks of the year, often driven by increased trading volumes and optimistic market sentiment. If XLM capitalizes on these dynamics, a 20% rally to $0.50 is well within reach. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

37705432,https://crypto.news/?p=14319662,1734333877,"This Cardano alternative, currently at $0.15, could reach $30 in 2025","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Cardano faces market struggles, Rexas Finance emerges as a promising alternative with smart asset tokenization and a projected $30 valuation by 2025. Table of Contents Cardano’s market challenges What makes Rexas Finance unique? Why $30 is realistic for RXS Challenges for Cardano vs. opportunities for Rexas Finance Conclusion Cardano, often described as one of the most original blockchain projects, has been one of the key actors in the cold crypto market. However, recent market activity has stalled; the altcoin lost 15.57% from $1.3 to $0.94 in one week. As Cardano suffers a bearish wave, a new alternative, Rexas Finance (RXS), is attracting investors’ attention. With analysts forecasting this rising cryptocurrency to reach $30 by 2025, it is positioned for exponential expansion at under $0.15. Cardano’s market challenges The current price behavior of Cardano shows a change in the market’s attitude. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has declined from 79 to 53 points due to growing selling pressure, and active network addresses have dropped noticeably, indicating declining user involvement. Its Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio also supports this story by implying an increasing market value that is not matched by transaction volume, a conventional measure of overbought conditions. With an increase in short positions among traders, Cardano seems caught in a correction wave that might bring its price considerably lower, thereby challenging the $0.77 barrier. Although ADA has long-term promise, its present difficulties have caused investor attention to more exciting prospects like Rexas Finance. What makes Rexas Finance unique? With a novel approach to blockchain adoption via real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance is fast becoming a noteworthy substitute for Cardano. The platform offers a creative link between conventional banking and distributed technology by allowing consumers to tokenize tangible items such as real estate, fine art, and commodities. Rexas Finance seeks a tiny but fast-expanding sector that addresses real-world financial inefficiencies, unlike Cardano, which primarily concentrates on smart contracts and distributed apps. This emphasis on tangible asset tokenization guarantees the platform provides valuable solutions with general appeal, enabling significant adoption. Rexas Finance is in the last phases of its very successful presale, which has already raised over $26,615,783 at its price of $0.15. The presale’s reaction shows great investor faith in the project’s long-term viability. Furthermore, Rexas Finance’s tokenomics reflects its growth-oriented approach. As demand rises, RXS tokens will value much more since their total quantity of 1 billion is meant to balance scarcity and usefulness. Further appealing to early investors with a chance for significant gains is the projected listing of RXS on top-tier exchanges in 2025 at an estimated launch price of $0.20. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Why $30 is realistic for RXS Rexas Finance’s strong foundations and strategic market orientation help to explain why it projects $30 by 2025. Rexas Finance is ready to take a sizable portion of the expanding asset tokenizing industry as demand for them keeps increasing. Moreover, the platform’s creative elements: the Rexas Token Builder, the Rexas GenAi, the Rexas Treasury, and the Rexas Launchpad, allow a broad spectrum of users, from institutional players to retail investors, accessibility. This adaptability guarantees consistent acceptance, which is essential for a continuous increase in token value. The cryptocurrency market also supports newly founded initiatives like Rexas Finance. Bull runs have historically witnessed a change in capital from recognized coins to attractive substitutes with more upward potential. Rexas Finance expects to gain, especially as its low entry price and unexplored market position appeal to consumers and institutional investors, even if analysts predict a market-wide surge in 2025. Challenges for Cardano vs. opportunities for Rexas Finance Although Cardano’s difficulties could be transient, they draw attention to projects’ established challenges in maintaining development and involvement. Cardano must pay attention to the declining active addresses and growing bearish attitude to regain momentum. On the other hand, Rexas Finance offers a new chance for those looking for high-growth potential in an emerging market sector. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a leader in the upcoming wave of blockchain innovation by focusing on actual financial inefficiencies and providing a platform fit for general adoption. Conclusion The focus is moving toward interesting substitutes like Rexas Finance as Cardano negotiates its present bearish wave. With a price of under $0.15 and a clear path to upset the asset tokenization market, RXS presents investors with hitherto unheard-of potential for increase. Supported by robust foundations, creative technology, and a growing market, Rexas Finance is positioned to reach $30 by 2025 and offers early adopters amazing rewards. Rexas Finance provides a convincing alternative over well-known brands like Cardano for individuals wishing to profit from the next great thing in crypto.

The adoption of stablecoin in regions like Sub-Saharan African and Latin America has skyrocketed. Ripple President Monica Long stated that stablecoin for payments is the future. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, have exploded in popularity. They’ve even beaten out Bitcoin (BTC) in transactions across the globe. Specifically, regions like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa have embraced these fiat-pegged assets, even as BTC hit $106,000 for the first time in history. This Chainalysis blog post explains how people in emerging markets use stablecoins to hedge against local monetary instability. They provide “a more reliable means of transacting and preserving value.” Furthermore, stablecoins have made a significant impact in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa due to their practicality for low-cost remittances, secure yield options, and access to DeFi services.

Special Agent David Paniwozik of the FBI’s Baltimore branch noted the growing trend, saying: “Criminals see cryptocurrencies as a quick and easy way to make money. Unfortunately, many investors are still unfamiliar with the technology, making them prime targets.” One of the key challenges, Paniwozik said, is the seamless and borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions. “Whether it’s $1 or billions of dollars, money can be instantly transferred from a U.S.-controlled wallet to an offshore wallet,” he explained. Scammers often set up fake cryptocurrency exchanges, convincing victims that their investments are growing rapidly or demanding crypto payments to “unlock” lucrative job offers. The FBI warns that these scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, capitalizing on the public's excitement about cryptocurrencies and their potential for high returns.

Significant losses have been reported in Maryland alone, with reported losses rising from $32,033 in 2023 to a staggering $3.8 million between January and October 2024. The average person in Maryland loses between $15,000 and $20,000 in these types of scams, Paniwozik said. According to the FBI’s 2023 Cryptocurrency Fraud Report, cryptocurrency-related complaints account for just 10% of all financial fraud reports, but nearly 50% of total monetary losses. The FBI advises potential investors and job seekers to be careful when dealing with cryptocurrency-related opportunities.

Each has its unique vibe, its devoted community, and promises of potential gains that make your heart race. Are these just another round of meme coin hype, or are they your ticket to the next big crypto breakout? While MEW and MOG have carved their spots as titans in the meme coin ecosystem, BTFD Coin is stealing the show with an electrifying presale that has the crypto world buzzing. Let’s dive in and see what sets these projects apart and why BTFD stands out as the best meme coin presale with 1000x potential. BTFD Coin: Revolutionising the Meme Coin Scene BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement for those who believe that every market dip is a golden opportunity. Right now, its 12th presale stage is underway, and the numbers are staggering: over 55 billion $BTFD coins sold, more than 5,400 holders on board, and $3.9 million raised so far. But the frenzy doesn’t stop there—analysts are already buzzing about its potential to deliver returns that could make your jaw drop. At the heart of BTFD Coin’s charm is its utility. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD is packed with features. Its Play2Earn (P2E) game, currently in beta, is an absolute game-changer. Imagine diving into a gaming experience that combines entertainment with the thrill of earning crypto. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards just yet, it’s a sneak peek into what’s to come—a full-blown crypto ecosystem where playing equals earning. Staking is another key pillar of BTFD’s ecosystem. With 18% of its supply allocated for staking rewards, the project ensures that early adopters are incentivised to hold long-term.

Schwartz confirmed that once supply and demand return to normal, the price of the stablecoin would settle close to its planned $1 parity, notwithstanding these anticipated swings. As RLUSD goes live, there may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes. There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD.

According to reports, one bid on a Ripple ( XRP ) wallet called Xaman priced a portion of RLUSD at 511 XRP, which is more than $1,200. Schwartz explained that rather than reflecting actual market worth, such high bids probably reflect people looking for the novelty of holding the first RLUSD tokens.

37704804,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52077,1734332408,IntelMarkets (INTL) Leads Downloads With QuantumX Wallet – Can This AI Platform Hit $1 Billion Market Cap,"IntelMarkets, a new AI-powered trading platform, is on course to transform the crypto trading landscape, hailed as a new DeFi project to watch. It is growing at a very fast pace with an intersection of AI and DeFi. Unlike conventional exchanges, it will integrate AI across all levels—the first true modern-gen exchange platform. As a trailblazer, experts anticipate massive adoption, primed for explosive growth. Experts suggest the INTL token will hit the $1 billion market cap milestone soon. IntelMarkets (INTL): A Novel AI-Powered Trading Platform IntelMarkets (INTL) might be this year’s most innovative crypto project. It adopts a novel strategy by fusing blockchain, DeFi, and AI technology. Industry analysts describe the resulting AI-driven trade system as revolutionary. It will differ from traditional platforms in a number of ways, including its sophisticated trading bots and ecosystem driven by an AI-based blockchain. Regardless of a user’s financial background, INTL’s trading bots will be built to provide them with access to top-notch trading methods. Furthermore, these bots may automatically enter profitable trading positions while processing large volumes of data from many sources at breakneck speed. Investors have started placing bets on the INTL cryptocurrency due to its imminent adoption. It is one of the greatest new cryptocurrencies to invest in because of its use cases, which include staking, governance, and administration. Huge Growth Prospects: On Track for a 9,500% Upswing As a new ICO and altcoin, INTL’s upside potential is staggering, outshining top crypto coins. With no bull market history, it has plenty of room to run, prompting traders to shift focus away from top altcoins to the new AI coin. In stage 7 of the ICO, a token costs only $0.064, heavily discounted and undervalued. Moreover, it is underpriced, allowing investors to position for substantial gains without breaking the bank—a retail favorite. Industry experts believe it is on track for a 9,500% upswing after its debut, making it arguably the best crypto to invest in. This significant upside potential is among the key reasons behind the presale selling out fast. Over $4.3 million has been raised, cementing its status as a top ICO and highlighting investor trust in its potential. Multichannel Analysis: A Key Feature Of IntelMarkets Multichannel analysis is a key feature of IntelMarkets. The Intelli-M trading system can perform technical calculations from multiple markets in seconds—the same can’t be said for other platforms. This is crucial as it would allow traders to maximize opportunities across different crypto pairs. Automatic and Self-Learning Trading Bots Sets INTL Apart INTL’s cutting-edge trading bots can identify profitable market opportunities, making it one of its kind. But that isn’t all; they can also take positions depending on users’ trading objectives. One only needs to adjust variables like leverage, risk, and position sizing to maximize this tech. Equally important, these trading robots can learn from their mistakes and real-time trading data, improving their performance. This ability to self-learn sets them apart. INTL’s Dual-Chain Functionality Makes It A Top Choice Lastly, IntelMarkets is a dual-chain functionality exchange that hopes to make the most of the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. It will be supported and can run on these mentioned chains, with traders able to choose their preferred blockchains based on specific requirements, such as preferences and strategies. For example, a trader might want to tap into Ethereum’s deep liquidity pools or robust ecosystem of dApps. Alternatively, Solana’s cost-effectiveness and scalability are also highly sought after. These features have catalyzed worldwide adoption and increased the popularity of the INTL tokens. Market analysts reveal that IntelMarkets is the most downloaded in this bull run. IntelMarkets (INTL): The First Quantum-Proof Trading Platform IntelMarkets ( INTL) will be the first of many things. It pioneered the world’s first quantum-proof custody solution, stirring up much buzz within the $264 billion global crypto trading market. Its recently launched QuantumX Wallet is a decentralized product developed after months of research aimed at preventing future security challenges arising from the de-encryption of data. The QuantumX Wallet will fend off cybersecurity attacks and the threat of quantum computing. It will provide the first retail solution to address this problem, and its outlook couldn’t be more bullish. Meanwhile, the Route X21 research initiative, seeded by a $1 million grant from partners in the MENA region, is dedicated to addressing the challenges posed by quantum computers. Given IntelMarkets’ real-world application, investors and retailers have been flocking to the ongoing INTL presale, tipped as the next big thing. Experts anticipate a $1 billion market cap for IntelMarkets soon.

It went up, down, and up again in the past 12 hours or so, leaving over $300 million in liquidations, but one particular order stands out as the largest. Data from CoinGlass shows that the primary cryptocurrency’s rally has wrecked nearly 100,000 traders in the past 24 hours. However, the biggest single liquidated position took place on Binance and involved the BTC/USDT trading pair. The total value was a whopping $19.86 million, which the whale lost during the volatile ride. Although it sounds as if it was likely from a short position, BTC also retraced by about two grand immediately after the latest peak, which could cast some doubt on whether it could have been a trader expecting further gains. After all, just over 51% of the liquidations on Binance were for shorts. Nevertheless, these developments only go to show that traders should be wary when opening over-leveraged positions in the current volatile environment. Liquidation Heat Map.

37704530,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393451,1734331999,"Cryptocurrency Market Today: Bitcoin Smahes New Highs Along with Ondo (ONDO) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), While Fantom (FTM) Marks Huge Gains","The post Cryptocurrency Market Today: Bitcoin Smahes New Highs Along with Ondo (ONDO) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), While Fantom (FTM) Marks Huge Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The markets began the weekly trade on a bullish note after the price of Bitcoin recorded a new ATH above $106.6K . This triggered a massive upswing in some altcoins, while others chose to trade within a narrow range. Ondo, for instance, is leading the top 100 with an over 15% rise, while Fantom (FTM) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) maintain a growth of over 13% each. With a bullish start, the question arises as to whether these tokens can maintain their dominance until the end of the day. Ondo (ONDO) Price Analysis Ondo price has been maintaining a steep upswing for over 40 days, regardless of the volume, which has been draining. Meanwhile, the bulls continue to remain dominant as they can exert enough bullish pressure. This also flipped the death cross that occurred in the first few days of September, offering significant bullish momentum to the token that smashed a new ATH at $2.79. As the above chart suggests, the price remains within the bullish range of the FIB channels as the price surged above 1 FIB but is yet to reach the next target at 1.2 FIB. The on-balance volume (OBV) continues to rise, suggesting the continuity of a bullish trend. Besides, the +Di & -DI are departing from each other, indicating a rise in the bullish trend. Therefore, the ONDO price is believed to maintain an ascending consolidation and mark a new ATH at $2.33, probably before the end of the year. Fantom (FTM) Price Analysis The Fantom price has been trading in a strong ascending trend since the reversal of the August lows close to $0.26. The trading volume over the platform has risen since November, which appears to have declined to a large extent. However, the token could get a fresh bullish boost as the selling pressure seems to have faded over the token. Hence, the price is believed to secure some crucial levels that may help the token form a new ATH in 2025. The FTM price is trading within a rising parallel channel and has faced multiple rejections close to the resistance. Currently, the token is facing some bearish pressure, but the bulls are expected to revamp a strong rise. The MACD ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) shows a drop in the selling pressure, which could pave the way for the accumulation of fresh buying volume. Hence, with a rise in the buying pressure, the price is expected to break above the Bollinger bands , which are currently going parallel, and reach $1.68. However, sustaining above the range could push the price above $2, which may eventually help the token to head towards the new ATH. On the other hand, the Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) price continues to trade within a discovery phase, forming a new ATH around $2.79. With this move, the token is an inch close to entering the top 50 cryptos, surpassing the giants like BONK, WIF, INJ, & ONDO. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37708464,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319683,1734331855,Fake Uber Driver Busted for Allegedly Stealing $300K in Crypto from Passengers in Scottsdale,"A man accused of posing as an Uber driver in Scottsdale, Arizona, has been arrested on charges of stealing a total of $300,000 in cryptocurrency from two unsuspecting passengers. According to a recent report from Fox10 Phoenix , the suspect, identified as Nuruhussein Hussein, allegedly targeted passengers outside the W Hotel in Scottsdale in two separate incidents, one in March and another in October. Authorities claim that Hussein pretended to be the Uber driver they had requested, even addressing them by name to gain their trust. Scammers Requested Access to Passenger Phones Once the passengers entered his vehicle, Hussein reportedly requested access to their phones. In the first instance, he claimed his own phone was broken and needed to borrow theirs. In the second, he offered to “fix” a supposed issue with the Uber app when the passengers noticed it had not confirmed a driver’s arrival. While in possession of their phones, Hussein allegedly accessed their Coinbase accounts and transferred their cryptocurrency to his own cold storage wallet. It remains unclear how he knew the passengers’ names to establish credibility. This $300K crypto heist in Scottsdale reveals a concerning evolution in social engineering attacks. Fake Uber driver targeting hotel guests + exploiting Coinbase mobile access = blueprint for future crypto theft vectors. Physical + digital security layers need serious rethinking… pic.twitter.com/QTPrFLe0Xc — AlphaChatX (@AlphaChatX) December 16, 2024 Prosecutors revealed that during one of the encounters, Hussein threatened a passenger who grew suspicious and demanded their phone back, warning them to “chill or something bad would happen.” On Dec. 11, Hussein was arrested by Scottsdale detectives in collaboration with U.S. Secret Service agents. He faces multiple charges, including theft, fraud, and money laundering. Prosecutors successfully secured a $200,000 cash bond with the condition of electronic monitoring should he be released. Additionally, Hussein has been barred from accessing the internet and from traveling abroad due to concerns he might flee to Ethiopia, where he reportedly has frequent visits. Hussein’s next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 18, while authorities continue their investigation into the case. Offline Crypto Thefts Increase The incident is part of a broader trend of offline crypto-related thefts. According to GitHub , there were at least 19 reported cases of offline crypto thefts globally in 2024, a slight increase from 17 cases in 2023 but lower than the 32 recorded in 2021. One of the most high-profile cases dates back to 2014 when an unidentified caller allegedly attempted to extort 1,000 Bitcoin from computer scientist and cryptographer Hal Finney. More recently, on Dec. 3, thieves in Melbourne, Australia, crashed into a shopping center to steal a Bitcoin ATM. Police later discovered the pried-open ATM in a park, set ablaze. Last week, a California court fined five individuals involved in IcomTech’s fraudulent Bitcoin Ponzi scheme $5 million. The court ruling found the defendants guilty of fraud and misappropriation of funds through a fake cryptocurrency trading operation. The ruling targets David Carmona, Juan Arellano Parra, Moses Valdez, and David Brend, who were found in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. They fraudulently solicited over $1 million from 190 individuals across the United States and internationally, leading to approximately $8.4 million in misappropriated funds by December 2022.

Recent catalysts that have supported growth in BTC include increased speculation of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump creating a federal bitcoin reserve, and crypto companies such as Riot Platforms and MicroStrategy purchasing billions worth of the asset in past weeks.  Optimism in U.S. policies are driving bitcoin ETFs inflows higher, contributing to increased prices, some point out.  “TradFi inflows now dominate all sentiment and price action in BTC unlike any other prior crypto cycle before,” shared Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “This influence will only grow as more and more traditional firms finally need to have a digital asset policy given the immense revenue opportunities and sea-change in the political environment.”  Recent price action has shown bitcoin forming higher lows, indicative of a sustained uptrend. The formation of a bull flag or a bullish continuation pattern after recent highs could signal further upward movement.  This month tends to be historically bullish for bitcoin in a move that’s colloquially termed the ""Santa Claus Rally."" Data from the past eight years shows that bitcoin ended December in the green six times since 2015, running at least 8% to as much as 46% (in the outlier year of 2020).  Seasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. While it may look random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, to the generally bullish November and December, a sign of increased demand ahead of holiday season.  Meanwhile, some traders are now targeting the $120,000 level and above for BTC in the coming year.  “We think bitcoin still has tremendous upside potential and could easily hit the $125k mark by the end of 2025,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, said over Telegram. “While some say the upside has already been priced in over the last month or so, we think the rally is just getting started.”  “This is because it takes time for institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals to warm up to the idea of allocating 1%-3% of their portfolios to bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Once that happens, crypto inflows could skyrocket. And given Trump's pro-crypto appointments, continued rate cuts, and stimulus spending from China, there are a lot of reasons to be bullish,” Mei added.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/16/bitcoin-traders-now-target-120-k-as-bullish-santa-claus-rally-gains-steam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90ddd2c57af2ca8a111b368ad62fcafbd5b928de-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors are also looking ahead to several major central bank decisions due this week including the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose +0.04% rose to around 39,600, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.05% to 2,748 on Monday, the Japanese yen depreciated toward 154 per dollar on Monday, hitting its weakest levels in three weeks amid bets that the Bank of Japan will forgo an interest rate hike this week. On the economic front, data showed that core machinery orders in Japan, a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, topped expectations in October. Japan's factory activity shrinks for sixth straight month, services activity improves in December . China ( SHCOMP ) rose +0.01% to around 3,395 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.9% to 10,615 on Monday, with mainland stocks struggling for clear direction and the offshore yuan weakened further around 7.28 per dollar, as traders digested mixed economic data. Data showed that retail sales in China slowed more than expected in November , while industrial production grew more than anticipated. New home prices in the country also declined for the 17th consecutive month in November, amid a prolonged property downturn. Additionally, the unemployment rate held steady at 5%, in line with expectations. In November 2023, the surveyed unemployment rate was also 5%. Foreign direct investment into China shrank by 27.9% year-on-year to CNY 749.7 billion in the first eleven months of 2024, compared with a 29.8% plunge in the previous period, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. As reported by Bloomberg, citing the 21st Century Business, the People's Bank of China is set to cut interest rates and reserve requirements next year. In a statement released after the release of November activity data, the National Bureau of Statistics said China's domestic demand is insufficient while the external environment is complex. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -0.76% to 19,836, extending falls from the prior session as traders reacted to November activity data in China. India ( SENSEX ) fell -0.61% to 81,819 in Monday morning trade, as traders took profit after the BSE Sensex hit its highest level in over two months in the previous session. Total passenger vehicle sales in India grew by 4.3% year-over-year to 300,459 units in November 2024, following a 1.1% rise in the previous month, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The figures exclude sales from BMW, Mercedes, JLR, and Volvo. The private sector in India expanded the most in four months, with the manufacturing expanding faster, while the services sector grew the most since August. Australia ( AS51 ) fell -0.56% to close at 8,250 on Monday, marking its lowest point in nearly a month, as mining stocks led the downturn amid weaker metals prices. The South Korean won ( USD:KRW ) stabilized at 1,433 per dollar following the weekend impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Political uncertainty in South Korea eased after the legislature initiated the impeachment on Saturday in response to Yoon's controversial attempt to impose martial law, which ended in failure. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended mixed with concerns over the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision and economic conditions limiting further gains. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Monday as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision this week: Dow +0.05% ; S&P 500 -0.02% ; Nasdaq -0.04% . The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged above $106,000 on Monday before paring some gains, driven largely by US President-elect Donald Trump's support for digital assets and plans to make the sector more regulated. Week Ahead : Traders are now shifting their attention to the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision later this week, where the bank is expected to deliver a 25bps cut. Other key highlights in the US include retail sales, PCE prices, personal income and spending, the final estimate of GDP growth, industrial production, manufacturing and services PMIs, building permits, housing starts, and existing home sales. In the UK, the BoE's policy decision, inflation figures, retail sales, and jobs report will draw attention. Japan will feature the BoJ's interest rate decision, inflation and foreign trade data.

As an early supporter of Rollblock , this could mean thrilling prospects to capitalize on Bitcoin-driven DeFi. Read on to find out more. Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision Charles Hoskinson is shaking things up again. The Cardano founder just announced plans to build a cutting-edge DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin. This shift promises a fresh approach to bringing decentralized finance to the Bitcoin network, and if users are backing Rollblock, they’re in for some serious perks as these innovations unfold. For starters, Rollblock’s secure and private transactions mean interactions and trades are encrypted, keeping everything safe and confidential. It’s like having your own vault for crypto activities, perfect for navigating the DeFi space. Then, there’s the multicurrency staking feature. Whether users are Bitcoin loyalists, Ethereum enthusiasts, or Dogecoin fans, Rollblock lets users stake their assets and earn rewards across multiple blockchains. With its 9th presale raising over $7 million and trading at $0.0415, it’s clear Rollblock is attracting attention. To top it all off, Rollblock periodically burns tokens, creating scarcity and driving up value. For early backers, that means every move Rollblock makes is designed to grow users’ stakes. With Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision and Rollblock’s features, the future is bright, and profitable.

In just two weeks, 245,000 BTC have been added to this range, showcasing strong investor confidence. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) highlights $99,559 as the largest accumulation zone, with 125,000 BTC purchased for just under $100,000. This activity reflects optimism for Bitcoin’s future as investors position themselves for potential upward moves while maintaining a solid foundation in the current range. Cardano’s multichain leap As we stated earlier, Charles Hoskinson announced the incorporation of Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain, into Cardano. This will make Cardano a multichain environment that integrates Ethereum and Solana. Midnight’s zero-knowledge technology lets users communicate with dApps while protecting their data, an innovation poised to reshape DeFi. On the flip side, Cardano has dropped 17% recently, driven by whale sell-offs and profit-taking. As large holders reduce their positions, ADA’s price may struggle to stay above $1. Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision might be the spark Cardano needs to shoot to new highs. Rollblock is making waves As the DeFi space evolves, Rollblock is positioning itself as a true game-changer, with features like multicurrency staking, privacy, and play-to-earn perks. While other tokens, like Cardano, continue to innovate, Rollblock’s early backers stand to benefit the most. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

37704803,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52268,1734330772,When XRP Hits $100: Things To Do To Stay Compliant When You Decide to Cash In,"Vincent Van Code, a respected software engineer and crypto enthusiast, recently shared a series of important guidelines on Twitter for individuals holding XRP, particularly in the event of a significant price surge to $100. While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, Van Code’s advice offers a prudent approach to managing potential gains responsibly and securely. Below is an analysis of his key points, emphasizing compliance, security, and long-term financial planning. If one day #XRP hits $100, there are some things you need to do to stay compliant when you decide to cash in: 1. Keep records of all your transactions. Especially if you are using a cold wallet 2. Spread tokens across more than 2 wallets, this way you can minimise losses if you… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 14, 2024 Maintain Comprehensive Transaction Records: Van Code underscores the importance of record-keeping, especially for those using cold wallets to store their cryptocurrencies. Keeping detailed records of every transaction is essential for tracking gains and complying with tax obligations. Failing to maintain accurate documentation can lead to complications during audits or when filing taxes. Diversify Wallet Usage: To mitigate the risk of losing funds in the event of a hack, Van Code advises spreading tokens across multiple wallets—ideally more than two. This approach ensures that the remaining funds are safeguarded if one wallet is compromised. Manage Bank Deposits Strategically: Cashing out large sums, such as depositing $100,000 into a bank account, can attract unwanted attention from financial institutions and tax authorities. Van Code recommends conducting smaller, incremental transactions to minimize scrutiny. Additionally, consulting with a financial adviser can help ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and reporting requirements. Set Aside Funds for Taxes: Investors must calculate their tax liability immediately upon cashing out and allocate the required amount in a separate account. This practice prevents unintentional overspending and ensures that tax payments are made on time. Crypto investors are often subject to capital gains taxes, which vary depending on jurisdiction and holding period. Exercise Caution in Sharing Information Online: Van Code warns against discussing cryptocurrency holdings or financial activities publicly, particularly on social media. Cybercriminals often use automated tools to gather personal information, which can be pieced together to target individuals for theft or fraud. Protecting one’s anonymity and digital footprint is critical in the crypto space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adopt Robust Security Measures: To safeguard accounts, Van Code advises enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), preferably through an authentication app rather than SMS, which is more vulnerable to interception. He also recommends using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords, as reusing passwords increases the risk of breaches. Invest in Appreciating Assets: When it comes to spending gains, Van Code advocates for purchasing appreciating assets like art, collectible watches, or property rather than depreciating items such as luxury cars or handbags. This approach ensures wealth preservation over time. Plan Investments Wisely: For those considering long-term investments, real estate and stocks are prudent options. Van Code emphasizes that substantial gains do not necessitate extravagant spending. Thoughtful investment strategies can ensure lasting financial security. Consult a Financial Adviser: While his advice is insightful, Van Code explicitly states that he is not a financial adviser and encourages individuals to seek professional guidance. A comprehensive financial plan tailored to personal circumstances is essential for maximizing the benefits of a windfall and avoiding costly mistakes. Van Code’s recommendations reflect a balanced approach to managing significant cryptocurrency gains, prioritizing compliance, security, and sustainable wealth-building. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, adhering to such principles can help investors navigate the complexities of digital assets responsibly.

According to Arkham Intelligence, Trump’s crypto venture bought 134,216 ONDO tokens worth about 250,000 USDC through the Cow Protocol. President-elect Donald Trump’s DeFi platform, World Liberty Financial, is garnering attention following its latest cryptocurrency acquisition. The crypto venture has been buying with digital assets such as Ethereum on its radar. World Liberty Financial buys ONDO tokens worth $250,000 Onchain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the platform used 250,000 USDC to purchase 134,216 ONDO through the Cow Protocol. According to the market intelligence platform, World Liberty Financial completed the purchase at 6:51 UTC+8 on December 16th. ONDO retai ls at $2.09 at the time of this publication and ranks 53rd on CoinMarketCap’s list of top crypto projects by market capitalization. The digital asset has surged by 12.8% in the last 24 hours, adding to its seven-day gain of 28.61%. The crypto asset has a market cap of $2.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $538 million. The purchase follows another one made on December 12th involving niche tokens. The DeFi platform’s multisig wallet purchased Ether, Aave, and Chainlink for about $14 million. World Liberty Financial bought 2,631 ETH for $10 million, 41,335 LINK for $1 million, and 3,357 AAVE for another one million. World Liberty Financial portfolio Source: Arkham Intelligence According to data from Arkham, World Liberty Finance has a portfolio worth $83.98 million, with most of its holdings in Ether, CBBTC, USDT, and USDC stablecoins. The blockchain analytics firm shows that the DeFi platform owns ETH worth $58 million, CBBTC worth $10.75 million, USDC worth $6.16 million, and USDT worth $3.56 million. Its portfolio also consists of LINK and AAVE tokens worth $2.24 million each, as well as $653,000 worth of ENA tokens. Justin Sun invests $30 million in World Liberty Financial by buying its native token WLFI Trump and his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, unveiled the crypto venture in September through a live stream on X. The DeFi platform has its token WLFI, which is currently on presale. The presale began on October 15th with more than 100,000 U.S. accredited investors. However, it struggled to meet its goals until a Chinese entrepreneur and crypto pioneer, Justin Sun, stepped in. Sun, who was previously in the news for purchasing a banana bought at 35 cents for $6.2 million, invested $30 million in WLFI. The crypto entrepreneur announced the purchase on X and highlighted that “the U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub.” He also added that Bitcoin owes it to Donald Trump, and TRON is dedicated to making America great again. According to Sun, the purchase made him the largest investor of World Liberty Financial. According to the World Liberty Finance website , the presale is still ongoing. The Trump family has already sold 4.97 billion WLFI at $0.015. The website shows that Trump aims to sell 20 billion tokens, and 15 billion tokens are still up for grabs.

Here Are the Factors That Triggered the Rise","Bitcoin broke new records on Monday night, rising to an all-time high of $106,648. Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,000, up 2.80% in the last 24 hours, and the price has pulled back slightly from its record high. Analysts attribute Bitcoin's record-breaking rally to a combination of institutional demand, rising adoption, and supportive market developments. “This new all-time high is a turning point for Bitcoin,” said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. “It signals that Bitcoin is shifting from a retail-focused asset to one increasingly dominated by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate adoption, further solidifying its status as a legitimate asset class.” Key Factors Behind the Increase US President-elect Donald Trump has sparked optimism in the crypto market with his recent announcement of creating a strategic crypto reserve and promising to “do something great” with crypto. MicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq 100 MicroStrategy, a major Bitcoin holder with reserves worth over $44 billion, announced on December 23 that it will join the Nasdaq 100 index. Co-founder Michael Saylor also fueled the excitement with social media posts hinting at additional Bitcoin purchases. Riot Platforms' Bitcoin Purchase Bitcoin mining giant Riot Platforms further boosted market sentiment on Friday by announcing that it purchased 5,117 Bitcoins at an average price of $99,669 per coin. The Federal Reserve’s final FOMC meeting of the year on Wednesday is drawing a lot of attention from investors. The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut is 97.1%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which could provide further support for Bitcoin and other risk assets. “The FOMC meeting will provide important insights into the Fed’s monetary policy trajectory,” said Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research. “Any dovish signals, combined with expectations for Trump’s crypto-related policies, could trigger another rally for Bitcoin.” As we approach the end of 2024, market participants remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s continued growth potential. With deepening institutional participation and macroeconomic factors aligning, analysts are predicting a strong start for Bitcoin in the new year. *This is not investment advice.

37703099,https://coinpaper.com/6550/open-sea-cayman-islands-registration-sparks-token-airdrop-speculation,1734329135,OpenSea Cayman Islands Registration Sparks Token Airdrop Speculation,"The excitement surrounding a possible airdrop is fueled by promises from OpenSea about a major December relaunch. Speculation also increased after some competitive pressure from platforms like Blur, which gained dominance through a very successful airdrop strategy. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is demanding crypto exposure disclosures from firms by 2025 to assess financial stability risks and policy options. In Japan, lawmaker Satoshi Hamada proposed a national Bitcoin reserve due to its potential economic benefits and the global trends toward Bitcoin adoption as a strategic asset. NFT Community Buzzes Over Potential OpenSea Token OpenSea, the well known NFT marketplace, ignited speculation about a potential token launch and user airdrop after registering in the Cayman Islands. The development was announced on Dec. 14 by Waleswoosh , a pseudonymous researcher that is associated with the Azuki NFT collection, who shared a screenshot of the registration. This led to widespread rumors in the NFT community that OpenSea may be planning to launch its cryptocurrency and reward users through an airdrop. The speculation comes on the heels of OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer's announcement on Nov. 4 about the platform's plans for a major relaunch. Although Finzer provided very limited details, he did promise that the revamped platform will be introduced in December. At the time, some users believed an airdrop might be part of the relaunch, but skepticism arose from people like DappRadar’s communications manager. Despite the absence of an official announcement, OpenSea’s Cayman Islands registration boosted hopes among users for an airdrop. Community members, including Matter Labs’ manager “ Golem ,” are optimistic that OpenSea will reward its early supporters to re-establish trust and loyalty. However, there are still concerns about whether the potential airdrop will actually adequately account for the high trading volumes from 2021 and 2022 , which was a period that was marked by billions in NFT sales. Users also speculated that OpenSea might emulate competitors like Blur and Magic Eden, which issued tokens to attract and keep users. OpenSea previously took measures to regain its market share, which included the introduction of zero fees in February to compete with Blur. However, Blur continued to dominate NFT trading volumes, with OpenSea and OKX trailing behind. Blur’s success was partially attributed to its airdrop strategy, where users earned tokens after each trading season. In one instance, a Blur user even reportedly earned $11 million in tokens after the platform’s second-season rewards. Magic Eden also adopted an airdrop strategy but faced some challenges during its rollout. Its ME token was launched earlier in December, and initially rallied to $13.10 before plummeting almost 70% due to user complaints about the claiming process and technical issues in its mobile app. ME price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) So far, OpenSea has not commented on the speculation surrounding its plans. Bank of England Demands Crypto Exposure Disclosures In Europe, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) issued a request for firms to disclose their current and future exposure to cryptocurrencies by March of 2025. The move was made to enhance the regulator's ability to monitor financial stability and shape policies regarding crypto assets. In a statement that was released on Dec. 12, the PRA asked firms to detail their “current and expected future crypto asset exposures” and provide information on how they are applying the Basel framework . This framework is an international standard for managing capital and risk in crypto exposures that was introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December of 2022. The PRA plans to use this information to evaluate the costs and benefits of different policy options and refine its prudential treatment of crypto assets. This initiative is also part of a broader attempt to understand the financial stability implications of crypto assets and emerging technologies like permissionless blockchains. Firms are being asked to provide insights into their planned crypto activities up to Sept. 30, 2029, with specific focus on areas like the application of the Basel framework and the use of decentralized ledgers. While the PRA acknowledges the potential benefits of permissionless blockchains, like increased transparency and efficiency, it still pointed out some serious risks, including settlement failures and a lack of guaranteed links between asset ownership and control mechanisms. The regulator stated that these risks are not yet sufficiently mitigated, although the classification remains under review. This development happened as a growing number of global firms and countries are investing heavily in Bitcoin. Some well known examples include Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International, which converted close to $50 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a treasury adjustment. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also announced plans to raise over $62 million to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Japan Urged to Consider National Bitcoin Reserve Many other counties are now also contemplating the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada recently asked some serious questions about the potential for Japan to establish national Bitcoin reserves. In a query that was submitted to Japan’s House of Councillors on Dec. 11, Hamada called on the government to assess global movements toward Bitcoin reserves. He specifically referenced initiatives in the United States and other countries. He argued that adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide major economic benefits, and stated that Japan should consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets like Bitcoin. Hamada’s questions were centered around the increasing global attention on Bitcoin as a strategic asset. He pointed to efforts by U.S. lawmakers and crypto advocates to introduce a Bitcoin reserve, a concept tied to Republican lawmakers' recent electoral success and former President Donald Trump’s campaign promises. Similar proposals emerged in Brazil , where lawmakers are exploring Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks. Hamada’s social media activity indicates that he is very closely following U.S. developments, including initiatives backed by well known people in the industry like Elon Musk. Hamada even retweeted posts from Musk's political action committee about the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which could indirectly support crypto adoption. Japan has a gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $4 trillion, and ranks as one of the world’s largest economies, although it recently slipped from third to fourth place, behind Germany. Hamada implied that introducing a national Bitcoin reserve could boost Japan’s economy nicely and position it very well in global markets. This will also benefit crypto holders and enhance the country’s financial resilience. A national Bitcoin reserve is a strategic allocation of Bitcoin by a government as part of its foreign exchange or national reserves. Overall, it is actually very similar to how countries hold gold or foreign currencies. The idea is to use Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks, currency devaluation, or geopolitical uncertainties while still potentially benefiting from its long-term value appreciation and decentralized nature. This approach positions Bitcoin as a store of value and a tool for improving financial resilience and economic stability.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6550/open-sea-cayman-islands-registration-sparks-token-airdrop-speculation,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-loves-usa-muskusa-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listings/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a recent post on X , Schwartz warned of potential price volatility due to large orders despite the stablecoin’s 1:1 parity with the US dollar. Schwartz revealed that pre-market activity had already sparked speculative bids for RLUSD, with some offers inflating its perceived value. 1 RLUSD Traded for Around 511 XRP He responded to a screenshot shared on X showing a bid valuing 1 RLUSD at around 511 XRP—equivalent to $1,244 at current XRP prices—on a Ripple-linked wallet named Xaman. Schwartz downplayed the anomaly, suggesting it was likely driven by a user seeking “the honor” of being the first to purchase RLUSD. “But rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn’t, something is very seriously wrong,” he wrote. “Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” WOW! XAMAN SHOWS 1 RLUSD = 511 #XRP pic.twitter.com/1dBodfNnFp — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 11, 2024 Ripple’s plans for RLUSD gained momentum after CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on December 11 that the New York Department of Financial Services had granted final approval for the stablecoin’s issuance. Ripple’s official X account confirmed that RLUSD’s launch was “coming soon.” RLUSD is set to play a key role in Ripple’s cross-border payments strategy, operating alongside the company’s native cryptocurrency, XRP. The stablecoin’s integration into Ripple’s payments network aims to enhance liquidity and reduce the risk of depegging. Ripple President Monica Long previously stated that RLUSD’s design is “complementary and additive” to XRP. Industry insiders see the move as a strategic step to strengthen XRP’s role in the payments ecosystem. By pairing RLUSD with XRP, Ripple aims to leverage XRP’s widespread availability on exchanges to support liquidity for the stablecoin. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said that RLUSD’s primary focus will be on institutional players, indicating a strategic push toward large-scale financial market participants. Ripple Labs CEO Faces Backlash for Shilling XRP and CBDCs in Alleged Trump Meeting Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently come under fire after rumors surfaced of a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump where he promoted XRP and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). At the time, former Messari CEO Ryan Selkis accused Garlinghouse of “shilling XRP and CBDC implementations.” Speculation about the meeting’s role in the rally has added fuel to the ongoing controversy. During a recent Fox Business appearance, Garlinghouse declined to confirm or deny the meeting but praised Trump’s relationship with the crypto industry. “Trump has embraced the crypto industry, and I think he recognizes its potential for innovation and entrepreneurship,” Garlinghouse said, expressing optimism about the sector’s future under the new administration. Garlinghouse also noted the market’s positive response to Trump’s election victory, citing the hostile stance of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as a major factor suppressing U.S.-based crypto projects. Trump’s promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office has garnered widespread support from crypto enthusiasts.

For the unversed, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that RLUSD has received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services.

37702962,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52266,1734328636,"XRP Collateralization Model Puts XRP Fair Market Value at $122,580","XRP’s current trading price remains significantly lower than its potential fair market value, as highlighted by the Collateralization Model developed by Valhil Capital. According to this model, XRP could be valued at an extraordinary $122,580 under specific conditions, underscoring its theoretical potential within a tokenized global financial system. Understanding the Collateralization Model Valhil Capital, a venture capital firm, introduced several valuation frameworks to explore XRP’s potential as a digital asset. Among these, the Collateralization Model stands out for its ambitious assessment of XRP’s role as a universal collateral asset in a tokenized economy. This model envisions a future where global financial systems are entirely tokenized, incorporating a wide range of assets—such as real estate, derivatives, central bank reserves, and commodities—onto blockchain networks. XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is positioned as a key asset for collateralizing these tokenized assets. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has confirmed XRPL’s focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a development that aligns with the Collateralization Model’s premise. The methodology evaluates XRP’s utility as a store of value and its potential to secure tokenized assets rather than facilitate everyday transactions. Breaking Down the $122,580 Valuation The Collateralization Model bases its projections on the total global wealth, estimated at $5.3 quadrillion. Factoring in a 1.25x risk adjustment ratio and calculating the present value of a tokenized economy, the model predicts that global tokenized assets could reach $6.2 quadrillion by 2030. By dividing this projected value by XRP’s circulating supply of approximately 50.7 billion tokens, the model arrives at an estimated fair market value of $122,580 per token. This analysis highlights XRP’s potential to become a foundational element of the tokenized financial ecosystem. The model emphasizes that this valuation depends on a scenario where blockchain technology fully represents global wealth and XRP plays a pivotal role in collateralizing assets across a highly interconnected system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Challenges to Realizing This Valuation Despite the Collateralization Model’s optimistic outlook, significant obstacles could hinder the realization of such a scenario. For instance, the global tokenization of assets would require overcoming technological, regulatory, and economic challenges. Additionally, the valuation excludes certain variables that could affect the accuracy of its estimates. Nonetheless, the model underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology and XRP’s role within it. It presents a theoretical analysis rather than a price prediction, aiming to illustrate what XRP’s value could be under ideal conditions. XRP’s Current Performance At the time of press, XRP is trading at approximately $2.40, reflecting strong performance in recent weeks as it maintains $2 support. While this is positive, it remains far below the Collateralization Model’s suggested fair market value. The disparity between XRP’s current price and theoretical valuation highlights the broader conversation around the cryptocurrency’s utility and potential within a tokenized global financial infrastructure.

37702751,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393420,1734328365,Donald Trump Bitcoin Reserve Plan Aligns with FASB’s New Crypto Accounting Rules,"The post Donald Trump Bitcoin Reserve Plan Aligns with FASB’s New Crypto Accounting Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has introduced a groundbreaking update that’s set to change how companies account for Bitcoin and other eligible crypto assets. Starting today, businesses can measure their Bitcoin holdings at current market prices, making financial reporting more accurate and transparent. Starting fully in 2025, the change could drive more firms to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Following the two breaking news, Bitcoin surged above $105,000 today , adding U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s comments about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve , similar to the country’s oil reserve. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $105,142 before settling at $104,609. It has seen a 55% rise post-election, with a whooping trading volume of $62B. HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 What’s Changing? This update, highlighted by Pete Rizzo of Bitcoin Magazine in a post on X, reflects a significant shift in how companies report their cryptocurrency holdings. Rizzo referenced a prior post by Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, to emphasize the importance of this change. Until now, companies recorded Bitcoin at its purchase price. If the value dropped, losses were reported, but if it went up, the gains weren’t included. This created a major gap in how companies reflected their true financial standing. With the new rules, Bitcoin’s value will now be updated in financial statements every reporting period, showing both profits and losses based on market prices. This change makes life easier for companies holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Big names like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which are known for their Bitcoin investments, will now have a smoother reporting process. Investors, creditors, and stakeholders will also get a clearer picture of a company’s financial health, making it easier to assess risks and performance. Who Benefits? The new standards apply to fungible crypto assets that meet specific criteria. However, assets like NFTs, wrapped tokens, and internally generated digital assets are excluded. For companies, this means better alignment with traditional accounting practices and greater transparency in their financial statements. A Big Win for Bitcoin This move is expected to encourage more companies to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. With fair value accounting in place, businesses can better handle Bitcoin’s price swings while staying transparent about their holdings. This milestone comes as the crypto market buzzes with speculation about former President Donald Trump’s potential plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, rumored to be enacted through an executive order on his first day after taking charge in January. The gap between traditional markets and the crypto economy is narrowing, and Bitcoin’s position as a dominant financial asset is stronger than ever.

If the latest purchase is confirmed, the company’s holdings would rise to 423,650 BTC, valued at approximately $50 billion. This development underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset, fueling its rally past $106,000. Trump’s BTC Reserve Plans Could Send Bitcoin Price to $800K Optimism surrounding Bitcoin intensified after reports that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might issue an executive order designating Bitcoin as a U.S. reserve asset. This move, proposed under the 2024 Bitcoin Act, would mandate annual Bitcoin purchases of 200,000 BTC for five years—removing nearly 5% of the total supply from circulation. According to experts like Perianne Boring , this policy could push Bitcoin’s price to $800,000 by the end of 2025, driven by Bitcoin’s capped supply and rising institutional demand. WHAT THE FCK ???

37702961,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52263,1734327431,"As XRP Community Awaits Major News, Experts Predict How High XRP Can Rise","Cryptocurrency experts suggest that XRP is on the verge of a significant breakout following nearly two weeks of price consolidation. However, market analysts emphasize that the digital asset is likely waiting for impactful news to trigger this movement. Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and prominent figure in the crypto community, has highlighted an ascending triangle pattern on XRP’s daily chart, which traditionally indicates a bullish trend. He believes that the lack of major news has kept the token trading within a narrow range, a condition often observed when markets are in a holding pattern. While the token has exhibited price fluctuations between 10% and 20%, Van Code predicts a decisive rally will occur once the price breaks through $2.90. Key Developments Driving Anticipation The community closely monitors several anticipated events that could catalyze a price surge. Among the most notable is the imminent launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple recently secured regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to list RLUSD, marking a significant milestone for the company. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, confirmed that RLUSD will soon be available on partner exchanges, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Other potential drivers include XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the resolution of Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute. However, these developments are not expected until 2025, making the RLUSD launch the most immediate and impactful event in the short term. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.42, reflecting a 2.14 % decline in the past 24 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Targets and Technical Insights Analysts have identified several key price levels that XRP could achieve. Vincent Van Code maintains that surpassing $2.90 is critical for initiating a rally, while other experts provide additional insights into potential price targets. Arjantit, a technical analyst, has observed a bullish flag formation on XRP’s 8-hour chart, indicating a strong likelihood of upward momentum. He suggests that breaking above this pattern could push the price to $2.91, with $3.20 being the next target. Arjantit advises traders to look for confirmation of this setup before making decisions. Similarly, another analyst known as FinanceBro has expressed optimism about the token’s potential surge. He asserts that the bull flag pattern has fully developed, paving the way for a rally that could reach $4.40. FinanceBro also speculates that $4.40 might only be an intermediate target, with the possibility of even greater gains in the longer term. As XRP trades within a narrow range, the market eagerly anticipates news that could catalyze a breakout. The expected launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin stands out as the most immediate trigger, with analysts forecasting significant price gains once critical resistance levels are breached. If these predictions hold, the asset’s price could exceed $2.90 and continue its uptrend toward $3.20 and $4.40, offering promising prospects for investors and traders.

MicroStrategy, spearheaded by Michael Saylor, is set to join the Nasdaq-100, marking a major milestone as the first Bitcoin treasury company to enter the prestigious index. Meanwhile, MARA Holdings, a prominent crypto miner, is positioning itself to follow suit, bolstered by substantial Bitcoin investments and a growing market presence. Michael Saylor Hints at MicroStrategy’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase as BTC Hits Six Figures MicroStrategy , under the leadership of Michael Saylor, continues its relentless pursuit of Bitcoin dominance. Over the weekend, Saylor dropped a cryptic hint suggesting that the firm may have made another significant Bitcoin purchase — its first acquisition with an average purchase price exceeding $100,000 per Bitcoin. In a Dec. 15 post on X, Saylor teased followers by asking if the SaylorTracker portfolio tracker was “missing a green dot.” The reference is widely understood by the Bitcoin community as an indication of a new addition to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings. The timing aligns with the firm’s recent pattern of Sunday hints, which have consistently been followed by Bitcoin purchase confirmations on Monday. If confirmed, this acquisition would mark a historic milestone for MicroStrategy: its first Bitcoin purchase in the six-figure price range. Bitcoin has remained above $100,000 since 5:00 PM UTC on Dec. 13, according to CoinGecko . Previous purchases by the business intelligence firm were made at average prices of $97,862, $95,976, and $98,783, with acquisitions amounting to $1.5 billion and $5.7 billion during the last three purchase rounds. As of Dec. 16, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings total 423,650 BTC, valued at over $43.6 billion. Should the latest purchase fall near the upper range of previous acquisitions, the firm’s Bitcoin portfolio would inch closer to a staggering $50 billion valuation. The latest hint comes just ahead of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $106,554. This monumental price level reinforces Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future. He has previously stated that MicroStrategy has no intention of slowing down its Bitcoin purchases, even as the cryptocurrency climbs to unprecedented price levels. In a bold statement, Saylor asserted he’s ”sure” the company will continue buying Bitcoin even if its price reaches $1 million per coin. This unwavering strategy has made MicroStrategy synonymous with Bitcoin investment in the corporate world. The company’s stock, MSTR, has reaped the rewards of this approach, skyrocketing 496.4% year-to-date, according to Google Finance data . Such stellar performance has propelled MicroStrategy into the elite Nasdaq-100, a stock index comprising 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. A Game-Changer for Bitcoin Advocacy Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin has extended far beyond the corporate realm. As an influential advocate, he has played a crucial role in driving institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. His public comments often serve as a barometer for Bitcoin’s broader acceptance in financial markets. If MicroSrategy’s latest acquisition is confirmed, it could bring the firm tantalizingly close to a $50 billion Bitcoin portfolio. Such a milestone would solidify its status as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, a title it has held for years. As Bitcoin continues to climb to new heights, all eyes are on MicroStrategy to see how far its ambitious Bitcoin strategy can go. Whether Bitcoin reaches $1 million or more, Saylor appears determined to lead the charge. Michael Saylor Predicts MARA Holdings Will Be Next Bitcoin Firm to Join the Nasdaq-100 In related news, Saylor has tipped MARA Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency mining firm, as the next Bitcoin-focused company to join the Nasdaq-100 Index. The prediction came in a Dec. 14 post on X, where Saylor responded to MARA Holdings chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, who congratulated MicroStrategy on its recent inclusion in the prestigious index. “Thanks, Fred. I expect $MARA will be the next,” Saylor remarked, signaling confidence in MARA Holdings’ trajectory toward becoming one of the largest publicly traded companies on the Nasdaq exchange. MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100, set to take effect before the trading day on Dec. 23, cements its position as a trailblazer in Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded firms. The company, recognized as the first Bitcoin treasury company to achieve this milestone, has seen its market capitalization soar to $94.77 billion as of Dec. 13, according to Financecharts. Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings’ CEO, acknowledged MicroStrategy’s achievement, stating, “Congratulations to $MSTR and @saylor for being the first Bitcoin treasury company to join the Nasdaq 100.” He further emphasized that MARA is “working hard to get there,” pointing to the firm’s ambition to follow MicroStrategy’s footsteps. MARA Holdings, a leading Bitcoin mining company, has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings. In the last two months alone, the firm has invested over $600 million in Bitcoin, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite its smaller market capitalization of $7.32 billion compared to MicroStrategy, MARA is positioning itself as a key player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its stock price has also demonstrated growth, closing at $22.73 on Dec. 13 — up 16.74% over the past six months, according to Google Finance data. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 is reserved for the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange by market capitalization. Being part of this elite index signals strong financial performance, innovation, and investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq-100 coincides with the removal of three companies: Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. The change reflects the dynamic nature of the index, where only the most competitive companies maintain their positions. MARA’s Call for US Leadership in Bitcoin MARA Holdings has not only focused on expanding its Bitcoin holdings but has also emerged as a vocal advocate for US dominance in Bitcoin mining and adoption. In a Nov. 26 post on X, the firm urged the US government to take more aggressive steps to secure its leadership in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, framing the issue as a matter of national security. “The United States faces an urgent need to secure its economic and national security interests,” MARA stated, drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold as strategic reserves. The firm’s call to action comes amidst a global trend of de-dollarization, as countries increasingly diversify away from reliance on the US dollar. MARA’s push for US leadership in Bitcoin aligns with the growing narrative of Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the global economy. As geopolitical dynamics shift and the role of the US dollar in international trade faces challenges, Bitcoin’s decentralized and borderless nature is seen by many as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Michael Saylor’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a superior treasury asset has been instrumental in driving institutional adoption. His prediction that MARA will join the Nasdaq-100 suggests an increasing convergence of cryptocurrency firms with traditional financial markets. As MicroStrategy prepares to officially join the Nasdaq-100, it sets a precedent for other Bitcoin-focused firms like MARA Holdings to follow. The crypto miner’s recent investments and advocacy efforts underscore its commitment to becoming a major player in the Bitcoin space. With Bitcoin adoption continuing to rise and institutional players making significant moves, the inclusion of more crypto-centric companies in major indices like the Nasdaq-100 appears inevitable. Saylor’s prediction for MARA Holdings could be a glimpse into a broader trend where Bitcoin firms solidify their positions in traditional financial markets. Whether MARA will indeed be next remains to be seen, but its trajectory suggests it is well on its way to joining the upper echelons of the financial world. For now, the spotlight remains on MicroStrategy’s achievement, serving as a reminder of Bitcoin’s growing influence in global markets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6551/michael-saylor-teases-record-breaking-bitcoin-buy-for-micro-strategy,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

With a recent price of $105,688, the cryptocurrency has increased by more than 50% since the election on November 5. Plus, ether increased by about 3% to $4,014. On Chain data revealed that nearly 27,000 Bitcoins, worth $2.8 billion, were withdrawn from major exchanges over the weekend, potentially driving prices higher due to reduced supply. This is an electrifying effect of Trump’s ultimate vision is to ensure America’s dominance in crypto before anyone else takes over, particularly against competitors like China, has fueled confidence among investors. Moreover, his selection of crypto-friendly figures, including David Sacks as the White House AI and crypto czar and Paul Atkins to head the SEC, signals a policy shift towards mainstream adoption. This move is a green flag for global powers, including Russia, to explore Bitcoin’s potential to counter geopolitical challenges, signaling a possible “Bitcoin cold war.” President Vladimir Putin explores alternatives to the U.S. dollar. Putin recently emphasized Bitcoin’s resilience against restrictions, highlighting its appeal as a hedge against traditional currencies. The Bitcoin reserve plan gained traction as companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla adopted Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks. MicroStrategy now holds 423,650 BTC, worth $43.6 billion, showcasing Bitcoin’s potential as a modern reserve asset. Trump’s proposal for a Bitcoin reserve echoes his earlier promise at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, where he predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could rival gold’s $16 trillion. Supporting this vision, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, advocating for the U.S. to acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years to address the $35 trillion national debt. Critics Have Mixed Views on Trump’s Bitcoin Plan Trump needs Congress to approve funding, clear SEC and Treasury guidelines, and Fed cooperation to succeed. In the meanwhile, Strike CEO Jack Mallers believes Donald Trump could issue an executive order on day one to make Bitcoin a U.S. reserve asset. While it wouldn’t involve buying 1 million BTC, Mallers calls it a “significant position” that could reshape Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy. Others argue that making Bitcoin part of national reserves could go against its decentralized nature. While price fluctuation are also expected with the plan. Bitcoin Current Scenario Market experts predict Trump’s plans could dramatically impact Bitcoin’s value. Perianne Boring, founder of the Digital Chamber, estimates Bitcoin could reach $800,000 by next year, creating a $15 trillion market cap. She highlighted Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a key driver: “The sky is the limit if Trump’s proposals take shape.” Notably, there are speculations 0.25% interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 18 could further boost Bitcoin’s momentum, according to analysts.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-106k-how-trumps-strategic-reserve-proposal-is-shaking-the-crypto-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Just 6 hours before the price surge, two multisign wallets with a common creator address withdrew their first ETH and staked them. Has some new institution started accumulating Ethereum, maybe. Their unrealized profit grew to $517,754 before coming back to $157,570 as ETH price fell to $3,930. The Break down Two multisign wallets 0x23a…dad and 0xc9c…d04 withdrew a total of 4,502 ETH worth $17.54 from Binance. This was the first withdrawal for both the wallets. Interestingly, both these multisign wallets have a common creation wallet 0x7cf…617. The withdrawals were executed between ETH price $3,880 and $3,900. These tokens were then staked to KelpDAO. Source : Spotonchain With the amount and timing of these transactions, it looks like these actions belong to some institution. It timed the movement of Ethereum perfectly as just 6 hours later, the token reached $4,022. The value of staked tokens rose by 3% creating an unrealized profit of $517k. One thing to keep in mind is that multisign wallets are commonly used by institutions. The Mysterious Institution It would not be possible to clearly state if this is some institution or a new fund. The wallets have no history and hence there is no way of tracking it. There are many possibilities. Source : X.com These addresses might belong to some new fund, or a DAO or even some major investor testing the waters. One of the multisign wallet is 4 days old and the other one is made just 15 hours ago. Even their creator wallet originated 51 days ago. Correlation with ETH Price Movement The most interesting part of these transactions is their timing. Were the transactions made based on some analyses as the time aligns perfectly with Ethereum recovery to $4k. Or it was vice versa? Did these transactions fill confidence in the market to push the price up. Whether this is a coincidence or a direct influence, it gives a clear message that the market is sensitive towards significant transactions. The Market Movement At the time of writing Ethereum is trading at $3,930, a0.28% drop in the last 24 hours. Before falling the token rose by 2.06% reaching $4,022.

Top Analyst Says XLM Will Make Haters Squeak,"Stellar has seen remarkable gains over the past month, rising over 209% amid a broader market recovery. Despite this impressive performance, some analysts believe the cryptocurrency has the potential to achieve even higher milestones. EGRAG CRYPTO, a well-known market analyst, recently shared insights suggesting that XLM could climb to $2, representing a 371% increase from its current price levels. #XLM – The Squeak Update! We’ve just touched the Mouse’s Moustache , and now it’s time to build momentum! Here’s what we’re watching: Next Steps: Retest the EMAs and push for a close above the Mouse’s Ears. Target: The Ears are sitting pretty at $2! #XLM WILL MAKE THE… pic.twitter.com/vraxwsML4l — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 13, 2024 Stellar (XLM) Path to $2 EGRAG CRYPTO outlined his bullish outlook for Stellar (XLM) in a post on X, citing a key technical pattern as the basis for his prediction. He referenced a significant event in 2020 when the asset broke above its exponential moving average (EMA) on the two-week chart. Following that breakout, the asset experienced a dramatic rally, gaining over 3,100% to reach $0.80. The analyst noted that Stellar (XLM) once again broke above this same EMA in 2023, showing the possibility of a similar upward growth. Based on historical performance and current charts, he set a potential target of $2.27 for the digital asset. As of now, the token is trading at approximately $0.4134 and reaching the $2 target would require a 360% increase from its current price. Price Action and Resistance Levels While EGRAG is confident in XLM’s potential, he emphasized that the journey to $2 will not be immediate or without obstacles. In a follow-up post, he provided a detailed roadmap for how the asset could achieve this milestone. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst suggested that XLM’s first major test will be breaking its all-time high of $0.90. Once this resistance is cleared, he expects the price to retrace slightly before climbing to $1.20 and beyond. This prediction is based on XLM’s weekly price action, which positions the asset in the middle of an ascending channel. EGRAG highlighted that the $0.90 level represents a strong resistance zone and will likely serve as a key inflection point. If the asset successfully breaks through this barrier, it could set the stage for further gains. Stellar’s Strong Momentum The asset’s recent performance has been part of a broader bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past 30 days, the asset has delivered substantial returns to investors, fueling optimism about its long-term potential. Analysts like EGRAG believe the ongoing rally and favorable technical indicators provide a solid foundation for continued growth. While the path to $2 may be gradual, the projection underscores the strong momentum behind the token and its potential to deliver significant returns. Investors will likely monitor resistance levels and market conditions closely as the asset attempts to reach new heights.

The U.S. central bank is expected to reduce the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points to the 4.25% to 4.5% range, marking a total easing of 100 basis points since September. However, there are concerns that the accompanying Fed commentary will seek to temper expectations for further easing, potentially diminishing the bullish impact of the rate cut.  The Fed will announce its rate decision, the dot plot, comprising interest rate projections, and economic forecasts on Dec. 18 at 14:00 ET. A press conference by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell will occur a half hour later.  The previous dot plot released on Sept. 18 showed 2.5 points of rate cuts by the end of 2026, pushing the borrowing cost below 3%. Some observers believe the Fed will trim these forecasts on Wednesday.  ""We suggest the risk of a 'hawkish' cut with less rate hikes next year than anticipated in September in the Summary of Economic Projections (dot plot), recognition that economy is stronger than it had expected previously, and inflation is on a bumpy path that allows the Fed to be patient,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in Sunday's edition of the newsletter.  If the projections reflect slower or fewer rate cuts, Treasury yields and the dollar will likely extend their recent run higher, potentially making it harder for risk assets, including BTC, to stay as strongly bid as they have been of late.  That said, seasonality is quite bullish for BTC, and with President-elect Trump sending positive regulatory vibes to crypto, a potential hawkish Fed may not have a long-lasting impact on the cryptocurrency.  Besides, the Fed rate cuts will still remain on the table alongside an expected easing from China, keeping BTC's bull case intact.  ""Yet, whilst lots of ink will be spilled on the pace of cuts going forward, little detracts from the supportive macro dynamic of a global central bank rate cutting cycle and rising global liquidity, set to be propelled by China,"" founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Now, he’s back with a new creation: the XRP $ARMY logo. Lobanovskiy described it as “the helmet of courage, an unstoppable ‘X’ of strength,” symbolizing the power of the XRP Army. As he puts it, “The XRP Army is more than just a community—it’s a movement. We shall prevail.” XRP enthusiasts appreciated his efforts and thanked him for the logo. A user said, “Wow. I didn’t even know that you are behind the xrp logo. I was always fan of your work Eddie, but now you are officially one of my super top favorite artists.” Another wrote, “I’m really proud of being part of the #XRPArmy movement. But now with the new logo… This is just the next level, thanks so much for this.” https://twitter.com/lobanovskiy/status/1866877220209250806 The XRP Army has been a strong supporter of Ripple, especially during the tough SEC lawsuit.In October this year, they started a petition on Change.org asking the SEC to stop its appeal in the case. The petition has almost 10,000 signatures. Ripple supporters believe that the SEC’s ongoing legal actions are causing unnecessary instability. The petition brings to light the four-year fight with the SEC, where Ripple supporters have worked to protect the company’s legitimacy. The XRP Army believes the SEC’s actions go against its goal of protecting investors and ensuring fair markets. Ripple Vs SEC: An Ongoing Saga The Ripple lawsuit started in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple Labs of selling XRP as an unregistered security, which Ripple denies. In the latest developments, the SEC must file its appeal-related opening brief by January 15, just days before Chair Gary Gensler leaves the agency. His successor, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, is known for advocating more lenient regulation, especially in the crypto space. With Gensler leaving soon, there’s speculation he may try to settle big cases like Ripple’s before he goes, but it’s unclear if that will happen.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-new-xrp-army-logo-revealed-by-xrp-logos-original-designer/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Bitcoin investments are best made countercyclically, during periods of low interest and panic, not during peak hype. The Company's bullish case is convoluted and lacks clear, sustainable cash flow generation, unlike straightforward business models like McDonald's or Google. For Bitcoin exposure, consider Bitcoin ETFs or even futures instead of MSTR, which carries additional risks and complexities and is inefficient. Before I start my discussion on MicroStrategy: I would like to set the tone that I'm not a crypto-denier: I was on the record strongly bullish on Coinbase ( COIN ) on October 10, 2022, during the crypto winter, and it has since gone up 367%. Coinbase coverage (Seeking Alpha) Ironically, as shown below, Bitcoin was trading at $20-30k apiece at that time and interest in Bitcoin was much more muted. Bitcoin price (StockCharts) After briefly introducing my crypto ""credentials"" of honking the bullhorn during the winter stage, I'm going to expand on why I think MicroStrategy should be avoided by investors. Now there is already a lot of bearish coverage on Seeking Alpha, so I'm not going to repeat their points, rather this article will focus on adding a few points: 1. Bitcoin investments are best done countercylically In fact, in the past 5 years, the good buy points were when there was panic and uncertainty, prices were low and sentiment was muted, e.g. as shown in the green boxes below (1) during the COVID panic in early/mid-2020, (2) the subsiding of the bubble during late 2022 and (3) during many uncertainties in mid-2024. Remember when there was worrying over Germany selling crypto in June/July 2024 ? Turns out that was near the low point of the whole year (a cynic might suggest the news of Germany selling a mere $1-$2 billion worth of bitcoin was exaggerated to drive down prices for accumulation, but that would just be pure guessing). Bitcoin price (StockCharts) Another way to gauge sentiment is by using Google Trends and searching for Bitcoin (a lower reading on the indicator indicates less search interest comparatively and vice versa). Note how periods with low search interest were usually bullish for Bitcoin (green boxes), while periods of high search interest and high anticipation (red boxes, i.e. right now, with hype of Strategic National Bitcoin Reserve ) were usually not so good for Bitcoin price performance. So even if an investor were bullish on Bitcoin for the long run, this is probably not the ideal time. Bitcoin Google Trends 2. Convoluted logic and unclarity of MSTR's business model Peter Lynch had a rule that analysts could deliver their pitch for why a stock was a good investment in 90 seconds. That's because the best investments have business models that are easy to clearly articulate. Many of the best investments of all time are easily understandable by any layman if articulated professionally. For example, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, Google etc. You can see the customers going to and from McDonald's, you can see people smoking and not really quitting, and you can see people using Google every day (whether or not these products and services have any negative externalities that need to be otherwise regulated or managed is a different topic). Their business models are visible and verifiable and there's no question about their existence and utility and popularity with customers. However, when it comes to MicroStrategy bulls, in my opinion, their bullish case is so circuitous and convoluted, it's hard to understand, and you need to continuously try to convince yourself that it makes sense and that in itself is a huge red flag to me. Maybe in the end it'll work out, but I highly doubt it. If we browse through some of the recent analysis on Seeking Alpha, bullish arguments about MSTR include raising debt at 0% to buy ""an appreciating asset (i.e. Bitcoin""). But Bitcoin, unlike real estate, does not yield cash flow, so where does the cash flows come from in the long run? Even Michael Saylor admits that ""MicroStrategy found a way to outperform Bitcoin. The way that we outperform Bitcoin, in essence, is we just lever up Bitcoin."" That does not sound to me like much of a business model. When an investor buys McDonald's or Google, he's buying into the perpetual future cash flows that these businesses can generate in the future. If MSTR is essentially just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, why should an investor buy MSTR (which is trading at a massive premium to the Bitcoin MSTR owns. MSTR has a market cap of $88 bn while it owns roughly $40bn of Bitcoin at current prices of $100k/coin, and that's before considering the bonds MSTR has issued that will need to be repaid somehow, further diluting the current shareholder and increasing MSTR's effective ""premium to net asset value"") and not just buy Bitcoin futures? What exactly are investors paying MSTR for that they cannot get in terms of adding or reducing leverage ratio in Bitcoin futures? This reminds me of what Greenspan wrote in his memoir ""The Age of Turbulence"" about Enron. Now, I'm not saying or alleging that MSTR is doing anything improper or anything like Enron; however, the similarity is that Greenspan viewed Enron's explanation of its business case as complicated and no one knew how it was making money. Eventually, it turns out it was not making money at all and was a house of cards. My view is that at times when darling stock prices have surged, investors in the market are at max gullibility and any story stock with a stock price still appreciating lures in believers. With NVDA going up 1000+% in a year and a half, anything seems possible. Investors should have learned from the Everything Bubble of 2021 receding that when the tide goes out, these speculative issues go kaput, but it seems like they are just doubling down. In fact, when the Everything Bubble of 2021 went out, MSTR fell by 90% from peak to trough as shown below. An investor would have made substantial gains by buying Bitcoin in mid-2020 in the $10ks and in late 2022 Bitcoin even at its trough was mostly in the 20ks. But joining the rollercoaster in MSTR, especially at times of peak interest, was calamitous the last time around and my assessment is that it is not a good risk-adjusted bet this time around either. MSTR stock price (StockCharts) Risks to bearish thesis Again, I would not recommending shorting this stock. Market enthusiasm can continue for way longer than anyone can predict (or sustain) and maybe MSTR doubles or triples and keeps their money machine going on for much longer. Conclusion Individual investors are strongly cautioned against buying MSTR or putting substantial amounts of their life/retirement savings into it. Its business model is unclear and if MSTR is just a levered bet on Bitcoin, then investors can just buy Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin futures to gain the same exposure. Note that I am not suggesting a leveraged exposure to Bitcoins, but if that's what investors are looking for, it would probably be more efficient than buying MSTR.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744430-mstr-bubble-popped-once-going-to-pop-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37700531.jpeg

The cryptocurrency touched $106,533 before settling at $104,512, marking a 3% intraday gain. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also climbed 1.5% to $3,941. Market enthusiasm erupted after Trump hinted at a potential bitcoin reserve during a CNBC interview, comparing it to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto,” Trump said, underscoring the need for the U.S. to lead in the space. Investor sentiment was further buoyed by MicroStrategy’s impending inclusion in the Nasdaq-100, potentially attracting institutional inflows. Bitcoin Continues to Rise on Hopes for Pro-Crypto Trump Policies Bitcoin’s rise reflects optimism that Trump’s administration will foster a crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Since his November 5 election, Bitcoin has jumped over 50%, with the crypto market’s total valuation nearing $3.8 trillion. Trump’s pro-crypto stance marks a significant pivot from his earlier skepticism. His team has already announced key crypto appointments, including PayPal alum David Sacks as the White House AI and crypto czar and pro-crypto attorney Paul Atkins as the SEC nominee . Globally, governments are exploring crypto reserves, with the U.S., China, and El Salvador holding substantial Bitcoin stakes. Russian President Vladimir Putin also recently highlighted crypto’s resilience amid declining trust in the U.S. dollar. Despite the excitement, skeptics urge caution as Bitcoin reserve could take a long time for it to become a reality. For now, Bitcoin bulls appear firmly in control, as the market continues to embrace the prospect of a U.S.-backed crypto reserve.

37700216,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374645,1734323123,These Crypto Institutional Trends Will Gain Momentum in 2025 (Nansen),"This year is gradually coming to an end, and while the crypto industry witnessed significant growth this year, particularly after the United States presidential election, 2025 is expected to be an even better year. The on-chain analytics platform Nansen has shared with CryptoPotato key insights into important institutional trends that will gain momentum in the crypto market in 2025. However, these narratives are expected to do well under a clearer regulatory framework, which is anticipated under the Trump administration. Institutional Interest to Rise in 2025 The crypto industry is likely to experience a surge in institutional interest in both listed crypto products. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) could become part of the default-balanced asset allocation among asset managers and pension funds. Nansen analysts noted that buy-side investors may begin integrating crypto into standard allocations – moving from a traditional 60/40 equity-bond split to a 55/40/5 equity/bond/crypto split. “This comes from a feeling of “missing out” on the past 40% BTC rally three weeks after the election. Can investors afford not to be allocated at all to crypto going forward?” the report questioned. Bitcoin could also emerge as a frequently used collateral in traditional lending and decentralized finance (DeFi). Word is spreading that stablecoin issuer Tether is already in talks with the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald about a $2 billion BTC lending project. The Tokenization Trend Furthermore, the launch of new derivative products like Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) options indicates increasing institutional adoption. Nansen mentioned that such products and their trading platforms will also attract fees for financial intermediaries, so the sector is likely to surge. Moreover, institutions are exploring the tokenization of financial assets at an increasing pace. U.S. firms are taking major strides toward integrating blockchain in financial markets, and this could be the basis for significant growth if authorities provide clear rules for such operations. One more trend that could drive growth in the crypto sector is stablecoin regulation. If the U.S. makes progress on stablecoin regulatory frameworks, then there could be higher institutional adoption of tokenized fiat currencies. In the meantime, Nansen says the market is seeing a healthy rotation among outperforming cryptocurrencies amid a relatively shallow consolidation after the election. While December’s historical seasonality suggests a positive environment, there could be heightened volatility by January as the new U.S. administration takes office.

Here’s Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Sky-High Returns,"The crypto market has been buzzing with excitement, and Near Protocol (NEAR) has been one of the standout names of the year. Known for its focus on scalability and user-friendly decentralised applications, Near Protocol has been making waves in the blockchain space. Its rise in value has left early adopters grinning ear-to-ear, while those who missed the boat are left wondering, “What now?” If you’re feeling that FOMO, don’t worry—you’re not out of options yet. While Near Protocol continues to thrive, there’s another project that’s catching the crypto world’s attention for all the right reasons. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Web3 aggregator that’s taking blockchain innovation to a whole new level. With its focus on real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to buy in December 2024, offering investors a rare opportunity for sky-high returns. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Groundbreaking Growth Let’s talk about Qubetics . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a trailblazer in the blockchain space, tackling problems that most projects don’t even attempt to solve. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, making real-world asset tokenization not only possible but practical for businesses, creatives, and individuals alike. Imagine you’re a small business owner in Chicago with a warehouse full of inventory you can’t liquidate. Traditionally, you’d have to jump through hoops to get a loan, but with Qubetics, you can tokenize that inventory, turning it into blockchain-backed digital assets. Suddenly, you’ve got liquidity without the hassle of dealing with banks. Now think about a landlord in Austin who wants to unlock equity from a property without selling it outright. Qubetics allows them to tokenize a portion of their property, opening up new revenue streams while retaining ownership. It’s not just for businesses. Imagine an artist in Los Angeles who wants to sell their work directly to buyers around the world. By tokenizing their creations on Qubetics, they cut out the middlemen, keep more of their earnings, and reach a global audience with ease. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is still in presale, and it’s already creating a buzz. Currently in Phase 12, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0311. The project has raised over $6.4 million, with more than 334 million tokens sold to over 9,400 holders. The presale price increases by 10% every week, and the final phase will see a 20% jump. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 after the presale ends, offering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI for those who get in early. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s the frontrunner for anyone seeking massive returns and meaningful innovation. Near Protocol (NEAR): A Blockchain Powerhouse for Scalable Solutions Near Protocol has made a name for itself as one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain world. With its focus on scalability, speed, and ease of use, Near Protocol has become a go-to platform for developers building decentralised applications (dApps). Its unique architecture and innovative solutions have earned it a loyal following and a spot among the top blockchain projects. In 2024, Near Protocol has continued to build on its success. Its integration with other blockchains through its Rainbow Bridge technology has expanded its ecosystem, making it a key player in the world of interoperability. Near’s user-friendly tools and developer-focused approach have drawn in projects from across the crypto space, helping it maintain its momentum. Price-wise, NEAR has seen steady growth throughout the year, reflecting its strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Analysts predict that its upward trajectory is likely to continue as the platform attracts more developers and users. However, while Near Protocol is a solid project with a bright future, its early explosive growth has already passed. For investors looking for a ground-floor opportunity with the potential for sky-high returns, Qubetics offers a unique and compelling alternative. Why Qubetics and Near Protocol Are Both Worth Considering Here’s the thing: you don’t have to choose between these two projects. Qubetics and Near Protocol serve different purposes and cater to different types of investors, making them both valuable additions to a diversified portfolio. Near Protocol is perfect for those who believe in the future of dApps and blockchain interoperability. Its focus on scalability and user-friendliness ensures that it will remain a key player in the crypto space for years to come. It’s a great option for investors seeking steady, long-term growth in a proven project. Qubetics, on the other hand, is all about real-world impact and explosive potential. Its focus on real-world asset tokenization is innovative and practical, opening up new opportunities for businesses, creatives, and individuals. With its presale offering a rare opportunity for massive ROI, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to maximise their returns. Both projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain, and together, they offer a balanced mix of stability and high-growth potential. Regret skipping Near Protocol’s rise?

Qubetics ($TICS) is offering an unprecedented opportunity to get in early on a project that’s solving real-world problems and delivering sky-high growth potential.

37701187,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52231,1734322538,"Searching for the Best Cryptos to Invest in Today? Qubetics’ dVPN, Ripple’s Speed, and Monero’s Anonymity Stand Out as Smart Choices","What makes a cryptocurrency worth your attention? With so many choices in the market, selecting the best cryptos to invest in today can be tricky. The exciting part is that some projects bring revolutionary solutions to the table. This article dives into three top contenders: Qubetics ($TICS) , Ripple, and Monero. Each of these offers something unique, from privacy enhancements to real-world use cases. Qubetics has quickly turned heads with its cutting-edge decentralised solutions, especially its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics doesn’t just push innovation—it actively addresses real-world challenges that other blockchains have struggled to solve. Let’s take a closer look at what sets these cryptos apart and why they’re the talk of the town. Qubetics Tackles Privacy with Game-Changing Solutions Qubetics ($TICS) has been causing a stir with its focus on decentralisation and user-centric applications. Its most talked-about innovation, the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , is a huge leap forward for internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs that depend on centralised servers, Qubetics creates a peer-to-peer network that ensures no single authority controls user data. This guarantees unparalleled transparency and privacy. To understand its impact, let’s consider a real-world example. Picture an entrepreneur who frequently handles sensitive business communications. Traditional VPNs may leave gaps for data breaches. With Qubetics’ dVPN , they can send and receive information securely, without worrying about third-party interference. Similarly, in regions with strict censorship, individuals can access the web freely, bypassing restrictions while staying anonymous. But there’s more to Qubetics than privacy. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it connects leading blockchains under one platform. This means smoother cross-chain transactions and a unified ecosystem. The ongoing Qubetics presale has grabbed attention too. Currently in its 12th stage, it has raised over $6.4 million, sold 334 million $TICS, and attracted more than 9,700 token holders. Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. These structured stages have created buzz around the $TICS presale , with analysts predicting significant growth in its value. If you’re curious to learn more about Qubetics, this video dives deeper into its features: Learn everything you need about this project . It’s clear that Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s solving real problems in a practical, user-friendly way. Ripple Focuses on Revolutionising Cross-Border Payments Ripple has made a name for itself as the go-to solution for cross-border payments. Using its native digital asset XRP, Ripple enables near-instant money transfers across borders at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional banking systems. Banks and financial institutions have adopted Ripple’s technology to modernise their payment infrastructure, making it a favourite among investors looking for practical utility. One of Ripple’s standout features is its consensus algorithm, which replaces the energy-intensive mining process used by many blockchains. This not only makes Ripple faster but also more eco-friendly. Transactions settle within seconds, a significant improvement over traditional systems like SWIFT, which can take days. For businesses and individuals who regularly send or receive international payments, Ripple offers a seamless experience that’s hard to ignore. However, Ripple’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. Its ongoing legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP is a security has created uncertainty in the market. Despite this, Ripple continues to thrive, forging new partnerships with major institutions worldwide. As the case inches closer to a resolution, many investors see this as an opportunity to get involved at a potentially pivotal time. Ripple’s focus on solving real-world problems makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in today. Its practical applications in the financial sector and growing adoption by banks make it a strong contender for long-term growth. Monero Brings Privacy to the Forefront If privacy is your top priority, Monero might be the cryptocurrency for you. Unlike most blockchains that operate with transparent ledgers, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep transactions private. This means senders, receivers, and transaction amounts are all hidden, offering unmatched anonymity for users. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to provide true financial freedom. Whether you’re a freelancer who wants to keep payments private or a business looking to maintain confidentiality, Monero’s features cater to diverse needs. Its RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) technology ensures that no one can trace the source, destination, or amount of a transaction. However, this level of privacy has also attracted criticism. Some governments and regulatory bodies have raised concerns about Monero’s potential misuse for illegal activities. Despite this, Monero remains a popular choice for users who prioritise privacy and security in their financial dealings. Another strength of Monero is its active developer community, which continuously works on updates and improvements. This ensures that the network remains robust and secure, even as other blockchains face scaling and security challenges. For investors seeking a cryptocurrency with a clear focus and loyal user base, Monero offers a unique proposition. Wrapping Up on Today’s Best Cryptos The best cryptos to invest in today depend on what you’re looking for. Ripple stands out for its role in revolutionising global payments, Monero caters to those prioritising privacy, and Qubetics shines as a blockchain innovator addressing real-world challenges. Each of these projects has its unique strengths, making them worthy of attention. As Qubetics presale continues to break records, it’s clear that $TICS is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a platform poised for growth. With over $6.4 million raised and a growing community of token holders, Qubetics is creating waves in the crypto world. If you’re ready to explore a crypto project with real utility, now might be the perfect time to take a closer look at these options.

37699486,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52252,1734321405,Dogecoin to $24? Analyst Says DOGE Is Basically Ready For the Next Move,"Cantonese Cat, a recognized cryptocurrency market analyst, has projected an extraordinary price target for Dogecoin, suggesting that the meme coin could rise to $24. This ambitious forecast represents a potential gain of over 5,823% from current levels, fueled by technical indicators and recent whale activity. Dogecoin has experienced mixed performance in recent weeks. After a sharp rally in early November that saw its price climb 132% in three weeks to $0.4800—marking a three-year high—the cryptocurrency has since retraced by 16%, currently trading around $0.4052. Despite this pullback, optimism remains strong among analysts and investors. According to Cantonese Cat, the asset’s recent price movements suggest the cryptocurrency is positioned for a significant breakout. The analyst highlighted that the token has successfully defended key support levels, particularly around the 0.786 Fibonacci extension. Based on historical trends, Dogecoin followed a similar pattern during its 2021 bull cycle, when it rallied from this level to surpass the 2.272 Fibonacci extension, peaking at $0.73995. Cantonese Cat predicts that Dogecoin could replicate this historical pattern and reach the same Fibonacci level at $24. If this target is met, the token’s market capitalization will exceed $3.5 trillion, solidifying its position as a major player in the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Whale Accumulation Signals Growing Optimism In addition to technical analysis, recent whale activity further supports the bullish outlook for the asset. Market analyst Ali Martinez has observed significant accumulation among large holders, signaling increased confidence in the asset’s future potential. Martinez shared data that whales holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE purchased 160 million tokens, valued at approximately $64 million, within the last 24 hours. This accumulation has brought the total to 22 billion DOGE, worth around $9 billion. Such large-scale acquisitions indicate strong market sentiment and often precede substantial price rallies. The willingness of high-value investors to buy during a dip suggests they anticipate a significant upward movement in the token’s price. While the broader cryptocurrency market has shown bullish momentum, Dogecoin’s trajectory remains uncertain as it contends with critical resistance levels. Nevertheless, analysts like Cantonese Cat and Ali Martinez believe the token is well-positioned for future growth, supported by historical trends and whale activity.

Bullish on Bitcoin with a price target of $125k by March, driven by strong ETF inflows, low exchange reserves, and potential regulatory support. Mt. Gox repayments and MicroStrategy's aggressive buying strategy are unlikely to disrupt the current bullish trend significantly. Key risks include potential market downturns in early 2025 and increased supply from miners if Bitcoin prices drop. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) holds futures instead of spot Bitcoin. For now, I prefer various competitors that hold Bitcoin. Probably the best thing, if you can manage, is to hold your Bitcoins through a hardware wallet. ProShares charges 0.95% on an annualized basis. The fund also distributes some gains, which can make it a bit tedious to keep your exposure up. On the other hand, you're automatically selling some over time. Futures also tend to suffer from roll-yield. This is one reason why it doesn't track the Bitcoin price perfectly: BITO lags bitcoin price (Seeking Alpha) The fees on U.S. traded Bitcoin ETF's tend to be lower: BITO GBTC IBIT ARKB BITB BTC Fund Name ProShares Bitcoin ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF Fund Type Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Issuer ProShares Grayscale iShares 21Shares US LLC Bitwise Investments Grayscale Inception 10/18/2021 09/25/2013 01/05/2024 01/10/2024 01/10/2024 07/31/2024 Expense Ratio 0.95% 1.50% 0.12% 0.21% 0.20% 0.15% AUM $2.60B $21.15B $53.00B $4.85B $4.07B $3.90B Only the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) is a more expensive way to get exposure. However, there can be advantages to going through futures. Some cryptocurrencies have a yield. That's currently not the case with Bitcoin. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is a well-known example. In Europe, there are a lot of cryptocurrency products that pass along (part of) that yield. In the U.S. that's not the case. For most U.S. investors, it is hard to get access to those products. However, professional global traders can buy these (collect yield) and offset the crypto exposure by selling futures. These kinds of arbitrage trades can then have an effect on the futures curve and implicitly pass on some of the yield. However, I'd still rather pick and choose which futures to buy but wanted to mention it. In any case, I think the details of BITO vs any of these other products are overshadowed by the consideration of whether you want Bitcoin exposure or not. The volatility level is so high that these, often important, issues take a bit of a back seat. Mt. Gox On Bitcoin, I remain bullish. In my most recent article about Bitcoin, I set a price target of $88k for the end of the year. That's been exceeded now, and I'll move the goalpost in the conclusion. There are several reasons I'm not too worried $100k Bitcoin marks the top yet. I've commented on the Mt. Gox repayment saga quite a few times in the past. Some money has been repaid. Creditors got to choose whether they wanted to be repaid asap or were okay with a bit of an outdrawn procedure. The reason for that being there always remain small issues to be resolved, and it isn't great if that's holding up the entire process. Of course, the creditors picking the early option gave up some of the ultimate theoretical economics. The holdouts should ultimately be slightly better off but get to endure. The rehabilitation trustee posted the following English doc laying out the reasons. In practice, at the time of posting, there was still 44,905 BTC that needed to be sent out, and the deadline was moved to October 31, 2025, due to a variety of reasons like having to find the right people, legal dispute, etc. Here's a quote: With the exception of certain types of repayments, the Rehabilitation Trustee has largely completed the Base Repayment, Early Lump-Sum Repayment, and Intermediate Repayment (collectively, the ""Repayments"") for rehabilitation creditors who have completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments and have not encountered any issues during the Repayments process. However, many rehabilitation creditors still have not received their Repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving Repayments. Additionally, a considerable number of rehabilitation creditors have not received their Repayments due to various reasons, such as issues arising during the Repayments process. This just makes for a more gradual release of this BTC. Given we're in a bull market for Bitcoin, I'm not too worried about this additional supply because holders will be more inclined to continue hodling, the market is able to absorb any selling better, and the repayments likely continue throughout the year as issues get solved. Inflows Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are strong. Inflows are at levels similar to when ETFs were launched. The difference being this time there are virtual no offsetting outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). At the time, investors were migrating from this higher fee product to the newly available and cheaper alternatives. In other words; there is a lot of interest currently. spot bitcoin flows (THE BLOCK) Exchange reserves Because exchange reserves have hit a multi-year low and are trending down hard since April I wanted to highlight this: Exchange reserve assets (Crypto Quant) Elevated (and especially rising) exchange reserves can indicate future selling. If you want your Bitcoin to be secure, you don't have it on an exchange. The reason it is moved there is for trading purposes (which means selling). With Bitcoin, this can be tracked because blockchain movement can be followed. The inverse (dollars getting moved there) can't be tracked in the same way. Trump's election In this article , I wrote: Personally, I expected Bitcoin to benefit from either election outcome. If only because the uncertainty of the election would end. I'm bullish on Bitcoin for other reasons as well, more deeply explored in this article . Q4 tends to be a very good quarter for Bitcoin (since 2016) and November specifically (an average of +50% and +30% results according to Tastylive ). For good measure, Trump wasn't as pro-Bitcoin during his previous run. In my view, the pre-market run will likely continue. I severely underestimated how excited the crypto community responded to a Trump victory. I still mentioned and expected Bitcoin and crypto companies to do well in the article mentioned but not to the extent it has. It is impossible to prove, as there are no counterfactuals, but I expected Bitcoin and the market to rise with a Kamala win as well. Anything was simply an improvement from the status-quo under Biden. Most interestingly, Trump has indicated he likes the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. It's an idea that's been worked on by Senator Cynthia Lummis, who advocates for the government to buy 1 million Bitcoins over 5 years. At most there will be 21 million of these things out there, so that's a considerable amount. If this idea gets implemented, I'd expect the outcome to be staggering, but it's not my base case. Just a more positive regulatory environment should have a positive effect, if nothing else, on the capital raising for crypto-associated companies. MicroStrategy I've been writing on Seeking Alpha about Bitcoin since 2016. Almost always favorably, as I think there's real merit to this interesting novel asset with all its widely discussed properties. I'm not a huge fan of certain derivatives of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (MSTR). I'd only touch something like that if you knew exactly what you were doing. But as I discussed here in more detail, MicroStrategy can have a large effect on Bitcoin's price. Since my last Bitcoin article, MicroStrategy has announced an astounding $42 billion plan to raise capital . Saylor is generally very upfront about what he will do with raised capital; buy Bitcoin. Historically, MicroStrategy follows this up with another capital raise if the price continues to rise. It will play defense if/when prices fall. Only part of the capital raising has happened, and it is likely designed to get some headlines, but it's an aggressive buyer who's waking up after being absent for a while. Risks The current key risks to me are that we've moved past November, which is a very good month for Bitcoin, and are moving towards early 2025. Especially, January can be a tough month. Perhaps with some of the buzz generated during the holidays slowing down. I've written often about the halving of 2024 and what it could potentially mean because miners bring less supply to market. However, when Bitcoin is rallying, crypto firms like MicroStrategy, but also the miners get to raise money at much more favorable terms. They tend to pounce on these opportunities: capital raising by miners (TheMinerMag) When this money gets converted into crypto-mining hardware, that results in more and more supply coming to market. When demand flags, the additional supply can start having an effect. Bitcoin prices go down, decreasing revenue miners are generating, causing them to sell more of their Bitcoin production and/or reserves. Conclusion I'm still quite bullish in the short term and the very long term. I'll likely get a bit more careful around Q1 2025. I'd strongly reconsider exposure if we move to $70k. This would be a clear change from the current bullish trend. Depending on the events driving such a drop, I'd either sit or potentially buy back in later. As for the upside, based on seasonal Bitcoin performance data, I think we could see Bitcoin $125k before the end of March. In my previous article I arrived at a price target of $88k primarily based on historical seasonal Bitcoin returns. Updating that number with seasonality return data up to March, starting from today's price, I get to $125k. Keep in mind that's just a possible target, and I'm more confident near-term prospects remain fine as with any exact target being achieved. For example, with the right tweets from a fresh President, higher prices are possible. Given all of the above, BITO and other Bitcoin funds remain a buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744424-bitcoins-2025-potential-what-it-means-for-bito-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37699315.jpeg

37698584,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393395,1734319650,XRP Price Prediction For December 16,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 16 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP is currently trading slightly above the $2.40 levels and has slipped into the green zone.XRP is maintaining its position above the upper boundary of the trend channel and recently there has been increased volatility in the crypto market, raising hopes for a possible further move upward. The price has experienced a shallow pullback since the local top, and this could be forming a sideways triangle pattern, suggesting market indecision. The pattern is narrowing, and a breakout decision is expected soon. Key Support and Resistance Levels: Support Levels: The key support lies around $2.28 (the internal low of the triangle). A break below this would likely lead to a test of the lower support range between $2 and $2.23. Resistance Levels: The primary resistance lies at $2.53. A break above this could signal the start of a move toward $2.64 to $2.76. Bullish Outlook: If the price breaks above $2.53, this would suggest that the C-wave has started, potentially leading to further gains. The target resistance areas are around $2.64 and $2.76. However, a drop below $2.28 could signal a deeper correction. Bearish Scenario: A break below the red line at $2.28 would invalidate the bullish triangle breakout scenario. In that case, XRP could revisit the lower support levels between $2 and $2.23. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP had a bullish breakout from a flag pattern, and it’s now retesting the previous resistance, which has flipped to support. If XRP holds above $2.37, the bullish flag pattern targets a price around $3.79, offering a potential 50-60% upside. This target would only be invalidated if the price drops below $2.37, especially if it breaks below $2.28.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-16/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

Don’t Miss Out Again—Grab The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today!,"Picture this: it’s early 2024, and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) launches quietly into the crypto world. You hear the buzz, but you brush it off—“just another meme coin,” you tell yourself. Fast forward a few months, and the whispers have turned into roars. Early investors are flaunting life-changing profits while you’re left with a lingering question: Why didn’t I act sooner? Now, history is handing you a second chance. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and it’s not just riding the meme coin wave—it’s making a tsunami. Already in its 12th presale stage, BTFD has raised a staggering $3.9 million, selling over 55 billion coins. With a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards boasting a 90% APY, and a passionate community, BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement. If you’ve ever wished for a do-over in crypto, this is it. The best meme coin to buy today is right here, right now. Don’t miss it. BTFD Coin: The Dip You Won’t Want to Miss The crypto world is buzzing about BTFD Coin , and for good reason. This Ethereum-based gem has taken the “buy the dip” mantra and turned it into a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a meme coin newbie, BTFD offers a unique opportunity to ride the next big bull wave. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype train. It’s a fully-fledged ecosystem that blends entertainment, community, and financial growth. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets you rack up rewards while smashing through levels with the Bulls Squad. Imagine earning real crypto while gaming—sounds like a win-win, right? Staking is another major draw. Offering an average APY of 90%, BTFD’s staking rewards are designed for long-term holders. For example, staking just $1,000 BTFD coins could nearly double your holdings in a year. By the end of three years, compounded rewards could multiply your stash several times over. Presale Frenzy: Numbers Don’t Lie BTFD’s presale has entered its 12th stage, and the excitement around it is off the charts. Priced at just $0.00013 per coin, it offers an unmatched opportunity for early investors to get in before the big launch. So far, over 55 billion coins have been sold, raising an impressive $3.9 million . With its target listing price set at $0.0006, investors stand to gain significantly once it hits the open market. This presale buzz highlights the growing demand for BTFD and its potential to dominate the meme coin landscape. Let’s break that down. An investment of $750 today would get you 7.5 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash could be worth $4,500 . Now imagine if the price soared beyond that—your potential gains could be life-changing. Accessibility and Community Power You can snag BTFD using multiple currencies. For example: 1 Ethereum buys 38,863,600 BTFD coins. $1 USDT gets you 9,981 BTFD coins. 1 Bitcoin? A whopping 984,470,000 coins. The project’s community is growing fast, with over 5,400 holders already. With its Play-to-Earn game live and staking rewards in full swing, BTFD is poised to become the best meme coin to buy today. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): The Meme Coin You Wish You Had Bought When Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) launched, it was the underdog no one saw coming. Within months, its price shot up, turning early investors into overnight millionaires. But as the saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. GOAT’s Early Days GOAT started as a joke but quickly evolved into a cultural phenomenon. Its team leveraged meme culture, building a community that thrived on humour and camaraderie. Early adopters who snagged GOAT for pennies watched in awe as its value skyrocketed. Unfortunately, not everyone was quick to jump on the bandwagon. Many watched from the sidelines, paralysed by doubt or simply unaware of its potential. Recent Developments and Future Prospects GOAT has continued to evolve, cementing its position as a leader in the meme coin arena. Its latest partnerships with gaming platforms and NFT integrations have given it a new lease on life. Analysts predict that GOAT could still see significant gains, but the golden era of exponential growth might be behind us. If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on GOAT’s meteoric rise, don’t despair. The market always offers new opportunities, and BTFD Coin is shaping up to be the next big thing. The Case for BTFD Over GOAT GOAT may have set the stage, but BTFD is rewriting the script. With its P2E game, robust staking rewards, and a presale price that’s still incredibly low, BTFD has all the ingredients to become the best meme coin to buy today. Imagine this: You’re an early investor in BTFD, staking your coins for a 90% APY. Meanwhile, you’re racking up more tokens through the P2E game , all while the coin’s value steadily climbs. By the time BTFD hits its listing price, you’re not just holding tokens—you’re holding a piece of the future. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out Again! Missing out on Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) was a tough pill to swallow for many. But here’s your second chance. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin to buy today , offering a unique blend of fun, community, and financial opportunity. With its presale already raising millions and its Play-to-Earn game live, the potential for massive returns is real. Don’t wait until it’s too late.

37698080,https://crypto.news/?p=14319632,1734318591,FASB’s Fair Value accounting rules for Bitcoin will officially take effect today,"As of today, the Financial Accounting Standards Board will put its Fair Value accounting rules on BTC and other eligible crypto assets into effect. Under the new rules, companies will measure crypto assets at fair value and update them at each reporting period in their financial statements. This will help companies realize both profits and losses based on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market prices, helping them keep pace with the often fluctuating traded status of the currency. FASB ASC Subtopic 350-60 outlines a new accounting standard that is suitable for fungible crypto assets that meet certain requirements. However, NFTs, wrapped tokens, and internally generated digital assets are exempt from the scope. NFTs are unique and non-interchangeable, which means no two are the same, unlike Bitcoin, and factors like inconsistent pricing, low liquidity, and subjective valuations make it challenging to gauge the fair value of an NFT. Also, unlike BTC, NFTs typically entail specific rights and utilities. All of these reasons make NFTs inappropriate for the standardized, fair value measurement as mandated by ASU 2023-08 . “Nonfungible tokens (ASU 2023-08 applies only to “fungible” intangible digital assets because it is difficult to obtain market prices that meet FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, fair value criteria for nonfungible digital assets; thus, it is unclear how to account for and disclose other types of digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens. Reporting entities accounting for NFTs need to fully understand the rights associated with these tokens and what the tokens transfer.” reads FASB Accounting Standards Update You might also like: Best altcoins to watch as phase 2 of the bull market prepares for liftoff https://twitter.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1868446105366577599 What FASB’s new rules mean for investors Companies holding BTC as treasury reserve assets can now benefit from simplified reporting processes due to FASB’s decision to embrace fair value accounting. The update is anticipated to accelerate corporate adoption by providing greater transparency and a more precise valuation of crypto holdings for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. As businesses increasingly turn to BTC as a long-term strategic reserve , this rule change will cement BTC’s dominance further into the fabric of modern finance.

Any gains were left out of the records, and only losses were recorded if the value decreased. Offering this option will also give retail investors an unrounded view of a company’s financial position. The new rules, which mandate reporting of BTC at current market value, will provide more transparency and accuracy of the financial statements, allowing investors to assess risks, cash flows, and performance more effectively for companies such as MicroStrategy , Tesla and so on. Differences between traditional markets and the crypto economy fade as BTC’s grip as a financial asset becomes firm and clearer, and fair-value accounting standards are now in place.

The government’s press service reported that the Abkhaz State Security Service (SSS) “has seized” almost 200 crypto mining devices “in different parts of the republic” in the space of just four days. Hunting Private Crypto Miners: Abkhazia’s Power Problems SSS head Dmitry Kuchuberia told the acting Abkhazia Prime Minister Valery Bganba that police officers “discovered and seized 194 units of mining equipment between December 10 and 13.” It has come to light in recent months that #Russia will begin selling #Abkhazia electricity at a higher, commercial price in the coming year. The #Kremlin also cut budget co-finance from the #Russian budget to the #Abkhazian budget last month. https://t.co/XUQeUFAbKp — Abkhazia Post (@AbkhaziaP) December 9, 2024 Media outlets have reported police raids in the cities of Ochamchira and Sukhum. Police also raided homes in the Gudauta and Gagra districts.

Both sets of rigs belonged to private citizens, the ministry said. The crackdown appears to have done little to slow crypto miners’ efforts, however. Timur Dzhindzholiya, the head of the state-run power provider Chernomorenergo, said the energy situation was now “critical” in the republic. He said that, despite rolling blackouts and the rising cost of electricity imports from Russia, “consumption is not decreasing.” And this reportedly “indicates that mining farms are continuing to operate” in Abkhazia. A landmark in Ochamchira, Abkhazia. (Source: Alaexis [CC BY-SA 2.5]) Electricity Shortage Bganba said he wants to convince acting president Badre Gunba and the de facto state’s parliament to “declare a state of emergency in the energy sector.” December has been a torrid month for Abkhazia’s deepening power crisis. On December 10, the republic’s internet providers cut off web access for seven hours in a bid to ease crypto mining-related pressure on the grid . Then, on December 11, the power provider was forced to shut down the key Inguri hydroelectric power station for around 24 hours due to critically low water levels.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

This Layer One Blockchain Proves It’s Not Too Late,"Have you ever looked at projects like Solana and thought, “Why didn’t I invest earlier?” For many, watching Solana’s rise was a lesson in missed opportunities. But the truth is, crypto always has another game-changer waiting in the wings. This time, Qubetics ($TICS) could be that golden ticket, offering a fresh opportunity for those searching for the best crypto to buy for explosive returns. While Solana revolutionised blockchain speed and scalability, Qubetics is bringing its own innovations to the table. From simplifying blockchain development to offering a lucrative presale, Qubetics is poised to turn heads and change fortunes. Why Missing Qubetics Presale Could Be a Big Mistake Qubetics is not just a blockchain project; it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone, whether they’re developers, small businesses, or large enterprises. At the core of its innovation is the QubeQode IDE , a visual development environment that eliminates the complexity of blockchain coding. Here’s how the QubeQode IDE is changing the game. Developers can use drag-and-drop components to add features like user authentication, token management, and data storage. A small business looking to create a custom token can do so in minutes without hiring a team of developers. Plus, the form-based configuration lets users set up smart contracts through intuitive forms—no coding required. The code snippet library adds another layer of simplicity by offering pre-written templates for common blockchain tasks. Now let’s talk about the Qubetics presale . Currently in its 12th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.031. Over 334 million tokens have already been sold to more than 9,700 holders, raising $6.4 million. With each presale stage lasting just 7 days and a 10% price increase at the start of each new stage, the time to invest is now. By the 13th stage, the price will rise to $0.0341. Solana’s Rise Shows Why Acting Early Matters Solana is one of the most talked-about blockchain projects, thanks to its unparalleled speed and low transaction costs. Launched with an ICO in 2020, Solana’s initial token price was just $0.22. Fast forward, and Solana is now a major player in the blockchain world, powering decentralised applications and attracting developers worldwide. What makes Solana special is its proof-of-history mechanism, which allows it to process thousands of transactions per second. This innovation has made it a favourite for projects requiring high throughput, from NFT platforms to DeFi applications. Its success underscores the importance of solving real-world blockchain challenges, which is exactly what Qubetics aims to do. For those who missed Solana’s ICO, it’s a reminder of how early action can lead to exponential gains. While Solana continues to grow, Qubetics offers a chance to get in early on a project with equally groundbreaking potential. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy for Explosive Returns Qubetics combines cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, making it a standout project in the blockchain space. Its QubeQode IDE makes blockchain development accessible to anyone, while its presale offers an affordable entry point for investors looking to maximise returns. For those who regret missing projects like Solana in their early days, Qubetics offers a fresh opportunity to be part of something big. With a clear roadmap, innovative tools, and analysts predicting significant growth, $TICS is the best crypto to buy for explosive returns. Don’t wait until the presale ends and the prices climb higher. Take a closer look at Qubetics and see how it could transform your portfolio.

37696143,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52244,1734310818,"2025 Crypto Market Cap Predictions: Dogecoin At $150 Billion, XRP At $400 Billion, ETFSwap (ETFS) At $100 Billion","The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for unprecedented growth, with 2025 predictions suggesting remarkable milestones for significant tokens. The Dogecoin price is projected to achieve a $150 billion market cap, propelled by its loyal community and speculative momentum. The XRP price is expected to reach a $400 billion market cap, driven by increasing adoption in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) is on track for a $100 billion market cap, emerging as a transformative force in crypto. Among the Dogecoin price, XRP price, and ETFSwap (ETFS), ETFSwap (ETFS) stands out as a balanced investment option combining innovation and practicality. Its recent listing on Uniswap and accessible price point make it a strong contender for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the growth predictions. Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Leads Among 2025 Predictions ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape with its innovative features and investor-focused tools. Among its standout offerings is a real-time ETF price tracker , which provides precise and immediate updates on ETF performance. This tool allows investors to monitor trends and make informed decisions in a fast-moving market. The real-time tracker is an essential resource for those aiming to capitalize on the projected $100 billion market cap. Unlike the speculative nature of the Dogecoin price or the institution-driven XRP price, ETFSwap (ETFS) prioritizes functionality and actionable insights, setting it apart as a forward-thinking investment option. ETFSwap (ETFS) also allows investors to diversify their portfolios by offering access to crypto ETFs and traditional commodities such as oil, silver, and gold. This feature bridges the gap between decentralized trading and conventional markets, creating a balanced approach to risk and growth potential. Unlike the Dogecoin price and XRP price, which are tied to specific market narratives, ETFSwap (ETFS) provides a broader range of opportunities to align with varied financial goals. Introducing an AI-powered ETF screener further heightens the appeal of ETFSwap (ETFS), simplifying the decision-making process. For those targeting the predicted ETFSwap (ETFS) $100 billion market cap, the AI-powered screener efficiently maximises returns. The 2025 market cap predictions highlight distinct strengths for the Dogecoin price, XRP price, and ETFSwap (ETFS) price. With its listing on Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) remains affordable, offering investors who missed the presale a chance to secure their positions before further growth. Dogecoin Price, XRP Price And Projected Market Cap Due to its community-driven growth and market popularity, the Dogecoin pric e has consistently drawn attention. Predictions of a $150 billion market cap reflect its ability to thrive during bullish cycles. Its speculative nature, amplified by high-profile endorsements, has made it a favorite for quick gains. Despite its appeal, the Dogecoin price relies heavily on market sentiment, which can lead to unpredictable fluctuations. This dependency may deter investors seeking long-term stability, making ETFSwap (ETFS) a compelling alternative with features designed to support sustained growth. Ripple (XRP) has established itself as a leader in cross-border payments, with the XRP price reflecting its growing use case among financial institutions. The $400 billion market cap prediction underscores its role in modernizing global transactions. Its ability to deliver efficient, low-cost solutions has earned it a strong position in the crypto market. However, regulatory challenges and competition in the payment sector may impact the XRP price trajectory. For investors seeking diversification, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a platform that combines decentralized trading with traditional asset classes, delivering a unique approach to portfolio management. Conclusion The 2025 crypto market cap predictions showcase exciting possibilities across the market. The Dogecoin price’s $150 billion target reflects its speculative appeal, and the XRP price’s $400 billion prediction underscores its institutional credibility. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) shines as a well-rounded investment option, set to reach a $100 billion market cap through its unique features and market positioning. Savvy investors are taking action now. Acting now gives access to a platform that addresses the needs of today’s investors while offering the potential for substantial returns. Don’t miss out.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE.

37693393,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627921,1734308574,Japan ‘far behind’ US in cyber attack preparedness — But that’s actually a good thing for crypto,"Japan’s government is currently pushing for an “active cyber defense” (ACD) policy, and major media in the country are falling all over themselves to aid in the effort with stories to alarm the public. However, copying the examples of the US and UK, as major outlet Nikkei implies ought to be done, is in the very worst interest of peaceful crypto and privacy advocates in Japan. Not long ago, Cryptopolitan reported on Masaaki Taira, Japan’s digital transformation (DX) minister, being commanded by self-described “defense geek” prime minister Ishiba to accelerate work on an “active cyber defense” (ACD) bill. The bill is controversial because it involves state-level spying via private telecom companies on the people of Japan, even in peacetime, and supplying the info to the United States. Some Japanese are also suspicious of scandal-embroiled Taira potentially having connections with anti-Japan interests in the Chinese Communist Party. Major news outlet Nikkei has now joined the push for the “active cyber defense” agenda, publishing a report (or propaganda piece, depending on who you ask) promoting greater cyber-attack preparedness. The December 16 report goes so far as to imply that centralized misinformation control and even state-level “debunking” need to be increased, and done in tandem with major nations like the US and UK. But mimicking Five Eyes intelligence giants in surveillance is a horrible idea for cryptocurrency adoption and privacy in Japan, especially with a digital yen now on the table. The combined effect of all this is to threaten the culturally self-reliant populace with even more influence from a global banking cabal, and pressure to align with cartoonish foreign figures like Musk and Trump , whose actions Taira wants to “closely follow.” Of course Nikkei knows this. And of course the new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba doesn’t actually care about the security or economic freedom of the people he supposedly governs. But nor does any politician, really. This should go without saying. Nikkei shills for surveillance, Japan falls further from crypto grace While the years of independent bitcoin ATMs in Tokyo (ca. 2015-2017) operating free and unfettered are far behind us, and popular trading sites like Local Bitcoins have long since been destroyed by the same restrictive red tape that took out the ATMs, things yet continue to spiral downward when it comes to the Japanese government’s approach to finance, cryptocurrency, and information control. And the media is right there behind them, fueling the fire. “Cyber ​​attacks are posing increasing threats to national security,” the new Nikkei report (translated by Google) reads. “Attacks on governments and military-related targets in various countries have increased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year.” The piece continues: “Japan is currently aiming to strengthen its cyber security system, including the introduction of ‘active cyber defense (ACD)’ that detects signs of cyber attacks and prevents damage before they occur.” As mentioned above, the ACD bill aims to spy on public communications via private companies ostensibly to stave off cyber attacks and the spread of misinformation before they happen. According to other reports from local media, the new legislation could even include shutting down people’s computers. The terms “thoughtcrime” and “pre-crime” might pop into the heads of readers and film buffs familiar with the horrific dystopias of 1984 and The Minority Report. Japan’s NISC, responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings, issued far less alerts than its foreign counterparts in England (middle) and the United States (top), according to Nikkei’s research. Source: Nikkei Combine all this with the looming CBDC , (read: centrally programmed, censorable digital JPY) also shilled/predictively programmed by Nikkei interests, and a pretty clear picture of what is happening emerges: Japanese state officials are painting themselves as the victims, while clamping down even harder on the true victims — everyday folks just trying to get by. Crypto is taxed at insanely high rates in Japan (up to 55% on gains), and increasing regulation of the cryptocurrency and banking industries in the nation is making it near impossible for individuals and small businesses to leverage the true benefits of peer-to-peer digital currency — that is, without facing potential jail time. It’s now common in Japan for even normal bank accounts to unilaterally freeze customer funds if the smallest abnormality or “suspicious behavior” is detected with a deposit or transfer. Further, Japan’s financial regulator, the FSA, is in closed door talks about how to more effectively capture the asset class. Debunking the need for government debunking The Nikkei report notes that Japan’s NISC (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity), responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings to the public, lags far behind its foreign counterparts in Britain and the US. But in Japan, perhaps worrying about the inflation problem , the rampant overtourism, and suicides from overwork might be good to put on the agenda, as opposed to Shigeru Ishiba’s plans for military spending on steroids and drafting of cyber-security bills that spy on everyone. Perhaps instead of lending military support and money to the United States/Israel genocide in the Middle East, politicians on the archipelago might start worrying about the aging population of retirees unable to survive on the national pension. But alas, that is wishful thinking. Which is why permissionless cryptocurrencies became so important in the first place. The report compares the number of “debunkings” Japanese embassies have issued on X, compared to other embassies. Source: Nikkei As if to insultingly answer these ponderings with a non-sequitur, however, the Nikkei report reads: “The Nikkei Shimbun compiled the number of debunkings from April 2011 to July this year for the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of the Japanese, US and UK embassies … the Japanese embassies in the US and UK only sent out one debunking each from their respective countries … that denied the danger of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.” Nikkei’s report then lauds the intelligence giants overseas: “On the other hand, the US embassy in Japan sent out 13 debunkings, and the UK embassy sent out 10.” Is this really a litmus for social progress? Which government sends out the most “debunkings”? I don’t personally think so. A litmus for social progress is how much economic freedom an individual has, and the respect of others for that freedom. On that front, the Japanese government, and those of the whole world, are miserably and intentionally failing. So, if dystopian spying and “pre-crime” cybersecurity bills are what Japan is lagging behind in, perhaps that particular lack of ambition is for the best.

Don’t Let This Best Meme Coin Presale for Massive Return Potential Be Your Second Mistake!,"Meme coins have been shaking up the crypto world for years, delivering wild profits and unforgettable stories. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise or Brett creating overnight millionaires? One thing’s clear: early movers always win big. Now, there’s a fresh chance to jump in early, and it’s making waves— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In just 14 days , this presale sensation has raised over $2.6 million, selling over 44 billion coins to more than 3,900 holders. BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement redefining what meme coins can achieve with innovative staking rewards, a thrilling play-to-earn game, and a vibrant community called the Bulls Squad. This isn’t just another crypto; it’s your ticket to ride the next bull wave. BTFD Coin: The New Frontier for Meme Coin Enthusiasts Unlike the usual meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin brings substance to the table. Built on Ethereum’s rock-solid foundation, it flaunts unmatched security, scalability, and liquidity. The concept of “ Buy the Dip ” is more than a tagline—it’s a rallying cry for those ready to seize opportunities. With presale prices starting at just $0.000004, BTFD Coin offers prime entry points. The current stage 10 price of $0.0001 is still a steal. By the presale’s end, it’s set to launch at $0.0006 per coin. For context, a $2,500 investment at $0.0001 could fetch you 25 million BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that $2,500 could skyrocket to $15,000 . Presale Success and Features BTFD Coin’s presale journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Hitting $1 million in under ten days, it’s sold over 44 billion coins. The Bulls Squad—a charismatic community of dip-buying enthusiasts—embodies resilience and camaraderie. For investors, BTFD’s staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, making it a top choice for long-term holders. The play-to-earn game adds another layer of engagement, allowing users to earn while having fun. Connect your wallet, level up, and turn in-game rewards into real-world profits. Tokenomics for Growth BTFD’s tokenomics ensure stability and growth. With 48% allocated to presales, 18% for staking rewards, and 17% for game incentives, every aspect fuels its ecosystem. Unsold tokens will be burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Brett Coin: The Opportunity You Missed Launched earlier this year, Brett Coin (BRETT) emerged as a memecoin powerhouse. Its 142% rally over the past 30 days captured the market’s attention, and it currently trades around $0.2053 with a market cap of $2.035 billion. This meme coin ranked #68 on CoinMarketCap and became a favourite among investors seeking high returns. However, not all has been smooth sailing. Brett faced a 47% drop in April 2024 due to insider holding concerns. Yet, it rebounded fiercely, proving its resilience. Investors who got in early reaped massive rewards, turning small bets into life-changing gains. What Makes Brett Unique Brett isn’t just another meme coin.

37694360,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52247,1734307232,Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. RCO Finance: Which Can Turn $1k into $100k by January 1?,"Among the numerous digital assets, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and RCO Finance (RCOF) stand out as three distinct choices with significant potential in 2025. However, while each of these coins has its own narrative and market dynamics, the key question remains: which one holds the potential to turn a modest $1,000 investment into $100,000 by January 1? Dogecoin Could Hit $1.48 in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE), originally conceived as a meme coin, has grown to become one of the market’s most recognizable and widely traded cryptocurrencies. Known for its fun, community-driven nature, Dogecoin saw a significant price surge earlier this year, doubling in value within a month following Trump’s re-election, reflecting the strong bullish sentiments surrounding the coin. Despite its reputation as a meme coin, Dogecoin’s performance has shown potential for substantial gains, with an impressive 350% rise in a year to trade at $0.4055 at press time. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some bullish predictions putting its price at around $0.8392 by early 2025 and others hinting that it could soar to $1.48 after Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. Nevertheless, while the projection of $1.48 is quite ambitious, it still can not convert a $1,000 investment in DOGE into $100,000. Buying DOGE at its current price could get you approximately 2,466 DOGE tokens, which at $1.48 would be worth a modest $3,649. Shiba Inu Price Could Hit $0.0000879 in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB), often called the “Dogecoin killer,” has carved out a unique space in the cryptocurrency market with its playful branding and vibrant community. Also launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu quickly gained attention due to its low entry price and speculative appeal. It has seen notable activity, including several token burns to reduce supply and increase scarcity. Although these burns represent only a small fraction of Shiba Inu’s total supply, they contribute to the deflationary narrative that can be attractive to investors looking for assets with limited supply and potential for price appreciation. Over the past year, Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase, soaring by 196% despite witnessing wild price swings. And while it is still way down from the $0.00008616 all-time high achieved in October 2021, predictions are placing the meme coin at $0.0000879 in 2025. However, while $0.0000879 would represent quite a huge gain for SHIB, it still would not be enough to convert a $1,000 investment into $100,000. $1,000, at the current SHIB price of $0.000028 , can get you 35,714,285 SHIB tokens, which at $0.0000879 would only be worth $3,139.285. RCO Finance Emerges as a Compelling Alternative Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are both meme coins and RCO Finance is emerging with a more structured and professional approach to cryptocurrency investing. As an AI-powered financial platform, it aims to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is the AI-powered Robo Advisor , which analyzes market data and tailors investment strategies to individual user preferences, optimizing portfolio performance without requiring manual oversight. This level of automation is particularly beneficial for novice and experienced investors, allowing them to focus on their long-term financial goals without getting bogged down by day-to-day market fluctuations. Additionally, RCO Finance will provide access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, from traditional stocks and bonds to digital assets and real-world assets like real estate. This wide range of tradable assets allows investors to diversify their portfolios and balance risk across different markets. Another unique aspect of RCO Finance is its KYC-free ecosystem, which ensures user privacy and simplifies the onboarding process, making it more accessible to privacy-conscious investors. Furthermore, the platform also features an audited smart contract , enhancing security and trust among users. These features position RCO Finance as a viable option for investors seeking more than just short-term gains. Investors can invest in the project through the ongoing RCOF token presale. Taking Advantage of the Ongoing RCOF Token Presale The RCO Finance presale represents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to maximize their returns. In its fourth stage, the RCOF token has already experienced a 509% price surge, reaching $0.07770, and is expected to see further gains as it progresses through the presale stages. The next stage, the final presale stage, is set to see the price of RCOF reach $0.21420 before public listing at between $0.4 and $0.6. This price trajectory indicates substantial potential for profit as the RCOF token approaches its public listing, where it could see even more significant gains as investors take advantage of early access to the platform’s features and the ecosystem’s expected growth. For those looking to transform a $1,000 investment into $100,000, the ongoing presale of RCO Finance presents a promising opportunity to capitalize on the projected price increases. A $1,000 investment in RCOF at the current presale price could earn you 12,870 RCOF tokens and if the token soars to $10 as projected by most analysts due to the current hype around AI and DeFi, the investment could turn to a cool $128,700.
