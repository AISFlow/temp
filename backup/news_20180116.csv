According to CoinMarketCap.com, those cryptocurrencies have fallen by at least 13% – and in excess of 25% in the case of XRP – since the start of the day. At one point, within the 24-hour period, the overall market capitalization for all tokens had lost nearly $200 billion, falling from $710 billion to $536 billion at its lowest.  As of press time, that figure had bounced back somewhat, hovering around $573 billion.  The drop illustrates the turbulence in cryptocurrency markets today, with bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, having fallen by 14 percent in 24 hours, bottoming out at $11,182 before recovering slightly.  Indeed, only several of the 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap's main page are reporting price gains, with assets like siacoin and Bitcoin Gold reporting losses in excess of 30% over the past 24 hours.  On the brighter side, today's market correction is not as severe as the one that occurred late in December 2017, when the overall market value fell more than $200 billion. At the time, bitcoin had fallen to $10,800.  Further, today's slump still leaves the market well up year on year. On Jan. 16, 2017 the combined value of all crypto tokens was under $16 billion. Today's low is at roughly similar levels to those seen a month ago, when the market cap stood at around $554 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

In a statement published Tuesday morning, the bank's parent company, Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp., said it was responding to ""erroneous statements contained in articles"" regarding its policies, which it said hadn't been changed.  The statement comes two days after reports indicated that the bank had ceased international wire transfers related to cryptocurrencies because it was unable to verify that overseas banks complied with certain rules or regulations. In addition, according to Fortune's report, the push was ""alleged to be a response to an incident of international fraud associated with one of the bank's clients.""  The company pushed back on that point as well in the Jan. 16 response, stating:  “This is a long-standing policy of the Bank and remains in effect today. Last week, the Bank sent out a reminder to customers of its policy against accepting cryptocurrency-related wire transfers from non-U.S. entities. This reminder to customers is not a new policy for the Bank and was not due to, nor did the Bank experience, any “incident of international fraud.”  The release made no mention of domestic wire transfers or international wires from U.S. entities. As well, Metropolitan's comments highlighted that its existing policy is a result of a risk-avoidance strategy within the bank.  ""The bank's long-standing policy of not accepting cryptocurrency-related wire transfers from non-U.S. entities is part of its robust risk management program that is designed to ensure the safe and sound operations of the Bank in compliance with applicable laws, rules and guidance,"" the firm said.

42400873,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEnT,1516114809,"XRP Price Drops to 2.5-Week Low, Eyes Sideways Trading","Ripple's XRP token fell to a 2.5-week low today, and is looking at a more or less sideways movement in the short-term, chart analysis suggests.  The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to the low of $1.23 at 09:54 UTC today before regaining a little poise, data source CoinMarketCap indicates. Further, XRP is still down 23 percent over the last 24 hours. At press time, XRP is trading at $1.39.  As per OnChainFX, XRP is down 63.41 percent from the record high of $3.84 set Jan. 4.  A look at the charts suggests XRP may have found a bottom and could consolidate in the next 36–48 hours before possibly resuming the sell-off.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Dip demand/bearish exhaustion as indicated by the Doji candle (previous 4-hour candle marked with a circle).  A head-and-shoulders breakdown (bearish reversal pattern) indicating the rally from the December low of $0.19700 has ended. As per the measured height method, that has opened doors for a drop to $0.30 (though that looks far-fetched currently).  50-day moving average (MA) has adopted a bearish bias (sloping downwards).  Bearish 50-day and 100- day MAs crossover is confirmed (short-term average cuts long-term average from above).  200-day MA has shed bullish bias (flattened).  Clearly, the 4-hour chart is loaded with bearish price patterns that indicate scope for a drop to $0.8610 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). However, the relative strength index (RSI) on the chart above shows oversold conditions.  Daily chart  As seen in the chart above, the 5-day and 10-day MAs have adopted bearish bias (sloping downwards). The RSI also favors further downside in XRP. The tide has clearly turned in favor of the bears.  However, the 50-day MA is curled up in favor of the bulls. This coupled with the oversold conditions on the 4-hour chart (as shown by the RSI) and the doji candle on the 4-hour chart could keep XRP rangebound in the next 36–48 hours.  The 50-day MA would shed its bullish bias (top out) following a bout of consolidation, thus opening doors for further losses.  View  XRP is likely to trade in the sideways manner in the range of $1.80 to $1.00 in the next day or two, before resuming the sell-off.  Overall, prices look set to $0.8610–$0.60 levels in the short-run.  Bullish scenario: A rebound from the 50-day MA, followed by a quick move above $2.25 (Jan. 11 high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

The minister stated:  ""We want a stable economy. We reject the risks of speculation and the possible financial diversions linked to bitcoin.""  Le Maire indicated that the working group will be headed by Jean-Pierre Landau, the former deputy governor of the country's central bank, the Bank of France.  “Jean-Pierre Landau's mission will be responsible for proposing guidelines on the evolution of regulations and to better control development and prevent their use for the purpose of tax evasion, money laundering or for financing criminal activities and terrorism,"" he said.  The move to establish a cryptocurrency working group comes a month after Le Maire proposed a discussion on bitcoin regulation at a G-20 summit in 2018. He said that he will ask Argentina to put bitcoin on the agenda during an upcoming gathering in April.  ""There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how ... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin,"" he stated at the time.

The partnership was announced today, alongside the news that Cypherium will launch an initial coin offering (ICO) early in 2018 and that the two entities hope their joint work will lead to mainstream adoption of blockchain-based platforms.  Cypherium plans to use its CPH token to power transactions and smart contract functionality for decentralized apps and a deferred payments system, according to the release.  The company, which includes former Google, Amazon and Microsoft engineers, notably utilizes the Bitcoin-NG technology pioneered by IC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer. Bitcoin-NG was designed to solve scaling issues with blockchains by using two different types of blocks.  Sirer, who is also a computer science professor at Cornell University, said Cypherium is a ""perfect fit"" for IC3, continuing:  ""Both of our organizations are dedicated to the research and application of methodologies that will solve scalability, compliance, governance, and performance issues with widespread blockchain adoption.""

42400856,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEYi,1516104004,Shipping Blockchain: Maersk Spin-Off Aims to Commercialize Trade Platform,"Global shipping giant Maersk wants to wrap the world in a blockchain.  With access to a shared, trusted record of transactions, Maersk executives say, the world's shipping companies would save money and be able to better compete on enhanced services. And the company has developed its technology using the Fabric software contributed by IBM to the open-source Linux Foundation, to do just that.  Yet one roadblock still remains: finding a way to sell a collaborative system to a bunch of competitors.  So Denmark-based Maersk and IBM have decided that by spinning off the project into a standalone entity, they might have more success in attracting Maersk's rivals to the solution.  Announced today, the yet-to-be-named joint venture is awaiting final regulatory approval, but the idea is that a well-rounded advisory board (which is still being established) would help ensure transparency and a level playing field among participants.  Unlike a typical startup situation, though, the technology behind the venture has already been widely tested, with pilot users including some of the largest companies in the world.  DuPont, Dow Chemical and the food packager and processor Tetra Pak have already experimented with an early version of the platform. Plus, custom agencies in the Netherlands and U.S., and ports in Rotterdam and Houston, have all taken part as well.  According to the joint venture's CEO, Michael White, the new entity is essential given the variety of potentially competing counterparties involved.  ""This is not a bespoke Maersk system,"" White, who was previously the president of Maersk Line in North America, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is going to be an industry-wide, open platform solution for all ecosystem participants.""  Prime participation  Within six months of receiving regulatory approval, White expects the company to make its services available for wider use.  Among those interested in using the entity's blockchain solution are General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Agility Logistics, with additional participation from customs and government agencies from Singapore, Peru and China.  Also, the global terminal operators of APM Terminals in New Jersey and PSA International in Singapore are slated to use the platform to boost collaboration between their users and improve the way they organize their terminals.  According to IBM Global Industry senior vice president Bridget van Kralingen, the venture is part of a bigger effort by the supply chain ecosystem to capitalize on ""untapped"" resources.  ""Our joint venture with Maersk means we can now speed adoption of this exciting technology with the millions of organizations who play vital roles in one of the most complex and important networks in the world, the global supply chain,"" she said in a statement.  The spin-off is the latest development by Maersk since it completed its first live blockchain trades in May and revealed a pilot project in Singapore in August.  In September, Maersk also outlined plans to deploy a maritime insurance product using blockchain.  According to White, the first two services the new company will offer are being designed to provide end-to-end shipping information and to digitize and automate trade paperwork.  ""Being able to run a global business more efficiently is important,"" White said, concluding:  ""The opportunity that the customers see in helping to identify and close key gaps in real-time access to events and to document availability is real. It's palpable.""

Data source OnChainFX indicates that bitcoin (BTC) has depreciated by 14 percent in the last 24 hours. At press time, prices were was at $11,966 levels, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Notably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 40 percent from its all-time high of $20,000 set just a month ago.  The losses in bitcoin are largely in line with those seen across the cryptocurrency space. As of writing, Ripple (XRP), stellar lumens (STR) and cardano (ADA) are down at least 25 percent on the day each. Ethereum's ether (ETH) token has shed 18 percent in value in the last 24 hours.  So what's troubling the cryptocurrency markets?  Firstly, comments on social media indicate there is unease in the investor community over talk of a cryptocurrency trading ban in South Korea and further possible crackdowns on trading and mining in China.  And secondly, BTC futures contracts are trading at a discount to bitcoin's global average calculated by CoinMarketCap. The January expiry futures contract on the CBOE is trading at $11,510 and CME's is changing hands at $11,530. Meanwhile, BTC spot is trading at $11,816. The discount (futures price lower than spot price) indicates that the market participants are bearish on the underlying asset (BTC).  The technical chart analysis indicates scope for a drop to below $10,000 levels if the bulls can't muster a response today.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  The rising trendline (blue line) has been breached.  A downside break of the triangle pattern, indicating the sell-off from the record high of $19,891.99 (Dec. 17 high) has resumed.  The relative strength index (RSI) has turned bearish (below 50.00), indicating scope for further losses.  The 50-day moving average (MA) has shed bullish bias (flattened).  The 5-day and 10-day MAs carry a strong bearish bias (downward sloping).  View  BTC looks set to close (as per UTC) below $13,000 and extend its decline to $8,350 (support of rising trendline).  A minor recovery cannot be ruled out if bitcoin defends $11,004 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the November low to the December high) over the next few hours.  Significant gains above $14,000 (daily highs) look unlikely, courtesy of the downward sloping 10-day and 5-day MAs.

42400852,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEUm,1516096820,PBoC Official Calls for Wider Ban on Chinese Crypto Trading: Report,"A senior official at the People's Bank of China is reportedly calling for a wider ban on services related to cryptocurrency trading in the country.  Pan Gongsheng, vice governor of the central bank, said, to prevent market risk, the government would apply more strict regulation to end all cryptocurrency trading-related activities and services. The news comes via a Reuters report today, citing an internal memo reviewed by the news agency.  While it's not yet clear whether the reported memo will become immediate policy, the news indicates the continuing severe stance taken by China's top regulators towards curbing cryptocurrency speculation and lowering perceived financial risk in the country.  According to the report, Pan said in the memo that a wider ban should extend to services and activities including individual or institutional market-makers, centralized trading platforms, guarantors, or settlement providers like online cryptocurrency wallets.  Back in early September, Chinese regulators banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the country and also subsequently required domestic exchanges to suspend crypto-to-fiat currency order-book trading services.  Following the restrictions, major exchanges in China have shifted business focus to over-the-counter (OTC) and overseas crypto-to-crypto trading – services that are currently still available for residents in China.  The report indicates that Pan is now seeking collaboration from both central and local authorities to investigate and subsequently block any domestic or foreign platforms that allow investors in China to participate in cryptocurrency trading.

42400857,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEZh,1516094159,"Big Money, Murky Governance: Kicking the Tires of Telegram's Token Sale","Pitched as a game-changer for the cryptocurrency industry, Telegram's initial coin offering could be a lifesaver for the company.  Launched in 2013 by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, the company has never executed on the vague proposals it has floated to monetize its messaging platform. And with hefty annual operating expenses ($70 million in 2017 alone, according to the token sale primer obtained by CoinDesk), Telegram has likely burned much of the Durovs' personal fortune, which is the project's sole known funding source, people familiar with the situation said.  But if successful, the forthcoming sale of cryptographic tokens known as ""grams"" would leave Telegram flush again, with $1.2 billion. And if the tokens hold their value over time, the company would have a recurring source of funds from the 52 percent of the 500 billion total grams created that its new foundation is keeping.  Those are big ifs, of course.  Heralded as the most ambitious token sale the industry has ever seen, the ICO would finance development of the Telegram Open Network for inexpensive real-time payments and eventually, a platform for decentralized identity, storage and more  But while the offering has piqued widespread interest among hedge fund managers excited about the idea of Telegram bringing crypto to the masses (the company reports its messenger app has 200 million users), others are skeptical about the prospects.  ""There's a serious challenge to building the infrastructure,"" said Evgeny Vigovsky, the chief operating officer at crypto depository Saifu, which is launching an ICO soon, and an alum of Russian security giant Kaspersky Labs. ""In my opinion, they are trying to take a swing at something with which they have a lack of competence.""  For one thing, as far as CoinDesk was able to ascertain, there isn't even an alpha version of the product yet.  And further, the company's approach to encryption has long been questioned by professional cryptographers worried about the security vulnerabilities inherent in its tech, Vigovsky said.  While the Telegram team has denied all such vulnerability claims in the past, Vigovsky continued:  ""This raises concerns about the security of the new project.""  Telegram has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CoinDesk.  Yet perhaps more important is that the documents obtained by CoinDesk regarding the Telegram ICO do not explicitly outline why the company is seeking such a large haul.  The reserve  It's not unusual for token issuers to hold some of the tokens they create in reserve for use by the company later on.  The hope is that the network proves enticing enough that, once the tokens start trading on the open market, they go up in value, giving the company another pool of capital (some of which it can sell later) that can keep its operations going.  And sometimes, management of those reserve funds is put in the hands of foundations, and this is indeed the case with the Telegram ICO.  According to the white paper, management of the reserve tokens will be handed over to the non-profit TON Foundation, and the foundation will hold off on any further sale of grams while the platform goes through its early development.  Telegram's staff will keep 4 percent of the token supply, as an incentive to continue iterating on the platform, thereby theoretically increasing the value of their own pool of tokens.  The TON Foundation also sets out a predictable formula for the sale of its tokens, with the very first token selling for 10 cents, and each subsequent token sold from the reserves sold for no less than one-billionth more than the last gram sold for.  According to a deal summary sheet attained by CoinDesk, participants in the private sale will have access to a fixed price of $0.308 per gram, for the first $600 million in grams sold. The price for those in the public sale will increase as the sales go on, following the formula described above. If the team succeeds in raising another $600 million in the public sale, the average price paid for buyers in that sale will be $0.969 per gram.  The Foundation ""reserves the right not to sell any of the remaining grams at all, or to sell them at a higher price, but never at a lower price (taking into account the uncertainty of quickly changing exchange rates),"" the white paper explains.  Co-founder of Turing Group and token economics expert Siddhartha Kalla ran the numbers of the pricing scheme defined by the white paper. Following the white paper's formula, as the token price increases, Telegram and the TON Foundation would bring in something like $14.7 billion, Kalla said.  He added:  ""The last gram would be sold at $14.84, which would value the five billion gram supply at $74.21 billion.""  That's years away and it assumes the project goes well and the TON platform attains widespread use. As MIT professor Christian Catalini told CoinDesk, ""Reserves are worth nothing until the coin is allowed to float in the market.""  Durov control  While the economics behind the gram token prioritize stabilizing the money supply, Catalini noted that it's unclear, right now, whether it will have the intended outcome.  Plus, Catalini is worried about governance on the platform.  According to the white paper, ""The TON Foundation will have a majority of votes during the first deployment phase of the TON Blockchain, which may be useful if a lot of parameters end up needing to be adjusted, or if the need arises for hard or soft forks.""  Neither of the documents that CoinDesk has seen go into detail about governance, but this implies that grams equal votes over the development of the protocol. For such a large project, it's especially strange that even something as simple as voting isn't clear. Other ICO projects go into considerable detail about how governance will move forward, settling disputes and voting schemes. The TON project is opaque on all these points.  For an industry that emphasizes trustless systems so much, the Durovs are asking investors to place a lot of trust in them and the Telegram team.  ""Overall, I would be more worried about the governance over the arbitrary parameters that can be changed ex-post by the foundation and team,"" Catalini told CoinDesk. ""Investors should evaluate the capacity of any team to execute on their plan and vision, as well as the protections they have if things go wrong.""  And with that, Catalini said, more details need to be revealed about how the proceeds will be used beyond the everyday expenses.  He concluded:  ""They need to provide a lot more detail on the monetary policy, how the parameters will be decided, what governance they see for the foundation, etc.""  Telegram icon on phone image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,TON,FIAT | TRADING | TON | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/01/16/big-money-murky-governance-kicking-the-tires-of-telegrams-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2889a409dceb36261a3b3d22911a0123ef72fee-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42400870,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEmU,1516091291,"Bitcoin's Price Just Dropped Over $1,300 in 1.5 Hours","The price of a bitcoin has just plummeted by over $1,300.  Having been on the slide in recent days, in large part seemingly due to new regulatory efforts to calm the enthusiastic crypto market in South Korea, chart analysis had indicated that bitcoin would recover and likely return to $15,000 levels today. However, that did not happen.  The cryptocurrency opened today's session at $13,585, and reached a high of $13,601 before the sudden tumble at soon after 07:00 UTC that saw the price drop from $13,210 down to $11,850 at 08:30 UTC. That's a fall of $1,360 in just 1.5 hours.  The drop puts the price of a bitcoin at a month low. Dec. 5 saw bitcoin at a similar level, however, that was when the cryptocurrency was climbing fast on the way to setting a new price record around $20,000, as the launch of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group and CBOE was being anticipated by the trading community.  At press time, bitcoin had recovered slightly, and was trading at $12,195 – down 10 percent for today, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The news comes as the wider cryptocurrency market is seeing losses. All the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red today, with ethereum down 14 percent, Ripple down 21 percent and bitcoin cash down 19 percent over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The overall market cap for all tokens is at $584.9 billion at press time – down from a high of $832 billion on Jan. 7.

42400853,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEVl,1516089791,Swift Signs Agreement With 7 CSDs to Explore Blockchain for Post-Trade,"Swift has signed a memorandum of agreement with seven central securities depositories to look into how blockchain can be used for post-trade processes, such as proxy voting.  Revealed today, the agreement is with U.S.-based Nasdaq Market Technology, Russia-based National Settlement Depository, Switzerland-based SIX Securities Services, South Africa-based Strate, as well as the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, Argentina's Caja de Valores, and Chile's Depósito Central de Valores.  Dubbed the CSD Working Group of DLT (distributed ledger technology), the financial infrastructure providers have agreed to explore how DLT could save money and bring new efficiencies to post-trade processes. Proxy voting specifically has been an area of interest for CSDs experimenting with blockchain technology.  Swift's head of standards Stephen Lindsay didn't give specific details about the working group's efforts, but instead, told CoinDesk the agreement was more exploratory in nature.  ""It's a complex area, and there are regional variations in the way that it works, so one thing is to bring the CSDs around the world [together] to actually focus in on the commonalities,"" he said, adding:  ""It's not something where we've seen a lot of cooperation in the past, because different markets do things differently. But this is a chance to do something even more different.""  Informally founded last year, the CSD Working Group on DLT formalized its requirements, adding the use of Swift's ISO 20022 messaging standard in November.  ""The CSD Working Group on DLT is tackling a key challenge related to emerging technologies, which is a clear lack of standards,"" said Thomas Zeeb, CEO of SIX Securities Services and Chairman of the International Securities Services Association (ISSA), which recently endorsed the working group effort, in a statement. ""As the industry evolves, DLT-specific standards such as [Swift's] ISO 20022, will provide a great foundation, in terms of both existing business content and approach.""  Echoing that, Lindsay told CoinDesk Swift signing the agreement had to do with making sure DLT technology plays nicely with ""existing post-trade processes, some of which are not broken.""

In an online statement published on Jan. 11, ViaBTC said it will temporarily increase the maintenance fee ratio for the AntMiner S9 cloud mining contract from the previous 6 percent to 50 percent. The mining pool currently accounts for 13.8 percent of the global computing power, data shows.  Effective since 8:00 UTC on Jan. 12, such change is said to be a result of the scarcity of mining resources now available in China driven by recent events, according to the statement.  ""Recently, due to policy changes, some of our long-term hosting partners are facing a crisis of farm closure as mining resources in Mainland China become more scarce, leading to rocketing costs of our cloud mining operation.""  Such notice came just a few days after the company announced to shut down its cryptocurrency mining contract marketplace on Jan. 8. At the time, reports indicated that Chinese regulators are taking steps to reduce tax, electricity and land benefits for cryptocurrency mining companies, an effort to curb their operations.  Upon inquires, ViaBTC didn't wish to give further comment or clarification on such notice.  While the company didn't specify how long this temporary change will be in effect, according to the statement, users have the option to apply for terminating their AntMiner S9 cloud mining contracts before Jan. 18.  Meanwhile the statement said the maintenance fee ratio for AntMiner D3 or L3 contracts remains unchanged at 6 percent but they are not yet available for termination.

42400871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLElV,1516078824,5 Blockchain Developments Coming in 2018,"Peter Loop is associate vice president and senior principal technology architect at Infosys, where he focuses on delivering enterprise cryptocurrency and blockchain ledger technologies, API management and cloud migration of enterprise systems.  This article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      During the course of 2017, we saw big technology players making moves in blockchain.  In addition to Microsoft and IBM, Oracle announced in October a new cloud-based blockchain-as-a-service offering, while SAP opened up early access to its own version of the offering in May. With these updates, and others, it's safe to say that Fortune 500 companies are now pairing with providers to explore blockchain’s uses in their businesses  These are examples of the type of adoption and validity we expected to see in 2017, but even these positive developments can still be considered scratching the surface.  Government bodies are also collaborating on the many potential benefits of blockchain, and bold entrepreneurs are thinking about how the tech can be used as the basis for new smartphones and apps.  Even the recent frenzied nature of bitcoin – which has stunned the investment community and has caused both scorn and praise – can’t disrupt the ongoing progress of blockchain. While we follow bitcoin's journey, let's look ahead at what we can expect to see unfolding in 2018:  1. Asia and the Middle East will aggressively push blockchain  Interest in blockchain continues to be very high in Asia and the Middle East, where some of the largest banking institutions are forging ahead with blockchain projects or service offerings, particularly in payments.  For example, banks in Japan and South Korea have just begun testing a blockchain technology that could achieve same-day international transfers and cut costs by nearly 30 percent.  2. Cybersecurity will amplify blockchain adoption  With the rise of ransomware attacks demanding cryptocurrencies, blockchain and IoT cybersecurity will emerge with defenses based on cryptocurrency technologies.  While this may sound fantastical and futuristic, the emergence of blockchain cybersecurity tools may be the next big thing in blockchain. With major breaches such as Equifax proving that companies generally cannot safeguard current identity data systems, the need for a more secure blockchain-based identity approach, in which no one holds all the keys, will emerge.  3. ICOs will take off  There was a seismic jump in ICOs in 2017, and the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies has expanded in a huge way. In the next year, the pace of ICOs will grow significantly faster, and will overtake venture capital funding.  4. Finance and insurance will go all in  The insurance and finance sectors are two of the most likely to experience deep, and threatening, disruption from blockchain technology.  Insurance will emerge as a hot area as claims processing and complex multi-party processes like subrogation will show the business value of blockchain-based automation. And, JPMorgan will open a cryptocurrency trading desk, despite Jamie Dimon's viral comments dismissing the validity of cryptocurrencies.  5. Automation, privatization are coming  Blockchain will drive digital transformation of the enterprise specifically with automation, digitization of processes, tokenization of physical assets and activities and codification of complex contracts.  In addition, governance issues will continue to plague bitcoin (Segwit2x), ethereum (frozen Parity funds) and others as new challenges emerge. This will drive enterprises to ""private"" blockchains but will not slow down the growth of core cryptocurrencies.

42400868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLEhZ,1516061976,Housing or Dotcom: Which Bubble Does Cryptocurrency Mania Resemble?,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and a former editor-in-chief of American Banker.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      ""It seems like the dotcom bubble all over again, or the housing bubble all over again.""  That's Robert Shiller, the Nobel Prize-winning Yale economist, quoted in Fortune magazine's cover story on bitcoin.  So: dotcom or housing? Pick one, professor. Because there's a meaningful difference.  Debt bubbles, like the one that overheated the U.S. housing market in the 2000s and ultimately sparked a global financial crisis, leave behind encumbrances. Tech bubbles, like the 1990s internet mania, leave behind infrastructure.  The last great debt bubble gave us $700 billion of bailouts and more than 2,000 pages of legislation (not counting the reams of regulations putting the Dodd-Frank Act into practice) in the U.S. alone.  Rather than ending ""too big to fail"" we ended up with the biggest TBTF institutions ever, zombie foreclosures that sat vacant for years waiting to be repossessed, and the spectacle of Occupy Wall Street stinking up a public park and scaring the children.  The last great tech bubble, on the other hand, funded the rollout of fiber-optic cable networks and research into 3G mobile computing. It fueled the development of smartphones (Apple, Samsung), algorithmic search (Google), big data logistics and e-marketplaces (Amazon, Alibaba), social media (Facebook, Twitter), cloud computing (Dropbox, AWS), the platform and app economies (Airbnb, Uber) and so forth. (To be fair, tech-stock shenanigans from that era were also a factor that led to Sarbanes-Oxley.)  As with a century earlier, when a boom-bust cycle in the 1880s and 1890s left behind a national railroad system, the dotcom bubble totally transformed the economy.  So while cryptocurrencies are almost certainly in a bubble – I mean, come on, dogecoin's market capitalization is above $1 billion, and its software hasn't been updated in two years – the pertinent question is what kind of bubble.  Pain ahead  True, either way, there will likely be steep financial losses, tears, layoffs, business failures, a funding drought, recriminations, pious editorials, lawsuits (meritorious and otherwise), prosecutions, congressional hearings, political grandstanding, unfunny ""Saturday Night Live"" skits and, quite possibly, burdensome new regulations.  But there probably won't be bailouts.  For one thing, bitcoin and its myriad clones and mutations are, even now, too small and too segregated from the broader financial system to warrant such an intervention.  And given the threat that decentralized money poses to tax collection and financial surveillance, it's not something most governments would be inclined to rescue from the abyss.  So crypto bagholders will be on their own – as it should be. If you don't see why, google ""moral hazard.""  Further, if someone makes a stupid bet on a cryptocurrency that goes south, his losses are limited to the cash he invested. (Hopefully not from his retirement savings.)  In sharp contrast, when housing prices returned to earth, the suckers who had taken out subprime mortgages still had six-figure debts hanging over their heads. Even after the borrowers mailed the house keys to their lenders, the foreclosures left a stain on their credit reports for years before they could get their financial lives back.  So the potential damage from this bubble is limited when compared to the crash of 2008. And arguably the upside is greater.  Because this bubble could leave behind the rails of a new and improved financial system.  Laying foundations  It is true that, as Lightning Network co-founder Elizabeth Stark recently noted on Twitter, many of the people doing important infrastructural work in bitcoin do so as a labor of love, not for the money. As the old saying goes, cypherpunks write code.  And it's hard to imagine many of the frivolous initial coin offerings (ICOs) out there leaving much of a legacy, apart from souvenir white papers (our era's version of those vintage stock certificates you can buy for a few bucks from Wall Street sidewalk vendors).  But it's also hard to imagine that none of the blockchain projects being showered with money by venture capitalists and, increasingly, ICO ""contributors"" (an unfortunate euphemism) will amount to anything. The ones that do may form an important, if intangible, infrastructure for global digital commerce.  Possibly in ways we can't yet imagine. The spreadsheet and the relational database are examples of applications of pre-internet computing that no one foresaw as they were building computers – transformative technologies that no one could have conceived of until after all the investment in a new platform was done.  And of course there's the internet itself, whose humble beginnings were in Cold War military commanders' need for a resilient communication network in the event of a nuclear attack.  Robert Shiller will always be a hero for calling out the U.S. housing market's excesses when it was politically incorrect to do so. But he's mistaken for speaking of financial bubbles as if they were interchangeable and equally destructive.  A final note: One good thing did arguably come from the last debt bubble, albeit indirectly.  If the crisis hadn't shaken the world's faith in centralized institutions and financial intermediaries, we might not have gotten bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/01/16/housing-or-dotcom-which-bubble-does-cryptocurrency-mania-resemble,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e249f3c63083be1463356597229eb1e8b32faacd-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
