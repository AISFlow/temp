34711781,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647828,1728946813,"Shiba Inu Price Flashes Historical Bull Flag, Here’s What Happened Last Time","Technical analysis suggests that Shiba Inu is currently positioned at a critical price junction, one that could lead to a massive 400% breakout to the upside. According to an analyst on the TradingView platform, the current Shiba Inu price action is pointing towards a full breakout of a bull flag formation. If this interesting projection were to materialize as anticipated, it would put the meme-inspired cryptocurrency on a steady path to a return towards its current all-time high. Shiba Inu Price Waiting To Break Above Bull Flag Taking to the TradingView platform, the analyst (without_worries) revealed an interesting take after an analysis of the Shiba Inu price action since the beginning of the year. The analyst highlighted a significant correction by examining the 5-day candlestick price chart, noting that Shiba Inu has retraced approximately 75% from its yearly high of $0.00003595. This correction has been marked by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, giving rise to the creation of a bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Expert Dissects $60 Forecast For XRP Price, Institutional Investors Are The Key The analyst pointed out several reasons why going long on Shiba Inu now presents a favorable opportunity. The most critical factor is the breakout above the bull flag pattern, which often signals the continuation of an upward trend following a period of consolidation. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also provided a bullish signal. For the first time since April, the RSI has broken above a descending trendline and is now trending upward meaningfully. The RSI currently stands at 54.7 on the 5-day chart, relaying the inflow trend among investors. Although there remains the possibility of SHIB retesting the bull flag pattern, the analyst emphasized that if SHIB experiences a second impulsive move, it could trigger a repeat rally similar to the one seen during its last major breakout. During that previous rally, SHIB surged by about 400% to reach a peak of $0.00003595. If history were to repeat itself under similar conditions, Shiba Inu could see its price break above its current 2024 peak and reach a target between $0.00006204 and $0.000074. Bullish Predictions For SHIB The Shiba Inu price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by intense volatility. From October 7 to October 10, the SHIB price tended downward to reach a low of $0.00001613. Since that point up until the time of writing, SHIB has gained about 11.84%, although it has been rejected multiple times at $0.00001809. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 40 Million XRP In 48 Hours – Where’s The Price Headed? At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001809. Another analyst, Javon Marks, is echoing the return to SHIB’s all-time high. According to Marks’ analysis, based on an earlier breakout of a falling wedge pattern, SHIB is now free for a run up to $0.000081.

The altcoin has surged 13% since last Thursday, showing signs of strength amid market volatility. Now, Solana is just 5% away from the $160 key resistance, a crucial level it hasn’t surpassed since early August. This resistance marks a pivotal point for SOL, as breaking above it could trigger a significant bullish move. Related Reading: Active Dogecoin Addresses Reach Highest Level In 8 Months – Is DOGE About To Rally? Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared a technical analysis suggesting that Solana is forming a bullish pattern. According to his analysis, if SOL breaks above this pattern, it could lead to a massive surge and potentially reach new all-time highs. As traders closely monitor this resistance level, the next few days will be crucial for determining Solana’s future price action. Investors are eager to see if SOL can break through and spark a broader rally or if it will face rejection and enter a consolidation phase. With momentum building, Solana’s price movements are at the center of attention in the crypto market. Solana Analyst Predicts New ATH Soon Solana is approaching the critical $160 resistance level after a 4% surge in the past few hours. Analysts and investors are paying close attention as the entire crypto market rebounds from local lows, and Solana is now poised to follow this trend. The cryptocurrency has gained 13% since last Thursday and is 5% away from breaking the key $160 resistance, a level it hasn’t surpassed since early August. The market’s growing optimism is reflected across social media platforms, where speculation about Solana’s future price action is mounting. Prominent crypto investor and analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis of Solana on X. In his analysis, Runefelt highlights that Solana is forming a bullish pattern, which could signal a massive breakout if the price breaks above the $160 resistance. According to Runefelt, Solana’s surge to new all-time highs would be substantial once it breaks the upper boundary of this bullish triangle pattern. The $160 zone has proven to be a key resistance level, pushing Solana’s price thrice since early August. As Solana moves closer to this critical level again, many investors are optimistic that the price will break through this time, leading to significant upside momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst However, a failure to breach this resistance could result in consolidation, with traders looking for stronger confirmation of the next big move. The coming days will be crucial for Solana, as the market eagerly awaits confirmation of a breakout or further consolidation. If bulls break above the $160 resistance, it could pave the way for Solana to target new highs, driving renewed interest and momentum in the price of the altcoin. SOL Supply Zone About To Break Solana (SOL) is trading at $153 after a modest surge above the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $151. This upward movement marks a significant moment for SOL, as being above this crucial indicator is seen as a positive sign for potential future gains. If the price can maintain its position above the 1D 200 MA, it could pave the way for a direct push toward the key $160 resistance level. A successful close above $160 would open the door to a challenge of yearly highs around $210, enticing traders and investors looking for momentum in the altcoin. However, if Solana fails to maintain its position above the daily 200 MA, investors anticipate a retracement to lower demand levels around $140. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details Staying above the 1D 200 MA will be crucial in determining the short-term direction for SOL. Investors are closely monitoring these levels, as they could signal either a continuation of the bullish momentum or a potential reversal, leading to increased volatility in the coming days.

34706821,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647821,1728936050,"Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top","Solana (SOL) has continued its recent bullish wave during the last 24 hours with a surge of 4%, but the trend in this social media-related metric could be to watch out for. Traders May Have Become Too Hyped Around Solana On Social Media Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the positive sentiment around SOL on social media has shot up to a nine-month high following the latest bullish momentum that the coin has seen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Going Through A ‘Generational’ Shift, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the ratio between the amount of positive and negative comments related to Solana that are appearing on social media. This metric works by analyzing the posts/threads/messages on various social media platforms (X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, and BitcoinTalk) and running them through a machine-learning model to determine which ones relate to positive sentiment and which ones relate to negative sentiment. When the indicator has a value greater than 1, it means the number of positive posts are outweighing the negative ones right now. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the dominance of bearish comments. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment for Solana over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment has registered a large spike as the latest recovery in the asset’s price has taken place. With this spike, the indicator has reached a value of more than 5.6, which means social media users are making over 5.6 times as many bullish posts as bearish ones. This is the highest that the metric has been in around nine months, so the traders are clearly quite optimistic about the current SOL rally. While some bullish moods can be conducive to rallies, an excess of them can actually prove to be an obstacle. Historically, cryptocurrencies like Solana have tended to show moves that are opposite to what the crowd is expecting. The probability of a contrary move rises the more sure the traders become of a direction, so a highly bullish market can lead to tops in the price. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Back To Positive Returns With $308 Million Inflows – Details This effect is also visible in the chart, as some past spikes in the Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment had occurred around local tops in Solana’s value. So far, SOL has only continued to rally further despite the investor FOMO, but considering the historical pattern, it’s possible a top may be hit before long, should hype on social media maintain at high levels. SOL Price Solana has continued its latest run with a 4% surge over the past day, which has taken its price above the $153 level.

Based on his analysis, the crypto could soon enjoy a massive pump that will lead to a price gain of almost 80,000%. XRP Price To Enjoy “Giga Pump” To $400 Amonyx stated in an X post that an XRP giga pump is incoming. Based on his accompanying chart, the XRP price could enjoy a massive rally to reach as high as $400. Such a price rally will represent a price gain of almost 80,000% for the crypto. The analyst made this prediction using the Elliot Wave theory. Related Reading: Expert Dissects $60 Forecast For XRP Price, Institutional Investors Are The Key The projected rise to $400 represents a wave 5 impulsive move, with the analyst’s chart showing that this move to the upside was already in play. However, the accompanying chart failed to show when precisely this parabolic move would occur, although it looks like a price target for the peak of this market cycle. Interestingly, about a month ago, Amonyx predicted that the XRP price could rise to between $50 and $57 this cycle, which looked to be his peak target for this bull run. As such, his recent prediction suggests that the analyst has become more bullish on XRP’s trajectory. His ultra-bullish outlook for XRP could be related to the recent filings by Bitwise and Canary Capital to offer XRP ETFs. Approval of these funds could attract more institutional investors into the XRP ecosystem, driving more inflows into the crypto and leading to a potential price rally. Amonyx also seems confident that the SEC and Ripple will settle their ongoing legal battle. Therefore, the lawsuit will no longer act as an obstacle to XRP’s potential growth. A settlement could also signal the potential approval of the pending applications for an XRP ETF since that will confirm that the Commission no longer believes that the crypto is a security. XRP To Break All-Time High Amid the ultra-bullish prediction, crypto analyst Jaydee has given a more conservative price target. The analyst predicted that the XRP price would rise to $6.5, marking a new all-time high (ATH) for the crypto. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently stated that XRP would at least rise to $5.89 in the worst-case scenario for the crypto in this bull run. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Bullish Breakout As Crypto Traders Go Long Above $2 – What’s Next? Therefore, the consensus among XRP analysts is that the XRP price will at least reach a new ATH in this bull run. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto predicted that the crypto could reach $10 in this market cycle based on his belief that ETH will hit $10,000. The XRP price has remained stagnant as it consolidates between the $0.5 and $0.6 range.

34701772,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647842,1728925228,Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising,"Dogecoin tests a critical liquidity area of around $0.112 after days of choppy price action. While the broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin, is experiencing a notable rise from yearly lows, driven by positive economic data and improving sentiment, Dogecoin has yet to catch up. Other altcoins and meme coins have surged, but DOGE remains in consolidation. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Analysts and investors are closely watching for a signal that could confirm a further uptrend for Dogecoin. The funding rate indicates rising demand, which could support a potential price increase. Top analyst and investor Ali has shared an intriguing buy signal for DOGE, suggesting that gains may be on the horizon. As the market sentiment shifts, traders closely monitor whether Dogecoin will follow the broader crypto trend and break out of its current range in the coming days. Dogecoin Price Is Set To Rise Dogecoin is currently at a crucial level that will determine its price action, as DOGE has struggled to hold above this area since early August. Speculation around DOGE’s performance in the coming months is optimistic, yet Dogecoin must catch up with the gains other meme coins deliver to investors. Prominent analyst Ali has shared a technical chart on X, showing a buy signal for Dogecoin on the 4-hour price chart. This signal is significant because it appears in a shorter timeframe and often indicates a larger trend shift in the daily timeframe, suggesting a potential upside in the coming days. If this signal plays out, it could begin a stronger upward movement for DOGE. Supporting this optimistic outlook, key data from Coinglass reveals that the OI-weighted funding rate for Dogecoin is rising. A positive funding rate in cryptocurrency markets indicates that the price of perpetual futures contracts is higher than the spot price of the underlying asset. This means long positions are becoming more dominant, and long traders pay short traders a positive funding rate. This dynamic reflects increased demand for DOGE and hints at potential gains ahead. Related Reading: Solana Prepares For A 20% Rally – Can SOL Reclaim $176? If Dogecoin can maintain strength above this critical level, it may finally follow the broader market’s uptrend. However, Dogecoin risks further consolidation or a potential drop if it fails to break above and sustain higher levels. For now, investors are watching closely, waiting for a confirmed move that could lead to significant gains for DOGE. DOGE Testing Supply: Breakout Soon? Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at $0.112 after several days of sideways trading below the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA), which sits at $0.116. This level has acted as a key resistance, and breaking above DOGE must gain momentum. If the price manages to recover the 1D 200 EMA and push past the $0.13 mark, it could signal the start of a significant rally for Dogecoin. Such a move would likely reignite investor interest and attract new buying demand, potentially driving higher prices. However, if Dogecoin fails to hold above the $0.11 level and continues to struggle with the 1D 200 EMA, a deeper correction could be on the horizon. In that scenario, DOGE may retrace to lower demand areas around $0.09, where buyers might step in to prevent further downside. Related Reading: Active Dogecoin Addresses Reach Highest Level In 8 Months – Is DOGE About To Rally? For now, Dogecoin’s price action remains in a tight range, and traders are watching closely to see if it can reclaim these critical levels or if a larger pullback is in store.

Earlier in the day, the campaign unveiled the broad agenda, which included the first thing resembling a substantive policy position from her on cryptocurrencies. But anyone hoping for more details from her speech in Erie, Pa., was left disappointed.  Harris didn't even mention ""blockchain"" or ""digital assets"" in passing, as she's done in prior appearances, much less crypto.  ""We will build a future where we have what I call an opportunity economy, where everyone can compete and have a real chance to not just to get by, but to get ahead,"" she said early in her remarks Monday evening.  The Harris campaign said earlier in the day that the ""opportunity agenda"" was aimed at bolstering support for her among Black men.  ""Vice President Harris knows that more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, which is why her plans will make sure owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected,"" a press release said.  An attached document echoed that message.  ""Vice President Harris appreciates the ways in which new technologies can broaden access to banking and financial services,"" the document read, before repeating the press release's statement about the framework.  In contrast to Harris' near-silence on the topic, former President Donald Trump has made a number of overtures to the crypto industry, promising friendly regulators and saying he would appoint a ""bitcoin and crypto advisory council"" at Bitcoin Nashville, an industry conference.  Last month, Trump visited PubKey, a Bitcoin bar in New York City, and bought burgers using bitcoin with assistance from the bar's staff.  Crypto industry participants have commissioned a number of polls gauging voters' interest in the sector. A Harris Poll (no relation to the Vice President) funded by crypto asset manager Grayscale suggests 77% of likely voters want candidates to be informed about crypto, with 21% of the respondents holding at least some crypto.

42407371,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGli7,1728920737,Does World Liberty Financial Count as Trump 'Launching a Coin'? Polymarket Bettors Are Divided,"This week in prediction markets:  Is Donald Trump really ""launching a coin""? Some Polymarket bettors say shilling World Liberty Financial doesn't count.  Are PoliFi tokens surging because of limited upside in prediction markets?  Canada's Justin Trudeau is in trouble, but Polymarket bettors doubt there will be an election this year.  A presidential candidate starting a business on the campaign trail certainly is unprecedented, but that's just what Donald Trump is set to do Tuesday morning with the launch of his decentralized finance (DeFi) project World Liberty Financial.  On a Monday X space, the team behind the project said they are looking to raise $300 million with the token sale and have 100,000 accredited investors on the whitelist.  Yet a Polymarket contract asking if Trump will launch a coin before the election gives it just an 83% chance of happening – even though Trump family members and associates confirmed a token is in the works during a September livestream and the post on X announcing the launch promises the start of a public sale.  Why the uncertainty? It's over whether this counts as Trump ""launching a coin.""  The market's rules say it will resolve to ""yes"" if ""conclusive, definitive evidence emerges that Donald Trump was involved in the deployment of a new token by"" Election Day, ""based on a consensus of credible sources.""  Some are contesting Trump's ""involvement.""  One holder by the name of Asherwow, who holds over 8,700 shares of the ""No"" side of the contract, argued in Polymarket's comment section that ""being an affiliate does not necessarily mean you are involved in the deployment of the coin.""  Trump would have to be more than having an ""indirect business relation"" for it to count, Asherwow wrote.  Another No holder by the name of Lawyered.eth points to language from the white paper, first reported by CoinDesk, which reads: ""World Liberty Financial is not owned, managed, operated, or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, or any of their respective family members, affiliates, or principals… World Liberty Financial and $WLFI are not political and have no affiliation with any political campaign.""  Those on the yes side, however, use a more liberal definition of ""involvement,"" and say the doubters are being pedantic.  ""Should he also write the smart contract himself and deploy the liquidity to Uniswap?"" asked one Yes holder.  When the contract resolves after Nov. 4, should there be a dispute on the outcome, it will be sent over to UMA, a decentralized oracle service that referees the platform's crypto-based prediction markets. UMA token holders vote on the resolution, though Polymarket has overruled UMA before.  PoliFi vs. Polymarket  Trump's odds of winning the 2024 U.S. election surged this month, bringing what was a tie in the first week of October to what's now a nearly 8.5 percentage point gap in the Polymarket odds.  Meanwhile, in the last two weeks, the TRUMP (MAGA) token is up 63%, according to CoinGecko data, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a market index that measures the performance of the largest digital assets, which is down 2%.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Steven Steele, the MAGA project's marketing director, said part of the token's appeal is that it has more room to grow than Trump's Polymarket odds, which have less upside the higher they climb.  ""Buying TRUMP as a bet on Donald Trump winning the election now becomes more attractive, pushing more capital into TRUMP,"" Steele said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""This offers significantly more upside than betting markets.""  On the other hand, if Trump wins, Polymarket traders who bet on his victory are entitled to $1 worth of crypto for every ""yes"" share they hold, whereas meme coins guarantee no payout and trade solely on vibes.  There have been other attempts to amplify the upside of prediction markets in the form of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), adding leverage to Polymarket contracts.  Market data, however, shows this hasn't really caught on quite yet.  Checking DEX D8X's leveraged prediction market shows low open interest available and a maximum 2x leverage to those wanting to trade the Trump ""yes"" side.  Meanwhile, the TRUMP token has had nearly $9.3 million in trading volume during the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, pushing its market cap over $200 million.  Canadian election?  Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is facing a revolt by high-ranking Liberal members of parliament and the continued threat of a non-confidence motion – a feature of the Westminster system where opposition parties can topple governments – but Polymarket bettors don't think there will be an #election2024 in the Great White North.  Around 20 Liberal MPs have reportedly signed a document urging Trudeau to step down, expressing concerns over declining poll numbers. Canadian pollster Angus Reid gives Trudeau a 30% approval rating. Surely with a minority government, where opposition parties, combined, have more seats than the ruling party, this would make for election season, right?  Not quite.  Although the Liberals hold only a minority of seats, they have managed to maintain power with the support of at least one other party during confidence votes.  Both the Bloc Quebecois and the NDP have recently declined to back a Conservative-led non-confidence motion, with Bloc leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh signaling they would not risk triggering an election that could favor the Conservatives.  Polymarket bettors give approximately the same chances of that happening as an election.  So even though Trudeau, personally, remains unpopular, until Canada's other opposition parties push for a motion of non-confidence, the status quo likely remains.",NEUTRAL,UMA,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | UMA | TOKEN SALE,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/does-world-liberty-financial-count-as-trump-launching-a-coin-polymarket-bettors-are-divided,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e0d1a094521b44399aea2a590f9a38c587d0fe0-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34699262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647863,1728919816,What’s Behind Bitcoin And Ethereum’s Exchange Exodus? Record-Low Reserves Could Hold The Key,"Crypto investors are not keen on dealing with cryptocurrency trading platforms, which has resulted in the dwindling exchange reserves of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Centralized exchanges on Bitcoin and Ethereum hit a historic low after investors and crypto enthusiasts opted for self-custody solutions for their virtual assets. Related Reading: Uniswap: New Crypto Developments Lift UNI Price Up by 17% – Details Staying Away From Cryptocurrency Trading A recent trend showed that traders and other enthusiasts choose to hold on to their crypto assets rather than sell them on Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange platforms. They preferred direct ownership of their assets using self-custody wallets, which created an increasing demand for self-custody solutions. However, it led to a decline in the liquidity of BTC and ETH on centralized exchanges. Strengthening Bitcoin And Ethereum Values A positive consequence of traders’ preference for self-custody solutions is the increasing value of Bitcoin and Ethereum assets over time. Traders veering away from cryptocurrency trading platforms create a sense of scarcity, leading to the growth of its value. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is pegged at $64,842. Since hitting a record-high of $73,000 in March this year, the price remains somewhere between $66,000 and $49,000. Meanwhile, according to Coinmarketcap, Ethereum is trading at $2,464. Bitcoin, Ethereum Reserves Drop Bitcoin and Ethereum on centralized reserves took a nosedive and hit a historic low early this month. As of October 13, CryptoQuant’s chart showed that centralized exchanges for BTC recorded an all-time low of 2,666,717 bitcoins. The highest amount of Bitcoin was pegged at 3,361,854, which was recorded on June 8, 2022. After that period, Bitcoin went on a sharp decline. It hit its lowest level early this month. In terms of volume, spot exchanges have 1.1 million Bitcoin in reserves, while derivative exchanges own 1.39 million reserves. By far, Binance owns 563,000 Bitcoin reserves, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, followed by Kraken with 112,3000 reserves. On the other hand, Coinbase Advanced holds 830,530 Bitcoin reserves and Coinbase Prime has 3,000 reserves. Ethereum’s centralized exchanges also face a similar dilemma to Bitcoin wherein its reserves continue to plummet and hit a record low of 18.7 million. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? According to CryptoQuant, derivative exchanges hold a big portion of Ethereum with 10.3 million in reserves, while 8.4 million Ethereum reserves are being kept at spot exchanges. Historically, Ethereum’s all-time high in reserves was 2,310,823 recorded on 6 September 2022. Since that period, Ethereum reserves in central exchanges continue to plunge. In terms of reserves, Coinbase has a large reserve of 4.5 million Ethereum, followed by Binance with 3.6 million Ethereum. Kraken also holds a significant Ethereum reserve of 1.3 million.

Howells assembled a team to carry out a $13 million excavation of the landfill, which would take between 18 and 36 months to carry out with a further year of remediation work.  The council has rejected the request out of environmental concerns.  A British man has filed a legal claim against a local council in Wales in an attempt to retrieve a hard drive containing 8,000 BTC that he accidentally threw out in 2013, according to news website WalesOnline.  The story of James Howells, 39, is well known in Bitcoin lore. In 2013, Howells accidentally threw out a hard drive containing his bitcoin stash that he had mined in 2009, worth around $1 million at the time but now worth about $527 million.  Over the last decade, Howells has made requests to Newport Council – proprietors of the landfill where the hard drive ended up – to retrieve it, but he claims he has been ""largely ignored."" He is now suing the council for damages of 495 million pounds ($646 million), representing the peak valuation that 8,000 BTC reached earlier this year.  The case is due to be heard in December this year, but Howells said that his aim is to ""leverage"" the council into agreeing to an excavation of the site in order to avoid a legal battle, according to the report.  Howells assembled a team to carry out a $13 million excavation of the site, which includes the council's former head of landfill, who claims to know the particular area where the hard drive is now located.  The excavation would take between 18 and 36 months to carry out with a further year of remediation work, which the council has rejected out of environmental concerns.  ""I'm still allocating 10% of the value for the council even though they have been problematic throughout,"" Howells said, according to the report. ""That would be 41 million pounds based on today's rate but in the future it could be hundreds of millions.""

42407351,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGlB3,1728916184,Liquidity and Options Pave the Way for Bitcoin ETF Market Expansion,"Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a total net inflow of $18.9 billion and currently hold around 869k BTC.  Bitcoin ETFs account for approximately 3% of the total bitcoin trading volume.  A portion of the inflows into bitcoin ETFs is driven by the ""basis trade"", where investors seek to profit from the price difference from the spot and futures price.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted vast amounts of media attention in 2024, and rightly so, for being the most successful ETF launch of all-time.  Since their launch on Jan. 11, bitcoin ETFs have attracted a total net inflow of $18.9 billion, according to Farside data. The nine newborn ETFs excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) hold 646k BTC. GBTC itself holds an additional 223k BTC, according to heyapollo data. In total, bitcoin ETFs now hold 869k BTC, representing approximately 4% of the circulating bitcoin supply.  Bitcoin ETFs have achieved several significant milestones this year. Most notably, this decade has seen the launch of 2,000 ETF launches, with iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) among the top 10 in terms of biggest assets, according to Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg Analyst.  ETF trade volume is a small fraction of the market  However, the ETF market remains a small fraction of the overall bitcoin trading volume.  According to checkonchain data, on Oct. 11, the last full trading day, the bitcoin futures market traded $53.4 billion, the spot market traded $4.5 billion and the ETFs traded $2 billion. This means ETF trading volume accounted for roughly just 3% of the total bitcoin market volume that day.  The basis trade is a portion of the total inflows  It is difficult to know the exact percentage of inflows into the ETFs that are tied to the ""basis trade"", which is also known as the cash and carry trade. This strategy involves investors going long the underlying asset while simultaneously shorting the futures contract, which typically trades at a premium. The goal of the trade is to capture the premium between the spot and futures price. As the futures contract nears expiration, its price converges with the spot price, closing the arbitrage opportunity and allows the investor to capture the spread.  This is a market-neutral trade, as the investor is both long and short the same asset. The futures position offsets any movement in the underlying ETF's spot price, allowing the investor to lock in the arbitrage premium without being exposed to directional market risk.  IBIT's biggest holders  Using Fintel data, to review IBIT's largest holders, which have been disclosed in the 13-F filings, where institutions with over $100 million in assets under management (AUM) must report ETF purchases. The top holdings show that major holders such as Goldman Sachs and Jane Street Capital are authorized participants (APs) involved in the creation and redemption of the ETF shares. Additionally, hedge funds such as Millenium Management and Capula Management appear to be most likely using the ETF for the basis trade. The only significant holding that doesn't seem to be part of this strategy is the State of Wisconsin Investment Board.  What can we expect moving forward  Private wealth management firm Bernstein previously referred to the institutional basis trade as a ""Trojan horse for adoption."" Bernstein suggested that as liquidity in the ETF market grows, these trades could lead to net long positions. As ETFs become a larger part of the overall market, liquidity and investor participation will be further enhanced.  Another potential catalyst for the ETFs is the approval of physically settled options tied to IBIT. These options, favored by more sophisticated investors, provide opportunities to earn passive yield through strategies such as covered calls or allow miners to hedge their position. As ETF adoption increases, these factors are expected to play a larger role in the market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/liquidity-and-options-pave-the-way-for-bitcoin-etf-market-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7deeb9b07bdb105178b3d28f25c9dacca51cb6d1-1198x571.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trading firm QCP Capital highlighted similarities between current price actions and those seen before U.S. elections in 2016 and 2020, suggesting a pattern where Bitcoin sees significant gains in the weeks leading up to the election, fueling 'Uptober' optimism.  The S&P 500 also opened at a new high, indicating a bullish market trend, which often correlates with cryptocurrency performance.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $65,000 in U.S. morning trading hours Monday as the S&P 500 index opened to fresh highs, with some traders arguing that historical price patterns witnessed ahead of prior U.S. presidential elections might offer a reason to be bullish ahead of November's upcoming vote.  BTC is up 4% in the past 24 hours, data shows, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid fund tracking the largest tokens, up 3.1%.  SPX rose 14.8 points, or 0.25%, at the open to 5,829.81 ahead of a week packed with corporate earnings and economic data, per Reuters.  BTC rallied from $62,000 to $65,000 since early Asian hours Monday, liquidating over $80 million of BTC and ether (ETH) leveraged shorts – or bets against the tokens. The early move came on renewed hopes of a future stimulus for Chinese markets, which tends to move riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Trading firm QCP Capital said the move was similar to BTC's price action in 2016 and 2020 before the U.S. elections.  “If we look back to 2016, BTC traded in a very tight range for over 3 months,"" QCP traders said in a broadcast message. ""It wasn't until three weeks before U.S. Election day that BTC began its rally from $600 and finally doubling its price by the first week of January.”  “Similarly, in 2020, BTC was stuck in a boring range for half a year and only started rallying from $11K just three weeks before U.S. Election day, reaching a high of $42K by January,” they added.  “Today's rally has definitely given the market a glimmer of hope just as Uptober optimism was fading,” the traders said, referring to October’s historically bullish seasonality.  October has only twice ended in the red since 2013 - chalking gains of as high as 60% and an average of 22% to make it the best for investor returns. However, prices have largely remained stable in the past two weeks, denting investor hopes.

MSTR outperforms Bitcoin by leveraging debt to buy more Bitcoin, increasing shareholder value, but faces risks if Bitcoin enters a bear market. Bankruptcy is unlikely even if Bitcoin drops below $15,000; MSTR has several financing options to cover debts even if Bitcoin's price falls. Potential risks include regulatory changes, competition, internal issues, and Bitcoin's price not appreciating as expected, which could impact MSTR's strategy and stock value. Thesis Summary MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has staged a strong rally in the last month as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has broken back above $60,000. The company is well poised to benefit from higher Bitcoin prices and will continue to outperform the asset thanks to continued buys financed by debt. As long as Bitcoin keeps appreciating, MSTR will do fine, but eventually, Bitcoin will enter a bear market again, at which point MicroStrategy could be in big trouble. What's the bankruptcy threshold for MSTR? How will investor sentiment affect the share price? And is it possible MSTR will end up selling its Bitcoin? The latter seems quite unlikely, and even if the price of Bitcoin plummets, MicroStrategy has plenty of options to finance, and still has a successful software business too. The MSTR Rally MicroStrategy is making new ATHs with the stock closing in on $225 as I write this on October 14th. In my last report on MSTR, I discussed the company was a levered Bitcoin play, but warned investors about its inherent volatility. So, today we address exactly those concerns. MSTR Price (SA) The company has enjoyed a significant rally in the last month, outperforming Bitcoin by a significant margin, and even rallying as Bitcoin sold off in the last week. In other words, MSTR is increasing its Bitcoin premium, or its price defined in Bitcoin, as we can see in the chart below. MSTR/Bitcoin (TV) This is happening while Bitcoin has also appreciated over the last month, but MSTR is outperforming the cryptocurrency. Why MSTR Outperforms Bitcoin The reason MSTR outperforms Bitcoin is pretty straightforward. Though it may be oversimplified, I would call it a levered Bitcoin play. The company indebts itself using loans, and more recently convertible notes in order to buy Bitcoin. MicroStrategy currently has around $3.8 billion in long-term debt, while their stash of around 250,000 Bitcoin is worth around $15 billion. MSTR doesn’t just hold Bitcoin, it keeps buying it, which is why it actually has a Bitcoin yield. When you buy a share of MSTR, you also have a percentage of Bitcoin, and that percentage has increased throughout the year, specifically at a rate of 17.8%. And MSTR can keep buying Bitcoin very efficiently. Its latest convertible notes carry an interest of 0.62% though they will likely get converted into stock. However, even accounting for dilution, the company added Bitcoin value to shareholders. The question is, of course, what happens when Bitcoin enters another bear market? Can MSTR Go Bankrupt? A lot of people are under the impression that MicroStrategy will go bankrupt as soon as the Bitcoin market takes a dip, but that’s actually quite far from the truth. For starters, there’s no such thing as an impending margin call for MicroStrategy. The debt they have issued, right now, is not collateralized by Bitcoin. There was at one point a loan obtained from Silvergate Bank, which was backed by Bitcoin, but that has since been repaid. The most pressing “concern” now would be the $1.05 billion in convertible notes due in 2027, and then the $500 million due in 2028. MSTR Debt maturities (Investor slides) Of course, if the stock is above $143 (we have to adjust for the 10-1 split) the notes will be converted, so no problems there. So, first off, MSTR would have to be trading below $143, how could we get to that point? MSTR and Bitcoin price (TV) This doesn’t seem that unreasonable. MSTR was trading at below $140 in many instances when Bitcoin dipped below $60,000. So, if Bitcoin is below $60,000 by the time convertible notes are due this scenario could play out. What Then? The company would have to pay back its loans. At this point, the company could: Refinance with new convertible debt Refinance with a Bitcoin-secured loan Dilute shareholders Sell Bitcoin Based on Michael Saylor’s stated conviction in Bitcoin, it’s likely that he would not want to sell. He would likely have to raise more cash, and perhaps the most efficient way to do this would be with a Bitcoin-secured loan, which especially makes sense if you think Bitcoin is going to keep rising long-term. For a loan of $3.9 billion, which would cover all their long-term debt, at $60,000 BTC price, MSTR could raise the money with a 50% backed Bitcoin loan that would require 36,000 Bitcoin. Even if no one is willing to loan money to MSTR, which seems very unlikely, the price of Bitcoin would have to drop to below $15,600 for MSTR to enter negative book value territory. It would probably have to stay at those levels for a while too. Enter Game Theory Of course, the issue here is that market participants have foresight and investors would be preempting such a move from MSTR. If Bitcoin begins to fall anywhere near these levels, but perhaps much higher, like $40,000, then MSTR could be in trouble. At this point, the share price would no doubt begin to fall, and the Bitcoin premium could become a Bitcoin discount, as it becomes clear that the company will be forced to raise more cash. The worst-case scenario would, of course, be MSTR actually selling the Bitcoin, which would no doubt be the last thing Saylor would ever do. With over 1,2% of the supply in their hands, this would be a massive shock to the market, and even worsen the situation. Other Potential Problems There are also other potential problems the company could face. Regulation could be a potential risk, both in terms of somehow limiting Saylor’s ability to buy Bitcoin or his ability to finance his Bitcoin buys. Competition could also be an issue, as more companies begin to buy Bitcoin and apply this strategy, therefore diluting the MSTR premium, much like was the case with Grayscale ( GBTC ) MicroStrategy could even be subject to internal problems, and the board could turn against Saylor. And, of course, if Bitcoin’s price fails to appreciate at the pace it has in previous years as many expect, then the strategy would stop making sense, and MSTR would lose its appeal. My 2 Cents In order for MSTR to really face liquidity issues, a few things would have to happen. Either Bitcoin drops below $15,000 and stays there, making MSTR insolvent. Or, Bitcoin could drop enough to cause MSTR to need more financing. If MSTR were not able to secure the financing using its BTC as collateral, which is also a big if, then they would have to dilute, and this in turn would drive out investors en masse, and MSTR would begin to trade much closer to book value, or even below it. Does this seem likely? I am personally quite bullish on Bitcoin, as I wrote about here and I don’t think Bitcoin will drop back to $15,000. Furthermore, I think MSTR has enough financing options out there to secure the necessary funds to pay back its debts, even if Bitcoin is significantly lower than today, which could happen but is also unlikely. And yes, in that event, MSTR could eventually be forced to sell its Bitcoin, unravel its whole strategy and the stock could begin to trade below its book value. This is a real risk and bear in mind the company now trades at almost 15x book value. MSTR’s stock could absolutely plummet if Bitcoin fell, say 30% from here, based on the speculation and game theory reasoning laid out above. The volatility works both ways and once we add investor sentiment to that, we may see big moves both up and down. Nonetheless, I maintain a hold rating as I continue to be bullish on Bitcoin",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726640-micrstrategy-worst-case-scenario?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34697156.jpeg

This sudden price jump has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with data from Coinglass revealing a significant wave of liquidations following the unexpected rally. Short sellers, who were anticipating a decline, found themselves in a tough spot as Bitcoin defied their expectations. Notably, liquidation data from Coinglass shows that over $182 million worth of positions have been liquidated across various exchanges in the past 24 hours, with a majority being short positions. Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $64,000 Again Bitcoin rose above $64,000 in the early hours of Monday, October 14, after breaking above a tight range over the weekend and gaining 2.53% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin reached as high as $64,500 in the past few hours, which is its highest point so far in October. As such, the Bitcoin price has now crossed above its open for the month, with the October monthly return finally turning green for the first time. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 40 Million XRP In 48 Hours – Where’s The Price Headed? The price action, however, wasn’t as positive for everyone. According to the data shown in the picture below, the sudden rise has been costly for many traders holding short positions. Bears who bet on a continued decline were hit hard as Bitcoin’s continued rally triggered a wave of liquidations. Of the $182 million worth of liquidations recorded across various exchanges, a staggering $115.76 million came from short positions, while $66.28 million were from long positions. Binance has led the crypto exchange market in liquidations over the past 24 hours, accounting for 42.48% of the total liquidations. On Binance alone, approximately $77.33 million worth of positions were wiped out, with 54.23% being short positions. OKX follows closely, with $58.71 million in liquidations, where an even larger percentage of 62.84% were short positions. HTX, Bybit, and CoinEx also saw significant liquidations, though on a smaller scale. HTX recorded $27.35 million in liquidations, a staggering 87.81% of which were short positions. Bybit came next with $12.62 million in liquidations and a short rate of 65.92%, while CoinEx rounded out the list with $3.50 million liquidated, 81.34% of which was from shorts.

Bitcoin’s recent uptick brings back the possibility of a declining Uptober sentiment. This interesting rally could set the stage for a surge in the second half of October, similar to what was witnessed in September. If this rally were to continue for the rest of the month, we could see more short positions liquidated in the next few hours. Bears, who have been betting against Bitcoin’s rise, may rush to close their positions to minimize losses. The decrease in selling pressure from short sellers exiting the market could further fuel Bitcoin’s ascent.

However, the selling pressure eased, and BTC quickly rebounded, recovering to $64,500 as spot buying aggression returned. Notably, much of the early-week selling last week originated on Coinbase, as reflected in the Coinbase Premium Gap indicator , which dipped to -100 points before the price recovery. On-chain metrics highlight the importance of Bitcoin’s short-term holder realised price , currently near $63,000, as a key resistance level. Breaking above this level could signal further bullish momentum, while a failure to do so may lead to a retest of lower support levels, potentially near $59,000 or even $55,000. The market remains reactionary, with future movements likely dependent on whether Bitcoin can decisively pass the realised price of short-term holders. Until then, traders should anticipate potential corrections but also be prepared for a stronger recovery bounce from lower levels, given the underlying market resilience. The latest economic data revealed the ongoing cooling of inflation, with the Consumer Price Index rising just 0.2 percent in September, marking the slowest annual increase in over three years. This disinflation is largely driven by declines in energy and housing costs, though core inflation, led by the service sector, remains slightly elevated. Producer inflation remained steady in September, offering relief from broader inflationary pressures. Declines in energy prices helped keep producer costs flat, signalling that inflation may not escalate sharply in the near term. Businesses however are still responding cautiously to the still elevated interest rates, as slower inventory growth and heightened uncertainty reflect concerns over demand and financing costs. While small business optimism has slightly improved, businesses are focusing on efficiency to navigate the challenges posed by higher interest rates. Recent developments in the cryptocurrency industry show key movements in regulatory and market activities. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission is reconsidering its ban on local spot cryptocurrency ETFs and institutional crypto accounts, signalling a potential shift in the country’s crypto investment landscape. Meanwhile, Canary Capital has filed with the US SEC for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund , aimed at simplifying XRP investment for traditional brokerage users by eliminating the need for direct crypto management. In other news, the Mt. Gox trustee has extended the repayment deadline for creditors to October 31, 2025, due to procedural delays. This postponement eases market concerns over a potential Bitcoin sell-off, as many feared that creditors might liquidate some of the 44,900 BTC set to be distributed, which could have pressured Bitcoin prices.

34694465,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647838,1728909025,Why Isn’t XRP Price Moving? Crypto Pundit Claims The Answer,"XRP has been one of the underperformers in the current crypto market cycle, remaining approximately 86% below its all-time high of $3.84 reached on January 4, 2018. Remarkably, despite significant fluctuations in the meantime, XRP is trading at a price similar to where it was one two years ago in October 2022. Crypto pundit known as CryptoTank (@Tank2033js) shared an explanation on X to clarify why the XRP price isn’t moving as some might anticipate. With 214,000 views, the thread gained a lot of attention. Why Is XRP Price Stagnating? When Will It Change? “I’m getting a lot of comments about XRP price and why it’s not moving,” began CryptoTank. “Let me explain once more how XRP price is determined for the new people to this space and those that still have trouble understanding.” According to his analysis, the price of XRP is calculated by dividing the value or volume transacted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) by the circulating supply of XRP. However, he emphasizes that the commonly referenced circulating supply figure of approximately 56 billion XRP is misleading. “Just because 56 billion is in circulation, it does not mean that the whole 56 billion is on the ledger for use,” he noted. A significant portion of XRP is held in private wallets, by large holders known as “whales,” or stored on exchanges, and thus not actively participating in daily transactions on the ledger. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? “What matters for price is how much of that supply is active on the ledger,” he asserts. Estimating that about 20% of the circulating supply is active daily, he suggests that around 10 billion XRP are in use within the ledger’s ecosystem. This active supply is crucial for providing liquidity in Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools, which facilitate transactions by pairing XRP with other tokens or currencies such as RLUSD (Ripple USD). He explains that banks and financial institutions planning to use the XRPL for settlements will operate with their own tokens or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), pairing them with RLUSD and utilizing the liquidity available in the AMM pools. The XRPL employs an algorithm designed to find the most efficient path for settlements, defaulting to XRP as the primary source unless an alternative offers a better route. “This algorithm uses XRP as the default source of settlement and will only use something else if it’s better than XRP, which most likely won’t be the case,” he elaborates. To illustrate the potential magnitude of value transacted on the ledger, CryptoTank highlighted the daily settlement volumes of several major financial institutions. SWIFT, the global provider of secure financial messaging services, processes approximately $5 trillion in daily settlements. J.P. Morgan Chase, one of the largest banking institutions in the United States, handles around $10 trillion daily. Bank of America processes about $7 to $8 trillion each day, and SBI Holdings in Japan settles approximately $2 trillion daily. “That’s about $25 trillion daily in settlement with just four banks/institutions,” he points out. Moreover, Ripple, the company behind XRP, reportedly has over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with various banks and financial institutions, suggesting a vast network of potential users for the XRPL. By conservatively assuming that only 10% of the settlement volume from these four institutions moves onto the XRPL, he estimated an on-ledger transaction volume of $2.5 trillion daily. To ensure smooth and frictionless transactions without failures—a critical requirement for banks—the liquidity in the AMM pools would need to be substantial. “These pools have to be about double the $2.5 trillion value to avoid failed transactions and friction within the pools. Banks cannot have failed transactions,” he stressed. This means that the total value or volume on the ledger would need to be approximately $5 trillion to accommodate the settlements efficiently. Related Reading: XRP Could Surge To $60 Overnight Using SWIFT Model, Expert Says Using these figures, he calculates the necessary price of XRP to facilitate this level of daily settlement. “To determine the price XRP needs to be to avoid friction and have deep enough liquidity pools to settle without failure between different currencies or CBDCs, you take the $5 trillion and divide it by the 10 billion of XRP in the pools,” he explains. This calculation yields a required XRP price of $500. “XRP’s price would need to be $500 to facilitate settlement daily,” he emphasizes. “This is a very basic example of what will happen when these banks start using XRP daily for settlement,” he adds. He acknowledged that other factors could further enhance the value on the ledger, such as the tokenization of assets, debt, and real estate. “There are other factors like tokenized assets, tokenized debt, tokenized real estate, etc., that will all add value to the ledger in the future,” he notes. Addressing skeptics who doubt the potential for XRP to reach such high valuations, he states: “For anyone saying XRP will never be a high price, you really don’t understand what XRP is going to be used for or how it works. Retail doesn’t matter, market cap doesn’t matter, charts are nice to look at but don’t matter either.” He argues that traditional metrics used to assess cryptocurrency value are less relevant in the context of XRP’s intended utility for institutional settlements. “You can’t chart how much liquidity or depth of AMM pools will be needed to handle the settlement of those 1,700+ NDAs on a daily basis,” he contends. “Nobody has any clue how high that number will be. XRP must be a high price or it won’t work efficiently to do what it was designed to do, which is handle large transactions fast and cheap.” However, not everyone in the crypto community agrees with his assessment. A user representing chart analysts on X responded to his thread, stating: “Wrong: The chart is the only thing that matters. Buy coins based on chart technical analysis and you do a lot better than buying narratives and hoping for it to pump. That’s why 99% of retail fails. Sad but true.” In response, CryptoTank defended his position, emphasizing the impending shift in the crypto landscape due to institutional adoption. “You clearly have no idea how utility tokens work or what is about to take place globally in this space,” he retorted. “Soon retail speculation will be dwarfed by institutional adoption and usage. 99% of coins will become obsolete. The big money is coming into the game and everything will change.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.542.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,011.66 +2.75%  Bitcoin (BTC): $64,872.86 +3.49%  Ether (ETH): $2,542.66 +3.27%  S&P 500: 5,815.03 +0.61%  Gold: $2,656.08 +0.28%  Nikkei 225: 39,605.80 +0.57%  Top Stories  Bitcoin moved to near $65,000 after Chinese stocks shrugged off mixed reactions to stimulus plans to finish the day higher. BTC traded at nearly $64,900 during the late European morning, over 3.4% higher in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has risen about 2.9%. Latest announcements from the Chinese government regarding stimulus plans fell short of expectations, but the Shanghai Composite Index still closed the day over 2% higher. “Chinese equities rebounded off the weekend disappointments, so risk sentiment will likely remain in 'buy everything' mode until further notice,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  Nearly $500 million worth of various tokens will be freed this week, potentially creating downward pressure on prices. Over $80 million in Worldcoin's WLD, $51 million in Arbitrum's ARB, and nearly $40 million each of Eigenlayer's EIGEN and Axis Infinity's AXS are set to be released in the next week. Solana's SOL will see $80 million worth unlocked as part of an ongoing ""linear"" plan, where tokens are emitted and absorbed by the market. The anticipation of investors or traders expecting recipients to sell their tokens can lead to a preemptive sell-off. However, if the market perceives the unlock as a sign of project progress or the tokens are expected to be used for staking governance, the price might remain stable or increase due to positive sentiment.  Investment firm Samara Asset Group will issue an up to 30 million euro ($32.78 million) bond to buy bitcoin. The bond will be used to expand Samara's diversified portfolio, which includes buying additional stakes in alternative investment funds and increasing its bitcoin holdings. Patrik Lowry, CEO of Samara, emphasized the importance of the bond, saying, ""The proceeds will allow Samara to further expand and solidify its already robust balance sheet as we diversify into new emerging technologies through new fund investments. With Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset, we also enhance our liquidity position with bond proceeds.” Samara Asset Group's share price was up over 6% at 2.04 euros on Monday.  Chart of the Day  The annualized three-month BTC futures basis, or the gap between prices for futures and spot prices, is nearing 10% for the first time in nearly two months.  Its a sign of renewed bullish sentiment and may attract arbitrage flows to the market.

Solv Protocol's SolvBTC product has more than 20,000 BTC staked ($1.3 billion) deployed across 10 major blockchain networks, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Monday.  Various Bitcoin staking platforms and protocols have emerged in recent years aiming to tap the potential of the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of capital held in BTC, putting it to work on other networks.  Staking refers to offering up digital assets to help finance the operation of a blockchain network and in return for rewards such as yield. In this sense, it is similar to receiving interest on the balance of one's bank account.  Fellow Bitcoin staking platform Babylon has drawn over $1.5 billion worth of staked BTC across two rounds totaling a little over two and a half hours, demonstrating the considerable demand for such services. This does however remain well below some staking plaforms on Ethereum, such as Lido, with $23.7 billion of collateral, or EigenLayer at $10.9 billion.  “With a market cap over $1.2 trillion, bitcoin holds huge opportunities for growth,"" Solv's co-founder Ryan Chow said in the announcement.

34692165,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647811,1728903613,Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price?,"TRON (TRX) recently garnered attention by incinerating over 10 million tokens, demonstrating its dedication to a deflationary approach intended to enhance its value. Currently, TRX is trading at roughly $0.1605, indicating a small increase. Related Reading: Uniswap: New Crypto Developments Lift UNI Price Up by 17% – Details Analysts express optimism on TRON’s future, forecasting a 57% price increase during the next three months, and an even more remarkable 208% rise over six months, figures from CoinCheckup show. This optimistic perspective indicates that TRX may be poised for a substantial upward trajectory in the cryptocurrency market. A Robust Technical Foundation The technical indicators for TRX are converging towards a positive sentiment. The price chart demonstrates a modest upward trend, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently at 57.58. This statistic indicates that TRX is approaching overbought area, however there still potential for more gains. The Stochastic indicator, currently at 66.63, reinforces this bullish perspective by demonstrating momentum without indicating imminent exhaustion. Collectively, these factors suggest that TRX may sustain its upward trend in the short future, rendering it an appealing opportunity for investors. Increasing Enthusiasm For TRON Alongside the token burn, TRON has had a decent increase in daily active addresses, indicating a growing investor interest, data from IntoTheBlock shows. Although the general trend seems constant, this minor uptick suggests that more people are entering the market. This increasing participation may enhance the token’s upward trajectory, particularly when coupled with the current deflationary strategies. As TRON endeavors to diminish its circulating supply, these elements may establish a foundation for heightened prices. Market Sentiment And Trading Conduct Despite the positive statistics, traders remain extremely cautious. The Long/Short Ratio shows shorts slightly outstrip longs with 54% shorts and 46% of longs. This is a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude by traders while awaiting a possible volatility in the price movement of TRX. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could Surge 340%, Echoing Its 2021 Bull Run Peak — Analyst The TRX OI-Weighted Funding Rate is at approximately 0. That means that the balance of longs to shorts is neutral, and hence it may also reflect positively on market sentiment pending short-term variability for TRX’s price. Recent burning of tokens by TRON and the steady increase in active addresses can boost the momentum TRX needs to post solid growth rates for the next couple of months. Technical indicators depict a positive trend and solid price projections, which shows TRX will gain substantially in the short term.

34689694,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647815,1728898202,WIF Bulls Charge Toward $2.89 As Key Resistance Test Looms,"Recent trading activity reveals that WIF is gaining bullish momentum, with its price surging toward the critical $2.89 resistance level. After a brief pullback, buyers are stepping in, driving the asset higher and setting the stage for a potential breakout. A successful break could open the door to new gains, further reinforcing the positive sentiment in the market. As the price approaches this crucial level, the goal of this analysis is to determine whether WIF can sustain its upward strength and break through the $2.89 resistance. By evaluating key technical indicators, price trends, and market sentiment, this review will delve into the possible outcomes of this pivotal test, assessing the likelihood of either a continued rally or a possible pullback. Current Price Momentum: WIF Push Toward $2.89 WIF is exhibiting strong bullish momentum following a recovery from the $2.6 support level. By consistently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the cryptocurrency indicates that buyers are firmly in control, reflecting a strengthening trend. Maintaining this position could enhance optimistic sentiment and generate the push necessary to challenge higher resistance levels, particularly the $2.89 mark. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a renewed upbeat potential, with the RSI climbing back to 62% after dipping to 50%. If the RSI continues to rise, it could point to further gains for WIF, as the asset regains strength and attracts more bullish traders aiming to push the price toward key resistance zones. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential Furthermore, the daily chart indicates that WIF is under significant upward pressure, marked by a bullish candlestick formation after rebounding from $2.6 and trading above the 100-day SMA. This suggests strong buyer activity, positioning the meme coin to challenge the critical resistance level of $2.89. Also, the RSI on the daily chart currently stands at 66%, comfortably above the 50% threshold, indicating a positive shift in momentum for WIF. A sustained position above 50% generally signifies that buyers are in control. If this pressure continues, it could lead to more price appreciation as traders remain optimistic about the asset’s potential to break through key resistance levels. Potential Outcomes: Rally Continuation Or Pullback? A continuation of the current rally could see WIF breaking above the $2.89 resistance, paving the way for further gains and possibly reaching new highs. This scenario is supported by the positive momentum indicated by the RSI and the price’s position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average. Related Reading: Is DogWifHat (WIF) The “Most Bearish” Of All Major Meme Coins? Should WIF fail to break through the $2.89 resistance, it could face a pullback toward the $2.2 support level.

42407392,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwrA,1728896090,Crypto Neobank Banq's Bankruptcy Case Dismissed by U.S. Judge,"Banq, which filed for bankruptcy last year, had its application dismissed by a U.S. judge who found the application was made to shield the company and its executives from ongoing litigation by a creditor.  Banq and its chair Jon Jiles are being sued by creditor N9 over allegations Jiles failed to uphold his fiduciary duties.  Crypto neobank Banq, which filed for Chapter 11 in a U.S. bankruptcy court in the district of Nevada, has had its application rejected.  The bank's bankruptcy application was called a ""bad faith"" tactic to “gain an advantage in pending litigation” and not to reorganize by Judge Natalie M. Cox, who presided over the case.  Judge Cox wrote in her ruling that this bankruptcy proceeding was a ploy to shield Banq and its founder, Jon Jiles, from an investor lawsuit launched by N9 – a major creditor in the company with a $3 million stake – which alleges Jiles failed to uphold his fiduciary duties by prioritizing Prime Trust's interests (where he was founder and managing member) over Banq’s.  ""Jiles quickly showed that his loyalty belonged to Prime Trust, not Banq,"" the N9 lawsuit reads.  N9's lawsuit also alleges that Jiles, in his capacity as Banq's chair, failed to create a non-compete agreement with former Banq CEO Scott Purcell, instead only putting one in place between Purcell and Prime Trust. N9 claims in the lawsuit that Jiles leveraged his control over Banq to benefit Prime Trust, prioritizing its interests and leading to Banq's downfall.  Banq is suing Purcell after he allegedly shifted the company's focus from crypto payments to NFTs before transferring $17.5 million in assets and technology to a competitor he founded called Fortress NFT Group, which is a central part of its bankruptcy claims.  In her ruling, Judge Cox wrote that Banq's bankruptcy plan was not a legitimate business reorganization because the firm had no sources of revenue. Instead, the company's business operations ""relate almost exclusively"" to pursuing litigation against Purcell.  “It is apparent from the totality of the circumstances that Debtor’s actual purpose in filing this case is not to successfully reorganize,” Cox wrote, noting that Jiles had funded the bankruptcy proceedings with a $225,000 loan through his company NVF LLC.  The case, Cox wrote, was designed to obstruct the ability for N9 to go after Jiles for breach of fiduciary duty.  ""In essence, this case appears to be filed as a litigation tactic to advance the self-interest of the Jiles parties,"" the filing reads.  Instead, Cox wrote, this case is a dispute between Banq, Purcell, and Jiles – not a bankruptcy.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/14/crypto-neobank-banqs-bankruptcy-case-dismissed-by-us-judge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a68a6e2b635c9286230b05008f54a14dbcf33cb-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407373,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwQi,1728894416,Altcoin Selling Pressure Looms as $500M in Token Unlocks Scheduled This Week,"Approximately $500 million in various cryptocurrencies are scheduled for unlock, potentially impacting their market due to increased supply.  The unlocked tokens will be distributed to team members and investors for ecosystem development, with some, like WLD, facing a 7% supply increase.  Historical data suggests that significant price changes might occur on average two weeks after the unlock.  Nearly $500 million worth of various tokens will be freed to investors, teams, and ecosystem advisors this week, potentially creating downward pressure on prices for these digital assets.  Over $80 million in Worldcoin's WLD, $51 million in Arbitrum's ARB, and nearly $40 million each of Eigenlayer's EIGEN and Axis Infinity's AXS are set to be released in the next seven days, TokenUnlocks data shows.  The 37 million WLD emission, representing the rate at which new tokens are created over time, will increase the token supply by 7%. The tokens will be distributed to team members, advisors, and investors. Initially, these early contributors' WLD tokens were intended to be subject to a three-year lock-up schedule, which was extended to a five-year schedule in July.  Layer 2 network Taiko's $18 million unlock will be the most by supply at 15% of its total.  Of the total $500 million in unlocks, the following tokens with a market value of $200 million will be released as a ""cliff"" - or a colloquial term for a large number of tokens released in one go.  $ARB (2.56%) - $48.97 million  $EIGEN (6.01%) - $41.40 million  $AXS (6.08%) - $41.55 million  $STRK (3.30%) - $25.00 million  $TAIKO (15.00%) - $18.24 million  $APE (2.31%) - $10.86 million  $PIXEL (7.05%) - $6.80 million  Solana's SOL will see $80 million worth unlocked as part of an ongoing ""linear"" plan, where tokens are emitted and absorbed by the market.  Unlocks increase the total available supply of a certain token but don’t necessarily hit the open market immediately.  The anticipation of investors or traders expecting token receivers to sell their newly unlocked tokens can lead to a preemptive sell-off, reducing the token price before or as the tokens are unlocked.  A 2023 research from TheTie suggests most losses from unlocks typically arise after an average of two weeks from the event.  However, if the market perceives the unlock as a sign of project progress or the tokens are expected to be used for staking governance or other utility purposes that do not involve immediate selling, the price might remain stable or increase due to positive sentiment.",NEGATIVE,WLD,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WLD,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/altcoin-selling-pressure-looms-as-500m-in-token-unlocks-scheduled-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8039d96c079b23f02082947834f016b01a4f296-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407372,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwNP,1728893895,"Trump's New Administration Would Support Strong Dollar, Economic Advisor Says","A potential Trump administration is unlikely to devalue the dollar deliberately, Trump's go-to man on economics Scott Bessent told Financial Times.  Trump's inflationary-imports tariffs plan will be eventually watered down, Bessent added.  A new U.S. government potentially headed by Donald Trump would support a strong dollar in line with the U.S.' multi-decade policy, Trump's go-to-economic advisor Scott Bessent told Financial Times (FT) on Sunday, downplaying concerns of dollar devaluation under Trump's presidency.  With Election Day fast approaching on Nov. 5, Democrat Kamala Harris is losing ground to supposedly pro-crypto Republican Donald Trump in Polymarket's prediction markets. Early this year, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, called for a weaker dollar to boost manufacturing.  However, Bessent told FT that he doesn't expect Trump to deliberately devalue the USD, stand by the USD as a ""reserve currency."" Devaluation refers to deliberately depreciating the home currency's exchange rate to boost exports.  ""The reserve currency can go up and down based on the market. I believe that if you have good economic policies, you're naturally going to have a strong dollar,"" Bessent added, cautioning he is not speaking for Trump.  In other words, the potential Trump presidency, though expected to be positive for digital assets, could be characterized by a resilient dollar, which often caps gains in riskier dollar-denominated assets like cryptocurrencies.  South Carolina-based Bessent is the founder of George Soros-seeded global macro investment firm Key Square Group. He is known for making big bucks by betting against the Japanese yen while working as a chief investment officer at Soros' family office from 2011-2015.  Trump has recently described Bessent as ""one of the most brilliant men on Wall Street"" who is ""respected by everybody"" and a ""nice-looking guy."" The ex-Soros star is purportedly on Trump's shortlist for the Treasury Secretary position.  Bessent also defended Trump's intention to impose across-the-board inflationary tariffs of up to 20% on all imported goods, saying these ""extreme positions"" will be eventually watered down during discussions with trading partners.  ""My general view is that at the end of the day, he's a free trader,"" Bessent told FT. ""It's escalate to de-escalate.""  During the interview, Bessent said Trump is a businessman who understands the economy while calling Trump's rival Kamala Harris ""an economic illiterate and her running mate Tim Walz ""twice as illiterate.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/trumps-new-administration-would-support-strong-dollar-economic-advisor-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/130f29ee3f8de9b6c6ffa066a914414940ef7f2e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34687294,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647804,1728892806,"Bad Decisions By Ethereum Foundation Hurt ETH Price, Hedge Fund CIO Says","Zaheer Ebtikar, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and founder of Split Capital—a hedge fund specializing in liquid token investments—has attributed the Ethereum underperformance over the last months to strategic missteps by the Ethereum Foundation and structural shifts in crypto capital flows. In an analysis shared via X (formerly Twitter), Ebtikar writes, “Independent of the myriad of (probable) bad decisions that the ETH foundation & co have made there’s another structural reason why ETH has traded like a dog this cycle.” Why Is The Ethereum Price Lagging Behind? Ebtikar began by emphasizing the importance of understanding capital flows within the crypto market. He identified three primary sources of capital flow: retail investors who engage directly through platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Bybit; private capital from liquid and venture funds; and institutional investors who invest directly through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and futures. However, he noted that retail investors are “hardest to quantify” and are “not fully present in the market today,” thus excluding them from his analysis. Focusing on private capital, Ebtikar highlighted that in 2021, this segment was the largest capital base, driven by crypto euphoria that attracted more than $20 billion in net new inflows. “Fast forward to today, private capital is no longer the heavy hitter capital base as ETFs and other traditional vehicles have taken the role of the largest net new buyer of crypto,” he stated. He attributed this decline to a series of poor venture investments and overhang from prior cycles, which have “left a bad taste in the mouths of LPs.” These venture firms and liquid funds recognized that they couldn’t wait out another cycle and needed to be more proactive. They began taking more “shots on target” for liquid plays, often through private deals involving locked tokens such as Solana (SOL), Celestia (TIA), and Toncoin (TON). “These locked deals also represented something more interesting for a lot of firms—there’s a world outside of Ethereum-based investing that is actually growing and usable and has enough market cap growth relative to ETH that could justify the underwriting of the investment,” Ebtikar explained. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Score Signals Cooling Market Momentum – Time To Buy? He noted that investors were aware it would be increasingly difficult to raise funds for venture and liquid investments. Without the return of retail capital, institutional products became the only viable avenue for a bid for ETH. Mindshare began fragmenting as the three-year mark of the 2021 vintage approached, and products like BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) gained legitimacy as the de facto benchmark for crypto. Private capital had to make a choice: “Abandon their core portfolio hold in ETH and move down the risk curve or hold your breath for traditional players to start bailing you out.” This led to the formation of two camps. The first consisted of pre-ETF ETH sellers between January and May 2024, who opted out of ETH and swapped to assets like SOL. The second group, post-ETF ETH sellers from June to September 2024, realized that ETF flows into ETH were lackluster and that it would take much more for ETH’s price to gain support. “They understood that the ETF flows were lackluster and it would take a lot more for ETH price to begin being supportive,” Ebtikar noted. Turning his attention to institutional capital, Ebtikar observed that when spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BITW entered the market, they exceeded expectations. “These products broke any realistic target investors and experts could’ve fathomed with their success,” he stated. He emphasized that Bitcoin ETFs have become some of the most successful ETF products in history. “BTC went from being a dog in the average portfolio to now the only funnel for net new capital in crypto and at a record rate too,” he said. Despite Bitcoin’s surge, the rest of the market didn’t keep up. Ebtikar questioned why this was the case, pointing out that crypto-native investors, retail, and private capital had long since reduced their Bitcoin holdings. Instead, they were “stuck in altcoins and Ethereum as the core of their portfolio.” Consequently, when Bitcoin received its institutional bid, few in the crypto space benefited from the new wealth effect. “Few in crypto were beneficiaries of the newly made wealth effect,” he remarked. Investors began to reassess their portfolios, struggling to decide their next moves. Historically, crypto capital would cycle from index assets like Bitcoin to Ethereum and then down the risk curve to altcoins. However, traders speculated on potential flows into Ethereum and similar assets but were “broadly wrong.” The market started to diverge, and the dispersion between asset returns intensified. Professional crypto investors and traders moved aggressively down the risk curve, and funds followed suit to generate returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces ‘Sell-Off Risk’ If It Loses $2,300 Resistance – Analyst The asset they chose to reduce exposure to was Ethereum—the largest asset in their core portfolios. “Slowly but surely ETH started losing steam to SOL and similar, and a non-trivial percentage of this flow started really moving downstream to memecoins,” Ebtikar observed. “ETH lost its moat in crypto-savvy investors, the only group of investors who were historically interested in buying.” Even with the introduction of spot ETH ETFs, institutional capital paid little attention to Ethereum. Ebtikar described Ethereum’s predicament as suffering from “middle-child syndrome.” He elaborated, “The asset is not in vogue with institutional investors, the asset lost favor in crypto private capital circles, and retail is nowhere to be seen bidding anything at this size.” He emphasized that Ethereum is too large for native capital to support while other index assets like SOL and large caps like TIA, TAO, and SUI are capturing investor attention. According to Ebtikar, the only way forward is to expand the universe of potentially interested investors, which can only happen at the institutional level. “ETH’s best odds of making a material comeback (short of changes to the core protocol’s trajectory) is to have institutional investors pick up the asset in the coming months,” he suggested. He acknowledged that while Ethereum faces significant challenges, it is “the only other asset with an ETF and likely will be for some time.” This unique position offers a potential avenue for recovery. Ebtikar mentioned several factors that could influence Ethereum’s future trajectory. He cited the possibility of a Trump presidency, which could bring changes to regulatory frameworks affecting cryptocurrency. He also pointed to potential shifts in the Ethereum Foundation’s direction and core focus, suggesting that strategic changes could reinvigorate investor interest. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of marketing the ETH ETF by traditional asset managers to attract institutional capital. “Considering the possibility of a Trump Presidency, change at the Ethereum Foundation’s direction and core focus, and marketing of the ETH ETF by traditional asset managers, there are quite a few outs for the father of smart contracting platforms,” Ebtikar remarked. He expressed cautious optimism, stating that not all hope is lost for Ethereum. Looking ahead to 2025, Ebtikar believes it will be a critical year for cryptocurrency and especially for Ethereum. “2025 will very much be an interesting year for crypto and especially for Ethereum as so much of the damage from 2024 can be unwound or further deepened,” he concluded. “Time will tell.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,534.

Over $100 million in short positions were liquidated due to the price jump. Memecoins like Mog and SPX6900 saw significant gains amidst discussions of a crypto ""supercycle.""  Broader market sentiment leaned towards buying due to positive economic indicators from both China and the U.S., with U.S. equities reaching new highs.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} jumped above $64,000 in Asian hours Monday on the back of renewed hopes of a China stimulus and increased demand in certain bitcoin-based assets, leading a crypto majors move higher.  BTC added 2% in the past 24 hours, data shows, with majors ether {{ETH}}, Solana’s SOL rising 3%. XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB remained flat. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid fund tracking the biggest tokens, rose 2.19%.  Over $100 million in shorts - or bets against higher prices - were liquidated on the move, CoinGlass data shows.  Some memecoins dominated weekend price action as talks of a “supercycle” continued among traders. Mog (MOG) extended seven-day gains to nearly 20%, while SPX6900 - a parody of the S&P500 index - extended gains to 135%. A CoinGecko tracker shows Bitcoin-based memecoins and Runes - a protocol for assets on the blockchain - jumped as much as 10% over the weekend to extended weekly gains above 100% but pared gains in the past 24 hours.  Interest in memecoins comes amid low market volatility in more serious crypto sectors, such as layer-2s or storage, and rising negative sentiment around tokens backed by venture capital funds – which are increasingly perceived as overpriced and a bad bet for retail traders.  BTC’s move higher came as Chinese stocks ended the morning session higher, buoyed by renewed stimulus hopes. Per Bloomberg, finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised new steps to support the property sector and hinted at greater government borrowing at a Saturday briefing.  However, the announcement fell short of expectations and suggested a low probability of continued outflows into China-linked assets.  “Bitcoin prices did manage to jump this morning to above $64K as Chinese equities rebounded off the weekend disappointments, so risk sentiment will likely remain in 'buy everything' mode until further notice,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “A strong BTC inflow on Friday might be a positive sign of things to come as we head into the final weeks of the election campaign, but patience will likely be required before we can make new ATHs anytime soon,” Fan said, referring to the U.S. elections scheduled for November 5.  U.S. markets saw relatively firmer data last week, with both CPI and PPI on the stronger side. Markets were initially confused by the data impact but ultimately decided that the 'core' inflation trend remained intact, and the curve steepening move continued.  U.S. equities made new all-time highs, with high beta names and the dollar breaking out further, as markets continue to expect an over 85% chance of a 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve in December.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL | BNB,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/bitcoin-begins-the-week-on-a-high-jumps-above-64k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6278a94fc428c4d7dec283d8c3bcc8039b88edc8-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407395,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGxHc,1728885546,"BTC's Trendline Breakout Exposes $70K Hurdle, ETH Holds 200-Day Average","BTC blows past the downtrend line from late September highs, with $62,000 as key support.  The dollar rally may be peaking.  Ether's triangular consolidation continues.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} positive price action during Monday's Asia session suggests a strong possibility that the steep upward move that began at around $54,000 in early September is about to resume.  BTC has risen over 2% to $64,300 in Asia, blasting past a trendline resistance off late Sept. 27 and Oct. 7 highs. The trendline represented a pullback characterized by a stimulus-led sharp upswing in oversold Chinese stocks and the strength in the dollar index.  The trendline breakout, therefore, indicates the mini price swoon has ended and the upswing from September lows under $54,000 has resumed.  The immediate resistance is seen at $64,461, from where prices turned lower on Oct. 7, followed by the late September high above $66,500. A major piece of resistance would be around $70,000, where the battle between bulls and bears has been most intense since March, with bulls constantly failing to secure a foothold.  Note that re-test of breakout points is a common phenomenon, meaning prices could revisit the $62,000-$63,000 range before continuing to move higher. That said, a move below $62,000 would negate the bullish view, potentially bringing deeper losses below $60,000.  The dollar index's rise has stalled near 103.00, supports the case for a move higher in risk assets, including BTC. The DXY formed a doji candle on Thursday, signaling indecision among traders. The dollar has held well within Thursday's trading range, teasing a potential end to the rally from late September lows near 100.  A doji candle forms when an asset moves in both directions only to end the period on a flat note, indicating a lack of willingness among bulls and bears to lead the price action. The indecision after a notable upswing can represent potential trend reversal.  ""The momentum indicators have been stretched by the greenback's strong recovery this month. We are anticipating technical evidence to suggest the dollar is peaking,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of “Making Sense of the Dollar, said in a market update.  Ether stuck in a triangle  Ether {{ETH}} bounced off the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) early today but continues to trade within the confines of a triangular consolidation pattern, identified by trendlines connecting Aug. 24 and Sept. 27 highs and Aug. 5 and Sept. 6 lows.  With BTC teasing a bull move, ether could look to break out of the triangle, exposing the next resistance at $2,770, the April 13 low from where prices surged back to nearly $4,000.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/crypto-chart-scan-btcs-uptrend-from-54k-looks-set-to-resume-eth-holds-200-day-average,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/092a95fd3f5c0083035bffe63164a152699b63fb-5593x3729.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP price is attempting a fresh increase above the $0.5320 support. The price is now trading above $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5310 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP Price Holds Key Support XRP price remained stable above the $0.5240 support. A base was formed and the price started a fresh increase above $0.5350 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price climbed above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5430 swing high to the $0.5252 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5310 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5390 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5430 swing high to the $0.5252 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5400 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5680 resistance or even $0.5750 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.600, where the bears might emerge. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.540 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5340 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $0.5280 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5280 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5250 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5120 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5340 and $0.5280.

USDe is unique insofar that it maintains $1 peg with collateral, hedged trades, and risk-managed reserves.  Ethena Labs, the entity responsible for developing and maintaining USDe, has proposed bringing onboard {{SOL}} as part of the synthetic stablecoin's mix of collateral that forms its treasury.  USDe differs from stablecoins such as Tether's {{USDT}} or Circle's {{USDC}} because it's a synthetic stablecoin and not backed by fiat assets at a 1:1 ratio. The stablecoin maintains its $1 peg by collateralizing stablecoins and leveraging a hedged cash-and-carry trade, which involves taking futures positions with large open interest available to stabilize value, supported by a reserve fund to manage risk in fluctuating market conditions.  If the proposal is approved by Ethena's Risk Committee – which is independent of Ethena Labs – SOL will be gradually integrated as a collateral asset for USDe, with an initial allocation target of $100-200 million in SOL positions. This initial allocation would represent roughly 5-10% of SOL's open interest, similar to its 3% stake in BTC's global open interest and 9% in ETH.  The proposal also considers using liquid staking tokens (LSTs) like BNSOL and bbSOL, similar to how Ethena utilizes ETH LSTs, which currently represent one-third of its ETH allocation.  Recently, Ethena announced that it had allocated $46 million of its reserve fund for USDe to tokenized real-world asset investments in BlackRock's BUIDL, Mountain's USDM, Superstate's USTB, and Sky's USDS, aligning with DeFi's trend toward yield generation from asset-backed tokens.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL | USDT,ETH | FIAT | SOL | USDT | ENA,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/14/ethena-labs-proposes-sol-for-usdes-collateral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/702730e4ed668bcc718e4d157fa118466a343f8b-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $63,200 level. A clear move above the $63,200 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $63,500. A close above the $63,200 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $64,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $65,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $63,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,250 level. The first major support is near the $62,000 level. The next support is now near the $61,150 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $58,888 swing low to the $63,445 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $62,000, followed by $61,150.
