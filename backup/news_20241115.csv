Gensler: 18 States File Lawsuit Against SEC Over Alleged Industry Persecution,"For months, the cryptocurrency community has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Chairman, Gary Gensler. Gensler‚Äôs aggressive regulatory approach has irked many in the industry, particularly the Ripple executives. Today, critics are taking Gensler to court over what they claim as the agency‚Äôs ‚Äúgross government overreach.‚Äù Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor According to Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business, 18 states are already frustrated with Gensler‚Äôs management style, affecting the crypto industry.

Lawsuit Argues That Gensler Is ‚ÄòOverstepping His Authority‚Äô The states‚Äô lawsuit reflects the growing discontent over Gensler‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation. According to Attorney General Coleman, the agency is trying to remove the regulatory authority away from states on cryptocurrency enforcement. üö®SCOOP: 18 U.S. states have filed to sue the @SECGov and its commissioners, accusing them of unconstitutional overreach and unfair persecution of the #crypto industry under the leadership of agency chief @GaryGensler. The lawsuit, signed by 18 Republican Attorneys General,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/wxOovuIRQH ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 14, 2024 Gensler‚Äôs ‚Äúregulation by enforcement‚Äù removes the states‚Äô control over regulation and deprives them of the opportunity to define their economic policies. The attorneys further explained that the agency‚Äôs crypto crackdown is intense, aggressive, and far removed from its original mandate. According to the petitioners, Gensler‚Äôs management style is more about control than upholding the law or protecting consumers. The lawsuit aims to stop Gensler from aggressively attacking the industry and instead create clear and established rules for stakeholders. Gensler‚Äôs Long-Running Feud With Crypto The crypto industry currently sees Gensler as its enemy. Immediately after becoming SEC chief, Gensler led investigations and inquiries against the most prominent crypto companies. He has consistently argued that many companies work in ‚Äúlegal gray zones.‚Äù Ripple Labs, the developer of XRP, has a long-running feud with the SEC over the sale of its digital token. The regulator has argued that the company broke the law by selling tokens (XRP) without registering these as securities. Last year, Ripple Labs scored a court victory when US district judge Analisa Torres found Ripple‚Äôs XRP was covered by the country‚Äôs securities law when marketed to institutional investors.

Gensler Responds To Crypto-Related Issues Gary Gensler recently broke his silence and defended his record as Chairman of the SEC during remarks made last Thursday. He emphasized that courts have consistently supported the agency‚Äôs actions aimed at protecting investors, rejecting claims that the SEC lacks the authority to enforce securities laws. However, with Republican Donald Trump winning the selections, Gensler may have a few options left. Trump has consistently signaled his support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and promised to replace him as SEC chair once he starts work in the Oval Office.

36366383,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653258,1731709840,Major Hindrances To Dogecoin Price Hitting $1 According To This Crypto Analyst,"A crypto analyst, identified as ‚ÄòTrading Jesus‚Äô on X (formerly Twitter), unveiled the roadmap for the Dogecoin price to reach $1. By highlighting Dogecoin‚Äôs resistance and support levels, the analyst has underscored the major hindrance to the meme coin hitting the $1 milestone. Dogecoin Price Roadmap To The $1 Target In his X post, Trading Jesus shared a Dogecoin chart on the 1-hour timeframe showing the support and resistance levels as the Dogecoin price aims for the $1 mark. Currently trading at $0.36, the crypto analyst has indicated that the next resistance level for Dogecoin is $0.44. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Swift 175% Surge As DOGE/BTC Pair Records Major Breakout This crucial level could trigger major selling pressures for the meme coin as investors start liquidating their holdings. However, if Dogecoin can successfully break above the $0.44 level, the meme coin could enter a bullish phase, with its next price high at around $0.56. Trading Jesus has highlighted the $0.56 price increase as a profit-taking level at which traders and investors could begin selling their Dogecoin for potential gains. The analyst has also pinpointed a higher resistance level at $0.73336 if Dogecoin can maintain its bullish momentum above that level. At the $0.73336 resistance level, Trading Jesus has predicted that Dogecoin could see its price surging to the highly coveted $1 milestone. His chart revealed Dogecoin‚Äôs next bullish target to be $0.996 if its price continues increasing. On the flip side, Trading Jesus has also shown the support levels for Dogecoin if it fails to break past key resistance levels. The first support at $0.34 represents a crucial level where buyers might step in if the price of Dogecoin drops. This support level ultimately acts as a barrier to prevent more price drops. If Dogecoin declines below the $0.34 support level, the cryptocurrency could experience further downward pressure, leading to a drop towards the $0.25 mark. If more pullbacks occur, Trading Jesus has revealed that the Dogecoin price could bottom to new lows around the $0.18 level. Analyst Remains Bullish Despite DOGE‚Äôs 8% Price Decline While analysts foresee the Dogecoin price hitting $1, others have predicted even higher all-time highs for the popular meme coin. A crypto analyst known as the ‚ÄòCantonese Cat‚Äô on X has unveiled a weekly DOGE price chart projecting a potential leap to $4. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Price Crash For Shiba Inu, But It‚Äôs Not All Bad News In the chart, the analyst indicated that Dogecoin is on its way to hitting the $0.42 price level at the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Breaking past this level could trigger a surge towards the 1.618 Fib, representing a price increase above $4.0. The Cantonese cat has revealed that investors and traders likely have three to four weeks to accumulate at Dogecoin‚Äôs current price of $0.36 before it shoots up to $4.

42415530,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJih7,1731709800,What Does Trump's Win Mean for Crypto?,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party at large had a strong 2024 election, winning the presidency, Senate and House. This almost certainly guarantees crypto legislation will advance and become law sometime in the next two years. It also heralds a potentially softer approach from regulators toward the sector.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Taking stock  The narrative  Last week Donald Trump won his second presidential race in three tries.  During his campaign, Trump said the U.S. would become the crypto capital of the planet. Soon we'll see whether and how he'll deliver on those promises. So far, his only official announcement since the election that has any ‚Äî even weak ‚Äî sort of crypto tie is appointing X/SpaceX/Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramasway to head up the ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" some sort of advisory panel tasked with reducing government costs. DOGE, of course, is the ticker symbol for the popular memecoin. Trump is selling shirts with the DOGE dog, or at least a lookalike, as well as his and Musk's faces.  Why it matters  The U.S. ‚Äî and global ‚Äî crypto industry will be watching to see just how, exactly, Trump shapes policies and regulations around the sector and what that means for businesses.  Breaking it down  There are a few broad conclusions I think we can draw based on the results so far.  1. The crypto industry confirmed that in a post-Citizens United world, money talks.  Fairshake dumped $40 million into Senator-elect Bernie Moreno's Ohio race against incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown. Brown ran ahead of Democrats' presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, but ultimately still lost his seat amid Republicans' broader sweep last week.  Overall, Fairshake has backed over 50 candidates who won their races, and may see just five candidates lose their general election races (as of press time, that number is three; California's 45th district and Alaska's at-large district are still counting votes).  We'll have a deeper analysis on Fairshake and its track record soon.  2. The chances of some kind of crypto bill passing have gone up.  Republicans will hold the House, Senate and White House. While crypto probably won't be priority number one, the chances of some kind of crypto legislation ‚Äî whether that's a new version of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (aka FIT21), a stablecoin bill, a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill or something else entirely ‚Äî passing through the legislative process and becoming law have increased dramatically.  Just what that bill may actually be is less clear.  Industry groups are coordinating to get on the same page, said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a lobbying organization.  ""This is the time to get the policy done. We're really excited,"" she said.  3. We still don't know who may lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, Treasury Department or Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  These are probably the three entities most directly of interest to the crypto industry. Trump has named a number of his future Cabinet nominees, including Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the Department of Health and Human Services and Pete Hegseth to run the Department of Defense  Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton, who set in motion much of Gary Gensler's SEC crackdown on crypto, will be Trump's pick to run the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York ‚Äî i.e. the Department of Justice branch best known for pursuing corporate crime. This is the team that prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried and is prosecuting Roman Storm, Keonne Rodriguez, William Lonergan Hill, KuCoin and others.  While some names have floated around for some of these financial regulator roles, we don't yet know who will actually receive the nods or how they'll direct policy.  On the SEC front in particular, a new chair may not mean that the regulator's active cases against exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken or Binance are immediately dismissed.  There are many ways the cases could be settled, Smith said, but ""I don't think it's a guarantee"" that they will be settled or settled quickly.  Former SEC attorneys and staff agree, Jesse Hamilton reported.  In the Treasury Department, both the head of the department itself, as well as the Undersecretary for Terorism and Financial Intelligence ‚Äî the role now held by Brian Nelson ‚Äî can affect crypto policymaking (recall that under Trump's first term, Steven Mnuchin proposed having wallets collect know-your-customer information and oversaw the U.S.'s role in driving the Financial Action Task Force to implement the so-called travel rule for crypto).  And, of course, if Congress passes a bill directing the CFTC to become a primary market regulator for some digital assets, whoever heads that agency up will have a lot of sway over how exactly that happens.  Stories you may have missed  Crypto Is a Clear Winner With Trump as GOP Takes Senate, Sherrod Brown Loses and Gensler Likely Heading for Door: Some immediate post-game analysis from CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton.  Former FTX CTO Gary Wang Asks Court for No Jail Time: Gary Wang, the former chief technology officer of FTX, will be sentenced next week. He asked a judge not to send him to prison.

Detroiters Will Be Able to Pay Their Taxes in Crypto Next Year Using PayPal: Detroit residents will be able to pay taxes in crypto using PayPal as an intermediary.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren Rises Into Role Where Crypto Sector Won't Shake Her: Fairshake's $40 million to sway the Ohio Senate race had one side effect: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, perhaps the Senate's most critical crypto skeptic, will lead Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee. If Democrats retake the Senate in a future election, that means she'll drive legislation that could affect the digital assets sector.  This week  Thursday  21:00 UTC (9:00 p.m. GMT) Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves gave her first Mansion House speech, laying out a long-term vision for policymaking, including some crypto components.

36362693,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653234,1731704429,Dogecoin Explodes 112% ‚Äì Is $1 The New Target After This Historic Rally?,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies after a 112% growth in the past week. DOGE leads another meme currency craze with this move, proving it can still steal the show and top the crypto scene. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention ‚Äì Is More Growth Ahead? Memecoins Performing Well According to Santiment data, meme-based cryptocurrencies are doing better than most assets partly because of speculation and the explosion of social engagement on X, Reddit, Telegram and other similar platforms. DOGE has had record bull market gains, reaching 30,700% in 2021. However, parabolic increases often result in strong corrections, like its 80% plunge after its 2017 rally. Dogecoin is approaching major resistance levels that could affect its short-term trend, so traders should be cautious. Dogecoin Price Prediction: How High Can It Go? Taking into account the present pace of market trends and expanding demand, recent estimates indicate that the price of DOGE is anticipated to record an appreciation of 107% over the course of the three-month period, according to data provided by CoinCheckup. Longer-term projections show more modest increase; the price is predicted to rise by 43% over six months and by 31% over a year. This slow stability implies DOGE could keep its increasing speed even when the excitement fades. Crypto Kaleo states that DOGE‚Äôs cyclical behavior exhibits a readiness for a breakout. If it breaks its resistance at $0.10, then the price ‚Äì which is currently at $0.37 ‚Äì may head all the way up to $0.15 and beyond, just as in its historical patterns of impulsive growth. The support remains strong at $0.075. This level should provide a safety net for investors in case of a pullback. $DOGE From a cyclical perspective, Dogecoin is in the process of making the massive impulse move to new All Time Highs at the early stages of a new bull market that its known for. 200+ days after each $BTC halving, DOGE made swift moves with massive multiples.

The rally of DOGE corresponds with an increase in social dominance, as Santiment research indicates that meme-related debates are prevalent in cryptocurrency forums. This increase in community engagement highlights the speculative characteristics of the current market while also indicating a revitalized retail presence. An increase in trade activity strengthens the narrative for continued momentum in the near term. Dogecoin‚Äôs rise in value shows that it will remain famous and be appealing to investors. As the memecoin gets closer to important resistance levels, traders need to be careful and use a mix of hope and caution.

42415527,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJifE,1731700688,"Bank Clients Just Dipped Their Toes Into Bitcoin ETFs, but Q4 Could See a FOMO Spike","Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and other Wall Street banks continued buying shares of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on behalf of clients.  While allocations barely changed, most likely due to uneventful price action in bitcoin, the fourth quarter could see renewed interest sparked by recent new all-time highs.  Wealth management clients of Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley in the third quarter continued to modestly accumulate (or trade) bitcoin {{BTC}} via spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Given the huge spike in crypto prices following last week's U.S. presidential election, it's possible the action will perk up in the fourth quarter.  ""The 13F filings mirror the tepid price action in bitcoin in Q3,"" said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. ""Most institutions are slow to deploy capital and to observe trends, and didn't take the initiative to front-run a historically bullish Q4.""  Goldman Sachs reported holding spot bitcoin ETF shares worth $710 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, as clients' allocations into the ETFs nearly doubled, up from $418 million in the previous quarter. Most of the bank's shares were in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in which it held just shy of 13 million shares.  Other top-tier banks/wealth management operations, including Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America, UBS and HSBC, didn't add to or subtract much from their positions. A new entrant was Australian investment bank Macquarie Group, which purchased 132,355 shares of IBIT worth $4.8 million. Wells Fargo, which has a very minor stake in the ETFs, held most of its shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).  The positions were reported in 13F filings, a quarterly report that institutional investors with over $100 million in assets under management are required to file to disclose their holdings of certain securities. The deadline for the third quarter was Thursday.  BlackRock disclosed a stake of 2.54 million shares, worth $91.6 million as of Sept. 30, in its own fund.  The three-month period from the start of July to the end of September signaled a period of flat to downward price action for bitcoin, with the price largely ranging from $53,000 to $66,000. This followed the flat to downward price action during much of the second quarter, so it's possible the tepid institutional interest reflected the pall that sat over the market.  Things, of course, have changed in a big way in the fourth quarter amid the run-up to and following the election of crypto-friendly Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Bitcoin blasted out of its multi-month range, quickly taking out March's record of $73,700 and continuing this week to as high as $93,400.  The recent price action, combined with a hoped-for crypto embrace by the Trump administration taking office in January might inspire a good deal of ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO) in institutional players and their clients. It's at least somewhat possible the next batch of 13Fs coming after the start of 2025 could prove far more interesting than this quarter's.  ""I expect a lot of scrambling behind the scenes to make sure institutions have at the bare minimum a 1% allocation due to crypto-friendly president Donald Trump and bitcoin breaking,"" van Straten said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/15/bank-clients-just-dipped-their-toes-into-bitcoin-etfs-but-q4-could-see-a-fomo-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3243a973044180448a2246b4b83f79660ddb68f-7895x4441.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36359041,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653290,1731699024,XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance ‚Äì Top Analyst Shares Price Target,"XRP is making waves in the crypto market, trading at $0.82 after setting new yearly highs following an impressive 65% surge in just a few days. This rally has captured the attention of investors and analysts, with top analyst Carl Runefelt sharing insights into XRP‚Äôs bullish breakout. According to Runefelt, XRP has finally broken above a multi-year resistance level, signaling the potential for a massive rally to higher prices in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone ‚Äì Last Time BTC Soared 80% Adding to the optimism, recent positive developments in the broader crypto space have further boosted market sentiment. Reports suggest that SEC Chair Gary Gensler may step down, a move that potentially reduces regulatory pressure on the crypto industry. Elected President Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance and policies also spark renewed interest and confidence among crypto enthusiasts. These factors have created an environment where XRP appears poised for significant gains. As investors watch closely, the focus remains whether XRP can sustain this momentum and continue pushing higher. With key resistance levels cleared and favorable news driving sentiment, XRP is positioning itself as one of the most promising assets in the crypto space right now. XRP Staring A Bullish Phase XRP has entered a promising new bullish phase after years of lackluster performance and prolonged legal battles with the SEC in the U.S. This resurgence sparks optimism among investors and analysts alike, with top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt sharing a compelling technical analysis on X. Runefelt highlighted XRP‚Äôs breakout from a multi-year resistance level, which signals a significant shift in its price trajectory. In his analysis, Runefelt cautiously predicted that XRP could reach $2 during this bull cycle, a modest target compared to analysts who foresee price levels soaring past $20. The breakout marks a turning point for XRP, which has faced years of sideways price action and persistent selling pressure. Legal setbacks, regulatory uncertainty, and market skepticism had kept the asset underperforming relative to its peers. However, with favorable developments in the broader crypto market and the ongoing adoption of blockchain solutions, XRP is regaining its footing. Related Reading: Solana ‚ÄòGod Candle Is Close‚Äô As It Breaks From Crucial Resistance ‚Äì Top Analyst Many believe the coming months could be transformative for XRP, with the potential to finally rise above its previous all-time high of $3.84 set in January 2018. As bullish momentum builds and investor confidence strengthens, XRP is positioned to be one of the standout performers in this market cycle. Bullish Price Action: Key Supply Levels To Watch XRP trades at $0.82 following a massive breakout that clears multiple resistance levels, signaling renewed bullish momentum. This surge has reignited optimism among investors as XRP demonstrates strength after prolonged underperformance. The next critical supply level for XRP to test lies at $0.92, a price point it hasn‚Äôt revisited since 2021. A successful breakout above $0.92, followed by consolidation and support building at this level, could open the door for significant upward movement. If XRP maintains its bullish momentum and establishes $0.92 as a support zone, demand could skyrocket, propelling the price toward the $1.4 level. This would mark a significant milestone, aligning with broader market optimism and strengthening investor confidence in XRP‚Äôs long-term potential. Related Reading: Chainlink Whales Waking Up ‚Äì Data Shows Signs Of Accumulation However, the possibility of a failed breakout above $0.92 cannot be ignored. If the price struggles to hold this level, XRP could enter a consolidation phase, remaining range-bound until new catalysts emerge. Such a scenario would likely delay the next major move but might offer opportunities for accumulation. As the price continues its climb, traders and investors are closely monitoring these key levels, recognizing that the outcome could define the next chapter of XRP‚Äôs price action in this bullish cycle.

42415521,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJibS,1731694798,The Many Ways Crypto Won in This Election,"Trump has been avowedly pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto for a minute now. In fact, he‚Äôs more of a degen than many of us, having launched his own DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial. The official Republican platform is explicitly pro-crypto, and Trump himself has made specific commitments to the industry, like freeing Ross Ulbricht, ending SEC Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs reign, letting Bitcoin miners mine, ending Chokepoint 2.0, and having the government hold on to all seized BTC.  People are policy, and Trump surrounds himself with an orange-pilled group. VP-elect JD Vance owns Bitcoin, and has a long track of engagement with crypto, even authoring a market structure bill as a senator. Vivek Ramaswamy, the new co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been a crypto bull for some time. Trump‚Äôs transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick is a bitcoin and stablecoin megabull (his company Cantor Fitzgerald custodies for Tether). Musk himself, who is becoming a right-side Soros of sorts, has dabbled in crypto for years.  By all accounts, Jared Kushner, Trump‚Äôs sons Don and Eric, and Barron are all crypto curious at least. RFK Jr, who may yet find a role in Trump‚Äôs cabinet, is beloved in the Bitcoin community. Trump‚Äôs rumored Treasury secretary nominee, Scott Bessent, openly supports crypto and Bitcoin. And Tulsi Gabbard, newly minted head of National Intelligence, owned ETH and LTC all the way back in 2018. Even those who suspect that Trump is merely paying lip service to crypto must admit he has surrounded himself with people who have invested in the industry‚Äôs future.  The election was also a spectacular success for the crypto lobby. On November 8, Bloomberg reported that FairShake, the industry‚Äôs largest Super PAC, prevailed in 48 of 48 races in which it backed a candidate (Fairshake backed both Democrats and Republicans). Coinbase‚Äôs Stand With Crypto aggregator claims that 273 pro-crypto and 122 anti-crypto Representatives were elected this cycle.  On the Senate side, they list 19 pro-crypto and 12 anti-crypto candidates elected. Most notably in the Senate, the crypto lobby threw an avalanche of cash at Bernie Moreno to help him unseat Democrat Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio. Brown was the chair of the Senate Banking Committee and a staunch opponent of crypto. Moreno, by contrast, is a crypto entrepreneur himself. In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy (""A"" grade on Stand with Crypto) defeated Senator Jon Tester (""D"" grade on Stand with Crypto).  Although we don‚Äôt know the exact size of the crypto single-issue voter bloc, it‚Äôs undoubtedly the case that crypto helped swing some of these races, helping Republicans retake the Senate and keep the House. Newly minted Senate leaders John Thune and Tim Scott have both spoken favorably of crypto in the past.  In the New Year, we can expect the first priority to be a stablecoin bill (although the details are still being negotiated), followed by a market structure bill. Trump could create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with an executive order, or Congress could create a new federal facility for this.  Tether specifically  Tether is a huge winner from the election. This was kind of an unexpected blessing for them, since they weren‚Äôt known to have participated in the electoral cycle at all nor were they listed as donating to any super PACs. (As a foreign entity, they would have been prohibited from doing so.) Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, which custodies a large share of Tether‚Äôs Treasury portfolio, is a huge Tether bull. He is also the co-chair of Trump‚Äôs transition team and even threw his name in the hat for Treasury Secretary. Lutnick deeply appreciates the value proposition of stablecoins like Tether.  The biggest threat to the $125 billion stablecoin issue is regulatory or law enforcement action, with the DoJ reportedly investigating them yet again. Due to a barrage of negative press coverage, Tether was never going to be fully in the clear. Although no one really worries about their reserves any longer, associations with illicit finance continue to plague it. Lutnick‚Äôs close relationship with Trump represents a meaningful political bailout for the stablecoin. You know that somewhere in the Bahamas, an Italian named Paolo was clinking champagne flutes on election night.  DeFi specifically  DeFi also looks to gain from the election. At the moment, the industry suffers from a regulatory paradox. Every feature that makes tokens worthwhile to hold ‚Äì cashflows accreting to holders, real governance rights, and so on ‚Äì also makes them more like securities legally speaking. This has forced founders to tread a delicate path between making the token attractive and trying to avoid the dreaded security designation.  This is ultimately an impossible path. Many of these tokens resemble a form of pseudo-equity and should be treated as such. Now as SEC chair Gensler looks to be on his way out, the SEC looks poised to install a regulatory framework to treat these tokens as pseudo-equity requiring light-touch disclosure for investors. This would level the playing field and make the DeFi space fairer for investors, while allowing founders to treat the tokens more like protocol equity.  The market is anticipating this, as DeFi names are already catching a bid. I expect that this flight to quality will continue over the coming months as the SEC‚Äôs agenda for tokens crystallizes.  Banks serving crypto  Crypto people often think that it‚Äôs crypto versus the banks. But the contrary is the case. Banks have been trying to get into the crypto space for a long time, although they have been largely walled off from serving the industry. SEC rule SAB121 has meant that banks holding crypto on behalf of clients have to hold it on their balance sheet, making such custody models prohibitively expensive.  In 2023, the Fed warned banks not to do business with stablecoins. And of course, banks have been discouraged from serving crypto clients by the FDIC, OCC, and Fed. This has been dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0.‚Äù Even today, after Chokepoint 2.0 has been exposed, the FDIC is insisting that banks offer no more than 15% of their depository base to crypto firms. Many banks would like to bank crypto firms but simply cannot.  Meanwhile, foreign banks are feasting, getting involved in crypto custody, exchange, stablecoin/FX brokerage, and even issuing stablecoins themselves. U.S. banks have been left out.  This is all likely to change under Trump. We know SAB121 will go away whenever Trump forces SEC chair Gensler out. Although Congress passed a SAB121 overturn (which was subsequently vetoed by Biden), no such bill will be necessary when SEC leadership turns over. SAB121 was imposed by fiat, and it can be eliminated with the stroke of a pen by Gensler‚Äôs successor. So banks will be free to custody crypto.  Chokepoint 2.0 will undoubtedly end, as Trump appoints a new Comptroller and FDIC Chair. Banks will be at liberty to serve crypto firms to their pleasure. Whether banks will be allowed to issue or transact with stablecoins remains an open question.  Prediction markets  Lastly, prediction markets were huge beneficiaries of the election, having performed exceptionally well. Polymarket was far sunnier on Trump‚Äôs (and general Republican) prospects than most of the pollsters, and called a number of races long before the pundits and MSM did. Aside from stablecoins, prediction markets appear to be the first meaningful breakout consumer product built on crypto. Finally, a use case. Prediction markets do outperform the polls and the press, and they will be a defining feature of political life for years to come.

36356327,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24443,1731693809,What is ColliderScript?,"ColliderScript introduces a method for implementing covenants on Bitcoin, which could enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs functionality. Covenants aim to allow for more complex transaction conditions, governing how and when Bitcoin can be spent. It does this by using 160-bit hash collisions, allowing transactions to enforce conditions on future spending without requiring a soft fork. Unlike other proposals, ColliderScript leverages existing opcodes, sidestepping the need for consensus-driven protocol changes, which makes it flexible but computationally expensive. While this technique provides a proof of concept for covenants on Bitcoin, its high resource demands currently limit practicality. However, with further optimisation, ColliderScript could advance Bitcoin‚Äôs programmability and encourage broader discussions around covenant adoption in Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting environment. How Could ColliderScript Covenants Improve Bitcoin? ColliderScript introduces a potential pathway for enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs functionality by implementing covenants , which allow for more complex transaction conditions on the blockchain. Covenants specify rules around how and when bitcoins can be spent in the future, effectively broadening Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting language to support new use cases like restricted wallets and vault mechanisms. ColliderScript‚Äôs approach bypasses the need for a soft fork by using 160-bit hash collisions , allowing covenants to function within Bitcoin‚Äôs existing infrastructure, without lengthy debates in an effort to sway consensus. This method sidesteps the need for protocol changes, which can be controversial and slow-moving due to Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralised governance. By keeping within the bounds of Bitcoin‚Äôs current opcodes, ColliderScript offers a technically feasible path for covenants, albeit one that requires a lot of optimisation to become practical. Bitcoiners see several use cases for covenants, particularly around security and layered network efficiency. Covenants could enable ‚Äúvault‚Äù wallets, where funds are held in a secure account with strict conditions on withdrawal. This structure would allow users to set time delays on transfers or restrict transactions to specific addresses, enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs security features. In addition, rate-limited wallets could help prevent unauthorised transactions by imposing spending limits, offering a layer of protection that is currently challenging to implement natively on Bitcoin. These covenant-enabled wallets and vaults could appeal to users who want greater control over their funds, especially those managing large amounts or handling assets in custodial capacities. Beyond improving security, covenants hold potential for improving efficiency in Bitcoin‚Äôs layer 2 ecosystem, especially on secondary layers like the Lightning Network , Ark , or BitVM . By imposing specific rules on Bitcoin transactions, covenants could streamline processes in multi-party and time-sensitive transactions, reducing the operational complexity required for these systems. For instance, covenants could aid in transaction batching or in ensuring that payments follow predetermined channels, making it easier to create scalable and efficient solutions atop Bitcoin. This could, in turn, lower transaction costs and enhance the reliability of the network for users relying on these layer-2 solutions for faster and more affordable transactions. Covenants in Bitcoin will enable a range of smart contracts that allow for more sophisticated control over how transactions are processed and funds are spent. They can facilitate time-locked or conditionally limited wallets, where funds are only accessible under specified circumstances or time frames, making them useful for applications like inheritance wallets or automated escrow services. Covenants can also enable multi-signature wallets with custom rules on transaction limits, which is valuable for business accounts that require controlled spending. These capabilities make covenants a powerful tool for creating programmable conditions on Bitcoin, similar to certain functionalities found in Ethereum smart contracts, but tailored to Bitcoin‚Äôs security and scripting environment. Despite the potential improvements, ColliderScript covenants face practical challenges, primarily due to their high computational cost. As ColliderScript relies on collision-finding techniques, its current model demands considerable processing power, making it too costly for widespread adoption without further optimization. However, even as a proof of concept, ColliderScript could accelerate interest in covenant functionality by demonstrating their utility and feasibility within Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting constraints. This research could ultimately contribute to community discussions and potentially support a future protocol upgrade, should stakeholders decide that covenants warrant a more efficient, integrated solution in Bitcoin‚Äôs code. Can ColliderScript Improve Bitcoin‚Äôs Programmability Without a Fork? ColliderScript leverages 160-bit hash collisions, specifically using SHA1 and RIPEMD hash functions, to achieve these covenants in Bitcoin‚Äôs existing scripting environment. This technique involves creating an ‚Äúequivalence check‚Äù that allows data processed in Bitcoin‚Äôs Small Script to mimic data processed in Big Script. By bridging these two parts of the Bitcoin scripting language, ColliderScript opens a pathway to implementing covenants without modifying Bitcoin‚Äôs consensus rules. One significant advantage of ColliderScript is that it bypasses the need for a soft fork, a challenging process requiring broad community consensus. Other proposed covenant methods, like OP_CAT and OP_CTV , mandate changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself, introducing operational and social hurdles. ColliderScript, on the other hand, relies solely on existing opcodes and hash functions, thereby avoiding the risks and delays associated with protocol updates. This independence from consensus changes provides flexibility and allows developers to explore and potentially implement covenants directly on the current network. It‚Äôs not perfect, ColliderScript also has notable limitations. Its current implementation is computationally expensive, potentially costing millions of dollars in computational resources to execute. The approach relies on collision-finding, which requires significant computational power, and transactions using ColliderScript demand a considerable amount of memory and processing time. These high costs make ColliderScript impractical for widespread use in its present form. While the ColliderScript method demonstrates the feasibility of covenants on Bitcoin, these resource-intensive demands may deter adoption without further optimisation. ColliderScript represents an important proof of concept for future developments in Bitcoin programmability. Despite its current limitations, improvements in hardware or optimised algorithms may reduce the cost of implementation, making ColliderScript more viable. This research also serves as a foundation for ongoing discussions around covenants in Bitcoin, potentially accelerating the soft fork process by highlighting covenants‚Äô utility and practicality. ColliderScript thus plays a dual role in advancing Bitcoin‚Äôs technical capabilities and fostering community dialogue around evolving the Bitcoin scripting language. What are the Potential Tradeoffs to Adding Covenants in Bitcoin? While ColliderScript introduces new programmability to Bitcoin through covenants, it also opens the door to potential risks and unintended consequences that could impact Bitcoin‚Äôs core principles. Covenants allow users to embed spending restrictions within transactions, which could, under certain implementations, restrict how and when bitcoins can be spent. Although designed with flexibility in mind, such restrictions could lead to scenarios where Bitcoin‚Äôs fungibility and freedom of use are compromised. This programmability may create opportunities for restrictions that Bitcoin users do not expect or want, potentially undermining Bitcoin‚Äôs role as an open and permissionless form of money. One significant risk is the possibility of making Bitcoin ‚Äúexpireable‚Äù through covenants, a characteristic associated with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) where funds can be set to expire after a certain period. Covenants could be configured to prevent a transaction from executing beyond a specified time limit, meaning that bitcoins could effectively expire if certain conditions aren‚Äôt met. This could harm Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental value proposition of being an unrestrictive, censorship-resistant, durable store of value. By enabling ‚Äútime locks‚Äù in spending covenants, it‚Äôs conceivable that some bitcoins could be programmed with expiration dates, turning them into a tool that enforces forced spending or devaluation, potentially diminishing users‚Äô long-term trust in Bitcoin as a stable digital asset. Another potential concern is the ability of covenants to restrict Bitcoin from being used for specific types of purchases. Covenants allow for spending rules to be written directly into transactions, meaning that coins could be made ‚Äúnon-spendable‚Äù for certain categories of goods or services. This could lead to a fragmented ecosystem where some bitcoins are restricted from particular uses, making Bitcoin less fungible and thus deviating from its original purpose as a universally usable digital currency. Over time, if widely adopted, such restrictions could create a precedent for more controlled or monitored spending, potentially making Bitcoin susceptible to limitations more commonly associated with regulated digital assets or state-controlled currencies. A primary concern is that covenants might enable increased surveillance capabilities by encoding tracking mechanisms directly into transactions. For instance, specific covenants could enforce a chain of custody, where each successive transaction retains a record of its past holders or restricts future transactions to known, whitelisted addresses. This could create a de facto surveillance layer, reducing the pseudonymity and privacy Bitcoin currently affords. Another risk is the potential for creating ‚Äúblacklisted‚Äù bitcoins, or coins marked as unusable for certain recipients or regions. If covenants gain traction in scenarios where regulatory or compliance rules are embedded in transactions, bitcoins could become subject to restrictions based on geographic location, identity, or other arbitrary factors, resulting in decreased financial inclusivity. Additionally, the risk of ‚Äúcovenant proliferation‚Äù exists, where coins could become embedded with so many conditions that they become unusable or difficult to spend freely, creating liquidity issues or burdensome complexity in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Lastly, covenants could pave the way for ‚Äúsocially enforced‚Äù restrictions if consensus emerges around certain use cases. For example, some might advocate for covenants preventing bitcoin from funding certain activities or political causes, leading to a form of soft censorship. This would conflict with Bitcoin‚Äôs principle of neutrality and could lead to a fragmented ecosystem where different factions implement and enforce competing restrictions. These risks illustrate that, while covenants add valuable functionality, their design and use must be carefully considered to preserve Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a decentralised, open financial tool.

This significant drop in volume has caught the attention of market participants, as a crypto analyst is discussing the mechanics and significance of a decline in Bitcoin and whether it indicates a Distribution or Accumulation phase. Bitcoin Price Falls As Volume Plummets 27% Data from CoinMarketCap has revealed that the daily trading volume of Bitcoin has crashed 26.46%, pushing the value to $85.89 billion. This significant decline in the Bitcoin volume coincides with a broader correction in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market In the last 24 hours, BTC has experienced a price pullback to $87,848, as of writing. The cryptocurrency was previously trading above $90,000, but has recently declined by 2.87%. This plummeting volume often indicates a reduced market interest or lack of enthusiasm. However, this may not be the case for Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency has been experiencing high market activity due to the just-concluded US Presidential elections that resulted in a Donald Trump win. The more likely reason for the decreased volume could be a market consolidation, where the price of Bitcoin could stabilize before a potential breakout. Supporting this, a crypto analyst, ‚ÄòPersonal Trader,‚Äô stated that the market has entered a phase of decline, where Bitcoin could enter its last correction period before moving toward the $100,000 milestone. BTC Price Decline May Indicate A Distribution Or Accumulation Phase Given the recent decline in Bitcoin price and volume, a crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòIonicXBT‚Äô has taken to X to identify and discuss the significance of this decline using two main trends exhibited in a Bitcoin market cycle: the Accumulation and Distribution phases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Swift 175% Surge As DOGE/BTC Pair Records Major Breakout The Accumulation phase is when smart money, including investors or institutions, starts to buy Bitcoin. During this phase, prices tend to be low or have stabilized after a decline. Additionally, Bitcoin‚Äôs trading volume increases in the same period as buyers step in to push prices higher. Moreover, every upward price movement tends to showcase a strong volume, indicating increased buying pressure. In contrast, the Distribution phase is when smart money are selling or distributing their Bitcoin. During this phase, prices may have peaked or are being seen as overvalued. The volume of BTC rises while its price falls, signaling intense selling pressure. Moreover, price spikes accompanied by low trading volume suggest a weak buying interest, a red flag that indicates that smart money are exiting the market. Based on these Bitcoin phases, IonicXBT has revealed that he will call the Bitcoin market top and bottom soon. The analyst has shown that Bitcoin is currently not in its distribution phase, which means it is still a ‚Äúbuyer‚Äôs market,‚Äù suggesting the potential for future price increases.

Solana is a major beneficiary in the meme coin bull market, thanks to its fast, inexpensive L1 blockchain network. I've been bearish on the Grayscale Solana Trust due to its excessive premium, recommending direct Solana purchases instead. Since July, Solana has surged 38%, while GSOL's NAV premium has plummeted from 750% to 138%, validating my recommendation. With private placement share lockups set to expire very shortly, time is running out to capture what is left of the secondary market premium on GSOL shares. With the recent election of President Donald Trump earlier this month, there has been an immediate resurgence in the digital asset market. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a fresh all-time high at $93k per coin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is back above $3k, and even Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) has gone on a monster rally. The latter of which has no doubt been fueled by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE), to at least some degree. With respect to Bitcoin and some of the other large cap coins, the biggest post-election rally has come from the meme coins: Since the US Election (Artemis) In the days since the US election, BTC and ETH have each rallied by over 25%. Memecoins are up by just under 100%. The latter of which is likely not what 'fundamentally driven' digital asset investors would prefer to see, but it's the market we have. And in a bull market for meme coins, Solana ( SOL-USD ) is likely one of the biggest beneficiaries of that kind of activity as a L1 blockchain network that is fast and inexpensive to use. Solana's On-Chain Trends Data by YCharts To put it mildly, Solana has been an absolute powerhouse over the last 18 months. And that success hasn't come purely from coin price hype, there has been real progress in network usage to go with the 900% increase in SOL since May 2023. For a blockchain that looked like it was dead in the water two years ago, the resurgence of Solana as a network following the collapse of FTX in late 2022 has been absolutely incredible to watch unfold. October 2024 set a new all-time high in Solana's monthly network fees at $73.5 million. November is on pace to top that with $47 million before we're even at the midway point of the month. Fully Diluted P/F vs Network Fees (Token Terminal) These fees have grown so quickly that the fully diluted price-to-fee multiple for Solana is averaging 107x ‚Äì this is the second lowest fully diluted SOL valuation ever, after the 104x P/F average in April 2024. Interestingly, the number of raw transactions on Solana doesn't appear to be the biggest reason for the fee spike. The primary driver of these fees has been a robust surge in monthly DEX volume, or decentralized exchange trading volume, going back to the beginning of the year: Monthly DEX Volume by Chain (Artemis) Solana did $52.5 billion in October DEX volume and is likely going to blow that figure out of the water in November, as the chain is already up to $49.8 billion through just half the month. While Solana has moved into the number 2 spot behind Ethereum in terms of Total Value Locked in DeFi protocols, this surge in activity is due to the proliferation of meme coins that are available on Solana. New memes pop up on a regular basis; including the apparently immortal "" Peanut The Squirrel "" (PNUT-USD) which has quickly catapulted to the 55th highest ranked cryptocurrency market capitalization after just 10 days of trading. Though silly from where I sit, these types of things are a big reason why Solana has had over 6 million active addresses in November. Daily Active Addresses (Monthly) (Artemis) Even when considering additional networks that have seen an explosion in usage recently like Sui ( SUI-USD ) and NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD ), neither have come close to Solana in the last two months from a DAA standpoint. In fact, Solana had a larger number of daily active addresses than Sui and NEAR combined in October and is on pace to do it again in November. For better or worse, Solana has become sort of the 'court jester' in the crypto market. While Bitcoiners HODL and 'ETH Maxis' wait for new highs as the chain scales through dozens of fragmented L2s, Solana is where the party is apparently at in the crypto ecosystem. I'm not sure that's a great reason to buy SOL, but I can't say it's necessarily a 'sell' either in a nihilistic world. Still, there's a wrong way to do everything, and buying Solana is no different. The GSOL Premium Is Melting Seeking Alpha There can be little doubt that I've been bearish about the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) in 2024. On separate occasions over the last 8 months, I've labeled the fund a 'sell' and a 'strong sell.' The logic behind those calls has primarily been due to the elevated premium the fund shares traded at to the net asset value of the fund. Most recently, in July , GSOL shares traded at a 750% premium to the SOL represented by each share. At that time, I even cautioned against doing a private placement in the fund in an attempt to capture the post-lockup price premium due to the duration risk in doing so: For accredited investors considering a private placement, I would weigh the merits of simply buying Solana and staking for the 7% reward. This way the duration risk of the lockup period is eliminated, there is no risk of selling your shares below NAV on secondary, and you're not paying Grayscale's 2.5% management fee while the SOL sits dormant for 12 months. For investors who heeded that advice and simply bought Solana directly rather than playing around with GSOL private placement, the results likely speak for themselves: GSOL vs SOL 7/17-11/14 (Seeking Alpha) Since July 17th, Solana is up over 38% before staking rewards, while GSOL has lagged the entire time. More recently, shares have fallen apart as the NAV premium has collapsed from 750% down to just 145% as of market close on 11/14. It's certainly possible that buyers of this massive premium collapse of GSOL during November could ride the premium back up where it was before. But I don't think that's likely. Grayscale Fund Ticker 11/14/23 11/14/24 Change Bitcoin Cash Trust ( BCHG ) 34,812,900 44,478,400 27.8% Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ) 17,204,700 23,064,800 34.1% Filecoin Trust ( FILG ) 111,400 1,906,900 1611.8% Chainlink Trust ( GLNK ) 321,010 1,172,710 265.3% Solana GSOL 304,427 1,412,627 364.0% Source: Grayscale, shares outstanding Relative to a year ago, GSOL shares outstanding have grown by 364% - this is far more than most of the larger AUM Grayscale funds and only dwarfed by share growth in FILG going back to last November. And here's the biggest takeaway I'll leave GSOL holders with from this article; it looks like you're running out of time to capture what is left of your secondary premium: GSOL Shares Outstanding (Grayscale, Author's Chart) From late November 2022 to late November 29th, 2023, there were 340.5k GSOL shares outstanding. That number exploded overnight to 468.7k GSOL shares on November 30th, 2023. And as you can see in the chart above, the outstanding share growth really hasn't stopped since. It would appear GSOL holders have about 10 trading days left before these accredited investor share lockups begin to expire. Closing Summary At this point in time, I'm going to maintain GSOL as a 'sell' and reiterate Solana as a 'buy.' The emergence of fast, retail-driven blockchains like Sui and NEAR Protocol figure to chip into Solana's leading spot as heir to Ethereum's smart contract throne over time. But to this point, Solana is still the clear leader in memes and nonsense on the blockchain. I trade SOL fairly regularly, but generally keep a core long-term position. GSOL, on the other hand, should be avoided until it starts trading closer to NAV. At a NAV rate discount, it might even be a 'buy.' We'll find out soon enough.",NEGATIVE,SOL | NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | NEAR,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737845-gsol-is-still-overpriced-relative-to-solana?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36352522.jpeg

Over the past few days, the price has oscillated between this record level and a low of $85,100, indicating the potential onset of a consolidation phase before the next major move. Traders and investors are now closely monitoring whether BTC will stabilize or continue its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Solana ‚ÄòGod Candle Is Close‚Äô As It Breaks From Crucial Resistance ‚Äì Top Analyst Key data from CryptoQuant suggests that selling pressure may increase quickly, primarily driven by speculative traders looking to lock in quick profits. However, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily spell trouble for Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish momentum. Analysts predict that much of the selling pressure will be absorbed by the growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs, which have gained significant traction among institutional investors. This balance between short-term selling and institutional accumulation could set the stage for Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. With volatility expected to persist in the coming days, market participants are eagerly watching for signals that might indicate the direction of BTC‚Äôs price action. Whether this phase leads to a deeper correction or propels Bitcoin toward new highs, one thing is clear‚ÄîBitcoin continues to dominate the financial landscape with its dynamic performance. Bitcoin Strong Demand Supports Bullish Price Action Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has been impressive, surging by 38% over the past ten days. This rapid rise has caught the attention of many investors, reaffirming the growing strength of Bitcoin‚Äôs demand. Key data from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler offers insight into the current market dynamics, highlighting that Bitcoin is trading above its short-term holder (STH) cost basis of $69,000. This level represents a crucial support threshold for those who acquired Bitcoin in the past few months, indicating solid demand above this price. Additionally, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio stands at 1.3, suggesting that Bitcoin is still profitable. However, Adler notes that if this ratio crosses the 1.35 mark, it could trigger selling pressure from short-term speculators looking to lock in profits. While this may prompt some market volatility, it‚Äôs important to note that most of these coins are expected to be absorbed by growing institutional demand, particularly through Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% ‚Äì Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside This data points to a significant shift in Bitcoin‚Äôs rally‚Äîrather than being fueled by speculative futures trades, the recent surge appears to be driven by strong spot demand. Spot demand typically reflects a more sustainable, stable price move than the volatility often seen in futures-driven rallies. As Bitcoin continues to trade above key support levels, the outlook remains bullish, driven by a healthy balance between speculative trading and long-term institutional interest. BTC Technical View: Prices To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $89,240, reflecting a 7% retrace from its recent all-time high of $93,483. The price has consolidated below this level following a period of aggressive upward momentum that propelled it into price discovery territory. This pause in the rally allows the market to stabilize and test key support levels before determining its next move. During this consolidation, the $85,000 mark has emerged as a crucial support level. If Bitcoin can hold above this level in the coming days, it may provide the foundation for another surge, potentially challenging the $90,000 resistance and retesting its all-time high. A successful reclaim of $90,000 would signal renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for further price expansion. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH ‚Äì Time To Buy Altcoins? However, failure to maintain the $85,000 support could lead to a deeper correction. In this scenario, Bitcoin would likely seek lower-level demand, with $82,000 emerging as a significant area of interest for buyers. As the market navigates this critical phase, traders and investors will closely watch price action for signals of either a breakout or a pullback, with both scenarios carrying implications for Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

On-Chain Metrics moved moderately Bearish, but this time may be different. The large U.S. national debt, budget deficit and soaring interest payments may motivate the government to print money and debase the U.S. Dollar. The stars are lining-up for the beginning of Altcoin season. Some tell-tale signs of Altcoin season are declining Bitcoin Dominance and Altcoin price breakouts on high volume. Introduction I've written several articles that highlighted the twists & turns of Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) journey to $90K. I have always been LT bullish on Bitcoin, especially given the catalysts of the halving, Spot ETF approval, and now we have a favorable regulatory environment and talk of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . On March '24, I became Bearish ( Bitcoin: ""Beware the ides of March"" ) predicting a local top (meaning temporary top) after strong gains. Bitcoin then entered a ""digestive phase"" until the recent Election in which prices soared. What I got wrong Since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, I expected by the very least that the U.S. would have a mild recession. Almost every instance of Federal Fund Rate rises has witnessed slowing economic growth - a negative for risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, this never occurred, and the Fed's recent dovishness in the face of strong GDP growth has all but eliminated the potential for recession. On-Chain Metrics (""OCTA"") I utilize a holistic approach to measuring risk, including my own Risk Indicator, Sentiment, charts and a slew of On-Chain Metrics. They are again showing confluence - meaning indicators from different data-sets and different assets (Bitcoin, Crypto, Equities...) are moderately Bearish. Some of the major categories and their readings are below: Sentiment (Very Bearish) Blockchain Usage (Neutral reading) Investor Profitability (Bearish) Long-term holder behavior (Neutral) Liquidity & ETF Flows (Bullish) Derivative Positioning (Bearish) Miner Activity (Neutral) Sentiment (""Fear & Greed"": very Bearish) The chart below is Bitcoin's price color-coded with the Fear & Greed index and as you can see, the index is at Extreme Greed (~90) which of course is a contrarian-indicator. Prices are likely to decline but probably on a temporary-basis. BGeometrics Blockchain Usage (Active addresses: Neutral reading) Active addresses' had been lackluster since March, something I found very concerning, as one can see from the chart that sharply dropping addresses typically portend a fall in Bitcoin's price. There are expanding use-cases for Bitcoin, such as Ordinals (i.e., NFTs) and the Lightning Network (for payments, remittances, etc.), however, this isn't showing up in the data. The Bitcoin ETFs, which are custodied differently than having personal wallets, may also have affected the data. The good news is that there's been a sharp rebound recently. There has been huge momentum with both retail, institutional and potentially sovereign governments embracing Bitcoin. Recently, the BRICS countries said they were planning a new currency based on a basket of assets including Gold, currencies and potentially Bitcoin. BGeometrics Investor Profitability (NUPL, Bearish reading) Essentially, when investors have high net unrealized profits, there's a tendency to want to sell Bitcoin and cash out of the market. Net Unrealized Profits-Loss (BGeometrics) Derivative Positioning (Bearish) Open Interest is at record highs, funding rates are positive, and the market is in Contango (Future price > Spot price). All of these align with local market peaks as there's more demand for futures in speculative markets, which not only pushes up the funding rates, but it raises the Bitcoin Futures price as the maturities lengthen. ARK Invest calls Contango "" Futures Rolling Basis "" in the chart below. On the positive side, both funding rates and Contango are not at peak levels despite the sharp run-up in Bitcoin prices. This is a sign that we're not yet at a major top. (As a sidenote: there's some fancy trading going on with hedge-funds that are shorting the Futures market and buying spot Bitcoin.) ARK Invest BGeometrics Why this time may be different As Shakespeare said, ""What's past is prologue."" But I think a nuanced examination is required. I gave you a few examples from a slew of indicators that show Bitcoin's in a high-risk area. However, I'm not so bearish this time around‚Ä¶ Bitcoin is at a point in its Halving Cycle when prices begin to accelerate. Concurrently, demand for the spot ETF continues good - in fact, it seems to be accelerating more recently! The Block The Money Printer may go into overdrive The U.S.'s national debt is huge, at $36 trillion and the country faces over $1.1 trillion in interest payments that are rising rapidly given that a large portion was financed with short-term treasuries that need to be refinanced at higher rates. Creative Planning One can do the math, but there is no way the U.S. can repay this amount of debt given its huge budget deficit and declining workforce. So it's left with only one solution: print more money, and that's where global liquidity comes into the picture. Once the Fed eases off its Quantitative Tightening, along with lowering rates, global liquidity could spike up. Below is a chart showing M2 growth and Bitcoin's price. In fact, you can substitute Bitcoin for nearly any risk-asset (tech stocks, S&P 500) and you will see a similar correlation! BGeometrics Passing the torch to Altcoins As much as I believe Bitcoin is ""Digital Gold"" I think the setup is ripe for a period when Altcoins outperform. This mania-phase is commonly called "" Altseason "" or ""Banana Zone"" by Real Vision. I expect this to occur within the next six months, depending on the interplay between economic growth (or lack thereof) and liquidity. Remember‚Ä¶the U.S. has been under an economic regime of Fiscal-dominance (i.e., lots of spending) which will likely give way to a period of Monetary-dominance. Altcoin Season (Blockchaincenter) After years of uncertainty and ""Regulation via SEC enforcement"", it's clear that the Trump Administration will encourage Gary Gensler to resign and replace him with a supportive chairperson. Further, Congress is likely to finally pass Crypto legislation (see list here ) that gives our community clear ""rules of the road."" Fundamentally this is more favorable to Altcoins than Bitcoin as digital gold has already been accepted by regulators. Main factors portending the upcoming Altseason: Falling Bitcoin Dominance Sharply rising Bitcoin prices, leading to a ""wealth effect"" High-Volume breakouts of some Altcoins Rising Altcoin interest via Google search Trends Rising Russell 2000 Index and long-duration/MEME stocks getting traction My framework is that as Bitcoin rises, a wealth-effect is created and investors become overconfident. They then trade on leverage and sell Bitcoin for faster horses. This tends to occur after Bitcoin Dominance reaches 60-65% (where we are now). The chart below shows the last two Altcoin Seasons (2017, 2021) with ""Others"" being Altcoins minus Ethereum. CoinMarketCap Several Altcoins (e.g., Solana (SOL-USD)) have broken-out on high volume, but not enough of them have risen to qualify for Altcoin season. Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) has risen substantially post-Election, and it's trading at the highest relative strength since 2021. However, these gains may be idiosyncratic - attributed more to Elon Musk. Google Finance If one looks at Google search trends, we can see that interest in Altcoins is growing rapidly. This makes sense because investors research (well, that's the hope!) coins before trading them. Google Trends Lastly, I'm noticing a host of MEME stocks such as Carvana ( CVNA ), long-duration SaaS software companies and small caps that have been outperforming. Creative Planning What could go wrong? A Black Swan Event in any risk asset could halt the Altcoin season, as crypto is an extremely volatile risk asset. The more likely scenario would be if U.S. inflation re-emerges. I think this is a probable event, given that the Fed has been reducing rates too quickly, despite a strong economy and above- target inflation . Evidence of this can be seen in the Yield Curve, which rose sharply after the Fed's initial 50bps rate cut. The Fed implicitly acknowledged this on 11/14/24 in a recent speech . Conclusion I'm seeing ""green-shoots"" prepping us for an Altcoin season, so I published this article, so readers can prepare. There are several highly rated Altcoins, some of which I wrote on SA: Solana ( SOL-USD ), Polkadot ( DOT-USD ). More risk-adverse investors should probably veer no further than Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) as it's considered ""battle-tested"" and it's a favorite amongst large institutional asset managers. Well, that's my two Satoshis!",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737836-bitcoin-passing-the-baton-to-altcoins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36351358.jpeg

The user first received BTC in 2010, when the asset was worth just $0.06 per coin and had a market cap of around $250,000. Trading volume at the time rarely topped $60,000 per day.  Inflows to an exchange typically suggest that the BTC will be liquidated. The transfer follows a trend of dormant bitcoin wallets becoming active in light of the recent market-wide price surge after Donald Trump's U.S. election win earlier this month. Glassnode shows a recent uptick in wallets that have been inactive for more than five years, with the figure reaching a two-month high.  Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,532 after cooling off from a rally that saw it set a record high of $93,214 on Wednesday.  This is not the first time older wallets have woken up as bitcoin started to hit new all-time highs this year. There have been at least two instances this year where millions of BTC from a period of late 2009 to 2011 called the ""Satoshi Era"" were moved from dormant wallets. Whether those bitcoin were sold is hard to gauge, but not impossible given the massive profits the users could reap at current prices.  The trend of more of the older wallets that held bitcoin from its early days coming out of the woodwork could continue, as they might be able to bag massive profits at current price levels. Such moves could limit any additional price upside, even though some traders are still optimistic that bitcoin could reach $100,000‚Äîa key psychological level of resistance‚Äîby year-end.

36352259,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101694,1731684547,MicroStrategy Founder Confident Bitcoin Will Reach $100K in November or December,"Michael Saylor predicts Bitcoin could exceed $100K this year, citing political shifts, institutional backing, and reduced market risks. Bitcoin saw a 1.5% drop in the past 24 hours, signaling profit-taking following a significant rally earlier this week. The cryptocurrency had climbed above $93,000, reaching a high of $93,850 before encountering selling pressure. The pullback led to a dip, with Bitcoin trading around $89,780 after hitting a low of $85,000. Despite this, market sentiment remains optimistic, with industry leaders forecasting further upward momentum.For instance, Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy , has expressed optimism about Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term potential. Speaking with CNBC, he projected that Bitcoin could exceed $100,000 by the end of the year, dismissing the likelihood of significant price drops. Saylor pointed to recent political shifts and institutional backing as critical factors supporting this outlook.https://twitter.com/MSTRUpdates/status/1857181366024093819Highlighting the impact of recent developments, Saylor described a transformative period for Bitcoin, driven by increasing adoption and credibility on Wall Street. He underscored the importance of institutional players like BlackRock in enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and shaping a constructive narrative for digital assets. Saylor also emphasized the positive momentum from pro-business and pro-crypto policies, which he believes will introduce a favorable framework for digital assets in the United States.Notably, Saylor linked Bitcoin‚Äôs prospects to the outcomes of the recent U.S. elections. He indicated that the results have clarified the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the country. According to him, the evolving political landscape has reduced near-term risks for the cryptocurrency market, setting the stage for regulatory clarity and broader institutional participation.Sovereign Adoption Strengthens Bitcoin's CaseIn a separate instance, Matt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm, pointed to Bitcoin‚Äôs growing legitimacy among sovereign nations as a critical driver of its adoption in a recent blog. Huang recalled Paradigm‚Äôs early belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential in 2018 when it was only $4,000 per coin. At the time, doubt prevailed regarding whether Bitcoin would gain adoption by sovereign nations.Fast-forward to today, several nations, including El Salvador, have integrated Bitcoin into their reserves, while Abu Dhabi‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund has ventured into Bitcoin mining.Huang highlighted proposals for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S., underscoring the increasing momentum among policymakers. Prediction platforms estimate a 30% likelihood of such a reserve being formalized. This shift has led to a race among nations to accumulate Bitcoin at favorable entry prices, marking a turning point in its perception as a strategic asset. Huang compared Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption to other transformative technologies that sovereign entities could not afford to ignore.Goldman Sachs Expands Bitcoin ExposureIn related news, institutional interest in Bitcoin also surged, as demonstrated by Goldman Sachs‚Äô increased investment in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The investment bank disclosed $710 million in Bitcoin ETF exposure in a recent SEC filing, making it one of the largest holders of these products. This marks a 70% increase from its previous quarter's $418.65 million exposure.Goldman diversified its portfolio across seven of the eleven available U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. Notable holdings include BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust, with 12.77 million shares valued at $461 million, and Fidelity‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF, which saw a 13% increase in shares. The firm also significantly boosted its holdings in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust by 110%, alongside investments in smaller ETFs such as Bitwise and Ark 21 Shares.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/15/microstrategy-founder-confident-bitcoin-will-reach-100k-in-november-or-december/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=microstrategy-founder-confident-bitcoin-will-reach-100k-in-november-or-december,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
36352257,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101699,1731684530,Pennsylvania Moves to Create Bitcoin Reserve with Up to 10% of $7 Billion in State Funds,"As the second Donald Trump presidency looms, states across the U.S. are looking to embrace cryptocurrencies as part of their financial strategies. Pennsylvania is at the forefront of this movement, with lawmakers introducing groundbreaking legislation to establish the first state-managed Bitcoin reserve. The bill would allow the state‚Äôs treasury to allocate up to 10% of its $7 billion in funds into Bitcoin.The move is part of a broader trend sparked by President-elect Donald Trump's renewed push for the U.S. to become the ""crypto capital of the planet."" As Trump prepares to take office in January, his administration's stance on digital assets fuels optimism within the crypto community.¬†Bitcoin Historic Price ActionSpecifically, Bitcoin's value surged over 35% in the week following Trump‚Äôs election victory. It reached a record high of over $93,400 and a market capitalization surpassing $1.85 trillion. This valuation briefly elevated Bitcoin to the seventh most valuable asset globally, overtaking Saudi Aramco and silver.However, with the recent market-wide pullback, Bitcoin is now at position eight, still above silver. Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill Expected to PassThe Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is the latest effort by state lawmakers to incorporate digital assets into state portfolios. State Rep. Mike Cabell, who sponsored the bill, emphasized that holding Bitcoin in the state‚Äôs reserves would protect Pennsylvania from inflation and diversify its assets beyond cash and bonds.¬†This new initiative follows a similar move in the state last month when the Pennsylvania House passed the Bitcoin Rights Bill. The proposal aims to secure residents' rights to self-custody their crypto assets and use Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method.¬†The Bitcoin Rights Bill is now moving through the Republican-led state Senate, with hopes that Governor Josh Shapiro will sign it into law.Notably, the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is backed by the Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), a group that has been pivotal in promoting Bitcoin legislation in multiple states. SAF founder Dennis Porter expressed confidence that the Bitcoin Rights Bill and the new reserve legislation would succeed.Essentially, Pennsylvania would become the first state to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet if this bill succeeds. This could transform how state governments view and integrate digital assets into their financial strategies.¬†Notably, SAF is currently discussing implementing similar initiatives with lawmakers in 10 other states.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/15/pennsylvania-moves-to-create-bitcoin-reserve-with-up-to-10-of-7-billion-in-state-funds/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pennsylvania-moves-to-create-bitcoin-reserve-with-up-to-10-of-7-billion-in-state-funds,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36348753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653236,1731682824,How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before Rallying Again? Expert Forecast,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced a staggering rally. Over the span of eight days, DOGE surged nearly 200%, reaching a local peak at $0.4385 on Tuesday. This explosive growth propelled the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) to almost 93, signaling strongly overbought conditions. Since then, the Dogecoin price corrected by 19%, trading at $0.37 as of press time. However, according to crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), who has gained significant attention on X for his Dogecoin price analyses, the correction phase may not be over yet. In a series of updates, Kevin addresses how low Dogecoin can go before resuming its upward trajectory. How Low Can Dogecoin Go? ‚ÄúMy first price target and a level we will want to hold for Dogecoin is the $0.30-0.26 range, which is the golden pocket retrace levels,‚Äù Kevin stated. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a 30-40% correction from the local top, which in a bull market is a perfect size correction.‚Äù Related Reading: Buy Dogecoin Now Or Wait? Analyst Points To Key Technical Indicator Kevin further explained the significance of RSI levels in predicting market movements. ‚ÄúA healthy 1-3 week correction/consolidation to cool off indicators would be the most beneficial thing that can happen to Dogecoin. Happened multiple times on the way up in 2020-2021,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúMy opinion still remains this occurs soon based off the technical data I am looking at.‚Äù Drawing parallels to the previous bull market, he added: ‚ÄúBack in the 2020-2021 bull market for Dogecoin, it hit a 90+ on daily RSI three times, each time marking a local top or consolidation period before the next leg up. We just hit 90+ on the daily RSI for the first time, signaling that we potentially have 1-2 more legs up remaining in this bull market before we find the macro top. PS: The second and third legs were both bigger than the first leg.‚Äù On the lower time frames, the Dogecoin price action formed a symmetrical triangle, a chart pattern often associated with periods of consolidation that precede significant price movements. Kevin observed: ‚ÄúTracking this weird Dogecoin symmetrical triangle. Honestly a 50/50 which way this breaks. I still favor the correction due to daily RSI being 90+.‚Äù The symmetrical triangle can serve as either a continuation or a reversal pattern, depending on market conditions. For the Dogecoin price, the breakdown from the triangle aligns with Kevin‚Äôs expectation of a correction due to overbought RSI levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Outperforms Bitcoin: Bloomberg Expert Explains Why To estimate the potential magnitude of the price drop following the breakdown from the symmetrical triangle, traders measure the height of the triangle‚Äôs base‚Äîthe widest part of the formation. This measurement is then projected downward from the point of breakdown, providing a target for the price movement. Applying this method to Dogecoin suggests a correction towards the $0.28 price level, which aligns closely with Kevin‚Äôs analysis targeting the $0.30-$0.26 range. ‚ÄúLooks like the correction I have been calling for the last couple of days is beginning on Dogecoin,‚Äù Kevin confirmed after observing the market movement. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt go straight up, folks. Dips are healthy and reset the indicators so we can go higher. Hopefully nobody gets mad at me anymore for delivering the truth.‚Äù As of press time, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.37, having retraced about 19% from its local top. The price appears to have found temporary support at $0.35, but with the daily RSI only resetting to 80‚Äîstill in overbought territory‚Äîa continuation of the correction cannot be ruled out. ‚ÄúA healthy 1-3 week correction/consolidation to cool off indicators would be the most beneficial thing that can happen to Dogecoin,‚Äù Kevin reiterated. ‚ÄúHappened multiple times on the way up in 2020-2021. My opinion still remains this occurs soon based off the technical data I am looking at.‚Äù Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/how-low-can-dogecoin-go-before-rallying-again/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Sebastien Guillemot, co-founder of Paima Studios, unveiled this innovation in a recent post on X. The demonstration moment spotlighted Midnight‚Äôs capabilities as a privacy-focused addition to Cardano, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced confidentiality.Guillemot expressed excitement about the zkApp demonstration, which ran directly in a browser. He noted the speed and efficiency of proof generation, describing it as a major step toward a future where privacy-centric applications can seamlessly integrate across blockchains.¬†According to Guillemot, a collaboration between Midnight and Paima Studios will simplify the creation of multi-stack dApps. Notably, this would allow developers to combine the strengths of different blockchain ecosystems.¬†For instance, developers could create applications enabling Bitcoin transactions with Cardano-powered assets or allow users to interact with Midnight smart contracts directly from popular wallets like MetaMask. These further show how Midnight‚Äôs ZK technology can expand functionality while maintaining data security.Cardano Founder Reacts Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reacted to Guillemot‚Äôs announcement with a Star Wars-themed GIF. The clip depicted Emperor Palpatine confirming, ‚Äúeverything is proceeding exactly as I have foreseen.‚Äùhttps://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1857242952931946981Notably, the Star Wars meme expressed his confidence that the development of the Midnight protocol and the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) into Cardano were unfolding exactly as envisioned without any major setbacks.Hoskinson shared a similarly optimistic reaction following a development update on Midnight nearly two months ago. The sneak peek, shared by IOG Developer Relations Engineer Steven Lohja, highlighted the ongoing Devnet work on the privacy-focused sidechain.Midnight‚Äôs Role in the Cardano Ecosystem As a Cardano sidechain, Midnight prioritizes privacy and confidentiality, enabling secure interactions while adhering to regulatory requirements. It uses ZKPs to ensure that transactions and sensitive data remain protected without exposing underlying details.¬†This balance between privacy and compliance sets Midnight apart, making it ideal for industries like finance, healthcare, and enterprise applications where data protection is important. While still in development, Cardano proponents expect the Midnight launch to be seamless. The latest disclosure from Guillemot comes nearly two months after the Midnight testnet officially went live , triggering a reaction from Hoskinson.The recent announcement also ties into the broader Midnight testnet development.

42415519,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJic5,1731681299,From Real Estate and Stocks: Former Premier League Player's New-Found Love of Bitcoin,"George Boyd made over 100 Premier League appearances and played in an FA Cup Final in a successful soccer career.  Now he's joined Jacobi Asset Management as a bitcoin ambassador.  Boyd discovered bitcoin in 2020 and sees it as a better savings tool than property or stocks.  George Boyd has had a change of heart. The former Premier League soccer player first heard of bitcoin {{BTC}} when it was just $1,800 and, like most people at the time, dismissed it. He was happy to follow the advice he'd received at the start of his career and put his cash into real estate and stocks.  But the more Boyd, who appeared in more than 100 games for Burnley FC and Hull City, learned, the more his outlook changed. The 39-year-old, who in the course of his career also played in the final of the FA Cup ‚Äî the U.K.'s most prestigious domestic football competition ‚Äî is now an ambassador for Jacobi Asset Management and said he sees bitcoin as a great source of generating generational wealth.  In common with many sportspeople, Premier League players have a shorter career span than the average person who works until they retire in their mid-60s. For professionals like Boyd, it's not just a case of accumulating wealth, but also preserving it.  ‚ÄúSo I had a really good agent who looked after me well,"" Boyd said in an interview. ""His mentality was to start me in property, so I bought into the property market and I've also got a stock portfolio. So that was our sort of general thesis. Now, I try to sell them all and then buy more bitcoin.‚Äù  His journey into bitcoin began in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, although he was initially skeptical of the token and its value. Later, he learned how the current monetary system is driving up inflation and how the old-school mentality of investing through property or savings in a bank doesn‚Äôt work anymore.  ‚ÄúI think that happened with Covid. Your eyes open even more ... I think the monetary system, once you do go around it and with inflation, how it's stealing from us. I've tried to tell friends, and they're still not listening. But bitcoin just fits today. It's more of a store of value,‚Äù Boyd said.  Boyd emphasized the importance of understanding the difference between bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies as well as the benefits of self-custody. He also criticized the traditional financial advice given to soccer players and advocated using bitcoin as a means of creating sustainable wealth.  ‚ÄúWe're not talking [profits], we're talking generational wealth, if you get it right and correct, we're talking about, generations of families being set up for life. I think that's how big it is.‚Äù  Boyd isn't the first sports personality to come out in support of bitcoin. Some, such as the National Football League (NFL)'s Russell Okung, decided to be paid in bitcoin. Others include the NFL's Odell Beckham Jr. and Premier League's Kieran Gibbs, who sat down on the Peter McCormack podcast ‚ÄúWhat Bitcoin Did.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSports people have a very unique earning window in that their capacity to earn is high yet the window in which to do this is low, unlike most careers,"" said Peter Lane, co-founder of Jacobi Asset Management, which listed Europe's first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2023.  ""Retiring in your 30‚Äôs means that you need to make the wealth you‚Äôve accumulated last possibly another 60 years unlike most people who work 40 years to retire for 20 years or so.

Seamless Access to Thalex from Bitfinex Derivatives Thanks to the Thalex integration, Bitfinex Derivatives customers can use their existing accounts and verification to make opening an account with Thalex quicker and easier thanks to KYC-sharing. The integration also makes it easier to transfer assets between your Bitfinex Derivatives and Thalex accounts, allowing you to access both Bitfinex Derivatives‚Äô and Thalex‚Äôs full product suite. Thalex offers Options and Futures which are settled daily in Tether tokens (USD‚ÇÆ), thereby complementing the Bitfinex Derivatives offering. Thalex has trading fees anchored around 1 bps, and gives equal access to advanced trading features and incentives to all traders. The Thalex Integration is Now Live! The integration offers full access to Thalex features and allows traders to access options trading on Thalex from within a verified Bitfinex Derivatives account. Please note that Thalex also offers paper trading on testnet for those who want to try out the platform before deciding to fund live trades. Get Started! An Overview of Thalex‚Äôs Futures and Options Contracts General overview Thalex features include linear options, futures & combinations, contracts are USD-quoted and cash-settled in USD‚ÇÆ, margin from a universal account supporting USD‚ÇÆ, BTC and ETH, and supporting portfolio margin requirements for all contracts per underlying. Perpetuals Thalex has simplified perpetuals in an effort to make funding rates transparent: Funding rate is (Mark ‚Äì Index) / 24h No dampers or caps, hence funding changes linearly with basis Funding is continuously reflected in P&L Futures Futures have been designed to act as a delta-hedge for options: Every option maturity has a corresponding future maturity Simplified funding rates allow for better pricing of futures relative to perpetuals Liquidity in futures is boosted by Implied matching with Perpetuals and Futures Rolls Futures Rolls Futures rolls facilitate, as suggested by their name, rolling a future to a longer maturity with atomic execution of both legs of the trades. This is achieved by creating dedicated order books for each combination of a Perpetual-Future and Future-Future spread. Futures rolls can provide pricing for the convergence or divergence of the cost of carry embedded in Futures‚Äô premia and expected Perpetual funding. Features: Future Roll orders are delta-neutral, which means correspondingly lower margin requirements than orders in outright contracts Futures Roll orders execute as a simultaneous buy and sell of a Perpetual and a Future or two Futures with the same underlying asset Order fills will result in two outright positions in the Perpetual or Future legs Options Thalex offers European, linear option contracts which are stablecoin-settled. This allows options to function as a hedge. A profitable option trade can increase an account‚Äôs USD‚ÇÆ balance through daily settlement and offers traders the choice, not the obligation as with inverse contracts, if and when to rebalance profits into the underlying. Beyond contract specifications, Thalex has put great effort towards providing market makers tools that can help manage their risk such as market maker protection, mass quotes and adequate rate limits and latency. Thalex Market Quality Program Thalex‚Äôs Market Quality Program (MQP) is designed to enhance the platform‚Äôs market liquidity by rewarding participants who contribute to visible liquidity with a substantial monthly reward pool of up to US$200,000. The distribution of rewards is based on a liquidity scoring system that evaluates each participant‚Äôs relative contribution to the order book across various snapshots. This system ensures Thalex has deep, visible liquidity, while simultaneously acting as a taker incentive for market makers to fill top of book limit orders that are placed by positional traders. MQP stands out for its fair and inclusive approach, allowing anyone who adds liquidity to participate and potentially earn rewards from Thalex. There are no barriers to entry.

Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $93,480 this week, pushing the global crypto market cap beyond $3 trillion for the first time since 2021. The rally followed the release of U.S. inflation data, with headline and core inflation meeting expectations at 2.60% and 3.30%, respectively. Market experts are now pricing in an 82.5% likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut in the December FOMC meeting. This shift in monetary policy expectations has bolstered optimism across risk assets, with Bitcoin leading the charge.QCP Projects $120K Bitcoin TargetCommenting on Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive performance this week, QCP attributed Bitcoin's sustained strength to market anticipation of a policy shift under the Trump administration, including proposals for a strategic Bitcoin reserve.The firm suggested that a rotation from gold to Bitcoin could provide a new narrative to support the asset‚Äôs valuation. QCP believes the $100,000 to $120,000 price range may not be too far off following the post-election rally.https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1857254781120582011In addition,¬†QCP also raised concerns about excessive leverage, particularly in altcoins. The firm reported that perpetual funding rates have surged to levels between 50% and 100%, driven by heavy leveraged buying. This heightened leverage amplifies the risk of a potential market-wide deleveraging event, which could exert significant downward pressure on prices.More Bullish Outlooks for BitcoinIn a separate analysis, VanEck's Head of Digital Asset Research, Matthew Sigel, expressed optimism about Bitcoin‚Äôs future price trajectory. Sigel noted parallels between the current rally and Bitcoin's performance in the 2020-2021 cycle, where the asset doubled in value post-election. Since the latest U.S. election, Bitcoin has surged over 30%, with VanEck's proprietary indicators suggesting continued upward momentum.Sigel also pointed to a potential shift in government sentiment towards Bitcoin, emphasizing the pro-Bitcoin stance of key figures in Trump‚Äôs cabinet. Based on these developments, VanEck projects Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of this market cycle, potentially by next year.Similarly, market analyst Rekt Capital highlighted Bitcoin's entry into a ""parabolic upside"" phase. Drawing from historical trends, he suggested this phase could last up to 385 days, indicating substantial room for further gains.

Whales are massively acquiring Dogecoin, leveraging the recent dip to buy the meme coin at a discount. In the past 24 hours, large holders have amassed 160 million DOGE in anticipation of a price uptick.The growing confidence in Dogecoin stems from the meme coin‚Äôs recent price explosion. For context, the dog-themed token recently broke a multi-year price high , appreciating extensively to trade around $0.4316 on November 13. As it dropped from this peak, accumulation has picked up.Whales Buying the Dogecoin DipSeasoned market analyst Ali Martinez disclosed in a tweet today that whales are making the most of the current Dogecoin price consolidation. Citing data from Santiment, he confirmed that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE have topped their stash by 160 million, taking their total tally to 19.91 billion DOGE. Dogecoin Whale Accumulation Notably, the 160 million DOGE were worth $56 million, 23% discounted from the stash‚Äôs value two days ago. The acquisition would have cost the whales a staggering $69 million a few days back, but they have leveraged the dip to buy more of the meme coin at a discount.Meanwhile, another whale was spotted dumping his SPX bags to acquire Dogecoin. Lookonchain reported that the whale sold all his 10.6 million SPX tokens over the past two days at a profit of $920,000.The wallet then used the $6.2 million realized from the sales to buy the DOGE dip. The whale acquired 13.95 million DOGE.Dogecoin Tipped to Surge to New Price DiscoveriesThe growing positive sentiments around Dogecoin have led to speculation of more upsides for the meme coin. Notably, the recent accumulation signals that investors are still betting on DOGE to surge to new price heights.Martinez earlier stated that the price correction was healthy and a prerequisite for a sustained upsurge. The analyst cited historical price corrections in Dogecoin‚Äôs last two bull cycles, noting that they preceded a 9,470% and 30,700% upswing.Following the growing accumulation, Dogecoin could be on its way to new peaks. Analysts have predicted a surge past its current all-time high of $0.7376 to $1 by year-end. Other assertions include an upswing to $2.4, $10, and a lofty $23 target.Meanwhile, Dogecoin trades at $0.3171 at press time, down 5.8% in the past 24 hours.

Analysts and investors have expressed interest in the XRP Ledger, Ripple‚Äôs digital payment platform, due to its increased transaction throughput. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor CryptoQuant recently noted an increase in the NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Ratio of XRP in a post on X (formerly Twitter), which implies that on-chain activity has been increasing. This increasing NVT Ratio may indicate that the XRP network is more active than its current market valuation. Market observers are keeping an eye on the altcoin‚Äôs value and activity, which of late are exhibiting a variety of signals. Despite the network usage‚Äôs surge, XRP price continues to encounter obstacles, with critical resistance levels imminent. XRPL: Spike in NVT Ratio ‚ÄúGiven that the NVT Ratio is a calculation between Market Capitalization (which is stable around $51.1B) and On-chain Transaction Volume, this spike reflects higher transaction volume.‚Äù ‚Äì By @JA_Maartun Read more üëáhttps://t.co/11LKvfGjDQ pic.twitter.com/1tK1M95cKv ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 13, 2024 What‚Äôs The Reason For The Increase In NVT Ratio? A measure of the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of network activity is the NVT Ratio, which is calculated by dividing market capitalization by the volume of on-chain transactions. On November 2, XRP‚Äôs NVT Ratio saw a sharp rise, hitting 1,162 in a comparatively short amount of time. This increase is primarily attributable to a surge in on-chain activity, which resulted in the network processing $44 million in daily transaction traffic, CryptoQuant data shows. So, what does this imply? A high NVT Ratio usually suggests that the market capitalization hasn‚Äôt kept pace with the increased activity in the network, even though the network is in use. With respect to XRP, it implies that the number of transactions is higher, possibly for remittance or other purposes. This increase in activity, however, has not yet translated into an increase in the price of the token. In fact, despite the rise in activity, the market capitalization of XRP has remained relatively constant, close to $51 billion. XRP: $0.75 Resistance In Focus While this is going on, XRP market experts are looking at how the price of the coin changes. For almost a year now, $0.75 has been a strong resistance. A well-known crypto expert, Egrag Crypto, also saw this level as a major obstacle for the token. #XRP at 0.75c ‚Äì The Key Level! by now you are fed up from me talking about $0.75c is crucial!

However, it has not been a simple feat‚ÄîXRP‚Äôs most recent endeavors to surpass this threshold in November 2023, March 2024, and this month were all met with substantial selling pressure. Nevertheless, traders remain optimistic that the heightened network activity and support levels could provide XRP with the necessary boost, despite these setbacks. December Rally December 2024 has the potential to be a transformative month for XRP. Many analysts believe that if XRP closes above $0.60 on a weekly basis, it could establish a ‚Äúwake-up line,‚Äù which could result in increased price gains through the end of the year.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,691.86 +0.76%  Bitcoin (BTC): $90,386.53 -1.21%  Ether (ETH): $3,107.30 -2.48%  S&P 500: 5,949.17 -0.6%  Gold: $2,568.54 +0.01%  Nikkei 225: 38,642.91 +0.28%  Top Stories  Bitcoin pared some of Thursday's losses during the European morning to trade above $90,000. BTC remains over 1% lower in the last 24 hours, a possible sign of profit-taking following its surge above $93,000 earlier in the week. The drop was catalyzed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments that damped hopes of swifter interest-rate cuts. ""The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,"" Powell said in prepared remarks at a Dallas conference. As of Friday, the market is pricing in a 66% chance of a 25 basis-point cut at the December FOMC meeting, down from Thursday‚Äôs 83%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, is 0.66% higher.  Bitcoin ETFs saw $400 million of net outflows on Thursday, their third-highest loss since they listed in January. Fidelity's FBTC saw outflows of $179.2 million, Bitwise BITB saw $113.9 million being drained, Ark's ARKB bled $161. 7 million, while Grayscale's two products notched combined outflows of $74.9 million. Similar to the dip in the underlying asset, ETF outflows may be a sign of investors taking profits. BlackRock's IBIT saw inflows, gaining $126.5 million, continuing the trend of strong interest since Nov. 7. The only days to have seen larger bitcoin ETF outflows ‚Äî May 1 and Nov. 4 ‚Äî both signaled local bottoms before BTC returned to an upward trend.  XRP zoomed 17% in 24 hours to outperform bitcoin and other majors as the shifting U.S. regulatory climate supported growth in tokens previously hampered by the SEC's actions. XRP traded above 82 cents in early Asian trading hours Friday, extending seven-day gains to 50% and reaching levels last seen in June 2023. The jump came as 18 U.S. states filed to sue the SEC and commissioners, including Chairman Gary Gensler, accusing them of unconstitutional overreach of the crypto industry. The speculative optimism among traders is that a crypto-friendly Trump administration could benefit tokens linked to U.S.-based companies, such as Ripple Labs and Uniswap, as the firms are more involved in boosting value for token holders.  Chart of the Day  BTC has recently bounced off the ascending 100-hour SMA accompanied by a renewed positive crossover on the hourly MACD histogram.  This arrangement suggests prices might soon challenge the overhead trendline resistance.  If BTC manages a breakout, we could see new records above $94,000.  On the other hand, if the price dips below the 100-hour SMA support, it might favor a deeper slide toward the 200-hour SMA at $82,600.

36344148,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653193,1731675653,Analysts Bullish On Dogwifhat (WIF) $5 Target As Price Retests $4 Resistance,"Solana-based Memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) is among the tokens leading the crypto market. The cryptocurrency surged over 40% in the last 24 hours, breaking above the $4 resistance zone following its Coinbase listing. As a result, some market watchers forecasted a massive WIF rally before year-end. Related Reading: Market ‚ÄòPricing In A Higher Fair Value‚Äô For Bitcoin As Price Discovery Continues Dogwifhat Rallies 40% Amid Coinbase Listing Dogwifhat has been one of the best-performing memecoins of this cycle, seeing a 2000% surge to its $4.83 all-time high (ATH) in March. The token led the Solana meme frenzy during Q1 but faced a significant 66% price drop in the following months while the market retraced. As the crypto market regained momentum, the token broke above the crucial $2 resistance zone, reclaiming this level as Q3 closed. Since Trump‚Äôs victory in the US presidential elections, WIF has joined the market‚Äôs broader rally, breaking out of an 8-month downtrend. WIF‚Äôs reclaim of the $3 mark earlier this week fueled investors‚Äô bullish sentiment as the token reached levels not seen since June. Moreover, the cryptocurrency experienced a massive 40% rally in the last 24 hours after being listed on a major crypto exchange. On Wednesday, Coinbase announced the listing of Dogwifhat alongside frog-themed memecoin PEPE. The news propelled a massive rally for the dog-themed token, sending its price from the $2.93 weekly low to the $4.00 resistance level. On Thursday morning, the memecoin rallied toward the $4.30 mark, seeing its highest price since early April. Since the listing news, WIF has tried to turn the $4 resistance into support, briefly losing the level as Bitcoin (BTC) retraced to $87,000. Despite the momentary retrace, Dogwifhat remained among the best-performing cryptocurrencies among the top 100 list, seeing a 9.9% increase in the last 24 hours, while the broader market bleed 2.2%. WIF To $5 By Christmas Day? Following its massive performance, some market watchers forecasted a $5 target for the cryptocurrency. Trader Koala suggested that WIF would see a deviation from its 24-hour $3.90-$4.30 range. After the deviation, the analyst stated that the memecoin could see a bounce from the range‚Äôs lows toward the range highs before moving toward the $5 zone. The token has momentarily recovered from the drop below $4, trading at the range‚Äôs lower levels, just 16.4% below its ATH. Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that Dogwifhat could see a rally like Shiba Inu‚Äôs (SHIB) 2021 run. X user Sito noted that SHIB rallied 1800% after being listed in Coinbase, reaching its ATH of $0.00008616 42 days later. Related Reading: Dogecoin Frenzy Arrives In Korea: ‚ÄòKimchi Premium‚Äô Returns Amid DOGE‚Äôs 110% Rally Per the post, WIF could see its surge above the $50 mark if it performs similarly to SHIB‚Äôs price action post-Coinbase listing. Sito pointed out that this would lead to WIF‚Äôs price trading at $52 by Christmas day. Moreover, he detailed that SHIB‚Äôs listing occurred towards the end of the previous bullish cycle, arguing that dogwifhat‚Äôs listing could be ‚Äúeven more bullish as it would allow for more organic growth.‚Äù As of this writing, WIF is trading at $4.05, a 71.6% surge in the last seven days.

36346636,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101598,1731673618,Here‚Äôs Timeline for XRP to Surpass $1 If It Maintains Its Pace of Explosive Gains,"XRP is surging towards $1, with analysts predicting it could hit the milestone soon, driven by bullish momentum and growing market confidence. Last night, XRP broke into the $0.80 region while Bitcoin's bull run cooled. Specifically, XRP's price rose from an intraday low of $0.6844 to as high as $0.8452, marking a one-day gain of 23.5%.At press time, while the broader crypto market is bearish, XRP remains surprisingly strong. While Bitcoin is down 3% and Ethereum has dropped 5%, XRP is defending the gains it accrued on Thursday and trading above the $0.80 price level.Notably, XRP last traded above $0.80 in July 2023 when it triumphed in the SEC lawsuit. Thursday‚Äôs impressive price movement built on the momentum from earlier this week, when XRP first reclaimed the $0.70 level, faced resistance at the $0.75 mark twice , and subsequently retraced.Now, XRP has overcome the $0.75 resistance and is aiming for the long-awaited $1 threshold.When Will XRP Break $1 at This Pace?Given that XRP has been bullish for most of this week, market participants are confident that XRP will reclaim $1 before the week runs out. According to popular crypto commentator ""Crypto Assets Guy,"" if XRP continues its current pace, it could surpass the $1 mark in less than 24 hours.¬†He believes that whales from other chains are finally joining XRP, expressing optimism that this could be the beginning of massive adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). He disclosed that he is accumulating XRP and meme coins in anticipation of a flood of capital entering the XRPL ecosystem shortly.Other market watchers, like Edo Farina, have also expressed optimism that XRP could hit the $1 price point before the end of today.Some analysts believe that once XRP surpasses $1, it could trigger FOMO , convincing more people to invest in the once-underperforming crypto asset. This could lead to even more buying pressure and push XRP higher.Some analysts have even speculated that after overcoming the $1 resistance, XRP could begin its journey toward $10.Likely Reasons Behind XRP‚Äôs PumpThe latest XRP bull run coincides with a recent statement from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, in which he made a subtle but telling hint at his potential departure from the agency.In his speech , Gensler took a notably reflective tone, particularly in his closing remarks, where he expressed deep gratitude for his time at the SEC and acknowledged the honor of serving alongside the agency's dedicated staff.Interestingly, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to fire Gensler from his first days in office. Gensler‚Äôs recent statements subtly hint that this could become a reality.

The leading investment banking firm disclosed the staggering exposure in a Thursday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The $710 million exposure made it one of the largest holders of the January-launched Bitcoin products, offering indirect exposure to the pioneering cryptocurrency.Notably, Goldman Sachs increased its position on the US Bitcoin spot ETFs from the last quarter, indicating the firm‚Äôs warm disposition towards cryptocurrency. The investment bank disclosed it held $418.65 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs in Q2, growing its exposure by nearly 70% in the last quarter.Goldman Sachs Diversify US Spot ETFs ExposureThe banking giant has a diversified portfolio, holding seven of the eleven US Bitcoin ETFs trading in the market. Furthermore, it increased its stash of most of its exposed funds considerably in the third quarter of the year.For context, Goldman Sachs upped its exposure to the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), buying 5.8 million shares in Q3. The funds now hold 12.77 million of IBIT ($461 million), with only Millennium Management‚Äôs $844 million trumping Goldman Sachs‚Äô among public entities.Goldman Sachs increased its stash of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) by 13%, holding 1.72 million ($95.5 million) of the fund as of September 30. The investment bank also bought 110% more of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) stash, cumulatively investing $71.8 million (1.42 million GBTC).Furthermore, Goldman Sachs went down the ETF tree, diversifying into other funds. It increased its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) by an impressive 156%, holding $22.5 million of the Bitcoin investment vehicle.Notably, the firm also holds shares of the Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the WisdomeTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), and the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) worth a combined $59 million.Surging Institutional Appetite Towards BitcoinMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs is one of the many institutions heavily invested in the Bitcoin spot ETFs. The Q3 financial reports show several large banks and pension funds have gained exposure to Bitcoin investment funds.For instance, Morgan Stanley recorded holding $272 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Leading banks, such as HSBC and USB, also once reported $3.6 million and $300,000 in exposure to the products.The ETF fever also reached State funds, as Michigan and Wisconsin disclosed exposure to Bitcoin spot funds.

This choice adds a high-profile and somewhat polarizing figure to Trump‚Äôs cabinet, highlighting the president‚Äôs intent to bring about significant changes to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Gaetz, a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency and blockchain, has gained media attention for his progressive stance on digital assets and government oversight, and his recent proposal allowing U.S. citizens to pay federal income taxes in Bitcoin. His appointment reflects Trump‚Äôs vision of shaping a more crypto-friendly government while aiming to dismantle what he describes as a ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù DOJ. It will be an honor to serve as President Trump‚Äôs Attorney General! pic.twitter.com/dg0iQ0bA6Y ‚Äî Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) November 13, 2024 Gaetz‚Äôs selection is among the most notable announcements made by Trump in recent weeks. Known for his strong Republican values and willingness to challenge the status quo, Gaetz has a record of supporting reform within the justice system and opposing the current administration‚Äôs approach to federal oversight. He is particularly remembered for his role in pushing for the removal of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, displaying his influence and bold stance within Republican circles. Trump praised Gaetz, calling him a ‚Äútenacious and gifted attorney,‚Äù and commended his work in Congress to hold the justice system accountable and press for meaningful reform. As Attorney General, Gaetz is expected to bring his unique perspective to the DOJ , particularly around issues involving federal control, digital assets, and cryptocurrency regulations. His track record suggests that he may advocate for increased freedom within the financial sector and reduced federal intervention, aligning with Trump‚Äôs goal of reshaping the DOJ to better reflect a hands-off, conservative approach to governance. This nomination underscores Trump‚Äôs continued focus on assembling a team that will challenge conventional policies and support his agenda for a more decentralized government. Gaetz‚Äôs stance on cryptocurrency, combined with his criticism of the Biden administration‚Äôs handling of the DOJ, suggests that his influence could lead to a shift in how digital assets are viewed and regulated at the federal level. This could create a favorable climate for crypto enthusiasts and blockchain advocates in the U.S., possibly encouraging wider adoption of digital assets and innovative financial technologies. The appointment of Gaetz is likely to draw both support and criticism, given his outspoken nature and sometimes controversial actions. Nevertheless, for Trump , Gaetz embodies the qualities needed to reshape the justice system and address perceived imbalances in federal authority. Gaetz‚Äôs tenure could pave the way for a DOJ that is more supportive of emerging technologies while focusing on what Trump has described as the need to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù federal operations.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-picks-matt-gaetz-as-attorney-general-to-shake-up-doj,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36342235.jpeg

Bitcoin Retail Interest Has Returned In Explosive Fashion Bitcoin has witnessed a massive surge recently and has come closer to the $100,000 dream target than many had expected. Investor interest in the asset had cooled off during the cryptocurrency‚Äôs endless consolidation, but with a rally like this, it has naturally made a return. In the context of the current discussion, the investor focus segment is retail, which includes the smallest of the holders. The first metric that would hint at a return of these investors in the market is the New Addresses, which keeps track of the total amount of BTC addresses coming online for the first time. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Co. Take Over Social Media: Why Memecoin Frenzy Is Bad For Bitcoin As the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has pointed out in an X post, the Bitcoin New Addresses have witnessed a sharp increase recently, suggesting a large amount of address creation. The New Addresses can register an uptick when new investors join the network or when old ones who had sold earlier come back to the asset. The metric also goes up when existing users create multiple wallets for privacy. However, when a surge occurs at a scale like the recent one, the former is more likely to be the reason. Thus, the latest trend in the indicator could imply a high amount of fresh adoption for the cryptocurrency. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin New Addresses recently hit a high of 442,000, the highest daily value since March of this year. Large investors are also likely joining the network right now, but their number certainly wouldn‚Äôt be too high, so this adoption must come from retail investors. Another indicator, the Retail Investor Demand 30D Change, provides us with information about the activity of existing and newcomer retail investors right now. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has explained in an X post, this indicator has also recently shot up. This metric tracks retail investor demand through transaction volume. Since the members of this cohort carry balance amounts that aren‚Äôt too significant, their transfers tend to involve small values as well. As such, their volume can be measured by only involving data of the transfers valued at less than $10,000. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that the 30-day change in the volume of retail investors has recently seen a large positive spike to levels not seen in more than four years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets Record $93,000 High As Extreme Greed Level Hits 84 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to ignore that retail trading is fully back, with Dogecoin surging, high funding rates, and a spike in Google searches for Bitcoin,‚Äù notes the analyst.

Sponsored by Republican Representatives Mike Cabell and Aaron Kaufer, this proposal aims to leverage bitcoin as a ‚Äúhedge against inflation,‚Äù providing the state with a potential tool to protect against economic uncertainty. In a memo, Cabell highlighted that various financial institutions and even governments, including the U.S., have invested in Bitcoin to safeguard their portfolios from economic fluctuations. Major investment firms like BlackRock , Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton now offer Bitcoin options, and some states, such as Wisconsin, have started making strategic digital asset investments. Cabell argues that holding a small portion of reserves in Bitcoin could help create a well-diversified and resilient portfolio for Pennsylvania. The bill follows a similar federal-level proposal by Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, known as the BITCOIN Act, which stands for ""Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act of 2024."" Lummis‚Äôs bill encourages U.S. states and federal agencies to invest in bitcoin, providing a pathway for broader public sector involvement in the digital asset market. Sen. Lummis, a long-time supporter and holder of bitcoin, has voiced strong support for the crypto industry. She believes her proposal could gain bipartisan support and pass within the first 100 days of the incoming Trump administration, pointing to President-elect Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance. In a recent statement, Lummis called on public support to help pass the Bitcoin Act , asserting that it would strengthen America‚Äôs financial stability. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act marks Pennsylvania‚Äôs entry into the growing trend of government interest in digital assets, joining a movement where states see crypto investments as a potential strategy for safeguarding financial assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/pennsylvania-pushes-bill-to-invest-in-bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36341274.jpeg

This de minimis allowance would help avoid conflicts of interest while giving regulators a practical understanding of digital assets , which could lead to more informed policy decisions. In a letter sent on November 13 to Shelley Finlayson, Acting Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), the Chamber formally requested the overturn of OGE Legal Advisory 22-04 , which prohibits federal employees from owning cryptocurrency, including stablecoins. The rule was enacted in 2022 under the Biden administration due to concerns that employees might use their positions to benefit financially from crypto holdings. The Chamber argues that allowing limited crypto holdings‚Äîsimilar to the rules for other asset classes‚Äîwould enable federal employees to have a closer look at the digital asset industry, promoting a better understanding of the sector they regulate. Cody Carbone, the Chamber‚Äôs president, suggested that allowing employees to hold a small, safe amount of cryptocurrency would create a fairer approach to handling potential conflicts of interest, aligning with how other financial assets are managed. The Chamber also highlighted that lifting the ban could have broader advantages, helping policymakers gain insight into emerging technologies and supporting well-informed regulation. In addition to the letter, the Chamber released a report on November 12 advocating for clearer rules around USD-backed stablecoins . The report, titled ‚ÄúHow Stablecoins are Extending US Dollar Dominance: A Policymaker‚Äôs Guide to Action,‚Äù emphasizes that over 98% of stablecoins are linked to the U.S. dollar. The Chamber suggests that promoting stablecoin use would strengthen the dollar‚Äôs role in global finance and expand access to financial services in developing markets. By supporting stablecoins pegged to the dollar, the Chamber believes the U.S. could solidify the dollar‚Äôs dominance and counter competitive financial systems from other nations. This would allow the U.S. to maintain its influence over global monetary systems and ensure the dollar's continued relevance in an evolving financial landscape.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/digital-chamber-pushes-to-lift-crypto-ban-for-federal-workers,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36340262.jpeg

With around $3.4 billion in Bitcoin and $581 million in Ethereum options on the line, traders are gearing up for possible fluctuations in price as both assets have recently seen declines. Bitcoin's put-to-call ratio stands at 0.85 , suggesting an optimistic outlook despite recent pullbacks, while Ethereum‚Äôs ratio of 0.92 indicates a similar sentiment among investors. These ratios, both below 1, imply that there are more bets on rising prices (calls) than falling prices (puts), reflecting a generally bullish mood in the market. However, short-term price swings are still anticipated, as the expiration of options often stirs up market movement. For Bitcoin, today‚Äôs expiring contracts include a significant number with a ""maximum pain"" point‚Äîa price level that inflicts the greatest financial loss on options holders‚Äîpotentially guiding price behavior as contracts approach expiration. The same is true for Ethereum, where the maximum pain price often plays a pivotal role in shaping end-of-contract price movements. Data from Deribit shows a drop in expiring Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts compared to last week, yet the volume remains substantial enough to influence market trends. This high-stakes expiration could create a burst of volatility that may briefly disrupt the market, but experts believe conditions will stabilize as traders adapt to post-expiration prices. Market influencers urge caution , warning that volatility is likely in the short term, yet the market could recover quickly. Looking ahead, more options expirations are scheduled, especially in late December, which could influence the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum as we move into 2025. Historically, large-scale Bitcoin options expirations near the end of the year have been key moments, often impacting the asset‚Äôs direction as traders adjust their strategies. Some analysts speculate that if this trend holds, Bitcoin might target new highs, while bears aim to keep prices within a controlled range. End-of-year expirations present a major event for crypto markets , as they have often coincided with significant price shifts. This December's options, with billions of dollars at stake, could set the tone for the beginning of the new year. If bullish momentum persists, Bitcoin‚Äôs journey toward higher prices may continue, with optimism growing around a potential six-figure target. Meanwhile, some traders are cautious, positioning themselves for potential downturns. As expiration dates approach, a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish positions could intensify, potentially shaping the market for months to come. Analysts note that while some major players are bullish, many traders remain cautious or are betting on price decreases, making the market highly fragmented and unpredictable. For now, traders should brace for potential turbulence as options expire, with the market adapting shortly after. The influence of these expirations could ripple into the coming months, with the possibility of significant shifts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum as 2025 approaches.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/traders-brace-as-crypto-market-faces-4-billion-bitcoin-and-ethereum-expiry,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36339829.jpeg

Coinbase has soared to ninth place globally in app store rankings , up from 435th just days earlier. This dramatic rise reflects a renewed enthusiasm among retail investors, eager to capitalize on the ongoing Bitcoin rally. Robinhood, a popular platform for both stock and crypto trading, also climbed to 13th in the rankings. Meanwhile, CashApp, another trading platform, currently sits at 30th. These shifts indicate growing demand for user-friendly platforms that provide easy access to cryptocurrency investments. Historically, Bitcoin price increases often lead to a surge in app downloads as retail investors flock to participate in the market. This isn‚Äôt the first time Coinbase has seen such momentum. In March 2024, it briefly re-entered the top 100 apps for the first time in two years, marking the start of a resurgence. Now, its entry into the top 10 highlights a significant wave of renewed retail adoption , largely driven by Bitcoin's performance. The trend also signals optimism about broader crypto market growth. Robinhood's dual appeal as a platform for both stocks and crypto trading is drawing in more users. The app, traditionally known for stock trading, is now leveraging the demand for cryptocurrencies. This shows that retail investors are increasingly seeking platforms that combine simplicity and functionality for their investments. As Bitcoin prices rise, apps catering to retail demand are likely to continue gaining traction. Bitcoin‚Äôs influence on app rankings is undeniable. An analyst recently noted that Coinbase‚Äôs app store ranking has been climbing rapidly, with a seven-day moving average of 191 on November 11. Historically, Coinbase reached the top spot during previous Bitcoin peaks in December 2017, April 2021, and November 2021. This pattern suggests that the current momentum could continue, potentially driving even more downloads in the coming weeks. Betting platform Polymarket has also picked up on the trend. Users estimate a 58% chance that Coinbase will remain in the top 10 free apps by mid-November. App store rankings often mirror market sentiment, signaling increased interest and participation from retail investors. When crypto trading apps rise in popularity, it hints at growing enthusiasm and the possibility of a broader market rally. This renewed interest in crypto trading highlights the vibrancy of the market and the responsiveness of retail investors to price movements. If the trend continues, more crypto trading apps could see similar growth, attracting a new wave of investors eager to capitalize on the cryptocurrency market's potential.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-boom-rockets-coinbase-robinhood-in-app-rankings,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36338871.jpeg

As Bitcoin lingers near the $89,000 mark, Cardano shows a massive recovery of nearly 40% in the last seven days. The market cap of Cardano recently crossed the $20 billion mark and is currently trading near the $0.60 psychological mark.¬†As Cardano's bullish recovery gains momentum, let's find out the chances of it reaching the $1 psychological mark. With a massive bullish recovery ready to regain momentum, will Cardano cross the $0.60 barrier?Cardano Price AnalysisCardano shows a massive bull run in action on the daily chart. With the broader market recovery, ADA formed seven consecutive bullish candles, accounting for an 88% rise. The bull run extended from $0.32 to a peak above $0.61. Cardano Price Chart However, the bull run failed to surpass the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $0.69, resulting in a quick retest of the 67.80% level at $0.548. However, with lower price action, the bullish recovery in Cardano resurfaces.¬†Currently, it is trading at $0.594 with an intraday gain of 2.41%. However, the higher price action in the intraday candle reveals a massive overhead supply.¬†Hence, the current price action projects a potential sideways trend between the 61.80% and 78.60% Fibonacci levels. Amid the recent recovery, the 50- and 200-day EMA lines have given a golden crossover.¬†Furthermore, the uptick in the 100-day SMA line teases a quick trend reversal and a potential crossover above the 200-day EMA. The intraday recovery keeps the MACD and signal lines in positive alignment as the bullish histograms resurface.¬†Will Cardano Hit $1?If the broader market recovers, the breakout above the 78.60% Fibonacci level could result in a price jump to the $0.77 mark. This increases the possibility of a new 52-week high and puts the next price target at the 1.27 Fibonacci level.¬†The Fibonacci level is extremely close to the $1.00 psychological mark, making it a potentially achievable target in this 2024 bull run. Conversely, the breakout below the 61.80% Fibonacci level paints the $0.50 mark as a potential psychological support.

36338380,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653179,1731666655,Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally,"Bitcoin has continued its bullish momentum streak, reaching a new all-time high on November 13 and triggering a wave of activity across the crypto market. In particular, the futures market has been significantly impacted, with a surge in trading volume for the BTC/USDT pair. This increase has highlighted an intense period of market engagement, with leading exchanges, particularly Binance, at the forefront of this trading frenzy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone ‚Äì Last Time BTC Soared 80% Record Trading Volumes And Market Volatility Risks A CryptoQuant analyst known as Crazzyblockk shared insights into the trading frenzy phenomenon, noting that the futures market for Bitcoin has become ‚Äúexceptionally overheated.‚Äù According to the analyst‚Äôs recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, trading volume has surged across both spot and futures markets on major centralized exchanges. The cumulative trading volume for BTC/USDT across all major platforms has reached an amount of roughly $129 billion, with Binance contributing a substantial $50.2 billion to this figure. The surge in futures trading activity has raised important questions about market stability and the potential for heightened volatility. As Crazzyblockk explained, when Bitcoin‚Äôs derivatives market experiences rapid growth, particularly in the futures segment, there is often a tendency for heightened market fluctuations. The CryptoQuant analyst added: While this can briefly boost demand, it often leads to minor pullbacks and sharp fluctuations. The analyst emphasized that the ‚Äúoverheated‚Äù state of the market warrants caution from investors and traders. In his words: Given the current climate, it would be wise for investors and traders to exercise caution, refrain from rushed speculation, and await a period of price stability before making further moves. Outlook On Bitcoin Bitcoin is facing a noticeable decline in price, dropping by 6.1% in the past day to a current trading price of $87,977. This ongoing drop in price comes after it recently achieved an all-time high above $93,000, as recorded yesterday. With BTC back to trading below the $88,000 region, the asset has now decreased 5.9% away from its peak. While the reason behind this ongoing correction is not certain, renowned crypto analyst Ali has recently highlighted an interesting BTC trend behind the scenes. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Move Millions To Binance‚ÄîIs A Market Correction Imminent?

36338212,https://square.htx.com/?p=41487,1731666431,Behind the Full-Fledged Crypto Boom: From Policy Impact to Celebrity Influence,"Recently, the crypto market has seen a new wave of price surges, with mainstream cryptos like BTC , ETH, SOL, and DOGE all registering significant increases. In addition, there are numerous wealth-creation stories in the memecoin sector. What exactly is behind this market upswing? Apart from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy shifts, Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection as U.S. President and statements from prominent figures like Elon Musk have also fueled this market momentum. This article will analyze the price increases of mainstream cryptos and the forces propelling them by taking into account the market performance. A Blistering Market Rally: Has a Bull Market Officially Begun? 1. Bitcoin (BTC) As the leading crypto in the market, Bitcoin has performed impressively in this cycle, with its price surpassing several critical thresholds, shoring up overall market sentiment. On November 13, according to HTX data, Bitcoin surpassed the $90,000 mark for the first time, setting a new record high at $93,200. Bitcoin‚Äôs surge is inseparable from the return of institutional investors. In particular, Trump‚Äôs reelection as the U.S. president has boosted market confidence. With expectations for Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù and ‚Äúfree-market‚Äù policies, investors have a greater demand for Bitcoin, which is regarded as digital gold. 2. Ethereum (ETH) As the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum has also experienced a sharp price increase in this cycle. On November 12, data from 8marketcap showed that Ethereum‚Äôs market cap rose to around $400.07 billion, surpassing Procter & Gamble and ranking 32nd globally in terms of market cap. A key factor behind ETH‚Äôs growth is its expanding ecosystem and technical strengths, especially the ongoing implementation of Layer 2 scaling solutions, which have significantly improved transaction speeds and reduced costs. In addition, Ethereum‚Äôs staking mechanism and growing application cases for DeFi and NFTs have contributed to its steady price appreciation. 3. Solana (SOL) On November 10, as revealed by DeFiLlama data, Solana‚Äôs on-chain DEX transactions totaled $14.533 billion over the past week, overtaking Ethereum‚Äôs on-chain DEX transaction volume of $13.779 billion. Solana, which has delivered a strong performance recently, has been actively committed to areas such as DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi and has attracted a large base of users and developers. As a high-speed, low-cost public blockchain, Solana has gradually become the top choice for various applications. With the market confidence in the Solana ecosystem, coupled with continued support from major exchanges, SOL‚Äôs price has soared in this cycle, with a 7-day increase of 27.83%, pushing its price back up to around $210 and making it a standout performer. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) As a crypto with strong community involvement, Dogecoin‚Äôs surge also deserves attention. On November 12, HTX data indicated that DOGE broke the $0.40 mark with a 24-hour increase of over 45.52%. Its current market cap is $60.3 billion, placing it fifth among cryptos by market cap (excluding stablecoins). DOGE‚Äôs price is often heavily influenced by social media and celebrity remarks. In particular, tweets from Tesla founder Elon Musk have once again ignited market enthusiasm. Musk has not only frequently mentioned Dogecoin in public but has even hinted that Tesla might support DOGE payments, generating substantial interest around the token. Endorsed by Musk, DOGE‚Äôs price has surged dramatically in the short term, demonstrating its strong appeal in the market. Analysis of the Reasons Behind the Full-Fledged Crypto Boom Impact of the Macroeconomic Environment Global economic uncertainties and mounted inflationary pressures have driven investors to seek broader safe-haven assets, diverting investors‚Äô attention back to the crypto market. Against the backdrop of Trump‚Äôs reelection and heightened policy uncertainty, crypto assets have become an option for investors to hedge risks. Fluctuations in the dollar‚Äôs exchange rate and shifts in international capital flows have lent further support to the crypto market. Changes in Federal Reserve‚Äôs Crypto Policies The Federal Reserve has recently adjusted its policy stance on cryptocurrency, emphasizing the need to allow room for innovation while ensuring proper regulation. This attitude has boosted market confidence, motivating institutional and retail investors to enter the market. This relatively relaxed policy stance suggests that the Fed may delay imposing stringent regulatory measures on the crypto industry and leave more space for market growth. Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Development Technological innovations on mainstream public blockchains like Ethereum 2.0 and Solana have been key pillars supporting this market momentum. The implementation of Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 scaling solutions has optimized network performance, lowered transaction fees, and invigorated the DeFi ecosystem. Solana‚Äôs technical features have contributed to its rapid growth in the NFT and GameFi sectors. This diverse ecosystem has attracted numerous developers, fostering a virtuous cycle and fuelling market enthusiasm. Social Media and Celebrity Influence A distinctive feature of the crypto market is the influence of communities and social media, especially celebrities‚Äô direct impact on market sentiment. Elon Musk‚Äôs ongoing support for DOGE on social media has put DOGE at the center of market attention, attracting related investors. Furthermore, Trump calls for a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù as he returns to politics, which resonates well with the decentralization concept. This, along with the Fed‚Äôs relatively relaxed regulatory stance, has driven up market enthusiasm as well as Bitcoin‚Äôs price. This surge in the crypto market is not just the result of capital inflows, but rather a product of the interplay between technological innovation, changes in the macroeconomic environment, institutional positioning and the celebrity effect. After this round of sharp rise, the market may face profit-taking pressures in the short term. Key assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum may fluctuate in the short run after breaking critical price levels. As the market gradually regains rationality, prices may adjust around recent highs, so investors should be cautious of a potential short-term pullback.

In a Thursday disclosure, FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett confirmed the lawsuit, signed by the Attorney Generals of the 18 US States and filed¬†at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, Frankfort Division.Notably, the plaintiffs accuse the US SEC and Gensler of imposing laws beyond their jurisdiction and, hence, wrestling regulatory authorities off the states.¬†Interestingly, Republican Attorneys represented the 18 US States, including Nebraska, Tennessee, West Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Florida , and Montana, in collaboration with the DeFi Education Funds.SEC Charged for Regulatory OverreachThe 18 States accused the US SEC of regulatory authority overreach and a conscious ploy to scuffle the growth of the nascent digital asset industry. They claim the agency has, under its Chair Gensler, bypassed due authorization.The plaintiff argued that cryptocurrency regulation has been under the State, which has enacted laws based on its local demands. The lawsuit also noted that Congress has repeatedly refused federal regulators the right to oversee the emerging industry.However, the US SEC and Gensler have overridden due procedures to unconstitutionally regulate the crypto industry. Adding to the infringement, the agency has unfairly prosecuted the sector through a series of enforcement actions.

The digital asset briefly crossed the $0.80 mark, spurred by a combination of regulatory developments and strategic initiatives from Ripple.¬†Notably, two developments that have coincided with XRP's surge are speculation around the potential resignation of U.S. SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Ripple‚Äôs readiness to launch its anticipated stablecoin, RLUSD.SEC Chair Signals Possible ExitIn a recent address, Gensler reflected on his tenure, emphasizing the SEC‚Äôs commitment to maintaining the integrity of U.S. financial markets. He cited regulatory advancements under his leadership, including reforms to the Treasury and equity markets.¬†Gensler highlighted the agency's ongoing enforcement efforts in the crypto sector, revealing that crypto-related cases have accounted for approximately 5% to 7% of total enforcement actions since 2018. Gensler underscored the SEC's position on Bitcoin, affirming it is not classified as a security, a stance previously shared by former SEC Chair Jay Clayton. Meanwhile, he emphasized the regulatory scrutiny on other digital assets, reiterating the need for clear distinctions within the market.In his closing remarks, Gensler suggested a potential departure. He acknowledged the contributions of SEC staff and expressed gratitude for his time in public service. Since his appointment in 2021, Gensler has overseen initiatives to modernize regulations, focusing on the rapidly evolving crypto sector.Ripple Ready for RLUSD LaunchMeanwhile, Ripple's plans to introduce RLUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, have also contributed to XRP‚Äôs recent momentum. The company has processed over $70 billion in payments through its blockchain technology, and RLUSD aims to enhance its offerings with a focus on speed, security, and cost efficiency.¬†https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/1857208643948609954Ripple‚Äôs President, Monica Long, highlighted that RLUSD would cater to growing demand in regions such as APAC, the EU, and Australia. Notably, the stablecoin will be issued on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain, providing developers with expanded use cases, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi).Transparency Drive RLUSD ReadinessFurther, Ripple intends to launch RLUSD under a New York Trust license following its acquisition of Standard Custody, which provides a stronger regulatory framework than a money transfer license (MTL).¬†New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) guidelines mandate that stablecoin issuers, including Ripple, hold reserves equal to at least 100% of the value of outstanding stablecoins backed by low-risk, highly liquid assets.

Spiderchain's builder, Botanix Labs, developed the blockchain to be compatible with other networks that use EVM, the software that powers Ethereum and enables smart contracts.  Aave, the largest decentralized-finance (DeFi) lending platform, is canvassing its community to gauge the level of interest in deploying on the Bitcoin layer-2 network Spiderchain.  The Aave-Chain Initiative (ACI), the driving force behind the protocol, published a call for comments on the proposal by Spiderchain developer Botanix Labs to expand the lender with more than $17 billion in total value locked into the emerging Bitcoin DeFi environment.  The idea of deploying on a Bitcoin layer 2 highlights the appetite for bringing functionality that is common elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem to the original blockchain. The bitcoin {{BTC}} price soared above $90,000 for the first time this week, reaching an all-time high of $93,445, as its dominance of the crypto industry reached 61.38%. Developers of projects native to other networks may be seeking to harness the deep reserves that are held in BTC.  Botanix Labs developed Spiderchain to be compatible with protocols that use Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers Ethereum and enables smart contracts. Botanix's goal is to allow any Ethereum-based application to be compatible with Bitcoin.  After feedback is gathered, the protocol will need to identify and mitigate potential security risks. ACI hasn't offered any expected timescale for this process.  Aave's native token (AAVE) has fallen just under 8% in the last 24 hours to just under $168, according to CoinDesk Indices. This drop is likely a reflection of the broad pullback across the crypto industry following BTC's surge above $90,000 on Wednesday.

36335164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653090,1731661202,Dogecoin & Co. Take Over Social Media: Why Memecoin Frenzy Is Bad For Bitcoin,"Data shows Dogecoin and other meme coins are receiving a significant amount of attention on social media, a sign that may not be ideal for Bitcoin. Top 6 Memecoins Have Seen Their Social Dominance Rocket Up Recently In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the trend in the Social Dominance for a few different subsections of the cryptocurrency sector. The ‚ÄúSocial Dominance‚Äù here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about the mindshare that a particular asset or a group of coins has on the major social media platforms right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets Record $93,000 High As Extreme Greed Level Hits 84 More formally, the metric‚Äôs value is calculated as a percentage of the discussions related to the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap that the given asset is making up for. To determine this, the indicator collects posts/threads/messages available on five platforms: X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, and BitcoinTalk. It then filters them for the keyword in question. Note that for measuring the ‚Äúdiscussion,‚Äù the metric simply counts up these posts containing at least one mention of the asset, rather than counting up the mentions themselves. The advantage of this methodology is that outlier posts containing hundreds of mentions don‚Äôt skew the data. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the Social Dominance related to three subsections of the market has changed over the last few months: The three segments in question are the layer 1 top six, the layer 2 top six, and the memecoin top 6. ‚ÄúLayer 1‚Äù networks refer to the primary blockchains that handle their own security, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Networks like Polygon that are built on top of these chains are known as ‚Äúlayer 2.‚Äù Naturally, the meme coins refer to the popular meme-based tokens, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. From the graph, it‚Äôs apparent that the Social Dominance of the layer 1 top 6 had rocketed up a couple of days back as a result of Bitcoin setting multiple new all-time highs (ATHs). BTC has continued to explore new highs since then, but it appears that the focus of social media users has shifted elsewhere, with the Social Dominance of the layer 1 giants witnessing a cooldown. The indicator has stayed relatively low for the layer 2 coins throughout this, implying the traders haven‚Äôt been caring much about them recently. The assets that have hogged all the attention have been the memecoins, who have just seen their discussion hit a new record. The reason behind this high interest in these tokens is the impressive rally that Dogecoin has seen over the past week, leaving the rest of the sector in the dust after amassing profits of more than 104%. If the past is anything to go by, though, this outperformance may not be such a good thing. ‚ÄúHistorically high speculative asset social dominance typically indicates greed and emotional trading,‚Äù notes Santiment. Assets in the cryptocurrency sector tend to move opposite to the crowd‚Äôs beliefs, so greed is something that has generally led to tops for the market. Related Reading: XRP NVT Ratio Has Been High Recently: What It Means As such, it‚Äôs possible that a shift in focus away from Dogecoin may have to happen, if Bitcoin and others have to continue their bull run. Dogecoin Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.398, up over 2% in the last 24 hours.

Could this lead to a new swing high at $0.25? The Algorand price action shows a bullish comeback gaining momentum. Surpassing a long-coming resistance trend line, the V-shaped reversal in ALGO prices shows an impressive bull run in action.Will this bullish recovery result in a breakout rally above $0.1630? Let‚Äôs find out.Bull Run in Algorand hits $0.16The bull run began with a Morning Star pattern near the psychological $0.10 level, propelling ALGO's market value by 44% over the last 10 days. Currently, ALGO is trading at $0.1457, with an intraday gain of 8.37%. ALGO Price Chart The recovery run forms a bullish engulfing candle that completes the morning star pattern. The crucial pattern is formed near the support confluence of the 200-day EMA line and the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.1391. This pattern suggests strong underlying demand, fueling the ongoing rally.At present, ALGO is facing resistance at the 38.20% Fibonacci level, which sits at $0.1630. This level has been significant in the past, as it led to a double-top reversal in July. However, with the recent bullish engulfing candle, the likelihood of a breakout is much higher.In addition, ALGO is gaining momentum after breaking through the trendline resistance, signaling further upside potential.EMA Crossovers and MACD Support Bullish MomentumAs the bullish trend gathers steam, the 50-day and 100-day EMA lines are nearing a bullish crossover. Furthermore, the price has ascended above the 200-day EMA, further strengthening the bullish outlook.The MACD and signal lines are showing an increase in bullish momentum, confirmed by the resurgence of positive histograms. These technical indicators support the thesis that the bullish trend in Algorand is likely to continue.Will Algorand Cross $0.20?If the rally extends beyond the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $0.1630, it could trigger a significant bullish surge. The next key resistance to watch is the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $0.2106, which could mark the next major target in the rally.Further upside could see ALGO reaching the $0.25 psychological level, aligning with the 78.60% Fibonacci retracement.On the downside, the crucial support level to watch is $0.1391, which corresponds with the 23.60% Fibonacci level.",POSITIVE,ALGO,ALGO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/15/algorand-breakout-rally-eyes-0-25-key-resistance-at-0-1630/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=algorand-breakout-rally-eyes-0-25-key-resistance-at-0-1630,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In a startling development, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler released a statement yesterday hinting at his potential departure from the commission. However, he failed to definitively confirm this.Gensler Hints at Leaving the SEC¬†In his remarks , Gensler emphasized the need to update the ‚Äòrules of the road‚Äô across treasury and equity markets, as well as disclosure and corporate governance.¬†Gensler also commented on his efforts in the crypto sector, noting that he inherited 80 enforcement actions, including the Ripple lawsuit, from the previous administration led by Jay Clayton. He maintained that most cryptocurrencies have no use case other than speculative trading and potential use for illicit activities.¬†The aspect of his remark that caught the attention of the broader crypto community was the hint that he could be leaving the SEC.¬†He expressed this view at the end of his speech, conveying a sense of accomplishment in elevating the U.S. capital market with other ‚Äòremarkable SEC staff.‚Äô¬†The statement, which seemed like a farewell message, has triggered speculation that Gensler could be planning to leave the SEC before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, slated for January 20. Recall that Trump promised to fire Gensler on the first day of his administration.¬†Ripple CEO and MicroStrategy Chairman React¬†As expected, Gensler‚Äôs potential exit elicited positive reactions within the crypto community. Ripple CEO Garlinghouse and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor commented on how Gensler‚Äôs exit might impact the crypto industry.¬†In an X post yesterday, the Ripple CEO indicated that Gensler may soon leave the commission, emphasizing that the SEC boss is in his ‚Äúlast days in office.‚Äù Celebrating Gensler‚Äôs potential exit, Garlinghouse wore a T-Shirt with the caption ‚ÄòF**k The SEC‚Äô to Cantor‚Äôs Annual Crypto Conference.Furthermore, Garlinghouse suggested that the United States is close to becoming the crypto capital of the world under Trump‚Äôs administration.¬†This suggests that Garlinghouse expects Trump to appoint a pro-crypto SEC chairperson, unlike Gensler, whom he criticized for waging a war against the industry.¬†Meanwhile, Saylor characterized Gensler‚Äôs departure from the SEC as incredibly bullish for the broader digital asset industry during his latest interview on CNBC.¬†He said Gensler‚Äôs exit would pave the way for a digital asset framework and pro-Bitcoin policies. He also suggested that the exit would end the SEC‚Äôs war against crypto.¬†XRP Explodes Amid Gensler Exit Rumors¬†Under Gensler‚Äôs leadership, the SEC has been aggressive toward crypto, introducing several enforcement actions and labeling most tokens as securities.¬†Given Gensler‚Äôs hostile approach against the industry, investors and other stakeholders consider his potential exit from the SEC as a major win for crypto.¬†Specifically, XRP enthusiasts speculate that his exit could lead to a settlement of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. Recall that the SEC appealed the Ripple ruling last month. The appeal could extend the lawsuit‚Äôs resolution to 2026.¬†However, with Gensler signaling plans to leave the SEC and the upcoming inauguration of a pro-crypto cabinet led by Trump, the commission might settle the longstanding lawsuit before the expected 2026 resolution date.¬†This speculation led to a dramatic surge in the price of XRP, with the asset hitting a 16-month high of $0.8452 yesterday.

In addition, it has successfully surpassed the critical resistance level of $0.064, further increasing the likelihood of continued upward momentum.With buying pressure continuing to rise, the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are all shifting bullish.

A Thursday transaction raised eyebrows among the Shiba Inu community as a whale shuffled a large amount of SHIB to an unidentified wallet. The transaction correlated with a broader market correction, leaving investors wondering what was next after the transfer.Transaction DetailsWhale Alert drew the community‚Äôs attention to a massive Shiba Inu movement, where a whale moved 4,000,000,000,000 SHIB to an unknown wallet. At the time, the tokens were worth a whopping $99 million.The shift saw wallet address ‚Äú 0x42219 ‚Äù move 4 trillion SHIB to ‚Äú 0x633be ‚Äù by 20:45 (UTC) on November 14. On-chain analysis shows that the wallet moved the Shiba Inu at an average price of $0.00002475.Notably, the sending address is one of the largest Shiba Inu holders, currently holding over 7 trillion SHIB (0.7302% of Shiba Inu‚Äôs total supply). Notably, the wallet is the ninth-largest Shiba Inu holder.Meanwhile, the receiving address seems new, as the 4 trillion SHIB movement was one of its only two transactions. The wallet‚Äôs other transaction, which looked like a test transfer, saw it receive 100,000 SHIB ($2.37) by 13:55 (UTC) the same day from the same sending address.At the time of writing, the receiving address still holds the funds, signaling it might be a mere fund shuffle. The ‚Äú0x633be‚Äù address holds 4,000,000,100,000 SHIB, valued at $94.7 million at the current price.Further investigation carried out by The Crypto Basic confirmed that both the sending and recipient addresses belong to digital asset firm BitGo. This confirms the theory that the movement was a mere in-house fund shuffle with no real market implications.Shiba Inu Consolidates After Bullish OutburstMeanwhile, the Thursday transfer correlated with a broader market consolidation after a bullish uptick. Shiba Inu has depreciated 7.76% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00002368 at press time.SHIB has also dropped 24.25% from its weekly high of $0.00002943, which it attained on November 12. However, it is still up 22.81% in the past seven days after an uptick from its $0.00001926 price at the start of the week.Notably, bullish momentum is still prevalent in the Shiba Inu ecosystem as its marketing lead, Lucie, speculated that the next price uptick will target $0.00006861.

Market Signals Reflect Patterns That Foretold the Recent Slide in Trump Media Shares,"The implied probability distribution is skewed to the left, suggesting expectations for price pullback.  Shares in Trump media experienced a similar dynamic before the recent price slide.  As bitcoin's {{BTC}} price struggles to secure a foothold above $90,000, developments in the Deribit-listed options market tied to the cryptocurrency resemble patterns that foreshadowed the recent price slide in the Trump media shares.  The pattern referred to here is the implied probability distribution, representing markets' expectations for the underlying asset's future price derived from options prices at different strike prices and expiration dates. It shows the probabilities traders assign to the asset reaching different price levels.  Per data tracked by crypto financial platform BloFin, the implied probability distribution now shows a ""left shift,"" suggesting that the market participants see a higher probability of BTC trading at lower prices from here.  ""A typical indicator is the implied probability distribution: whether it is MSTR, COIN or Deribit's BTC options, the implied probability distribution of different expiration dates has shown a significant left shift,"" Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""It seems that traders have an implied consensus that the prices of BTC and altcoins are still high, and more pullbacks may be on the way.""  Ardern added that a similar left shift was seen in the DJT options market, presaging the recent price slide. The share price has halved to $27 in just over two weeks, according to charting platform TradingView. DJT surged to a high of $54 at the end of October, as markets priced in a potential victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election held on Nov. 5.  Well, pro-crypto Trump emerged victorious as expected, and since then, BTC has surged by over $20,000, tapping the $93,000 mark at one point.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency changed hands at $88,100, according to CoinDesk data.  Hawkish comments from the Fed officials support the case for a price pullback suggested by the implied volatility distribution. On Thursday, Chairman Jerome Powell said that the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates, dashing hopes for faster liquidity easing.

36332265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653183,1731655857,"Bitcoin Expert Predicts Correction To $78,000 CME Gap, Reveals Date For Next Bear Market","Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a massive surge, rising over 39% since November 5th to reach a new record high of $93,250 on Wednesday. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has since experienced a pullback and is currently trading around $88,800. Market analyst Quinten Francois has suggested that this retracement could extend further, potentially dropping below the $80,000 mark due to a significant CME gap located beneath this level. 12% Retracement Ahead? CME gaps refer to price discrepancies on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures chart, where the closing price of one trading day differs from the opening price of the next. These gaps often arise following substantial price movements and are typically filled as the market stabilizes. Francois has identified a CME gap at the $78,000 level, which would represent a retracement of just over 12% from current prices if filled in the coming days. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor Such a correction could be healthy for BTC, as it often liquidates long positions, setting the stage for future upward movements. Historical patterns suggest that these pullbacks can provide the necessary liquidity for the cryptocurrency to advance further. However, if Bitcoin sees increased selling pressure at this level, additional support levels are identified at $72,000 and $69,000. The potential for a drop below these levels would take BTC back to the prices seen before Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory on November 5th, which many believe was a catalyst for the recent price spike. Could Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Strategy Influence Future Price Movements During his presidential campaign, Trump continuously expressed his intention to support the growth of digital assets, positioning Bitcoin as a central element of his next administration‚Äôs economic policy. One of¬†Trump‚Äôs¬†promises includes establishing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the United States. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis has taken this initiative to the Senate by introducing the Bitcoin Act, which aims to increase US Bitcoin reserves to 1 million coins, potentially reducing market supply and positively impacting the BTC price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Swift 175% Surge As DOGE/BTC Pair Records Major Breakout Francois has also forecasted a bear market for the broader cryptocurrency sector, predicting it could emerge between 2026 and 2027. This suggests that the next two years will likely witness an extended bull run for Bitcoin and the overall digital asset ecosystem. However, the expert cautioned that if the $78,000 CME gap is not filled before a significant price rally, it may need to be addressed in the subsequent bear market phase, suggesting further price fluctuations ahead.

Analyst Weighs In,"Bitcoin has reached a major milestone by surpassing the $90,000 price mark, marking a significant moment in its ongoing bullish rally. The price surge has drawn the attention of existing investors and attracted a new wave of market participants. This influx is evidenced by the increase in UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) Age Bands. This metric tracks the distribution of Bitcoin holdings by age, according to an analysis shared by CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley. This development reflects heightened interest and engagement in the Bitcoin market. Moodley‚Äôs analysis revealed that a high percentage of market participants are currently profitable, as indicated by the UTXO profit percentage metric. However, despite this strong market performance, long-term holders appear to maintain their positions even as the derivatives market becomes increasingly leveraged. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Move Millions To Binance‚ÄîIs A Market Correction Imminent? Samuel Edyme Profitability Metrics Signal Market Momentum One of the key insights highlighted by Moodley is the positive Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This indicator suggests that many Bitcoin transactions are occurring at a profit, reflecting an optimistic market sentiment and providing a foundation for potential further price increases. However, Moodley pointed to a developing ‚Äúmania phase‚Äù in the market, evidenced by the growing number of options market call contracts set to expire over the next two months. This surge in call contracts indicates that many traders are betting on continued upward momentum, potentially driving further speculative activity. The CryptoQuant analyst also discussed the implications of probability models that track Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements over time. According to these models, with a lag of 500 days, Bitcoin has breached two standard deviations at the $90,000 level. The next significant price marker, represented by the third standard deviation, according to Moodley is currently projected to be around $101,000. This suggests that, while Bitcoin‚Äôs current upward trajectory is notable, the potential for further price gains remains. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin appears to be now seeing a cool off in its recent bullish momentum. Particularly, following a consistent week of new highs reaching a peak of $93,477 yesterday, BTC has since faced a major pullback in price, bringing its price to trade as low as below $89,000, as of today. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $88,878, down by 2.9% in the past day. Regardless, BTC seems to still be in an uptrend with a past week performance of nearly 20%. Notably, while the market environment still reflects strong bullish sentiment, there are risks to be aware of. As highlighted by Moodley, the increased leverage in the derivatives market, combined with rising call options activity, could lead to heightened volatility in the BTC market.

Bitcoin Experiences Significant Liquidation Activity According to Bloomberg data, the premium for CME-listed Bitcoin futures contracts‚Äîcommonly used by institutional investors to speculate on price movements‚Äîhas decreased, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. K33 Research notes that the basis, or the difference between the futures price and the spot price, has dropped to around 10% after previously hovering between 13% and 16% since the election. Related Reading: New Era For Crypto Regulation? SEC Chair Gensler Suggests He May Step Down Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, remarked, ‚ÄúMarkets seem to be cooling down‚Ä¶ that might have been a subtle hint of moderating risk profiles.‚Äù This shift suggests that investors may be reassessing their strategies in light of the recent price volatility. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $87,970, down from its all-time high of $93,462 reached just a day ago. Since Trump‚Äôs election victory, the cryptocurrency has seen an increase of over 30%. However, this rally has been accompanied by significant liquidation of leveraged bullish positions. In the past 24 hours, liquidations of long positions‚Äîthose betting on price increases‚Äîtotaled $447 million, compared to $207 million for bearish bets. Renewed Trader Interest Profit-taking is also contributing to the recent downturn, particularly as Bitcoin approached the $90,000 mark, which has historically been a significant level for open interest in call options. James Davies, CEO of Crypto Valley Exchange, noted, ‚ÄúCrazy speculative days in the market, big profit taking in the last few hours‚Ä¶ $90k is a massive level in the call options open interest.‚Äù The rally has primarily been fueled by fresh demand in the spot market, evidenced by substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by Bitcoin and relatively moderate leverage among traders. Interestingly, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures on offshore exchanges rose after falling earlier in the week, indicating renewed interest among traders after the so-called ‚ÄúTrump trade‚Äù catalyst. Related Reading: Solana ‚ÄòGod Candle Is Close‚Äô As It Breaks From Crucial Resistance ‚Äì Top Analyst Options traders are increasingly optimistic, with growing interest in calls with strike prices at $110,000 and $120,000, according to data from Deribit. As Davies commented, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all pure speculative trading right now, expect lots of volatility and a lack of clear signals for a while whilst we wait for policy announcements in the U.S.‚Äù As the market approaches the expiry of November options, all eyes will be on whether the $90,000 price point will serve as a resistance level or if Bitcoin can surpass it once again.

The price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $635 level. BNB price started a downside correction from the $665 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $640 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $620 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $600 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a close above the $620 level, BNB price extended its increase. However, upsides were limited above $660 and the price remained capped, unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $632 and $620 levels. However, the price is now holding gains above the $600 level. A low was formed at $616 and the price is now consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $661 swing high to the $616 low. The price is now trading below $620 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $620 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $626 level. The next resistance sits near the $638 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $661 swing high to the $616 low. A clear move above the $638 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $650. A close above the $650 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $665 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $680 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $638 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $620 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $615 level. The main support sits at $600. If there is a downside break below the $600 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone.

Prosecutors described his attempts to launder the money as ‚Äúthe most complicated‚Äù techniques IRS agents had seen to date.  Ilya Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the theft of approximately 120,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} from crypto exchange Bitfinex, the U.S. Department of Justice has announced on Thursday.  The 35-year-old hacked the network in 2016, using ‚Äúadvanced hacking tools and techniques‚Äù. Once inside the network, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions transferring 119,754 bitcoin from Bitfinex to his own wallet. He then took steps to cover his tracks by deleting from Bitfinex‚Äôs network access credentials and other log files that could have revealed his conduct to law enforcement.  Following the hack, Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan laundered the stolen funds. Morgan, also known by her rapper moniker ‚ÄúRazzlekhan‚Äù, will be sentenced on Nov. 18. Prosecutors have recommended she serve 18 months.  According to court documents, the couple managed to laundered 25,111 bitcoin ‚Äì 21% of the total pile Lichtenstein stole from Bitfinex ‚Äì using a web of Eastern European bank accounts and bitcoin mixing services to hide the origin of the funds. Prosecutors described the methods as ‚Äúthe most complicated money laundering techniques [IRS agents] had seen to date.‚Äù  Among the methods they used were are utilizing computer programs to automate transactions; depositing the stolen funds into accounts at a variety of darknet markets and cryptocurrency exchanges and then withdrawing the funds; converting bitcoin to other forms of cryptocurrency in a practice known as ‚Äúchain hopping‚Äù; depositing a portion of the criminal proceeds into cryptocurrency mixing services; using U.S.-based business accounts to legitimize Lichtenstein‚Äôs and Morgan‚Äôs banking activity; and exchanging a portion of the stolen funds into gold coins.  But despite their complexity, former founder and leader of cybercrime cartel Shadow Crew, Brett Johnson told CoinDesk last year that some of Lichtenstein‚Äôs laundering methods, such as using Coinbase accounts directly connected to him, ‚Äúdid not make sense‚Äù and suggested a lack of experience. ‚ÄúIlya is a f***ing idiot. If you look at the way he was trying to launder money, he was doing absolutely everything wrong,‚Äù Johnson said at the time.  Lichtenstein and Morgan were initially only suspected of laundering the money until the former outed himself as the hacker. Neither was charged in relation to the actual hack of Bitfinex despite Lichtenstein claiming responsibility.  Instead, both pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering on Aug. 3, 2023, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention ‚Äì Is More Growth Ahead? This rapid ascent has rendered it the highest daily gainer and elevated its market capitalization to about $1.8 billion, securing its position within the top 50 cryptocurrencies. The Excitement Surrounding The Increase: The Elon Musk Influence The increase in PNUT‚Äôs price can be mostly ascribed to a tweet from Elon Musk, in which he remarked, ‚ÄúAmerica was saved by a squirrel and a meme coin!‚Äù This tweet rapidly gained popularity, akin to the other endorsements made by Elon Musk that have propelled other memecoins, such as Dogecoin, to new heights. The origin of PNUT enhances its appeal; it was established in reaction to popular indignation about the euthanasia of a pet squirrel named Peanut by New York City‚Äôs Department of Environmental Conservation. This occurrence elicited extensive sympathy and discourse on social media channels, highlighting the token. Apart from the influence of Elon Musk, PNUT has profited from the broader increase in the bitcoin market, partly resulting from recent political developments following the triumph of the Republicans in the US elections. While these factors are associated with a period of increased market activity and speculation, many investors are now turning their attention to PNUT in anticipation of possible gains. PNUT: Trading Activities And Market Positioning The escalation of the trading volume of the meme coin courtesy of an Elon Musk social media post, however, increased by nearly 280% during the same 24-hour period making it approximately $5.75 billion. This upsurge in trading activity is indicative of the strong fervor and expectation level possessed by investors towards the token‚Äôs future performance. Subsequent to its recent debut on Binance, PNUT has garnered attention and is currently ranked as the third-largest memecoin on Solana, following established entities such as dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK). Market analysts exhibit optimism regarding PNUT‚Äôs future prospects. Technical indications indicate a bullish trend, with forecasts suggesting a potential 300% gain in value in the forthcoming days. Should PNUT surpass its existing resistance level of $2.3, it could facilitate the attainment of elevated ambitions. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor The Road Ahead Many investors want to find out if PNUT can keep its momentum and reach fresh highs. There is clear excitement about this memecoin; some estimate it may hit $6 immediately if it continues its increasing trend. All cryptocurrencies still naturally have volatility, though. Peanut the Squirrel‚Äôs rise reflects bitcoin‚Äôs rapid wealth swings. PNUT‚Äôs unique tale and solid sponsorships have drawn cryptocurrency newcomers and veterans.

Clayton, who has advised a number of crypto firms since leaving the SEC in December 2020, oversaw the production of the SEC's DAO Report, which claimed jurisdiction over a broad swath of the crypto industry, and famously once said he believed most initial coin offerings were securities, a view later echoed by his successor, current SEC Chair Gary Gensler.  ""[Clayton] is a highly respected business leader, counsel and public servant,"" Trump said.  One of Clayton's final actions at the SEC was to sign off on its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The case is currently winding its way through the federal appellate court system, after a judge ruled last year that the company had not violated federal securities laws in making XRP available to retail traders through exchanges. He's currently a senior policy advisor at the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, alongside his various advisory roles.  He did not immediately return a request for comment.  Under current U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, the SDNY branch of the DOJ brought prosecutions against a number of people tied to financial and corporate malfeasance, including last year's high-profile trial against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, which resulted in his conviction and 25-year-sentence on seven different fraud and conspiracy charges.  Trump previously tried to nominate Clayton to the office, to replace then-U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.  In the week since his reelection, the former and now future president has named a number of individuals he intends to nominate to cabinet and other positions, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Matt Gaetz to be the U.S. Attorney General, Senator Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State and former Representative Tulsi Gabbard to be the Director of National Intelligence.

The market is now pricing in a 66% chance of a 25 basis point cut in the December FOMC meeting, down from Thursday‚Äôs 83%.  XRP zoomed 17% in the past 24 hours to beat gains in bitcoin {{BTC}] and majors, as shifting U.S. regulatory climate supported growth in tokens previously hampered by the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) actions.  XRP traded above 82 cents in early Asian trading hours Friday, extending 7-day gains to 50% as it reached levels last seen in June 2023. The jump came as 18 U.S. states filed to sue the  SEC and commissioners, including chairman Gary Gensler, accusing them of unconstitutional overreach of the crypto industry.  The speculative optimism among traders is that a crypto-friendly Trump administration could benefit tokens linked to U.S.-based companies, such as Ripple Labs (related to XRP) and Uniswap (UNI), as the firms are more involved in boosting value for token holders.  Meanwhile, BTC and majors slid as much as 4% amid profit-taking in late U.S. hours Thursday, an expected market reaction following several days of growth.  The drop was catalyzed as Fed chair Jerome Powell delivered hawkish comments in his latest speech, dampening hopes of swifter rate cuts. ""The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,"" said Powell in prepared remarks at a Dallas conference. ""The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully.""  As of Friday, the market is pricing in a 66% chance of a 25 basis point cut in the upcoming December FOMC meeting, down from Thursday‚Äôs 83%.  BTC fell to $88,000 from a peak of $93,000 on Thursday, with the drop causing over $120 million in liquidations on both bullish and bearish bets. Ether {{ETH}} and Solana‚Äôs SOL fell 3.5%, while dog-themed dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu (SHIB) lost as much as 5%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, was little changed.  New top-20 token pepe (PEPE) corrected 8% after a 75% surge on Thursday following a Coinbase listing that briefly put the frog-themed meme at a $10 billion market capitalization for the first time.

36322812,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653119,1731639615,Bitcoin Profit Taking Relatively Muted Amid $93K Rally ‚Äì Can BTC Climb Higher?,"Bitcoin (BTC) recently reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $93,477, as the leading digital asset inches closer to the highly anticipated $100,000 target. Notably, the ongoing price rally has seen relatively muted profit-taking, fueling hopes that BTC has further room to surge. Low Profit-Taking For Bitcoin In Current Cycle According to a recent report by Glassnode, the current BTC price momentum is primarily driven by strong spot demand and rising institutional interest. Particularly, the victory of Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump has added optimism to the digital assets industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says The report highlights that over 95% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is currently in profit. However, despite the high proportion of profitable holders, profit-taking has remained relatively muted during this cycle. Historically, monthly profit realization has typically ranged between $30 and $50 billion during previous Bitcoin ATH cycles. The current price discovery phase has seen about $20.4 billion in realized profit. This relatively low profit-taking level in the current BTC ATH cycle suggests further room for the BTC price to rise, potentially reaching the $100,000 milestone before demand wanes. The chart below shows the cost basis of new BTC investors, along with upper and lower statistical bands. According to the report, during an ATH phase, BTC‚Äôs price repeatedly tests the upper bands as new investors enter the market at higher price points. As can be inferred from the above chart, BTC‚Äôs current spot price of $91,199 is just below its upper band of $94,900. Keeping track of price movement between these bands can show when the market price might be high enough to force existing holders to sell their holdings. Excess Leverage Must Be Flushed Before $100,000 BTC While BTC is trading less than 10% below the $100,000 level, industry experts opine that excess leverage must be flushed out before the top digital asset attempts to hit the 6-figure target. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why Data from Coinglass shows that more than $718 million worth of crypto contracts were liquidated in the past 24 hours, impacting 202,074 traders.

Some industry leaders remain optimistic about BTC‚Äôs future price action. In October, the BTC mining firm CleanSpark CEO said that the premier digital asset may peak at $200,000 in the next 18 months. Similarly, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently predicted that BTC may hit $1 million under the Trump administration. BTC trades at $91,199 at press time, up 3.9% in the past 24 hours.

36319680,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653120,1731634256,XRP Price Will Escalate To $1.03 This Week If This Happens: Analyst,"In a new analysis, crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) highlights a significant pattern in the daily XRP/USDT chart that suggests a possible sharp rise in the price of XRP. According to his analysis, the XRP price is possibly forming a technical pattern known as a ‚Äúbull flag‚Äù after decisively breaking above the multi-year resistance at $0.6649, a move that has been further substantiated by two consecutive daily closes above this key level. XRP Price To Reach $1.03 This Week? A ‚Äúbull flag‚Äù pattern occurs when the price of an asset moves sharply higher, then consolidates in a narrow, downward-sloping range, resembling a flag on a pole. This pattern is typically considered a continuation pattern, suggesting that after the consolidation phase, the price is likely to break out upward in the direction of the initial sharp movement. In the context of XRP, the flagpole was formed by the steep price increase from $0.52 leading up to the break above $0.6649. Furthermore, Dark Defender points out the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently in the overbought territory at 84. An overbought RSI often indicates that the asset might temporarily pause or consolidate due to short-term selling pressure as traders take profits. Related Reading: XRP NVT Ratio Has Been High Recently: What It Means This aligns with the expectation of the consolidation phase of the bull flag pattern. However, an overbought RSI in the context of a bull flag pattern can also indicate strong underlying momentum, suggesting that once consolidation is complete, a breakout to the upside could follow. Dark Defender highlights the next substantial price target at $1.03, which could be achieved swiftly if XRP manages to ascend beyond the immediate resistance near $0.7496. Specifically, touches or minor closings above $0.7496, with potential surges to $0.76 or higher, are deemed critical for this bullish scenario to unfold. Should these conditions be met, Dark Defender expects that the price of XRP could rally to $1.03 within this week. Related Reading: XRP Surges To $0.74, Reaching Its Highest Price Since Mid-March: Here‚Äôs Why Notably, the analysis also rests on the understanding of Fibonacci levels, which are used extensively in crypto trading to predict potential support and resistance levels based on prior market movements. The level at $0.6649, now surpassed, could likely serve as a 70.20% retracement from the previous market high to low. If this level is breached to the downside, the bull flag pattern could extend more to the downside. Then, the 61.80% and 50% Fibonacci levels at $0.6044 and $0.5286 could serve as a support zone from which the XRP price could escalate above $1. The analyst states: ‚ÄúXRP closed 2 days in a row above $0.6649. Now we can say this Fibonacci Level is dead, too. There are no more substantial levels than this until $1.03. If we see touches above $0.7496, such as $0.76 or more, we can quickly expect the $1.03 this week.This is not financial advice but my expectation. Remember, XRP broke the multi-year (7) resistance of $0.6649 in NOVEMBER 2024.‚Äù At press time, XRP traded at $0.7086.

42435323,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4koz62,1731629332,Republican State AGs and DeFi Lobby Sue SEC Over Crypto Enforcement Actions,"A group of state attorneys general and the DeFi Education Fund sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and its five commissioners alleging the agency was overstepping its bounds in bringing enforcement actions against crypto exchanges.  The lawsuit, filed Thursday afternoon in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, asks a federal judge to block the SEC from bringing enforcement actions, arguing ""the SEC's 'crypto policy' is 'unlawful executive action'"" and that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act.  ""The SEC‚Äôs sweeping assertion of regulatory jurisdiction is untenable. The digital assets implicated here are just that ‚Äî assets, not investment contracts covered by federal securities laws,"" the lawsuit said.  The case comes as Gary Gensler, the SEC's Chair under President Biden, is on his way out, with once and future president Donald Trump expected to appoint a more industry-friendly successor.  The SEC's approach to crypto is encroaching upon states' rights to police the industry on their own, the suit argued.  The suit also pointed to the major questions doctrine, a Supreme Court precedent that says federal agencies shouldn't litigate issues not directly assigned to them by Congress. Other federal courts have rejected the doctrine's application to SEC lawsuits against crypto companies.  Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the chief executive officer of DEF, said in a statement that the suit was targeting SEC ""overreach.""  ""DeFi, and crypto broadly, promises to make financial services and the digital economy more accessible, efficient, interoperable, dependable, and consumer-focused,"" he said. ""The SEC currently stands as a barrier to realizing this promise.""  An SEC spokesperson said, ""We don‚Äôt comment on litigation. State securities regulators have been strong partners in efforts to uncover and prosecute misconduct in the crypto markets.""  Earlier Thursday, Gensler spoke briefly about the SEC's approach to crypto, saying it followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, Trump appointee Jay Clayton.  ""This is a field in which over the years there has been significant investor harm,"" Gensler said. ""Further, aside from speculative investing and possible use for illicit activities, the vast majority of crypto assets have yet to prove out sustainable use cases.""  Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said the suit aimed to ""keep the federal government from reaching into Kentuckians' wallets.""  ‚ÄúKentuckians of all ages and backgrounds are eager to access crypto to assert their financial freedom and guard against historic inflation,"" he said. ""Instead of encouraging this vibrant new digital industry, the Biden-Harris Administration is unlawfully cracking down on cryptocurrency.""

36316325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653089,1731628826,Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market,"Driven by bullish market sentiment following Donald Trump‚Äôs win in the concluded US Presidential election, the Dogecoin price has been steadily increasing, aiming to break through the $0.4 resistance level. A crypto analyst of Trading View has discussed several factors that could propel the Dogecoin price even higher, potentially hitting the $1 mark in this bull market. Key Drivers To Send The Dogecoin Price To $1 A recent post on TradingView discusses the potential for the Dogecoin price to soon hit the coveted $1 milestone. Presenting compelling factors, the report suggests that Dogecoin could see its price surging to $1 with the influence of SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins To put it more clearly, TradingView has revealed that Musk‚Äôs steadfast support and devotion to DOGE could allow the meme coin to steadily grow to a $130 billion market capitalization, representing a $1 price surge. In addition, Dogecoin‚Äòs increasing popularity in the financial space is also set to catalyze a potential price surge. Currently, Dogecoin is one of the most talked-about meme coins in the market, as the cryptocurrency has among the top gainers in this bull market. With more users and investors flooding into the DOGE ecosystem, demand and adoption are poised to rise, potentially triggering a major price spike. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has increased by a staggering 250% in just one month. This massive price surge saw the meme coin jump from around the $0.2 price level to new highs around $0.4. TradingView‚Äôs report noted that many analysts foresee the Dogecoin price hitting the $1 price tag in the near future. Notably, Jeremy, a prominent crypto analyst, told his 180,300 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that the Dogecoin price is gearing up to reach $1, driven by Musk‚Äôs support and the integration of the meme coin in America‚Äôs economy. Other X crypto analysts like ‚ÄòBark‚Äô have projected even higher price surges for DOGE, believing it could rise to $10. DOGE Outperforms Bitcoin During its report, TradingView also revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently outperforming Bitcoin by 150%. As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin has been on a parabolic run recently, jumping 110% in just one week while still accumulating gains as of writing. TradingView‚Äôs report revealed that following Trump‚Äôs Presidential win in the concluded US election, the Dogecoin price rallied 180%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? This massive price surge outperformed Bitcoin, which grew only 30% within the same period. While Bitcoin‚Äôs price is significantly larger than DOGE and has successfully achieved a new ATH, DOGE, with a lower price of around $0.4, is viewed as a more accessible and profitable option for smaller investors. Despite the clear gains in the Dogecoin price, analysts from TradingView caution against jumping headfirst too quickly. They warn that downturns remain possible and low prices can be deceptive.
