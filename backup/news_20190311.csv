42430277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJXh,1552337114,IBM Scores Deal With US Credit Union Group to Use Hyperledger Blockchain,"CU Ledger, a consortium of U.S. credit unions that's been experimenting with a range of private blockchains, has added one more to the list: IBM's Hyperledger Fabric solution.  The consortium will use IBM's tech to create ""an immutable audit trail that can be used to create new business models and transform existing business processes for credit unions,"" Big Blue said Monday.  In particular, the new solutions will be built for such services as identity authentication, compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, lending and payments, the tech giant said. The first blockchain-based services will be available to CULedger members ""later in 2019,"" IBM said.  However, the consortium told CoinDesk it will keep its relationships with previously announced partners R3, Hedera and Evernym.  ""The use of a specific blockchain platform will be dependent on each particular application or use case that is being developed. Our partners, such as IBM, Evernym and Sovrin, each play a role within our overall strategy and solutions,"" Julie Esser, CULedger’s chief experience officer, told CoinDesk.  “We are not replacing any of the relationships that we have previously announced,"" she said. ""CULedger is building a network of networks that will facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of anything digital. As we continue to develop our solutions, there will be applications better suited for different networks, and CULedger will enable those networks to interact with each other.""  For example, CULedger is building an identity solution for its members leveraging the Hyperledger Indy platform (the code for which was developed by Evernym and contributed by the Sovrin Foundation). But the new KYC-related product will use Fabric (which IBM contributed to the open-source Hyperledger project), Esser said.  Past partnerships  Last May, the consortium announced it was going to use Hedera's Hashgraph distributed ledger technology (DLT) to build a public system for cross-border payments. In December, CULedger also announced it was joining R3's global network of companies building on the open-source Corda platform. The group also said earlier its identity solution MyCUID was developed with Evernym, an identity-focused blockchain company.  At the moment, CULedger isn't building on Corda, Esser explained, but ""there is an opportunity in the future"" for the consortium to leverage R3's tech. Evernym remains a key partner, providing the front-end solution for MyCUID. As for Hedera, CULedger ""doesn't have a specific use case at this time"" in the works for Hashgraph, including the earlier mentioned cross-border payments, Esser said, but, ""it is still on our roadmap.""  According to Esser, eight credit unions participating in CULedger now are piloting different use cases using MyCUID, including one for call center user authentication. The consortium has 38 member institutions overall, according to its website.  CULedger was first unveiled in 2016, led by the Credit Union National Association with 55 credit unions on board at the time. The consortium managed to hire away Mastercard’s executive vice president of North America markets, John Ainsworth, who became CULedger's president and CEO in December 2017.  At the end of January, CULedger announced that it had successfully closed a $10 million A Series funding round.

42430267,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJDh,1552333546,'Facebook Coin' Could Generate Billions in Revenue: Barclays Analyst,"Facebook's reported stablecoin project could be a significant moneymaker for the social media giant, according to Barclays analyst Ross Sandler.  In a note to investors first reported by CNBC and later obtained by CoinDesk, Sandler says Facebook's cryptocurrency efforts could yield anywhere from $3 billion to $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021. To put that estimate in context, the Menlo Park, California, company brought in $40.6 billion in total revenue in 2017, with $39.9 billion from advertising.  However, the analysis hinges on whether ""Facebook Coin proves successful in reinvigorating FB’s micro-payment strategy for digital content distribution,"" Sandler wrote.  Sandler also sees two primary challenges for Facebook achieving its crypto goals: ""demonstrating a value prop for users above what is available today in payments"" and overcoming consumers' ""trust issues after 2018’s problems.""  In an apparent bid to account for said trust issues, CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued a lengthy post last week calling for Facebook to become more privacy-oriented in the years ahead. While ""cryptocurrency"" isn't mentioned, payments and encryption are frequently invoked.  Face from the past  Sandler of Barclays noted that much remains unclear about Facebook's crypto project. However, there is a precedent for virtual currency on the social media site: Facebook Credits.  “Facebook coin may simply be [looking] to process micro-transactions and re-invigorate the original business model that was in place in 2010-2012 under Facebook Credits,” Sandler wrote. “However, the scope of the project could be much larger, especially considering David Marcus (former CEO of PayPal) is heading up the project.”  Indeed, Facebook has been on a hiring spree on the cryptocurrency front in recent months, with a hiring push and at least one startup acqui-hire.

Switzerland, known to be a nucleus for financial markets innovation, is the ideal starting point for Deutsche Börse to drive this evolution forward.”  Sygnum is also in the process of obtaining a Swiss banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), Swisscom said. Once the license is in place, Sygnum will provide banking services such as custody, deposits, lending, capital issuance via tokenization, brokerage and asset management within the planned ecosystem.  The trio partnership is currently awaiting merger approval, the firm said, adding that other products and services are planned for launch later this year in a “regulatory compliant” environment.  Deutsche Börse has also previously announced that it is planning to develop a blockchain-based system for securities lending. The firm said in March 2018 that it plans to develop a system that can offer more efficient securities settlement using technical support from financial management firm HQLAX and the Corda platform from blockchain startup R3.

For the effort, Invesco has partnered with London-based Elwood Asset Management, an investment firm specializing in digital assets, to launch the product called the “Invesco Elwood Global Blockchain UCITS ETF.”  Elwood announced the news Monday, saying the ETF is designed to target companies with the potential to generate “real earnings” from blockchain technology.  Chris Mellor, head of EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) ETF equity product management at Invesco, said:  “The potential for blockchain to drive real earnings is huge, but it is often hidden within companies involved in other areas. This ETF offers investors access to companies with real earnings now, but with the added potential of blockchain-related earnings not reflected in their share prices.”  The ETF carries an annual management fee of 0.65 percent and aims to deliver the performance of the Elwood Blockchain Global Equity Index by ""physically investing in the index constituents,"" Elwood said in its statement.  The index, calculated for Elwood by German provider of financial indices Solactive AG, currently has a portfolio of 48 companies.  These include cryptocurrency chip-maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), bitcoin futures trading operator CME Group, South Korean messaging app giant Kakao, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange operator Monex Group, online retail giant Overstock, Signature Bank and Square.  The index's sector allocations currently include information technology (46 percent), financials (23 percent), communication services (9 percent), and in materials and consumer discretionary sectors (8 percent), according to the announcement. The three largest geographical allocations are to the US (39 percent), Japan (29 percent) and Taiwan (12 percent).

As reported by Bloomberg on Monday, Ground X CEO Jason Han said that IDG Capital, Cresendo Equity Partners and Translink Capital had participated in the round. The firm is also reportedly planning to raise ""a similar sum"" in another round starting Tuesday, before launching its blockchain platform in June.  Kakao first revealed its plan to set up a blockchain subsidiary back in March 2018, soon after confirming that it had launched Ground X to develop a blockchain-powered platform as a foundation for application developers. Kakao's top execs said at the time that the plan was to integrate future blockchain-based services with Kakao’s existing internet offerings, such as the Kakao Talk messaging app.  Ground X launched a test network (or testnet) for its proprietary blockchain network, dubbed Klaytn, last autumn. It has already partnered with 26 companies that aim to run apps on Klaytn, Han told Bloomberg. These include South Korean video game developer Wemade and video streaming platform Watcha, as well as a unit of Chinese travel agency Zanadu.  The subsidiary has also said it will work with the Seoul Digital Foundation, an organization created by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, to develop blockchain projects focusing on social and public services.  Ground X could be summed up as “partial or gradual decentralization,” Han told CoinDesk Korea last year, adding that some of Kakao’s services could be decentralized.  He added:  ""The token economy is a business model that no one could have imagined before. Until now, Kakao has only operated in Korea, but through blockchain we could expand into the global market.

42430282,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJjh,1552302013,A Bitcoin Bull Market Is Still $350 Away,"View  Bitcoin has established a higher low near $3,300 in the last two months, signaling bearish exhaustion.  However, a break above the Christmas Day lower high of $4,236 is needed to confirm a bearish to bullish trend change.  Bitcoin (BTC) needs to climb at least anther $350 to confirm a long-term bullish reversal, technical charts suggest.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,903 – having rallied 24.8 percent from this year's low of $3,122 seen in December. This positive trend has spurred hopes that the sell-off from the late 2017 record high of $20,000 is over.  Validating that argument are a number of long duration technical indicators flashing early signs of bullish reversal. To name a few, the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is at its most bullish for over a year. The money flow index, which takes into account both bitcoin's price and trading volume, is also trending north, validating the bullish divergence created in December.  That said, BTC is yet to invalidate the most basic of all bearish technical indicators – a lower high, lower low.  Weekly chart (2018-2019)  On the weekly chart, BTC has been charting regular bearish lower price highs and lower price lows since January 2018. These were essentially shallow bounces that ended up recharging the engines for a drop to further lows.  The last lower high of $4,236 created on Christmas Day, however, failed to challenge the preceding lower low of $3,122. And since then, BTC has been creating higher lows in the region of $3,300.  While the latter is evidence of seller exhaustion, a bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when BTC prints a higher high above the Christmas Day lower high. Put simply, a break above that level is needed to mark a successful transition from bearish to bullish trend change.  So, with bitcoin's price currently trading at $3,890, that target is still $350 away.  Weekly Chart (2014-2015)  As seen above, the previous bear market ended with bitcoin charting a higher low near $230 in April 2015. The bullish reversal was confirmed in November 2015 when BTC convincingly breached the bearish lower high of $297 carved in March 2015.  It's worth noting the failed breakout above $297, witnessed in July, which was followed by a drop all the way back to $200.

42430275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJTh,1552298401,Swiss Exchange to List XRP Exchange-Traded Investment Product,"Switzerland's primary stock exchange SIX could soon list another cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded product (ETP), which will track the price of XRP, the third largest crypto asset by market capitalization.  Hany Rashwan, co-founder and CEO of the Swiss company Amun AG – which already offers several crypto ETPs – told CoinDesk in an interview that his firm has received approval from SIX to issue the XRP-linked ETP with the ticker name AXRP, adding:  ""We can comfortably say that we expect to release the world’s first XRP ETP within the next two months.""  Besides XRP, Rashwan said that Amun has also obtained clearance to issue ETPs linked to four more single crypto assets, including bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), stellar lumens (XLM) and EOS.  While the exact time to launch these products is not yet fully finalized, and will based on buyer interest, he said the firm plans to list all the eligible and approved crypto ETPs on SIX by the end of this year.  The SIX exchange listed its first ETP that tracks a basket of the top weighted crypto assets in November 2018. That product was issued by Amun for retail and institutional investors under ticker name ""HODL"" – slang in the cryptocurrency community for holding rather than selling assets.  Since its listing, the total monthly trading volume for HODL has taken over that of XETC – an ETP that tracks crude oil – and became the top traded ETP on SIX in December and January, according to data provided by the SIX exchange (see chart below).  However, the price per share for HODL – which tracks BTC, ETH, XRP and LTC – has dropped from $15 in November to around $13 currently, reflecting the overall crypto market decline. In February, its market turnover also dropped to second place, with about $4 million changing hands.  Fully collateralized  According to listing rules enforced by SIX, since ETPs are passive investment instruments with no active trading strategies involved, they are not treated as collective investment schemes that are subject to the approval or supervised by Switzerland's market regulator, the Federal Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).  That said, structural features of crypto ETPs must nonetheless fulfill requirements with respect to investor protection efforts, based on SIX's practice circular for listing derivatives.  For instance, Rashwan explained, each unit of Amun's crypto ETPs has to be collateralized and backed by an identical amount of crypto assets which is checked continuously.  “The collateral also has to be kept at an independent qualified custodian. The calculation of the price is checked multiple times a day by several parties,” he said.  Amun stores its collateral with Kingdom Trust, a custodian for both traditional and crypto assets registered with the Securities Exchange Commission in the U.S., and is planning to add more custodians in different jurisdictions as it plans to list more crypto ETPs.  SIX's circular indicated that only the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at the time of application can be considered for trading. It further specifies only cryptocurrencies that are ""based on open-source software that function according to the principles of blockchain"" are permitted as underlying instruments.  ""Tokens, in the sense of units from a project, which are often issued as part of an initial coin offering, are not permitted as underlying instrument,"" the stock exchange states.  Tokenizing ETPs  Looking ahead, Amun is also planning to launch an ERC-standard token administrated by its own platform and running on the ethereum blockchain that it will use for tokenizing ETPs.  The goal is to allow both itself and third parties to tokenize both crypto ETPs and traditional ETPs, such as those that track gold, so that the tokens can be traded on securities token exchanges.  Currently, the SIX also building its own digital exchange in a bid to use distributed ledger technology to speed up settlements and trade tokenized assets. It recently chose R3’s Corda Enterprise platform to develop the infrastructure, with a plan to launch the SIX Digital Exchange in the second half of 2019.  Rashwan said:  ""I don’t think we will have a real licensed and regulated securities token exchange with a professional partner in a reputable country until late this year or early next year – that’s my guess. But when that happens, we will be ready with three to five tokenized ETPs, including our own and others'.""

According to a report from CoinDesk Korea published Sunday, the Samsung Blockchain Wallet is currently compatible only with ether (ETH) and ethereum-based ERC20 tokens. Bitcoin is not yet supported, despite the logo appearing on earlier pre-release presentation images.  The wallet also supports four decentralized apps (dapps) at launch: crypto gaming platform Enjin, beauty community Cosmee, crypto collectibles platform CryptoKitties and merchant payments service CoinDuck.  The wallet app can be downloaded only on Galaxy S10 phones from the Samsung Galaxy Store. The firm said it plans to expand the service to more devices and cryptocurrencies in the future.  The phone officially started shipping from pre-order sales on March 8.  Samsung Blockchain Wallet will be used in conjunction with Blockchain Keystore and is designed to simplify the transactions process for newcomers to the technology, according to CoinDesk Korea.  Through the supported CoinDuck dapp, users can also make payments to merchants, CoinDesk Korea said in another report on Monday.  In the dapp, users can enter the amount to be paid, scan a QR code providing the online or offline merchant's wallet address, press the “accept” button, and the payment will be made through the Samsung wallet. CoinDuck currently supports only ether (ETH).

42430262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBvh,1552291235,Ethereum's ProgPoW Proposal: An Expensive Game of Whack-a-Mole,"Dovey Wan and Martina Long are partners at Primitive Ventures, a crypto asset investment fund.    –––––––––    Recently, there has been discussion regarding a proposal to migrate ethereum away from proof-of-work called ProgPoW (short for programmatic proof of work). Proponents of ProgPoW want to flip the paradigm of the cryptocurrency mining industry on its head. Their thought is: instead of building hardware to fit the mining algorithms, a somewhat “wasteful” approach, we should be using mining algorithms that are optimized for GPUs to encourage the decentralization of mining.  At first glance, ProgPoW appears to minimize the advantage ASICs have over commodity hardware, making mining more accessible and thus decentralized. But upon further inspection, it becomes evident that ProgPoW doesn’t truly democratize mining as it claims.  The current implementation of ProgPoW, in fact, worsens the performance gap between the different GPU models, with preference given to the newer and more expensive GPU models from NVIDIA and AMD (the RTX 2080, TitanX and Vega 64). The team behind the proposition has been transparent about the fact that the algorithm is optimized for certain GPUs, and they are actively working on a newer version of the algorithm to make it more fair to all models.  (We will update the performance benchmark here once it’s available.)  The table below illustrates the hashrate reduction comparison between Ethereum’s current mining algorithm, Ethash, and ProgPoW for different GPUs. Highlighted in red are the models ProgPoW favors, which see a much smaller decrease in hashrate and greater improvement in bandwidth utilization under ProgPoW.  The implementation of ProgPoW in Ethereum will potentially serve to centralize mining further in the hands of those mining farms which have these high-end GPUs, or urge farm owners to upgrade to those models.  A nonexistent problem  Putting that fact aside, the “ASIC threat” that ProgPoW purports to solve is actually not as much a problem as one might think. Even ProgPoW developers acknowledge that Ethereum’s algorithm is already one of the most ASIC-resistant. The best Ethereum ASICs have a tough time achieving a mere 2-4x improvement over GPU mining, far less than Bitcoin ASICs.  Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, is also not concerned about the threat ASICs pose, saying: “If you look at the E3 that was released a few days ago the efficiency gains are relatively small compared to existing GPUs. My Chinese sources indicate a 220 MH/s miner costs about $2,500, while Bitmain is offering a 180 MH/s for $800, which is only a 2.5x factor of improvement.”  Indeed, though it is difficult to know exactly what proportion of Ethereum mining is performed by ASICs, most sources estimate that it is probably quite low.  The “ASIC problem” is largely a non-issue for Ethereum. This is because an ASIC must have long-term potential to be worth the high upfront cost to miners. Unlike GPUs, ASICs are highly specialized machines specific to the mining algorithm they are developed for, and are useless for mining other chains.  With the switch to PoS planned for Ethereum in the near future, it doesn’t make economic sense for most miners to further massively invest in Ethereum ASICs for their brief lifespan.  GPU mining != decentralization  The reasoning behind the argument that GPU mining is more secure is that, in theory. it makes mining accessible to the layman, and thus more decentralized and resistant to 51% attacks. Regular “at-home” miners can’t afford expensive ASICs, and thus if we want to encourage decentralization, GPUs are a better option.  But in reality, even GPU mining is largely concentrated in mining pools or farms, not in the hands of individual hobbyists. Centralization in pools does not happen because ASICs are inaccessible to the layman. Rather, it is because of the benefit that economies of scale provide in giving miners belonging to pools a steadier payout.  Centralization in farms is largely due to the cheap energy available in certain regions.  GPU friendly mining is not going to encourage significantly more at-home miners and it won’t dissolve existing mining pools either. Rather than naively holding onto the hope of making mining slightly more accessible to a few at-home miners who barely make a drop in the ocean, we should disincentivize those pools which dominate from attacking the system.  Here is where ASICs come in.  Seeing ASICs in a different light  The assumption that ASICs make a network less secure is misplaced. It comes from a failure to consider all the incentives at play. Namely, the fact that the specificity of ASICs is actually a key security component.  An ASIC is a machine whose circuits are designed specifically to run a single hashing algorithm, and are useless for any other purpose, unlike GPUs which are multipurpose and can be used to mine on many different chains. The sunk cost of both ASIC development and investment functions as a one-time entry ticket into network participation.  Such a security expenditure incentivizes ASIC miners to protect the chain in order to preserve the future return on their hefty hardware investment. Whereas a GPU miner does not need to be loyal to any particular hashing algorithm and can simply switch back and forth between chains to optimize their profits, or even repurpose their hardware for non-mining activities.  Used GPUs can be resold for over 50 percent of their original value, while ASICs resell for only 5 percent of their original value, and that price is also dependent upon the value of the tokens it is specific to.  A key factor in a chain’s security against a 51% attack is whether there is excess hardware available for an attacker to accumulate hash power with. The excess hardware in ASIC mined chains is usually close to zero, but readily available for GPU mined chains.  It’s extremely difficult to quickly acquire enough ASICs to launch an attack even when it is worthwhile to, whereas there are plenty of secondary markets for GPU hashrate and AWS GPU instances. The more general purpose the hardware is, the more available excess capacity there is, and the less secure the chain is against attacks.  This is not merely theoretical — multiple known 51% attacks on GPU coins have already happened. Most recently, Vertcoin and Ethereum Classic. David Vorick goes into the topic of ASICs as a security feature here and Dovey Wan has a thread on why 51% attacks are an evolutionary feature, not a bug, here.  Centralization on the manufacturing level  Centralization on the hardware manufacturing level is also a concern for networks, and GPUs are much more centralized on the manufacturing level than ASICs. GPU manufacturing has been largely dominated by three vendors in the past two decades, whereas ASICs remain a highly competitive industry due to the arms race of higher mining margin.  In the past, while a given ASIC manufacturer may have become the dominant manufacturer of machines for a given hashing algorithm, they have never been able to dominate manufacturing for all chains. It’s possible to overthrow an ASIC leader in a few years, but almost impossible to overthrow Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.  Any update to an established mining algorithm comes with unproven security risks and the hassles associated with upgrading a worldwide system of miners. The upside of Ethereum adopting ProgPoW is minimal, since ASICs do not pose a large problem to the network.  And while it is no longer much of a debate for Ethereum, which is soon to switch to Proof of Stake, other Proof of Work coins still face the question of whether to freely allow ASICs. Those chains should consider whether GPU mining really does increase the security of their system or if it is, in fact, a security vulnerability in itself.  ***  Many thanks to Hugo Nguyen, Hasu, David Vorick, Nic Carter, James Prestwich, and Derek Hsue for helping develop these ideas.

42430258,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBjh,1552266022,"Venezuelan Economist: Cryptocurrency Is 'Good' Money, Bolivars Are Not","The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela, first due to hyperinflation and later due to dollarization, could come to play a role in the country’s economic rebuilding.  At least that's according to Venezuela's most outspoken economist on the subject of cryptocurrencies, professor Aaron Olmos, who dissected the reasons for his country's current dependency on the US dollar in a new interview with CoinDesk. A passionate advocate of the benefits of cryptocurrencies, Olmos has lectured about the technology for over two years, even leading a program focused on blockchain for IESA, the most prominent business college in the country.  With several publications, conferences and interviews in national television, the economist has demonstrated a passion for teaching the Venezuelan public about the crypto economy and the implications of its adoption.  In his new interview, Olmos discussed the challenges of the present economic situation, where a devalued Bolivar is used as an official currency, despite alternatives. In his opinion, this situation – a consequence of decades of poor economic administration – has lead to a crisis where the use of cryptocurrencies has been accelerating as the Bolivar’s decline in value sharpens.  He told CoinDesk:  “We are in a complicated situation because 'good money' – dollars or cryptocurrency – is available, but it is scarce because people tend to keep it, not spend it. On the other hand our 'bad money,' the Bolivar, it’s the one used by law.""  Added to this, the economist pointed out the fact that cash in high denominations is limited, while bills in low denominations with no acquisition power are issued by the central bank.  “This creates a distortion in the price of goods and services since the production value is now based in dollars in the internal market,"" he explains. ""Everybody knows it: the Bolivar is our official currency in circulation, but the actual functional currency is the US dollar.""  Crypto as a solution  Yet, in the midst of this crisis, Olmos believes cryptocurrency could help form a solution, in part, because adoption ""is already happening.""  Along with the reactivation of production and the creation of new sources of investment, the answer to the country's economic issues could be introducing a double circulation system, similar to the one used in Brazil to overcome its rampant inflation in the 1990s, the Unit of Real Value (URV).  This way, the cryptocurrency would carry part of the burden in commerce and share it with the Bolivar.  “Given the conditions were we need an alternative element of trust, there’s nothing better than a cryptocurrency while an economic policy takes care of making the Bolivar regain value and recover its power,"" Olmos said.  Olmos went on to indicate that he does not believe current laws in the Venezuelan Constitution exclude the possibility of using a cryptocurrency for payments as part of a readjustment plan.  “What should be done is to recognize its use and give it some space for development for it to work properly and temporarily,"" the economist said, emphasizing the ultimate goal would be to boost the Bolivar’s value. ""We could even use it in a digital form.""  When asked about the possible inclusion of the Petro as part of a recovery plan, the economist denies it outright, adding: ""The Petro hasn’t worked out because it has a structure based on intervention, power concentration, and forced usage.""  Two visions of one country  Of course, the outcome will be defined by who will make the reins of Venezuela’s future. As Olmos puts it: “From Jan. 10, we have two visions of the same country.""  As the economist recounts, there’s an economic plan for 2019 - 2025 that theoretically includes blockchain and cryptocurrency. “But this document hasn’t been published nor seen by anyone,"" he said.  On the other hand, it's unclear what position will be taken, as the administration in charge, run by the National Assembly’s President, Juan Guaidó, hasn’t issued further opinions about crypto within the context of their plans for Venezuela’s recovery.
