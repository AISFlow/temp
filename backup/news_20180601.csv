42429170,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs3Fh,1527871510,Crypto Candy? Expect Free Giveaways When the EOS Blockchain Launches,"It turns out, owning EOS could be a 17-for-one offer for anyone who's in before the launch.  That's because, once live, it won't just be the cryptocurrency that powers the EOS software that's available to the market (see our full guide to the launch). In fact, most EOS holders will find they also own a bunch of other new tokens with real-world value since loads of startups are planning to jumpstart their efforts by gifting tokens to EOS users, the lion's share coming in the first blocks.  Stepping back, airdrops are a broader trend in crypto and not by any means something unique to EOS. A form of giveaway, they have taken on a special significance as a way to jumpstart a community around a project at very little cost and without asking anyone to spend money.  The OMG token issued by OmiseGo pioneered this approach in late 2017, when everyone with an ethereum wallet received a helping of its new token. Airdrops didn't stop thereafter, though they became more focused, with giveaways for people who sign up based on specific criteria becoming the norm. For example, companies might pay to do airdrops to elite crypto communities like 21.co or CoinList or they might simply ask their community to complete certain verifiable tasks to earn allocations.  But with EOS, that trend only appears to be accelerating.  The new EOS protocol will go live in early June (there is no precise time), and when it does, a transition will occur, with those who own EOS tokens issued on ethereum (effectively a dummy token used for fundraising) having their coins locked up in smart contracts until they can be exchanged.  Shortly after this happens, there will be many airdrops, and generally speaking these first few airdrops will be distributing widely to users. Many of them are dropping into every single wallet that has a certain number of EOS tokens in it.  Chaince, an exchange devoted to the EOS community with a plan to do an airdrop, and it says the flurry of activity around the launch was simply too good a marketing opportunity to pass up.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""EOS is very popular recently. New projects surely would like to choose a topical chain.""  As for the other companies involved, their missions vary widely. Some are attacking evergreen problems chased by startup founders, such as job search or payroll. There's a few taking on one of crypto's perennial favorite industries: gambling. Several, however, seem designed to build out the functionality of EOS.  Here's a selection of those more infrastructural efforts that happen to yield piles of new tokens:  Scatter        Users of ethereum may be familiar with Metamask, a browser extension that makes it easier to interact with the project's blockchain in the Chrome browser. Scatter aims to to do the same for EOS.  The goal of scatter is to give users a way to interact with products built on EOS without the need to reveal more information than they want (and without exposing their private key). By logging into Scatter once, a user can use different EOS dapps without logging in again as they move across the web, but Scatter also allows users to have multiple identities.  So, for example, a user could have one login for social networking sites and another to buy real things that will be shipped to their home.  The Scatter team wants to create a token to take on the issue of reputation, allowing different identities earn tokens to improve their reputation as needed on a given network. The token will be called RIDL.  ""For us, it's a way to actually create the initial supply. There is no maximum supply for the RIDL token,"" Nathan James, Scatter's founder told CoinDesk in an email. ""They are minted every time a new identity is registered.""  Scatter's token is unique in another way: it's giving them to identities, not matching eos balances, and no identity can hold more than 100 ridl. Reputation can't go any higher than that.  Chaince  Chaince will run an audit process that publishes reports about tokens listed on the platform. Called Choice of Chaince, this process is meant to make the platform one that reduces information asymmetry for token investors.  The white paper states:  ""The Choice of Chaince audit team will focus on high quality decentralized applications based on the EOS system and look forward to projects that pass the audit having the opportunity to develop into multi-billion dollar commercial giants.""  Chaince tokens will be distributed to all holders of EOS early on, and the Chaince exchange will share a portion of its earnings with holders of the tokens (the exchange only charges a 0.2 percent transaction fee, according to its white paper).  According to a spokesperson, Chaince is already well funded, and the main purpose for the airdrop is to drive user adoption rather than to finance development.  EOSDAC  Remember The DAO? EOSDAC is bringing the concept back, launching a version that will decide projects to take on democratically and return the value realized back to the community.  EOSDAC is interesting because it already did its airdrop on April 15, based on block 300 of the EOS token sale. So, only people who were following EOS before the buzz in the final days before the airdrop were able to get the tokens.  But the airdrop has complicated the launch of the mainnet somewhat. In order to access EOS tokens after the launch, users need to have already established an EOS wallet and associated it with their ethereum wallet. Lots of conversation about the best wallets to choose addressed whether or not they were built to support EOSDAC tokens as well as EOS.  EOSDAC dropped 75 percent of its tokens to EOS holders.  Parachute  After all this talk about wide distribution of tokens, the platform obviously needs a tool to allow for permissioned, targered token giveaways. Enter: Parachute, a project of the block producer candidate EOS Dublin.  Parachute will create a membership-based system where a person can share information about themselves and receive offers for free tokens based on that information.  EOS Dublin isn't actually offering a new token to run Parachute, but users will get airdrops, provided it works out. Unless the idea of creating new tokens for startups goes away, something like Parachute will be needed for a while.

According to a report by the China Money Network on Friday, the cryptocurrency exchange has teamed up with Chinese investment firm NewMargin Capital and South Korean securities firm Kiwoom Securities on the joint effort. Banks from South Korea, including Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank Of Korea, are to invest in the fund as limited partners, the report adds.

42429172,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs3Hh,1527862516,Up 24%: Bytecoin Only Gainer In Bad Month for Big Cryptos,"Bitcoin's failure to scale the $10,000 mark and the following 19 percent slump did not bode well for the cryptocurrency markets last month.  The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fell to $304 billion on May 29 – the lowest level since April 13 and a drop of 26 percent for the month, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Meanwhile, the bitcoin dominance rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap contributed by bitcoin, rose from 35.86 percent (May 6 low) to 40 percent, signaling a possible rotation of money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin.  The argument has merit, as BTC ranked 18th on the list of losers among top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, meaning it outperformed most of the big names.  For instance, XRP and bitcoin cash both (BCH) dropped 26 percent during May. EOS depreciated by 30 percent and litecoin (LTC) shed 20 percent. Among the major cryptocurrencies, only ethereum (ETH) managed to outperform bitcoin with a 13.8 percent drop.  It wasn't all bad news, though – a cryptocurrency called bytecoin (BCN) refused to follow the downtrend and clocked a 24 percent monthly gain to become the best top-25 performer in May.  Monthly winner  Bytecoin  Monthly performance: +24 percent  All-time high: $0.0186  Closing price on May 31: $0.006838  Current market price: $0.006665  Rank as per market capitalization: 19  Bytecoin surged to a record high of $0.01862 in early May as Binance's decision to list the cryptocurrency revved up investor excitement. However, the bullish momentum weakened in the second half of the month, likely due to profit taking and broader market sell-off.  Daily chart  Prices fell below the key ascending trendline on May 17, as seen in the chart above, and then dropped to the 200-day moving average support of $0.0051 on May 29.  A bullish outside-day candle neutralized the immediate bearish outlook. However, the lack of positive follow-through is disheartening for the bulls.  Only a strong move above $0.0075 would confirm a bullish reversal. On the downside, acceptance below the 200-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $0.0186.  Monthly losers  Qtum  Monthly performance: -41.2 percent  All-time high: $106.88  Closing price on May 31: $13.35  Current market price: $13.74  Rank as per market capitalization: 20  QTUM, the native token of Qtum blockchain, took a beating in May, having repeatedly failed to scale the all-important 200-day moving average (MA) in April, Bittrex data shows. There had been plenty optimism in the air at the beginning of the month as Qtum, a lesser-known ethereum rival, launched the first decentralized application (dApp) – Bodhi (BOT) – on its mainnet.  However, the good news failed to keep prices bid – not surprising, perhaps, considering the broader market sell-off and the technical failure at the key long-term moving average seen below.  Daily chart  However, the recovery from the recent low of $11.91 has put the brakes on the sell-off. Further, the daily relative strength index (RSI) has crossed the falling tendline, signaling scope for a corrective rally. Hence, a move above the immediate resistance of $14.37 (May 12 low) could yield a quick rally to 50-day MA located at $17.76.  NEM  Monthly performance: -40 percent  All-time high: $2.09  Closing price on May 31: $0.245114  Current market price: $0.252008  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  NEM (XEM) was in the news for all the good reasons in May.  Tech Bureau released an update for the NEM protocol for public and private networks, codenamed Catapult, which will enable digital asset creation, decentralized swaps, advanced account systems and business logic modeling.  Meanwhile, Abra, the global app that allows users to invest in 25 cryptocurrencies, added XEM to its platform.  However, the repeated failure on the part of the bulls to cross the $0.45 mark in late April seems to have proved costly for the cryptocurrency. Prices hit a 6.5-week low of $0.2235 on May 29, according to Poloniex data.  Weekly chart  XEM has created a head-and-shoulders-like bearish reversal pattern. A break below $0.22 (neckline support) would allow a deeper drop to $0.07 (long-term rising trendline support). On the higher side, only a move above $0.457 (April high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  OmiseGO  Monthly performance: -37.9 percent  All-time high: $28.35  Closing price on May 31: $10.55  Current market price: $10.52  Rank as per market capitalization: 21  OmiseGO (OMG) crossed a key falling trendline in April, raising the odds of a rally to record highs in May. However, the bullish move ran out of steam around the $20 mark in early May and prices fell to a 6.5-week low of $9.50 on May 29, according to Bitfinex.  Weekly chart  The fall back below the descending trendline may have weakened the bulls. So, prices could drop to the head-and-shoulders neckline support of $8.48 in the near-term. Acceptance below that level would mean a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

Ella Zhang, head of the exchange's incubator program Binance Labs, said during an online meetup Thursday that the capital for the fund will be coming from Binance's own reserves as a way to contribute to the industry ecosystem.  Binance will pour in the $1 billion over 10 phases of $100 million each and, in essence, will create a combination of a fund of funds (a fund that invests in other funds) and a direct fund that invests in blockchain projects.  For the fund of funds, the incubator chief further explained that Binance is seeking 20 funds to invest in, which each must manage a pool of at least $100 million in order to be eligible. Investments will be made through Binance's own BNB token, she said.  The first project to be supported is a blockchain-powered ride-hailing initiative that was recently announced by Chen Weixing, CEO of app developer Funcity and former founder of Chinese ride-hailing app Kuaidi Dache. As previously reported, Chen revealed the initiative at a Big Data expo in Guizhou, China, last week together with Yang Jun, co-founder of Meituan, one of the largest group discount apps in China.  ""We believe it's a disruptive social experiment. Binance Labs hopes to work with more aspirational projects to explore blockchain applications and together move forward the growth of the industry,"" Zhang said.

According to an announcement, the new app – called CryptoChips – will initially be integrated with a real-time territorial battle game also developed by GMO called ""Whimsical War.""  By playing the game on an iOS or Android device starting from August of this year, users can be rewarded with bitcoin based on their ranking and missions achieved inside the game.  Rather than using on-device mining to earn the cryptocurrency, players will receive their bitcoin rewards directly from GMO. The firm kicked off its own bitcoin mining operations in December 2017, and has also slated in August as the deadline for the launch of its cloud mining service.  The tech giant said in the announcement that the hope is to encourage the public to become familiar with cryptocurrencies via the new app, since users will need to use their own digital wallets to receive and use the bitcoin.  GMO indicated that, moving forward, it may include support for more cryptocurrencies within the app and also expand its integrations across other mobile games.  The new service comes just a week after GMO announced that it is launching the world's first 7nm bitcoin mining chip, with a target shipment deadline set for the end of October 2018.

Greg Pinn, who ran Thomson Reuters' risk intelligence and financial crime screening platform, will now be in charge of product strategy at iComply, which focuses on using blockchain and artificial intelligence to maintain immutable records. So far the startup has launched a know-your-customer (KYC) tool, as well as a toolkit for blockchain startups looking to add governance and compliance systems, according to a press release.  In a statement, Pinn said that KYC processes are important for cryptocurrencies, and he plans for iComply to be an industry standard in the space.  Pinn explained:  ""Both World-Check and iComply are in the KYC space, and World-Check came about at a time before there even really was a compliance space – it was one of the first players in the market to solve a major problem. iComply is doing the same thing for the emerging blockchain and crypto world, not only removing the 'tinfoil hat' from crypto but solving a real problem and building a solution for it.""  Matthew Unger, chief executive and founder of iComply, said in a statement that cryptocurrency exchanges and startups need better KYC tools than most use at present, which means they do not actually comply with certain legal requirements.  As such, he sees iComply as filling a need for regulatory compliance, adding that ""The irony of the cryptocurrency markets is that while blockchain opened the door to non-compliance with ICOs initially, the underlying technology actually has the ability to provide more robust and effective compliance, transparency and integrity than traditional tools, at a fraction of the cost.""  ""Existing legacy tools and services do not have the capabilities to assess the unique risks within cryptocurrency markets. This has allowed iComply to raise the standards of compliance in the industry, enabling institutional wealth to start participating in the growth of global financial decentralization,"" he said.

42429171,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs3Dh,1527847227,This Long-Term Indicator Could Complicate Bitcoin's Price Recovery,"A long-term price indicator has turned bearish for the first time in four years, threatening to impede continued gains in bitcoin's price.  Despite the rally late in the month, the cryptocurrency dropped 19 percent in May, according to Bitfinex data, pushing the 5-month moving average (MA) below the 10-month moving average for the first time since June 2014. The bearish moving average crossover validates the argument that long-term bull market has ended and indicates scope for further losses.  The monthly chart also shows BTC fell below $7,698 – the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $162 (2015 low) to $19,891 (2017 high) – last month, bolstering the already bearish technical setup.  However, the 4-hour chart is distinctly more bullish, indicating that gains could continue in the short-term.  Monthly chart  Going strictly by the monthly chart, BTC could drop to the immediate support of $6,000 (February low) and possibly extend the decline further towards $4,384 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement).  However, bitcoin had to drop 19 percent in May to push the 5-month MA below the 10-month MA. So, it's likely the bears have run out of steam, at least for the short-term. Thus, a corrective rally could be in the offing before the bearish effect of the long-term moving average crossover is felt.  Indeed, the short duration chart does show a scope for a rally to $7,800.  4-hour chart  Bitcoin created another higher low (bullish pattern) as it recovered from the low of $7,414 yesterday. The 50-candle MA has now shed bearish bias) and the RSI is above 50.00 (bullish territory) and rising.  The price action, when viewed against the backdrop of Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and the bullish price-RSI divergence, indicates scope for a rally to $7,818 (falling trendline resistance).  View  The 5-month and 10-month MA bearish crossover has boosted the odds of a drop below the February low of $6,000.  In the short-term, bitcoin could rise to $7,818, while a high-volume break above the falling trendline hurdle would open the doors to $8,310 (5-month MA).  However, only a convincing move above $9,990 (recent high) would revive the long-term bullish outlook.  Bearish scenario: Bitcoin could drop below $7,000 over the weekend if the cryptocurrency closes (as per UTC) below the descending (bearish) 10-day MA, currently located at $7,419.

42429150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs2hh,1527843647,Bitmain's New Miner Is Drawing Criticism from Early Users,"Mining hardware giant Bitmain has been criticized over one of its latest mining products, the AntMiner B3, with Chinese users making allegations about its marketing tactics and quality control.  According to a blog post from the AntMiner's official WeChat account, the new product – dedicated to mining BTM, the native token of the Bytom blockchain – was launched on April 25, one day after the Bytom team launched its mainnet.  Priced at 17,000 Chinese yuan (or $2,600) per unit, the first batch of 25,000 B3 miners was notably sold out in seconds after commencement of the sale.  While the AntMiner B3's official specifications tout a computing power of 750 hashes per second, complaints from the first batch of buyers in China soon emerged, alleging that Bitmain had significantly exaggerated the product's power capability in its marketing.  According to a local news source, the dispute arose after an initial test by miners in China said the AntMiner B3 can only produce 500–600 hashes per second, a difference that critically reduces their calculated profits from an 47 BTM per day to as low as single digit production.  As more complaints have emerged in the local community over the past several weeks, miners have moved to form groups on social messaging app WeChat and have shared their findings on the mining device on Chinese Q&A site Zhihu.  Other allegations that have since then been circulating over the social media include suspicions that Bitmain is using secondhand components to manufacture the B3. According to one post on Zhihu, users commented that the fan of their supposed brand new AntMiner B3 was covered with dust, which could potentially explain the reported weak computing performance.  Subsequently, a dedicated Weibo account that claims to protect the rights of the B3 buyers was also created on May 19, in a bid to demand refunds from the mining giant.  According to a post from the activists' Weibo page, a group of B3 purchasers visited Bitmain's office in Beijing on Monday to discuss a solution to the issue. While the group apparently comprised of fewer than 10 people, the meeting saw local policemen present to ensure the conversation was peaceful.  Based on a news report from Sina, miners from the group said Bitmain expressed willingness to fix products that have hashing power issues, but would not consider refunding customers. The firm is instead open to the idea of resolving the matter through the legal process, as per the report.  While Bitmain has yet to respond to CoinDesk's enquiry for further comment, the company was quoted in another local news report Thursday conceding there are problems with some B3s. However, Bitmain clarified that devices with issues only represent one percent of production so far, based on its internal investigations. The company also denied the accusation that it was selling secondhand products.  In response to the accusation that it exaggerated the specs of the mining machine in its marketing, Bitmain commented:  ""Mining machines are in essence investment products ... The profit and the price of the token adjust based on the market dynamics. As such nothing could guaranteed by any company or any individual.""

42429169,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs39h,1527840003,Taking Back Power: An Upstart Government Plans to Tokenize Energy,"Catalonia is continuing to test the boundaries of centralized power in Spain, this time with the help of decentralizing blockchain technology.  Despite the police crackdown that followed last October's failed bid for independence, the Catalan government plans to airdrop an energy trading token to people in the northeastern Spanish region. The plan is to incentivize solar power generation by circumventing rules inhibiting its adoption made by Madrid.  Peer-to-peer energy trading in Spain is limited by rules requiring consumers who produce solar energy (known as ""prosumers"") to pay a grid access fee before they can sell their excess power back to the national grid or share it with others using the grid.  However, this debate goes way beyond Spain's torrid political climate. Highly regulated energy markets around the world appear to be embracing a wave of disruption in the form of renewables and innovation, but the big players are also stymying the democratization of energy.  Restricting the sale of excess electricity back to any national power grid makes rooftop solar much less attractive – when it could be bringing down people's bills and making the planet greener.  Lluïsa Marsal, the technological innovation lead at the Catalan Institute of Energy of the government of Catalonia, is overseeing a creative project that dodges legal and economic limitations on sharing and trading self-produced energy.  The solution involves an ""ION"" crypto token to vitalize community-managed micro-grids (groups of distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar generators which can connect to the main grid or operate in ""island mode"").  Marsal stressed the token was not conceived as a challenge to Madrid's authority, but rather to ensure that energy trading is attractive to consumers.  She told CoinDesk:  ""The token has nothing to do with independence. It's an energy token to manage micro-grids.""  But in order for those micro-grids to be free from the legal and economic constraints which limit their appeal, they have to be isolated from Spain's national grid.  ""This way, the trading is not with the utility company but between the peers of these solar communities. The ION token powers all the transactions within micro-grids,"" said Marsal.  Power to the people  The ION token and wallet will be completely open and public and based on the ethereum ERC-20 token standard, Marsal said.  Rather than being sold to raise funds like an ICO token, it will be given away, or ""airdropped"" to use the common parlance, when users sign up for the project and install their ION wallet. Quantities given out will vary between 100 to 5,000 IONs, depending on the user's engagement.  The wallet is still under development and no code has been released yet. The plan is to start in approximately two months from now with a pilot scheme covering five municipalities in Catalonia.  Ultimately, there will be 8.418 million ION distributed; this is to mirror the power in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year produced by Catalonia's combined nuclear power plants, said Marsal.  ""When these micro-grids are massively deployed and many solar communities are formed, we aim for a total solar production equalling one solar power plant. This may take years, but we want to establish the value of 1 ION to 1kWh.""  In terms of how the token will work in the hands of users, the system will use an average measurement of kWh in solar power usage and when someone uses more than average they pay for the excess in crypto tokens; if they use less they are rewarded in crypto.  This approach to electricity metering is meant to offer more flexibility. For instance, small and discrete groups of users can agree on energy consumption schedules (such as using appliances at different times of the day or different days of the week). Smart contracts could help manage power allowances for each user in these ""non-simultaneity"" schedules.  In addition, ION tokens could be traded on secondary markets, ""since the price of kWh is known and it is approximately €0.10,"" said Marsal.  Winners and losers  Stepping back, the ION proposal aims to cut through a Gordian Knot of regulations, disincentives and subsidies that tie up any kind of free market for trading or sharing energy.  James Johnson, CEO of Open Utility, a peer-to-peer energy marketplace in the U.K., sees tokens as an interesting replacement for feed-in tariffs, subsidies designed to help accelerate renewable energy technologies.  ""In the U.K. we have mandated subsidies paid through electricity bills that then gets awarded to the early adopters,"" he said. ""A token could count in the same context if there are enough people willing to buy into it, because they saw the value in taking power into their own hands, figuratively speaking.""  There will likely be some losers within the legacy system of suppliers, generators and wire infrastructure as we evolve towards smarter, greener grids, said Johnson.  ""With the rollout of solar and batteries and electric cars, all the interesting stuff is on the edges of the network, rather than centralized,"" he said. ""Some of the big generators could go out of business because they can be replaced with small-scale equivalents.""  Returning to Catalonia, it's fitting timing for the ION airdrop as the region's new separatist president, Quim Torra, just got a green light to form a government provided it doesn't include any of the jailed and exiled former ministers involved in last October's rally for independence.  The drive for Catalan independence goes back centuries (the region gained broad autonomy in the early 1930s but that was revoked under General Francisco Franco). Catalonia is wealthier than the rest of Spain and recently has emerged as a flourishing technology hub.  Indeed, the decentralizing power of blockchains is being explored in other areas, such as managing a digital Catalan identity system. And identity, after all, is a thing many of these people are proud of.  ""We Catalans usually are more creative and we tend to be more pioneering,"" said Marsal, who also allowed a little resentment to slip out regarding a ""revolving door"" between the central government and utilities, adding:  ""The guy who leaves the government is always the one who goes to a utility. They have verbal agreements to keep the status quo.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article misdescribed Spain's policy on peer-to-peer energy trading.

The company said in an announcement on Friday that the investment instrument – called HB10 – is now open for subscriptions, though it only accepts purchases using cryptocurrencies instead of fiat currencies.  According to the firm, the new product will replicate the Huobi 10 index, which was recently launched to track 10 different assets on the Huobi Pro exchange in real time, based on their market capitalization and liquidity.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the index uses weighted samples to reflect the overall market performance on Huobi Pro. By tracking that data, Huobi touts that HB10 will help to diversify risks for retail investors while giving them exposure to major cryptocurrency assets.  The company further added that since the product will also be available for institutional investors, it could potentially ""reduce the impact of institutional entry and exit"" on single cryptocurrencies.  Meanwhile, a company representative told CoinDesk that the new offering will have similar restrictions as Huobi Pro. For instance, while it will still be available for investors from China, the new service notably excludes those from the U.S., given regulatory uncertainty over cryptocurrency-related ETFs in the country.

42429157,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLs2th,1527820227,The EOS Blockchain Launch: What Should Happen (And What Could Go Wrong),"The world's fifth most valuable cryptocurrency is set to formally release its software this weekend.  First announced in 2017, the EOS project has been fundraising for nearly a year, raising a reported $4 billion in what many are claiming is the largest amount ever collected by a team creating a custom cryptocurrency. As such, the launch, expected for Saturday, has come with no shortage of hype.  The fervor around the unveiling is, in part, due to the diverse discussions long surrounding the project. As detailed by CoinDesk, EOS has long been a target of criticism for its vision and execution, though it has attracted advocates who believe it offers a decentralized alternative to the cloud hosting services that currently dominate the lucrative market for data storage.  With public trading for the cryptocurrency already well underway, all eyes are likely to be on the markets, in addition to technology forums, where token holders are already queuing up with questions related to trading, token registration, airdrops and wallet compatibility.  Clarity has been hard to come by, something that hasn't been helped by a lack of dialogue from those who have been most publicly associated with the project.  Nevertheless, the upcoming launch process is not wholly mysterious.  Most notably, the launch will begin 23 hours after the protocol's publisher, Block.one, makes the code available as open-source software. The release of the code, however, will be the extent of Block.one's involvement in the launch.  From there, a community of aspiring block producers -- various entities competing to act as validators in the network's delegated proof-of-stake system (dPOS) -- will subsequently pick up the baton as part of an elaborate process that appears unorthodox, even in the evolving world of new blockchain technologies.  Liftoff? Not quite  Upon the software's release, this group of block producers -- which includes an unknown set of exchanges, crypto mining operations, consultancies and others -- will first take a ""snapshot"" of the EOS tokens (represented on the ethereum blockchain, used for fundraising) to determine the quantity of EOS tokens that must migrate to users EOS wallets.  For users who have bought EOS tokens, this merely means that the block producers will verify that the balance of tokens at their new EOS address is the same as the previous balance of EOS tokens at their ethereum address.  According to Block.one, EOS token holders can ensure that their tokens transfer by registering their ethereum addresses prior to June 2.  Upon the completion of the token verification process, a limited number of block producers will be appointed to test the blockchain prior to making it available to the public.  ""What we're going to do is launch the mainnet together as a group, but we're going to freeze it so that no [token] transfers can happen yet, "" Dafeng Guo, co-founder of EOS Asia, a developer consortium specialized in the EOS blockchain, told CoinDesk.  He added that the block producers will then ""clone the chain"" and complete a ""bunch of testing on it"" to ensure that its smart contract, voting and multi-sig wallet functionalities work. According to a statement circulated by multiple block producer candidates, third parties will also be able to test the network at that time.  Once the block producers conclude their tests, the network will be available to token holders, however they will still be unable to carry out token transfers.  The protocol's consensus system (delegated proof-of-stake) requires users to first select block producers by voting, which is carried out by 'staking' tokens. Users with more tokens have more influence in the election of block producers than those with fewer tokens, and 15 percent of the network's total tokens must be staked in order for users to kick-off token transferal.  The voting process is one anticipated pain point of the launch. As CoinDesk has previously reported, there has been widespread confusion within the community as to how to vote and user-friendly interfaces are few and far in between. Programming-literate token holders can vote via a command line interface, but less tech-savvy users will likely have to rely on crowdfunded projects like EOS Portal.  ""If we can't vote, then we can't activate the chain,"" Kevin Rose, co-founder and head of community at block producer candidate EOS New York, told CoinDesk.  According to Guo and Rose, the period of time between the protocol's launch on mainnet to the conclusion of testing could be hours or days. The voting process is likely to add additional time.  In other words, it is unlikely that the EOS blockchain will launch on mainnet, become public and allow users to undertake transfers all on the same day.  Bugs? It's anyone's guess  Another potential roadblock to the full activation of the chain is vulnerability in the code.  Earlier this week, major China-based internet security firm Qihoo 360 informed Block.one that the protocol had a ""series of epic vulnerabilities"" that made its nodes susceptible to attackers. Developers fixed the bug on the same day, and Block.one CTO Daniel Larimer subsequently announced a 'bug bounty' on Twitter, offering $10,000 for major finds.  Guo predicted that other bugs will crop up after the launch, and said he was happy that Qihoo 360 is reviewing the EOS code.  ""I anticipate that there might be more vulnerabilities being discovered and patched in the first one or two weeks after the code is frozen,"" he said, adding that the severity of the issues, and hence their effect on the network, could vary. ""It could be a very easy patch or it could be a harder to fix type of problem,"" he explained.  Still, Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto investment fund and EOS investor Multicoin Capital, downplayed the potential for bugs to disrupt the launch.  ""That's par for the course for any system of this scale,"" he said of Qihoo 360's discovery. ""If you look at the history of these systems, like ethereum 1.0 when it was launched, it's amazing that the thing even worked. It was really held together with duct tape. And if you look at bitcoin in its early days, it's the same thing. It's always going to be a little bit rough, but overall things are trending in a very good direction.""  Nonetheless, he added that Multicoin is ""keeping an eye on the GitHub issues log.""  For his part, Rose said he was confident that Block.one would adequately address issues with the code before the launch, but ""if extra time is needed, that's ok,"" he added.  Evil twins?  While the prevalence of bugs remains to be seen, Rose and Guo said one likely outcome of the mainnet launch is the creation of mainnet ""clones"" - or forks of the EOS blockchain created to steal users' tokens.  ""This is going to be wrought with scams because this software is open source and the EOS private keys are the same across all networks that launch,"" Rose explained of the launch.  ""It's kind of tricky because ordinary token holders, they don't know which one is the real mainnet,"" Guo said. Likewise, he suggested that airdrops - the distribution of free tokens often through forks - could make these clones all the more tempting.  ""For them, from just purely a game theory point of view, they probably also don't care as much. Some people will be like, 'Oh I have an extra token,'"" he continued.  Guo explained that these clones carry additional risk because, unlike bitcoin for example, ""there is no standard"" for the EOS blockchain, so the first mainnet version is not guaranteed to create a committed following.  While forks can be valuable ways for communities to experiment, Guo said he thinks early EOS forks are unlikely to be well-intentioned.  ""Since there is no EOS mainnet yet, anybody who is trying to launch a clone at this moment is just taking advantage of the situation.""  Rose said he advises users to be ""extremely vigilant"" about inputting their private keys and to rely on unified statements put out by mainnet block producers.  ""Do not do so unless you are absolutely certain that you have heard from at least five reputable sources. And when I say reputable sources I mean block producers you trust that have published the exact same statement, on the same day, that says to do the same thing at the same time. Don't do anything until you see that,"" he cautioned.  Representatives for Block.one did not reply to requests for comment for this story.
