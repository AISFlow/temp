42383014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tioD,1574205918,Security Token Platform iSTOX Lands Another Big Asian Backer,"Japanese financial services group Tokai Tokyo is the latest large Asian financial institution to back tokenized securities platform iSTOX.       The $5 million infusion, disclosed Monday, followed the startup’s Series A funding round last month which also was subscribed by a single institution, Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group (KKP), one of the largest Thai investment banks.       No financial details of that raise were disclosed, but the proceeds were to grow the user base of qualified investors, issue tokens based on stocks, bonds and structured products, and expand in Asia.       In a statement, iSTOX said the new partnership with Tokai provides a “strategic gateway” to Japan through that conglomerate’s established investor network there which dates back to 1908.       The iSTOX platform's owner is ICHX Tech, a fintech infrastructure company funded by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Heliconia Capital Management, a subsidiary of the Singapore state-owned investment giant Temasek Holdings.      The platform plans to enter full commercial operation in the first quarter of 2020.       The company said it expects to be the first fully regulated platform to offer security tokens in a major financial hub across the world. iSTOX aims to lower transaction costs by eliminating middlemen and streamlining settlement process – both addressed via tokenization.       Three law firms are advising issuers on the structure and issuance process for tokens to be traded on the platform, including Allen & Gledhill LLP, Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow and Rajah & Tann, CoinDesk previously reported.       In May, iSTOX was admitted into a fintech regulatory sandbox set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Singaporean central bank.

Speaking at Chainalysis Links conference in New York City on Friday, Blanco said FinCEN upholds its “technology neutral” standpoint in including stablecoins under that definition.       “It does not matter if the stablecoin is backed by a currency, a commodity, or even an algorithm – the rules are the same,” Blanco said.       The clarification by America’s anti-money laundering regulator came as Blanco insisted stablecoin administrators must register as a Money Services Business (MSB) with FinCEN.       A branch of the Treasury Department, FinCEN investigates money laundering and other financial crimes by pouring through transaction records and data.       Including stablecoins as money transmitters, and their administrators as MSBs, means firms dealing with them must follow federal know-your-customer (KYC) and AML laws under the Bank Secrecy Act.       Stablecoins are issued based on reserve assets - frequently, 1:1 with the U.S. dollar or linked to a basket of currencies. But they can also use other mechanisms to ensure stability. Dai, the MakerDAO token, uses algorithms to rebalance.       Bitcoin, on the other hand, trades freely.       It is a distinction without a difference, according to Blanco.       “Just because you say you are a banana doesn’t make you a banana,” he said.       “FinCEN applies the same technology neutral regulatory framework to any activity that provides the same functionality at the same level or risk, regardless of its label. It is not what you label it, it's the activity you actually do that counts.”       Blanco’s comments add legal clarity to a fast-evolving corner of the crypto space, whose recent big-name storylines such as Facebook’s Libra project attracted widespread media attention.       But the stablecoin concept is not new; Blanco said Friday. FinCEN began studying stablecoins in crypto’s early days and first issued guidance on it in 2008. He said that increasing public interest warranted clarification.       FinCEN’s past decisions placed money transmission service considerations on ICO issuers and most recently on some decentralized applications.       The remarks Friday reemphasized a recent talking point by Blanco: there’s no excuse for non-compliance. Not in money transmission or in the requirements of Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule.       “You can’t build a car that only goes 150 miles per hour and ask us to change the speed limit.

42383013,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tikR,1574172000,Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust Seeks SEC Reporting Company Status,"Grayscale Investments, the asset management subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, is filing to register its Bitcoin Trust as a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting company.      If the U.S. regulator deems the Form 10 filing effective, the trust’s shares would be registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, potentially making it the first cryptocurrency investment vehicle to become a reporting company.      The shares are already publicly traded on an over-the-counter market, but reporting company status would improve transparency and liquidity for shareholders.      For example, the trust would have to make public filings of its quarterly and annual reports, as well as updates on unscheduled material events and corporate changes, just like Apple, ExxonMobil and AT&T do.      As a reporting company, the trust could potentially attract investors who are currently restricted from participating in any investment vehicles that aren’t SEC-regulated reporting companies, Grayscale said.      “The fact that it would be an SEC reporting company would perhaps give some of those institutions greater oversight or greater comfort,” said Grayscale managing director Michael Sonnenshein in a phone interview.      Participants in the bitcoin trust could also more quickly liquidate their holdings if needed. Currently, investors must hold their shares for at least 12 months. If the registration statement is deemed effective, this could drop to six months, Sonnenshein said.      Grayscale manages some $2.5 billion in assets across 10 different trusts, he said.    Additional requirements    The SEC usually takes 60 days to respond to filings like the one Grayscale submitted Tuesday, though “that is by no means guaranteed,” Sonnenshein said, since the U.S. securities regulator may request edits or ask questions.      Should Grayscale successfully register the bitcoin trust, it would have to file 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports with the SEC, similarly to other publicly traded companies. Shareholders with more than 5 percent of the trust’s shares would be required to file beneficial owner reports. While the trust has no directors or officers, if it did, any with more than 10 percent of outstanding shares would have to report their transactions.      Sonnenshein said he could not disclose how many investors or institutions this might include.      Still, he said, the move should serve the growing demand for the bitcoin trust.      The trust was the second-most actively traded security on the OTCQX market last month, he said, following Roche, a research-focused healthcare firm.      “We’re seeing an ever-growing demand for exposure to bitcoin through a security or an access product like we offer,” Sonnenshein said.

Coinbase Ventures, ConsenSys, Kleiner Perkins, A Capital, Collaborative Fund and Sound Ventures joined the latest round as new investors, while early backers, including Galaxy Digital and Initialized, made follow-up investments after a $5.25 million seed round in March.       Bison Trails declined to disclose further financial terms of deal.       The Series A round came after the startup was included as one of the 21 founding members for Facebook’s Libra Association in October, boosting its reputation as a global infrastructure service provider, CEO Joe Lallouz said in an interview.       “As the only blockchain infrastructure firm in the Libra project, we'll contribute to building the new system with Facebook,” Lallouz said, adding that it was the tech giant that approached Bison Trails earlier in the year for the role on the founding team.       Formed in 2018, the New York-based startup uses its protocols to help customers deploy the participation nodes on any blockchain, without having to develop their own security, dev ops, infrastructure, and protocol engineering competencies.       ""We have become the easiest way to run infrastructure on multiple blockchains, and helped other protocols, companies and builders launch and manage distributed nodes on blockchain network,” Lallouz said noting the firm now serves more than 20 protocol projects.    Investing in infrastructure services    Bison Trails’ investors said they were betting on the increasing utility of the company’s infrastructure services.       Kleiner Perkins investing partner Monica Desai said: “Bison Trails realized early that node infrastructure would become a bottleneck to blockchain adoption, which is why they created a decentralized, user-friendly solution,” according to a statement.       Coinbase Ventures COO Emilie Choi said crypto networks will continue to move towards active network participation models such as staking, voting, signaling, further reinforcing the need for solutions such as those that Bison Trails provides.      Infrastructure protocols has seen a stream of significant investments in blockchain services.       Nervos completed its $72 million token sale and launched its mainnet this month, providing infrastructure for companies to build their projects on chain, while the Interchain Foundation has dedicated resources to developing its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.       Lallouz said the equity raise, rather than a token sale, keeps its interests inline with those of its customers.       “Without our own blockchain or tokens, we can actually better focus on offering the secured and scalable infrastructure layer for any blockchain platform with the new funding.” Lallouz said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/19/blockchain-capital-leads-25m-funding-round-for-libra-member-bison-trails,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cde04e3f032b3613ab4b18e164c65afa78c931e7-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383017,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9titF,1574168400,When Lambo? Crypto's Favorite Automaker to Track Cars on Salesforce Blockchain,"Automobili Lamborghini, the manufacturer of the most craved sports cars in crypto, will trial blockchain tech in its supply chain operations.  Announced today, the luxury automaker will use an enterprise blockchain platform from Salesforce to track the authenticity of the cars sold on the secondary market.  ""When a Lamborghini is resold, the vehicle often goes through 800 to 1,000 certification checks that take place at the Lamborghini headquarters in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy,"" according to a press release published Tuesday by Salesforce.  To ensure customers are buying a genuine Lambo with genuine parts, the company needs to employ a broad network of people and entities, such as dealerships, auction houses, repair shops, photographers and more, to help document each car's history. Blockchain tech will help to make this easier, Lamborghini believes, by gathering all the partners together in one trusted distributed network.  In the future, ""each vehicle will come with an immutable record of service, including restoration, prior ownership and more,"" and each car will be ""armed against potential counterfeiting,"" Salesforce said.  Paolo Gabrielli, head of after sales at Lamborghini, said the automaker has always been curious about new technologies despite its long history (it was founded in 1963).  “Salesforce Blockchain will allow us to take our innovation a step further, accelerating the authenticity of our heritage vehicles faster than ever,"" Gabrielli said.  Salesforce unveiled its enterprise blockchain platform, based on Hyperledger Sawtooth, in May. The product is provides a framework that allows customers to drag and drop ready-to-use modules to build their own blockchain networks with minimal need for writing code. Salesforce joined the Hyperledger consortium in May.  “Blockchain is changing the way companies approach trust and transparency,” said Adam Caplan, Salesforce's SVP of emerging technology. “Lamborghini is a perfect example of this – we're excited to see how such an iconic brand is able to innovate and transform the vintage car market with a cutting edge technology like Salesforce Blockchain.”  Lamborghini has now become the fourth client for Salesforce's blockchain platform, following Arizona State University, health research company IQVIA and ratings agency S&P Global, Salesforce's spokesperson Vince Bitong told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/19/when-lambo-cryptos-favorite-automaker-to-track-cars-on-salesforce-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87d85428a19b8f9376f9d0e7419c12a8c57ac11b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383021,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tivl,1574168400,PayPal Joins $4.2M Round for Crypto Banking Compliance Startup,"Financial institutions know how to calculate the risk of serving traditional businesses. But for firms touching cryptocurrency, the math is still fuzzy. The assumption of added regulatory hurdles and money-laundering fears have led to a widespread problem: Your average bank would rather just not deal with it.      Addressing those concerns with clear-eyed data is how compliance startup TRM Labs wants to accelerate the institutional embrace of crypto. And that’s why a group of investors are backing the blockchain analytics firm to the tune of $4.2 million in new funding.      “Many might consider this the unsexy plumbing of the financial system but it’s what allows [crypto adoption] to thrive,” TRM Labs co-founder and CEO Esteban Castaño said in an interview. “We’re helping financial institutions to think through crypto’s potential as well as to mitigate any of the associated risks.”      The slate of investors includes Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian’s Initialized Capital, SF stalwart Blockchain Capital and a new strategic partner, PayPal Ventures. The influx of capital brings TRM’s total funding to $5.9 million after the startup emerged out of Y Combinator earlier this year.      It’s only the second blockchain-related investment disclosed by PayPal Ventures (the first was in April 2019) and comes just a month after PayPal itself withdrew from the Facebook-led Libra Association.    Chainalysis, but for banks    While competing firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic are known for aiding law enforcement, TRM Labs is focused solely on finance.      “Financial institutions use TRM to risk-score their cryptocurrency-related transactions, customers, or partnerships, helping them to simplify customer due diligence and meet regulatory requirements,” the company said in a statement.      That means the startup scours over a dozen blockchains, analyzing billions of transactions for signs of fraud and money-laundering.      The heightened interest from major players in traditional finance comes from a dawning realization that exposure to crypto is now “inevitable,” Castaño said.      “This new world is coming,” he said. “We’re going to help the existing financial system adapt to this new world so they can effectively engage with it.”      That doesn’t mean TRM is alone. Chainalysis, for one, already serves the finance sector, apparently to mixed reviews.      “The existing providers are trying to tailor products to financial institutions, and we’re just finding they’re not doing a good job of that,” Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart told CoinDesk.      Regardless, he said, getting those institutions comfortable with crypto requires conforming to existing rules and regulations around tracking the provenance of customer funds.      “Every time we’re talking to a financial institution, number one or two on their list of concerns is compliance and risk management,” Bogart said.      TRM Labs is a team of 20, according to Castaño. The San Francisco-based company says it will use the new funding for product development, hiring and expanding to new geographies.

The remaining ""hard assets"" are listed by Grant Thornton as around CA$30,000 in fiat and CA$15,000 in cryptocurrency, after “a very limited review of Einstein Groups’s books and records.""

It further authorized the receiver to forcibly enter Einstein’s business premises if necessary, which the receiver did on Nov. 1.      The BCSC had said it received a number of complaints from Einstein customers who said they were unable to access their assets.      Grant Thornton has issued notices to a number of banks in the U.S. and Canada, as well as wealth manager Cannacord Genuity, where the receiver suspects Einstein CEO Michael Ongun Gokturk or his firm may have placed funds, the filing indicates.

42374511,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva0Ad,1574155800,Bitcoin Price Faces Deeper Dive as Bear Cross Confirmed,"View  A lack of positive developments in the crypto and blockchain space has led to fading sentiment and further declines in bitcoin's price.  A long-term bear crossover of the 100 and 200-day moving averages (MAs) confirms BTC's latest leg down.  BTC looks set to test the 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, now located at $7,520.  Bitcoin prices tumbled over 4 percent Monday as buyers proved reluctant to engage with the market, likely due to recent suggestions of a new crypto crackdown in China.  At press time on Tuesday, the world's top crypto by market capitalization had dropped further, and was down 3.03 percent on the day. Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $8,144, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Amid the lack of trader enthusiasm, two long-term moving averages – the 100 and 200-day – crossed over on Nov. 17, suggesting a long-term trend change in favor of the bears.  Daily chart  As seen above, a crossover of the two averages, whereby the 100-period moves below the 200-period, does not bode well for bitcoin's price. Back in early 2018, a long-term bear cross saw prices fall by as much as 60 percent.  While past events are not indicative of future results, it does raise the question: how far can bitcoin's value fall?  Weekly chart  Further losses will expose prices to the 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, now located at $7,520.  With a lack of bullish fundamentals, bitcoin is deflating under seller pressure, as reflected in the daily and weekly RSI's (not shown) which are in bearish territory beneath the neutral 50.00 line.  Selling volume has also risen to its highest in three days, adding to the credence of the downside move.  The bulls need to enter back into the fray in force if they hope to stem the bleeding, and need a firm close above $9,000 to reverse the current trend. For now, that seems a tall order.
