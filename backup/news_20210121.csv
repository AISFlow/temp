42385716,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBKqed,1611270056,Japan Rallies Behind XRP as Ripple Faces US Litigation,"“I’m not selling,” Makoto, a Japanese businessman and XRP investor, told CoinDesk.      Makoto first bought the digital token XRP in 2017, a year after its issuer, San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, launched a joint venture with one of Japan’s most respected financial services institutions, SBI Holdings Inc.      Soon after, the popularity of XRP soared in Japan.      “XRP was probably the single most popular token or cryptocurrency in Japan. It was also backed by SBI. It invested in Ripple,” Mike Kayamori, founder and chief executive officer of crypto trading platform Liquid Global, told CoinDesk.      Now, Japan’s love for XRP is being tested after the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Ripple Labs in December 2020. The complaint accuses the firm of violating U.S. securities law, arguing that Ripple failed to register XRP as a security or seek an exemption before the company began selling it seven years ago.      Japan considers XRP to be a cryptocurrency, but this has no bearing on the SEC's allegation that Ripple sold XRP in unregistered securities transactions. Likewise, the U.S. classification of the cryptocurrency isn’t likely to impact how Japan treats XRP.      Following the filing, a string of prominent crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, announced they will delist or suspend XRP from their U.S. platforms.      XRP has a strong global fanbase, and a lot of people see this lawsuit as an attack on virtual currencies in general, Kayamori said.      Ripple declined to comment about XRP's popularity in Japan.    Read more: SEC Sues Ripple Over 7-Year, $1.3B ‘Ongoing’ XRP Sale    “The crypto community, I feel, sees this as a big blow to them and as kind of a precursor to what could come in the future, that other companies are also vulnerable,” Kayamori added.      Although XRP is still widely available in Japan, some local XRP users appear somewhat shaken by the lawsuit.      “Many people are saddened by the SEC issue these days … I am very worried,” Okurisan, another Japanese XRP investor, told CoinDesk via Twitter. He said he sold most of his XRP after hearing about the lawsuit.      SBI's influence, Ripple's marketing and relatively clear regulation that classified XRP as a cryptocurrency is driving XRP’s popularity in Japan.      Okurisan, for instance, said XRP will be “soaring” once again. Despite the lawsuit, XRP’s price rallied in early January, driven in part by retail investors in Asia.    A giant’s blessing    SBI Holdings was established in 1999 as a subsidiary of internet and media conglomerate SoftBank Corporation until the two firms parted ways in 2006.      According to Masakazu Masujima, a partner at international law firm MHM Global, SBI was set up as an innovation-focused investment arm of SoftBank, and “SBI” initially stood for SoftBank Investment.      Now SBI Holdings Inc. has almost $950 million paid-in capital and 8,568 employees, according to its website. In January 2020, it announced plans for a new venture capital fund of $920 million that would be the largest active fund focused on startups in Japan, according to Nikkei Asia.      Masujima said SBI’s work as a financial services innovator has earned it the respect of Japan’s tech-savvy population.      “The SBI culture is very much innovative. It has actually pioneered Japan's internet based finance services from internet based securities to foreign exchange and virtual currency trading. So people from the internet space are very big fans of what SBI has achieved so far,” Masujima told CoinDesk.    Read more: Asia’s Retail FOMO Could Be Behind XRP’s Rally Despite SEC’s Lawsuit    After the SEC filed suit against Ripple Labs and companies began distancing themselves from XRP, SBI came to its support releasing a statement that said, under Japanese financial laws, XRP is characterized as a crypto asset and not a security.      “SBI Holdings is and will continue to be a strong partner of Ripple,” representatives for SBI later told CoinDesk via an email.      Following the filing, Yoshikata Kitao, SBI chief executive officer and board member at Ripple Labs, tweeted that Japan’s financial authority, the FSA, had already made it clear that XRP was not a security.      “I’m optimistic that Ripple will prevail in the final ruling in the U.S.,” Kitao said.      The SEC complaint against Ripple Labs alleges that from 2018 to 2020, Ripple made “institutional sales” of at least 1.1 billion XRP (worth over $300 million) to SBI.      The complaint includes a 2017 tweet by Kitao, named in the document as “Institutional Investor C”, which said, “Wow, XRP at all time high! Forget about bitcoin, we’re all in on XRP!”      In effect, an SBI endorsement goes a long way: When asked why he invested in XRP, Okurisan replied, “I bought XRP because it is supported by SBI.”    Marketing    In Japan, XRP was uniquely marketed as a remittance-instrument and people on the internet, mainly those who frequently use Twitter, purchased XRP believing it would be the next bitcoin, Masujima said.      With the 2016 joint venture SBI Ripple Asia, the U.S. crypto firm introduced its international remittance and payments settlement network RippleNet to Asia.      According to the SBI website, RippleNet uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) to directly connect users with financial institutions to “instantly and reliably transfer money in more than 40 currencies to more than 70 countries.”    Read more: An SEC Victory in Ripple Case Would Render XRP ‘Untradeable,’ Market Pros Say    Makoto told CoinDesk that what made XRP so attractive was the “speed of remittance” processing.      “The first thing I bought was bitcoin, but the long wait I had when I moved [exchanges] was painful. XRP is already used in international remittances by many banks, and the system requires far less power than bitcoin,” Makoto added.      Between 2018 and 2020, Ripple entered into partnerships with financial institutions in a number of countries including UAE, Malaysia and Brazil to introduce the remittance product RippleNet.    Regulation    In addition to a strong partnership with SBI and its role in facilitating speedy remittances, under Japanese financial law, XRP was treated as a cryptocurrency.      In fact, before the SEC brought the case against Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse contemplated moving the firm out of the U.S. citing a lack of regulatory clarity on crypto. Garlinghouse also said it would be ""advantageous"" to move operations to a country like U.K. which, unlike the SEC, clarified that XRP is a currency and not a security.      Japan was among the countries Ripple was considering for the move because XRP is classified as a crypto asset.      “In Japan, all the tokens that are listed or available to be traded in Japanese regulated or licenced exchanges are already whitelisted or allowed for use by an administrator in advance,” Kayamori said.      Under the Payment Services Act of 2009, amended to include a chapter on virtual currencies in 2017, all virtual currency service providers were required to register and obtain licenses.      Masujima, who frequently works with the FSA to shape regulation, said the agency views the crypto space as something that can provide “genuine” financial services. Therefore, according to Masujima, the FSA believes it should be regulated in the same way as securities, and that existing provisions on crypto assets reflect this.      Following the SEC filing, FSA made a statement made to crypto publication The Block, saying that under the Payment Services Act, the regulator considers XRP to be a cryptocurrency, although it did not specify if this precludes XRP from also being considered as a security.    Read more: XRP Climbs Back up Crypto Rankings With Near 50% Rise    The FSA did not respond to comment in time for publication.      “Within the Japanese regulatory guidelines, if your token is whitelisted as a cryptocurrency that means it's legal. You don't have to further define it … regardless of the U.S. saying it's a security or Singapore or Switzerland or any other jurisdiction saying otherwise,” Kayamori said.      Kayamori added he does not believe that FSA would re-classify XRP as a security in light of the U.S. lawsuit, but if it did it would be “a first.”      Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer at bitFlyer USA, a subsidiary of Tokyo-headquartered bitFlyer, told CoinDesk via an email that bitFlyer Japan, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the country, continues to list XRP for Japanese clients based on regulatory guidance from their domestic regulator. bitFlyer Japan declined to comment.      Although Makoto admitted he was worried about the suit, he said Ripple’s technology will continue to be adopted by banks around the world for processing remittances.      “We [will] not sell even if there is a gain, and even after the litigation problem,” Makoto said.

In an earnings call Thursday, Signature revealed that deposits from customers in the crypto industry now total $10 billion – twice that of California rival Silvergate Bank.      “We’ve clearly become the preeminent player in that space,” said Eric Howell, the company’s executive vice president of corporate and business development. “It’s obvious that digital assets and cryptocurrencies are not going away.”      Signature Bank CEO Joseph DePaolo added that the bank’s blockchain-based payments platform Signet is the main driver of deposit growth in digital asset banking, and that institutional adoption is causing the vertical to “grow by leaps and bounds.” Prominent customers include Voyager Digital Holdings, Polychain Capital and bitFlyer USA.      Signature banks the “top five crypto exchanges,” DePaolo said, and is now offering retail banking services through them. (Silvergate is known to serve Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp. Exchanges often have more than one banking partner in order to more quickly onboard new customers.)      Signature added $2.5 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of 2020, which fell half a billion shy of Silvergate’s $2.9 billion in new deposits from digital currency customers in Q4.    Read more: Analysts Question Silvergate Execs on Whether Crypto Deposit Growth Will Continue    Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. As such, analysts have paid close attention to non-interest-bearing deposit growth at Signature, especially since the bank doesn’t break out deposits from crypto customers in its financial statements.      Signature sees itself as a bank for high-net-worth individuals and institutions; its crypto banking business has a low profile.      These deposits are not equal to the deposits from crypto firms at the bank, since Signature has many other lines of business. In total, non-interest-bearing deposits represent nearly 30% of total deposits at the bank.

42385727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBKqrD,1611265064,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Descends to $31K as Ether Funding Rates Drop,"Bitcoin has suffered two straight days of selling, bringing the price close to below $31,000. Also, ether funding rates for leveraged positions are cooling after a very heated few weeks.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $31,850 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 8.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $31,006-$35,656 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC slightly above the 10-hour moving averages but well below the 50-hour on the hourly chart, a sideways-to-bearish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin is in the second day of a major sell-off, with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency bottoming out Thursday around 14:30 UTC (9 a.m. ET) at $31,006, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin has gained somewhat since then, changing hands at $31,850 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Slumps to $31K on Sell-Off in US and Europe      Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at crypto custody provider Koine, said bitcoin’s drop this week comes after a month when fresh all-time highs were crossed several times. “It's been quite a run,” Douglas told CoinDesk. “I think we're due a pullback after the recent pump.”      The current all-time high for bitcoin’s price, set on Jan. 8, is $41,962, according to CoinDesk 20 data. In the couple of weeks after that record – to Thursday’s low – bitcoin fell by over 26%.      Katie Stockton, technical analyst at Fairlead Strategies, continues to see support at $25,000 where she sees traders planning to scoop up some of the asset and push price back up.      “Yes, bitcoin is extending its pullback,” Stockton said. “The $25,000 level would be a natural level for buyers to show interest.”      Volatility for bitcoin has been rising. Data from Wednesday’s close shows bitcoin’s 30-day volatility is trending upward again. It was at 88.7% on Jan. 20, a level not seen since April 2020 when the coronavirus created uncertainty for all markets across the board, including cryptocurrencies.      Stockton expects bitcoin’s gyrations to continue for a while. “My short-term overbought/oversold measures support another couple weeks of downside volatility, after which we would look for support discovery.”      News stories are beginning to detail bearish signals in the crypto market, including one on the nominee for Treasury Secretary in the Biden administration, according to Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “Comments from Janet Yellen about curtailing crypto was another negative headline,” Lau told CoinDesk.      Read More: Bitcoin Sells Off on Bearish Sentiment, Yellen Worries      In addition, Wednesday’s bitcoin volumes are shaping up to be the weakest they have been in the past month. Daily volume on the eight exchanges tracked on the CoinDesk 20 were at $860 million as of press time, a paltry showing compared to the past month’s $4.3 billion average.      OKCoin’s Lau is seeing a lot of selling in the market, with Asia particularly bearish, he told CoinDesk. Yet, institutional investors in the U.S. are still grabbing some bitcoin, which is a bright spot to consider.      “Over the past few weeks we have seen a strong and consistent selling during Asian trading hours, while new capital from North America has constantly bought the dips during their trading hours,” Lau said. “Asian traders look to be taking profits with price increases, while American investors, mostly institutions, continue to engage in crypto markets and accumulate positions.”    Ether swaps funding comes back to earth    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Thursday, trading around $1,206 and falling 9.6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      After some ether perpetual swaps funding rates were coming in at lofty levels in January, including BitMEX offering a whopping 0.6%+ rate Jan. 4., the numbers are now converging towards zero on the spot price drop.      The funding rates are for liquidity providers to offer leverage to traders to go long or short. Thus when funding rates were high, it meant traders were paying a premium to go long. It’s much lower now.      Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, says ether’s previously incredibly high funding rates proves an all-time high of $1,439 per 1 ETH was the result of an overheated market. “I’ve only had a peripheral look, but I’d say the cost of leverage was simply too high,” Shah told CoinDesk.

Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). At the time, Yellen called crypto a concern, saying she believes many are being used “mainly for illicit financing.”      These appear to be her first public comments on the cryptocurrency ecosystem since 2018, when she said that in her view many transactions were “illegal, illicit transactions.”    Read more: State of Crypto: What the Crypto World Should Watch for in the Biden Era    Yellen testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday ahead of a possible vote on her nomination.

42385725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBKqoh,1611263314,The Bitcoin Double-Spend That Never Happened,"Interest in Bitcoin “double-spending” grew after recent news that the Bitcoin network processed the same bitcoin (BTC) in two transactions – the very “double-spending” scenario Bitcoin was specifically designed to prevent.      Except the double-spend didn’t happen, at least not in the traditional sense.      “The bitcoin ‘double-spend’ media headline has certainly spooked investors, but it’s a misunderstanding of how the Bitcoin network operates. In this case, a chain re-organization of one block occurred, which is a fairly common occurrence,” Jason Lau, COO of OKCoin exchange, told CoinDesk.      Put another way, no bitcoin was “double-spent” because no new coins were added to Bitcoin’s supply. Instead, the same coins from the same wallet were registered in two different blocks during a typical split in Bitcoin’s blockchain.    Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?    The reason this does not qualify as a double-spend is because only one of these transactions (the one recorded on Bitcoin’s longest blockchain history) is considered valid by the network while the bitcoin in the other transaction cannot be spent because the network does not consider it valid.    What is a Bitcoin block reorganization?    Due to the distributed and highly competitive nature of Bitcoin mining, mining pools from time to time mine the same block simultaneously and thus cause a split in the blockchain’s history. When this happens, both blocks will have miners add on to them until one history wins out over the other.      Let’s say, for instance, mining pool A and mining pool B mine a block at the same time, resulting in two different blockchain histories (versions A and B). Going forward, all other miners have to choose which version of the chain to build on. Let’s say the miner who finds the next block in the sequence chooses to build on version A, but then afterwards the next two or three or more miners decide to build on version B. Version B ultimately wins out as more miners choose to mine that transaction history.      The other history is excised from the network and considered irrelevant and any blocks mined on it become stale blocks.      This was the case at block 666,833, wherein two blocks were spawned by separate mining pools and a one-block reorganization, as described by Lau, occurred. The above scenario is why Satoshi Nakamoto said in the white paper that a transaction should only be considered final after it has six confirmations (i.e., six new blocks are mined onto the chain that has recorded the transaction).    No, a double-spend didn’t really happen    The supposed double-spend first became news yesterday after BitMex Research reported on block 666,833’s abnormalities on Twitter. The reorganization meant a “stale block” (also sometimes called an “orphan block”) had been mined that contained bitcoin also spent on Bitcoin’s valid chain, so a transaction containing the same bitcoin was recorded on both the relevant and irrelevant chains.      What BitMEX research called at first a “double-spend-like scenario” now looks like a perfect storm caused by the one block reorg and a replace-by-fee transaction. A RBF transaction occurs when you tell your wallet to send the same bitcoin again but with a higher fee, with the hopes that it will be confirmed before the lower fee transaction.    Here's what actually happened    It went down like this: Someone sent 0.00062063 BTC to this address but set the lowest fee possible (1 satoshi per byte, or less than a fraction of a cent, per byte of transaction data).      Since the fee was so low, the transaction took a while to confirm, so the sender tried to outpace it by sending what’s called a “replace by fee transaction” (RBF).      Instead of the RBF replacing the slow transaction as intended, however, the lower fee transaction cleared first and made it into the block that was mined onto the longest chain.      Meanwhile, the higher fee transaction found its way onto the stale block. The final result: 0.00062063 BTC is recorded as existing on the address 1D6aebVY5DbS1v7rNTnX2xeYcfWM3os1va on the irrelevant transaction history while 0.00014499 BTC exists on the same address but on the relevant transaction ledger.    The importance of 6 confirmations    Technically, the same bitcoin was spent twice in this scenario. But one transaction was double-spent to an address on a transaction history that the Bitcoin network does not consider valid (if you query the transaction ID for the “losing” transaction in any Bitcoin block explorer, for instance, nothing comes up).      “It's kinda a double-spend but not really. Normally a double-spend refers to when you intentionally replace a transaction that sends money to someone with one that sends it to your own wallet,” Ben Carman, a Bitcoin Core contributor and developer at Suredbits, told CoinDesk.      In this scenario, “the important thing to know is that, yes, there might be different versions of the same transaction, but only [one] will ultimately be accepted” by nodes and users of the Bitcoin network, Coin Metrics Bitcoin network data analyst Lucas Nuzzi wrote on Twitter.      A double-spend typically means a sender tricks a recipient into accepting a transaction that the sender actually sends to itself, as well. This is why it’s considered best practice for merchants to wait for six confirmations before a payment is considered final to avoid an outcome like this one. It's worth noting that in this instance, though, no reported fraud took place because the sender and the recipient are probably the same entity.      As CoinMetric’s co-founder and CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter opined on Twitter, lacking proof of fraud, the double spend claim can rightly be dismissed, especially considering what occurred yesterday was actually pretty pedestrian for Bitcoin, not to mention something Satoshi Nakamoto describes in the white paper itself.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | RESEARCH,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/21/the-bitcoin-double-spend-that-never-happened,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2d4ee7665b6b76dd273cc7df1a33ed45f593a9c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411943,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEUs,1611261180,How to Stay Safe in DeFi: Red Flags and Risks You Need to Know,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the crypto industry, with $92 billion worth of crypto assets locked in peer-to-peer powered protocols in January, 2022 – up 196% over 2021.  This growth can largely be attributed to the many lucrative, high-interest earning opportunities available across DeFi lending and trading platforms. But, of course, with any new crypto trend that draws significant attention and investment, there are always scammers looking for ways to capitalize on it – and you aren’t likely to get a refund for your mistakes.  What is DeFi again?  DeFi protocols are blockchain-based platforms that offer a range of financial services you would typically find in the traditional space, such as:  Loans.  Insurance.  Interest-bearing accounts.  The key difference is, DeFi platforms run entirely using smart contracts rather than having an intermediary like a bank or insurance broker operating in the middle.  Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs that enforce contractual agreements between parties.  In an ideal world, they power valuable non-custodial financial services, like lending protocols and decentralized exchanges. But sometimes they contain bugs or gaping security vulnerabilities that allow attackers, or even errant developers, to drain treasury wallets.  To stay safe, it’s valuable to be able to identify common red flags that indicate a DeFi protocol might, in fact, be a scam or operate on faulty code.  To do this, you don’t have to be able to read smart contract code or understand programming. Free tools, such as Token Sniffer for Ethereum and PooCoin for Binance Smart Chain, run automated audits of token contracts to check if they contain any malicious code for you. While these shouldn’t be relied on entirely, they can be a good starting point for your own due diligence process.  Rug pulls  Rug pulls are so common in DeFi that “getting rugged” has become a common phrase in crypto-speak.  A rug pull is a type of exit scam in which the perpetrators create a new token, launch a liquidity pool for it and pair it with a base token like ether (the native token of Ethereum) or a stablecoin like dai (DAI). A liquidity pool is a large pool of tokens that a protocol uses to fulfill trades, as opposed to an order book system where buyers and sellers list their trade orders and wait to be filled.  The key part of this scam is the creators retain a significant portion of the total supply once the token launches.  If they’ve successfully marketed it to the wider crypto community, investors will begin adding liquidity to the pool to earn a portion of transaction fees charged to traders who use it. Once the amount of liquidity in the pool reaches a certain point, the creators dump all their tokens into the pool and withdraw all the ether, dai or whichever base token was used from the pool. This sends the price of the newly created token to near-zero, leaving investors holding worthless coins while the rug pullers walk away with a tidy profit.  It’s a massive red flag when just a few wallets control nearly half the circulating supply of a token. You can check the token distribution on a blockchain explorer – Etherscan for Ethereum – by clicking on the ""Holders"" tab of a token contract.  A November 2021 study found that 50% of all token listings on Uniswap are scams, so the odds aren’t in your favor when it comes to investing in relatively unknown projects.  It’s generally safer if the team behind a project is public, or if it’s run by anonymous accounts that have earned a good reputation by launching previously successful, honest projects.  Read More: How to Protect Yourself From Getting ‘Rugged’  Honeypots  Cryptocurrencies are volatile, meaning prices can fluctuate massively over a given time period. But, if a new coin only goes up and nobody seems to be selling it, it can be a sign that something known as a honeypot scam is going on.  This is where investors are lured in by a token’s ever-increasing price but the only wallet that the smart contract allows to sell is controlled by the scammers.  Squid Game token is a recent example. The DeFi project attracted mainstream media attention due to its alleged association with the popular TV show. It rapidly rose in value shortly after launch, but the media quickly noticed investors were unable to sell any of their tokens. Eventually, the founders dumped their tokens and ran off with millions of dollars worth of binance coin (BNB).  It’s important to note that widespread coverage of a cryptocurrency doesn’t necessarily mean it’s safe. Mainstream media outlets may not have the expertise or time to vet a crypto project, and can often assist in drumming up more hype for scams. In some cases, social media influencers may be paid to promote cryptocurrencies without taking the time to realize they’re a scam – and these influencers don’t always disclose that they’re being paid to talk about a project. A-list celebrities like Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khalid and Kevin Hart have all faced lawsuits for promoting crypto projects that were later found to be outright scams.  Phishing attacks  Phishing is when a scammer pretends to be an official company in order to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. This type of scam is especially rampant in crypto.  If you post certain keywords on social media like “MetaMask” on Twitter, you can expect a swarm of scam bots to reply. Often these bots will direct you to a Google Form, asking you to enter your wallet seed phrase or other sensitive information. Something you should never share with anyone.  Many scammers pretend to be famous people you might follow on social media. They’ll message you appearing to offer help before asking you to send crypto or share sensitive information. Sometimes scammers will run fake YouTube channels soliciting funds.  In January 2021, someone lost $1.14 million to scammers pretending to be Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy.  Remember, real influencers are highly unlikely to ask you to send them money in a private message– especially if they’ve never spoken to you before. However, some celebrities may knowingly or unwittingly promote pump-and-dump schemes, which are also highly common in crypto.  Fake Google ads  The first Google result for a crypto project might not point you in the right direction – in fact, it might direct you toward a scam.  Unfortunately, Google doesn’t vet the authenticity of websites before it sells an advertisement spot, so a Google ad should never be construed as a sign of legitimacy.  If you aren't sure what the right website is, check out reliable sources, like the official Twitter page of the project, to find the real website.  Exploits and vulnerabilities  DeFi runs on pieces of code visible to everyone, which means that technically-savvy people may exploit vulnerabilities in the code and run away with huge sums of money. In fact, the amount of funds lost in exploits of DeFi projects totaled $1.3 billion in 2021, according to blockchain security firm CertiK.  To reduce the risks of exploits, many DeFi projects commission audit firms like PeckShield or Hacken to review their code and help them patch any issues found. DeFi projects may also offer bounties to white-hat hackers through platforms like Immunefi to discover bugs in their code before malicious attackers do.  Audits and bounty programs are usually displayed on project sites, so you may want to check them before deciding to invest. Although these programs reduce the risks of exploits, they don't eliminate the risks completely. There are plenty of audited DeFi projects that have fallen victim to million-dollar-plus exploits.  Scam airdrops  Airdrops, when protocols distribute free tokens to members of their communities, are common in crypto. But not all tokens airdropped to your wallet are genuine.  A recent DeFi scam, especially common on the Binance Smart Chain, tricks people into thinking they have suddenly received tokens worth thousands of dollars. But they aren’t tradable on exchanges as there’s no liquidity.  Read More: 3 Major Risks in DeFi Lending  In most instances, these tokens will be named after a shady website. If you connect your wallet through that website and approve access to a malicious smart contract, scammers are able to siphon funds directly from your wallet.",NEUTRAL,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi-red-flags-and-risks-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dee15d7aa5a56aeef77fe6d18be2e9cd137299d1-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBKqnR,1611261175,Minority Mining Pools Threaten to Collude Against Contentious Ethereum Update,"Ethereum miners have formed a cartel of sorts to thwart the implementation of a now contentious proposal – one they say cuts into their bottom line unfairly.      Eight Ethereum mining pools amounting to around 30% of the network’s hash power have cast their support behind tiny mining pool Flexpool’s stance against Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.      The small pool – which only mined 10 blocks among 48 miners in December – is now calling on Ethereum miners to jump ship from major mining pools that support the update such as Sparkpool (24% network hash power) and F2Pool (11%).      “Don’t be a slave to your mining pool. Blacklist pools that support robbing their miners just so that they can inflate the price of [ETH] for rich speculators,” a Flexpool blog post reads.      Since the blog post was published on Jan. 14, some 400 miners have joined Flexpool, CEO Alexander Sadovskyi told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.    EIP 1559    First proposed in April 2019 by Vitalik Buterin, EIP 1559 flips the traditional mining payment scheme on its head by burning most of the transaction fees typically given to miners in a bid to address transaction fee volatility and improve the blockchain’s woeful user interface. (Here’s a short description from Ethereum developer Tim Beiko).    Read more: Ethereum Developers Consider New Fee Model as Gas Costs Climb    One blockchain analyst went as far to call EIP 1559 “the biggest change to any blockchain post-release.”      And although the update has not been officially accepted for mainnet, the EIP has received strong support among developers and could be forked into the Ethereum codebase sometime after the Berlin hard fork. That hard fork is roughly queued for February or March.    Runaway fees    It’s understandable why Ethereum miners would want EIP 1559 to never be implemented, or at the very least delayed.      Miners have been a big winner from an uptick of on-chain activity sparked by the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi). Indeed, mining profitability is reaching near three-year highs as on-chain congestion pushed transaction fees to record highs in 2020, according to data collected by BitInfoCharts.      Not only this, but Ethereum mining is an industrial-scale business.      Firms such as China-based Linzhi have begun rolling out new ASIC Ethereum miners developed over the last few years. A simple protocol change would force miners toward lesser-known Ethash coins – a potential waste of R&D money. Not to mention other Ethash coins are “really unprofitable,” Sadovskyi said on Telegram.      Paired with ether (ETH) breaking its all-time high on Tuesday, it's easy to see why miners are fighting tooth and nail to keep the printing press running as is.    Larger Ethereum mining pools react    Only time will tell if bigger mining pools react to the collusion campaign sparked by Flexpool. The three largest mining pools – BitFly, F2Pool and Sparkpool – are either anti-EIP 1559 or neutral, according to CoinDesk inquiries.      BitFly has long been against the proposal. It reaffirmed its stance in a tweet saying the EIP may put “Ethereum's future at risk.”      After publication of this article, F2Pool co-founder Chun Wang told CoinDesk in a message that the pool will support EIP 1559 and ""is not going to be neutral."" F2Pool Financial Director Da Liang earlier told CoinDesk the that the pool was ""neutral at this stage and not ready to announce anything officially."" The pool also operates an Eth 2.0 staking service, Stakefish.      It also seems as if dominant Ethereum mining pool SparkPool is walking back its prior stance on the EIP. In June, SparkPool CEO Xin Xu told CoinDesk that a “better fee model design is needed” and that the pool had been “supportive of EIP 1559 for a long time.”      That may not be the case as SparkPool Telegram admin ""CZ"" said no SparkPool employee had given a public stance on the subject. He added: “Obviously, mining pool (sic) always oppose 1559.” The pool’s official Twitter chat also promoted an article against the EIP on Jan. 20.      SparkPool has yet to respond to requests for comment.    Which way, Ethereum man?    Dissenting Ethereum miners need at least 51% of the network’s hash power to nix implementation of EIP 1559.      Here – in the extremely unlikely scenario – a dominant anti-EIP 1559 mining cartel would be able to censor blocks that use features of EIP 1559. Any blocks conforming to the new rule set with EIP 1559 would be stopped from being processed.      Beiko, the unofficial project manager for EIP 1559, told CoinDesk it's unlikely to come to that point, particularly because of how early EIP 1559 is in its development.      “It’s worth noting how ‘early’ 1559 is in the deployment process,” Beiko told CoinDesk in an email. “Yes, it’s been worked on for a while (mostly because of how big of a change it is and how much R&D there was to do), but it’s still not scheduled for any mainnet upgrade.”      Beiko added the EIP could be skipped for multiple reasons going forward including consensus issues among Ethereum Core Developers.      “I’m obviously biased here, where I think shipping as is is probably the best path forward, but this is ultimately not my call. The best the people working on 1559 can do is make a compelling case for it to the community,” Beiko said.      Sadovskyi told CoinDesk he expects Ethereum developers to make some concessions to miners given the public backlash fomenting in the mining community. He said it's unlikely Ethereum developers totally disregard miners as “Ethereum devs care about their reputation.”      “The response from eth dev team, non-miner community has been very dismissive, often hostile,” Charles Spears, VP of Strategy at Ethereum mining firm American BitPower, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.      “There is a narrative that miners are making tons of money and yes, times are great right now. But GPU miners really took it on the chin for a couple years there, which we feel goes unnoticed,” he said.    Developers respond    On the other hand, miners serve the Ethereum network and not the other way around. The thinking goes that there will always be a mining market as long as it's profitable. Moreover, Ethereum mining has always had an uncertain shelf life as Eth 2.0’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism does away with it all together.      A recent lesson in decentralized governance also indicates where this struggle could go: Programmatic Proof-of-Work (ProgPoW).      That failed campaign was a multi-year attempt to update Ethereum’s mining algorithm from Ethash to the newer ProgPoW. It failed to reach consensus among developers multiple times, despite many in the mining businesses best efforts. It left large parts of the Ethereum ecosystem antagonized which may in some part be fueling sentiment around EIP 1559.    Read more: Ethereum’s ProgPoW Debate Is About Much More Than Mining    So, what power do miners have? Not much, unless they want to attack the Ethereum network itself, Ethereum developer Micah Zoltu wrote in a Jan. 20 blog post.      “Any censorship attack by miners against the interest of users will almost certainly result in the core developers taking very aggressive action against miners,” he explained in the blog post. “The most likely retaliation that the core devs could execute would be a rush to launch Proof of Stake, which would completely remove all miners/mining from Ethereum.”      So maybe we do get Eth 2.0 a bit faster than expected?      Probably not, Beiko said, as following through on colluding against the update would bare large costs for mining parties.      “It is easy for [miners] to signal they are against the change, and much costlier for them to actually follow through on things like forming cartels,”      Update (Jan. 22 17:45 UTC): Corrected description of 51% censorship attack.

Former President Donald Trump did not renominate him to the federal commodities regulator after he took office in 2017. Biden also named Brummer to his transition team after winning the 2020 presidential election last year.      Now-former Chairman Heath Tarbert, who took office in 2019, announced his resignation from the role Thursday, after announcing last year he would resign early in 2021. However, Tarbert will remain a commissioner on the CFTC, a CFTC press release said. His term expires in 2024.      Commissioner Rostin Behnam will serve as the acting chair in the interim.      If he is nominated and confirmed, Brummer would join former CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler, who is Biden’s nominee to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and former U.S. Treasury official Michael Barr, Biden’s rumored nominee for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as one of the key regulators for the cryptocurrency industry.    See also: Capital Controls: Chris Brummer Talks About the DC Crypto Scene    Like Gensler and Barr, Brummer will also bring an extensive understanding of the cryptocurrency space. In recent years he has testified about cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies before the CFTC, in addition to running the Fintech Week conference.      Brummer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      On the securities regulatory side, Commissioner Allison Herren Lee has been named Acting Chair of the SEC. She first took office in 2019, and is likely to serve in the acting chair role until Gensler is confirmed by the Senate.      UPDATE (Jan. 22, 2021, 00:25 UTC): After the publication of this article, the CFTC announced that Commissioner Rostin Behnam would serve as the acting chair.

Calling bitcoin the “least reliable hedge during periods of acute market stress,” strategists Federico Manicardi and John Normand questioned bitcoin's ability to function as reliable diversification investment through times of economic uncertainty.  ""Mainstreaming is reducing diversification benefits and leading to underperformance during crises,"" the memo said.  Bitcoin's recently heightened correlation with traditional markets, moreover, could ""erode diversification value over time"" if the strong positive correlation continues, they wrote.  Per Coin Metrics data, bitcoin and the S&P 500 have a 180-day correlation of 0.23, a relatively weak relationship, but still significantly stronger than a year ago.  Bitcoin's close relationship with price movements in legacy markets and the ""mainstreaming"" of cryptocurrency investing generally is ""potentially converting them from insurance to leverage,"" the strategists wrote.  Bitcoin prices to date have pulled back slightly to below $32,000 at last check after nearly touching $42,000 the first week in January.  A similar sentiment was expressed in October 2020 by other JPMorgan strategists who wrote that bitcoin has proven itself to be more of a risk asset, than a safe haven.  What could change this pattern, however, is ""a more unique macro shock related to much higher U.S. inflation or a breakdown of the payments system,"" the analysts said.

""Both bitcoin and gold are viewed as scarce, have the potential to be held outside of conventional financial markets, and have values that cannot be inflated away by relentless money creation and currency debasement.

42405741,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAemdL3,1611251898,Bitcoin Slumps to $31K on Sell-Off in US and Europe,"Bitcoin’s price took another hit Thursday morning, dropping close to $31,000 since markets opened in Europe and the U.S.. Investors rushed to take short-term profit, concerned about when – or if – another wave of new buyers would come into the market soon.      At the press time, bitcoin's price was at $31,910.61, down 6.61% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20. In the U.S., at around 9:40 a.m. ET (14:40 UTC), bitcoin's price was as low as $31,006.59.      One indicator showing the severity of the U.S. and European sell-offs is the so-called ""Coinbase premium,"" the gap between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, according to South Korea-based on-chain data site CryptoQuant. The number dropped to as low as -$212.79 at 4:17 a.m. ET (09:17 UTC) on Thursday.      “Coinbase naturally has to trade higher than Binance by, like, 20 basis points, I believe, due to the minor tether price difference,” Ki Young Ju, the chief executive at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “So if it is actually trading at the same price or even lower, it would mean really, really, very super-bearish.”      Tether is the largest stablecoin in cryptocurrency. Trading close to – but not exactly – at par with the U.S. dollar that is supposed to back it, tether is the popular method for those on Binance and other Asian exchanges to get into and out of bitcoin.      Even though the premium fell in deep red territory during Asian trading hours on Thursday, it does not mean traders in the U.S. were not involved in the latest correction.      “U.S. traders have been attempting to trade in anticipation of lower Asian sessions,” said John Todaro, director of institutional research at cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock. “So depending on the times this premium tightening occurred in the day, it could be an indicator of U.S. selling ahead of that.” TradeBlock is a CoinDesk subsidiary.      Several factors seem to have triggered the latest bitcoin sell-off: the unwinding of leverage, especially in Asia; concerns that fewer buyers are coming into the market; and uncertainty about policies on cryptocurrencies from newly inaugurated President Joe Biden's administration, according to analysts and traders.      “We saw some selling from institutions, but not significant,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Geneva-based Swissquote bank, told CoinDesk. “The trigger was Asian leveraged positions late in Asian hours. They move the market quite a lot because of the leverage.”      On the technical side, traders said the market has broken the price uptrend since Dec. 11 and is looking at a new support level in the $29,000-30,000 range.      ”The next support level down is the 61.8% Fibonnacci retracement at $26,700,” Jean-Marc Bonnefous, partner at investment firm Tellurian Capital, told CoinDesk. “That is, if the new investors' allocations do not come in as widely expected to buy the much-awaited dip.”      As the number of traditional investors and traders entering the bitcoin market increased in recent months, the price movement has become more technical-driven, according to Bonnefous. Before it was mainly affected by bitcoin's supply and demand, he said.      Bitcoin's price is below its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a shorter-term bearish signal for market technicians.      A few institutions, including some hedge funds, could be using the uncertainty in the market as an excuse to take some profit, Todaro added. Many of these traditional financial players in the U.S. and Europe came to the market prior to the steeper portion of bitcoin's run-up and are thus more likely to be at higher profit levels given current prices.      But some potential investors may be spooked by not knowing what the Biden Administration will do regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.      “Given the timing of the selling and the isolation [of that selling] to U.S. firms, such as Coinbase, this could also indicate geopolitical aspects as well with the Biden Administration coming in the last few days,” Todaro said. “Biden’s [nominated Treasury Secretary Janet] Yellen has floated a possible 'unrealized tax' proposal, which would impact cryptocurrency investors – and really investors in any assets – and may have resulted in some selling.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/21/bitcoin-slumps-to-31k-on-sell-off-in-us-and-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a753f63a4698810c28bc38dda085b6d9b6f1051-1596x836.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some analysts point to Treasury Security nominee Janet Yellen’s ominous “concern” over crypto as the reason for the sell-off.      The recent pullback has some formerly bullish analysts, such as Guggenheim, speculating on whether the cryptocurrency could retrace its 2021 gains in the short term.      Elsewhere, a Bitcoin copyright debate is driving people to host their own versions of Satoshi's white paper while BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, gave the green light for two of its funds to trade BTC futures.    Top shelf    Crypto state President Joe Biden has frozen all agency rulemaking, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s controversial proposal on “unhosted wallets,” according to a prominent cryptocurrency lawyer. While not out of the woods yet, the pause on the proposal – which would require exchanges to add stringent surveillance to privately held wallets – is being celebrated as a minor victory. Elsewhere in the Biden administration, former Treasury official and onetime member of Ripple’s board of advisers Michael Barr will reportedly replace Brian Brooks as Comptroller of the Currency. Separately, Nebraska is pitching itself as the next Wyoming.      White paper woes Bitcoin.org has refused to comply with Craig Wright’s demand to take down a copy of the Bitcoin white paper. Wright, who claims to be Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, also claims he owns the copyright to the source document. Bitcoin.org said the white paper is published under the permissive and free MIT license, making Wright’s claims meritless, though Wright has taken steps to patent Bitcoin's technology among an alleged 100-200 other blockchain-related patents. In what is seen as betrayal by some, Bitcoin Core removed the paper, references to it and merged the changes on GitHub, according to Bitcoin.org.      No blackout BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $7.81 trillion under management, appears to have granted at least two of its funds the ability to invest in bitcoin futures. “Certain Funds may engage in futures contracts based on bitcoin,” the prospectus reads, including the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc. and BlackRock Funds V. It’s unknown if and when an allocation is coming but the door is open. Meanwhile, eToro, a popular brokerage, surveyed 25 institutional players and found pension funds and endowments are warming to crypto.

These contracts account for 50% of total trading volume on major exchanges, according to Skew.    At stake    Penny hoarders? While some crypto traders look at fundamentals like bitcoin’s deflationary attributes when placing bets, it’s possible many are investing based only on a token’s price.      That was the conclusion drawn by Wall Street Journal columnist James Mackintosh in a Tuesday report for how the traditional stock markets moved in 2020. “Stock-market performance this year has been driven by the raw share price, with lower-priced stocks doing better and higher-priced worse,” he wrote.      With people sheltering in place, there was a well-documented surge in the number of retail investors signing up for free trading apps. eToro, for one, a Robinhood competitor that was quick on the draw to add crypto services, saw more than half a million new registrations in the first 17 days of 2021, Bloomberg reported.      The influx of inexperienced investors looking to ride the green wave of asset prices is, as Mackintosh argues, a market failure. Instead of considering the basics of what makes a sound business sound, like its “future cash flow, valuation, brand power, management skill or even political sensitivity,” many are looking only at the ticker price – with those under $5 seeming like bargains.      And it’s paid off! As Bloomberg put it in June, “Dumb money is looking a lot smarter in never-ending stock rally.” Still the idea of “aping into” an asset based solely on its current price is an affront to some analysts. Mackintosh called it a blatant misallocation of capital.      Stock prices are basically meaningless. Companies can, and do, do things like stock splits (creating more shares to cut their price) and reverse stock splits (consolidating outstanding shares to buoy the price) without affecting the company’s underlying value proposition. It’s just arithmetic!      Of course, cryptographic tokens are not equivalent to the little certificates of ownership over a publicly traded company called stock. Tokens and cryptocurrencies are typically programmable assets that are issued based on how a blockchain is programmed.      Many tokens serve a function, like dai, which is an algorithmic U.S. dollar stablecoin. Bitcoin was the first fully decentralized, peer-to-peer currency system. Social tokens, like $ALEX, are bets on a particular community or individual’s future market value. None of these are claims on an underlying company, because there is no company. (This is setting aside some of the securities concerns hanging over some crypto companies.)      As CoinDesk previously reported, in times of market exuberance, many new crypto entrants look at a token’s price as the primary reason to invest. “Some entry-level investors viewing the high-numbered trading price of bitcoin – unaware that it can be bought in minute fractions – take to altcoins because their relatively low price make them appear affordable,” CoinDesk reporter Muyao Shen wrote.      It’s for this reason that the U.K.’s financial watchdog issued a warning stating that “if consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.” The Financial Conduct Authority said a lack of consumer protections and high volatility are particular worries.      That said, many analysts claim crypto markets are moving away from the FOMO-driven speculation that made markets in 2017. In a new report, CoinShares, a digital asset management firm, said the uptick in corporate and institutional interest in bitcoin is sustainable.      “What was typically a desire to speculatively invest has now become one of being fearful of extreme loose monetary policy and negative interest rates, with clients looking for an anchor for their investments,” James Butterfill, CoinShare investment strategist, wrote.      This doesn’t discount the idea that crypto retail traders are following the penny-stock investment playbook. However, it does complicate the complaint that crypto is pure speculation.      With the rise of fractional stock programs, which allow small buyers to buy a percentage of a stock, the question arises: What’s really the dividing line between the old and new markets? The “dumb” and the “smart” money? As my colleague Noelle Acheson often says, does anyone know what’s going on anymore?

42405733,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAemdF9,1611248588,How Cultural Differences Drive User Adoption in DeFi,"At the end of 2020, I wrote about the cultural differences of Eastern and Western crypto communities. As we kick off 2021, I’d like to unpack the story of SushiSwap and Uniswap and build on the theme of how cultural differences can explain why both ultimately succeeded, despite being direct competitors with virtually identical products.      When SushiSwap first launched at the end of August, 2020, there was a lot of speculation about the intentions behind the forked project. Some thought it was a jab at the fact that liquidity is not a moat, while others thought it was actually a clever move to “front-run” Uniswap’s forthcoming $UNI token. Crypto Twitter at the time was also wed to the narrative that “community-backed projects,” a notion that emerged when Yearn and YAM launched, were superior and more incentive-aligned with users. The “fair launch” narrative was also gaining footing as anti-VC rhetoric grew in the wake of Yearn’s YFI launch.    Mable Jiang is a principal at Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven investment firm that invests in cryptocurrencies, tokens and blockchain companies. She is based in Hangzhou. Disclosure: Multicoin Capital owns $SUSHI tokens.    As a China-based team member of a U.S.-based investment firm, I spend a lot of time trying to understand differences in opinion across Eastern and Western cultures. I see the story of SushiSwap and Uniswap as another example of the stark differences between the east and the west in crypto. Viewed through this lens, it explains why both projects ultimately found product-market fit and are both growing, despite adopting strikingly different go-to-market approaches.    Uniswap vs. SushiSwap    Uniswap was the first breakout automated market maker (AMM), a tool that allows users to trustlessly trade crypto assets without a counterparty or an order book. Uniswap got serious attention as it grew, and raised several rounds totaling $11 million from big investors including Paradigm, a16z Crypto, USV, Version One, Variant, Parafi Capital, SV Angel and A.Capital. With its reputation for innovation, VC legitimacy and sleek user experience, Uniswap was able to attract many early decentralized finance (DeFi) adopters.      There are actually a lot of parallels between Uniswap and Coinbase – I’ll come back to this several times throughout this essay. Coinbase can be credited with pioneering crypto trading in the U.S. It also prioritized user experience (UX) and invested in building legitimacy.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      SushiSwap, on the other hand, forked Uniswap’s open-source code and quickly growth-hacked its way to hundreds of millions of dollars of value using a variety of incentivization campaigns. It now commands a significant market share, despite the dominance of Uniswap. Rather than Coinbase, SushiSwap reminds me more of Binance, which also did not come to market early but nonetheless was able to capture a significant market share.      How is it possible projects can just copy another and still succeed?      The answer lies in the cultural differences between the development teams and the users for whom they build products.    Different products for different regions    Uniswap is known for being laser-focused. While it had the capital and research resources to work on many other DeFi primitives, the team intentionally chose to concentrate on building the ultimate AMM. The simplicity behind its minimalist front-end helped emphasize its brand and establish it as the fastest and easiest place to trade crypto, much in the same way that Google’s homepage focuses user attention on a single action. Coinbase adopted a similar approach. Its design is also clear, friendly and obviously meant for American retail users.      SushiSwap chose a completely different approach. It started by forking Uniswap – both front- and back-end – with only one product difference: liquidity farming. Had SushiSwap stopped innovating, it probably would have died from a lack of differentiation. But, since then, SushiSwap has grown from a pure AMM to a robust suite of protocols. It is now a DeFi network in its own right.      See also: Bridging Cultural Gaps in 2021: Crypto in China and the US    Look at the SushiSwap sitehttps://sushiswap.fi/. In addition to the basic AMM on the sidebar and the “Quick Swap,” you also see Onsenhttps://sushiswap.fi/onsen, a rotational reward program that incentivizes new liquidity providers and allows people to vote for new pools. The team is also about to launch BentoBoxhttps://bentobox-frontend-git-omakaseui-components.teamsushi.vercel.app/, which will enable alts pairs for isolated margin trading. Unlike its Western counterparty, all these efforts mirror Binance’s strategy: creating a comprehensive suite of trading tools that encourage users to stay within an ecosystem, that foster loyalty and that capture value via the platform token.    While American users may find Binance’s user interface (UI) overwhelming, Asian traders usually prefer a more condensed UI with more options on a single page. Seemingly trivial, these design trade-offs actually signal very different things to very different user bases, which is also how SushiSwap differentiates from competitors by catering to power users who want more features accessible in a single click.    Meticulous production vs. fast iteration    When Uniswap launched in 2018, it focused on optimization (e.g., lower gas, open-source mobile front-end, etc.). It delivered version two in May 2020, which added features like arbitrary ERC20/ERC20 pairs, TWAP oracles and flash swaps. The Uniswap team is very deliberate in what it builds. Very few people have a view into its roadmap. Similarly, Coinbase, over its years of product iteration, shares the same tradition. It doesn't update or list new tokens often, but when it does it’s impactful.      SushiSwap has taken a very different approach. Because SushiSwap was founded as a “community-initiated” project, a lot of decisions were made via public voting, including whether to hire a developer and how much to pay. As a result, the core team members have always been keen to get feedback from the community, and are hyper-responsive in Discord.      Again, there are lots of parallels to Binance. The senior management of the Chinese exchanges often make themselves available to retail traders in group chats. The products, consequently, are adjusted quickly based on the community’s feedback. There is a clear culture of transparency, community and rapid iteration. Binance and SushiSwap are similar in wanting to deliver what the users want as much as possible, even if the request comes from a small group of vocal individuals.    Brand or business development    As more DeFi tokens were created over 2019 and 2020, decentralized exchanges (DEX) and AMMs quickly became the preferred launch venues for new tokens. Uniswap, as the first mover in this category, naturally attracted a significant share of these tokens. The simplicity of the product itself, plus the first-mover advantage, made it an easy decision for projects to launch their liquidity on Uniswap. SushiSwap, as a fast follower, did not have the same luxury. It realized it had to compete on an asset-by-asset basis via focused outreach.      The SushiSwap team subsequently adopted a strong business development culture, one where the core team tried to partner with many other partners in order to drive liquidity and volume (by providing better incentives and support either for new token to launch at SushiSwap or for existing projects to move their liquidity over). If Uniswap served the basic on-chain trading needs of the masses, then SushiSwap optimized its solutions for specific and vocal niches, including more sophisticated traders and token issuers.      See also: What Is DeFi?      As I wrote previously, in China, partnerships and trust are even more important to most users than in the U.S. because there is inherently a higher requirement of trust among people in China. I suspect that SushiSwap will attract a significant share of the Chinese retail user base by effectively listening to the community and signaling via strategic relationships.      Binance is also well known for partnering to develop trust. Most of its regional products and communities are the direct result of effective partnerships.      Despite being birthed from the same code, these products have attracted different users and are evolving into very different solutions.

42405734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAemdDB,1611239692,Trading Bitcoin in Africa Is a Way for Some to Escape Poverty,"For years, Stephen Aluko lived ""hand to mouth"" in Nigeria, home to a big but struggling economy in Africa with a high unemployment rate. He worked odd jobs, from running cyber cafes to ""soft media"" and videography, constantly mulling in the back of his mind if he would be able to pay for his next meal.      He was unemployed before hearing about bitcoin in 2017. At that point, his shoes hardly held together.      When Aluko decided to commit to trading bitcoin – buying and selling the cryptocurrency for profit – that all changed. At first he had second thoughts. He didn't know what he was doing. But the side hustle worked out so well he's now been trading the largest cryptocurrency full time for three years.    Read more: Over $20K? Why Is Bitcoin Worth Anything at All?    ""My finances were not in a good state when I started trading, so you could say bitcoin trading saved me,"" Aluko told CoinDesk. ""I have made enough money from trading bitcoin that I have been able to get married and can live comfortably without any debts.”      This is one example of someone using bitcoin in an unanticipated way to improve his life. And there are many other examples around the world, from Argentina to Iran.      ""The money I have made from bitcoin trading has made it possible for me to invest in other businesses, be financially independent and live debt-free. So, I do think I have made more money with bitcoin than if I had chosen another career path,"" he said.      The recent bitcoin bull run didn't have anything to do with Aluko's success. CoinDesk talked to Aluko about the rise of bitcoin trading in Africa in August 2020, before the price of bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high, launching into a bull run.    27% unemployment    Aluko knows plenty of other traders who found themselves in a similar position.      ""It's not unique to me,"" he said. ""I know many people in Nigeria [who] trade bitcoin as a way to earn a living. I have also taught people how to trade bitcoin because I know how bitcoin trading has changed my life and I want to be able to help people.""      He argues that one factor driving so many people to trading is the high unemployment rate in the region. The situation has only gotten worse since Aluko was unemployed. In Nigeria, for instance, the unemployment rate has tripled over the past five years, swelling to 27%.    Read more: Bitcoin Dissidents: Those Who Need It Most    ""Let’s just say that the numbers are not encouraging. There’s a chance that if I had worked hard and done a lot more applying to companies I may have gotten a decent job. But when I think about what I have achieved in three years as a result of trading bitcoin I am sure that I made the right choice,"" Aluko said.      Other Africans have made the same career decision, giving bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading a try. African exchange Quidax CEO and co-founder Buchi Okoro said this is one of the key reasons people use the exchange.      ""From our conversations with our customers, we have a lot of people using crypto to earn a living by trading as a full-time job,"" Okoro told CoinDesk.    Bitcoin trading vs. speculation    Then there's speculation, which is a bit different from trading. Speculation is investing in a risky asset, such as cryptocurrency, with the hope the price will go up and enrich the investor.      ""Though bitcoin is used for speculation universally throughout the world, it hits differently in Africa,"" KenyaCoin, a pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast from Kenya, told CoinDesk, pointing to unemployment rates, as Okoro had.    Read more: Unconfiscatable? Using Bitcoin to Resist Police Extortion in Nigeria    ""There are huge numbers of university graduates who simply cannot find employment in the country. Those with the means, especially those who studied economics, finance or tech, take up speculation in the crypto space to either try to supplement whatever income they do have or as a substitute for 'employment,'"" he added.      KenyaCoin guesses that speculation is ""the number one activity involving bitcoin and crypto on the continent.""    Risk of bitcoin and crypto scams    The rise of bitcoin and crypto in Africa has not necessarily been all rainbows, however.      There's a dark side to this trend, too. Some people have gotten hurt from trading and speculation. Much like the rest of the world, as Africans have explored cryptocurrency as a route to a better income, some have lost money or have fallen for a number of scams.      Many Nigerians, for instance, first heard about bitcoin through MMM, a Russian Ponzi scheme that promised investors 100% returns. When MMM didn't fulfill these lofty promises, participants lost their money.      KenyaCoin pointed to infamous cryptocurrency scams BitClub network and Onecoin as other examples of ""bad"" projects that have flourished in the region, as well as lesser-known scams such as Nurucoin and Crowd1.      ""Scams often target victims in developing countries, as regulations in the finance and investment space are not always solid and/or enforcement is oftentimes lagging,"" he said.

""For the time being, we have probably put in a top for bitcoin for the next year or so,"" Minerd told CNBC on Tuesday, adding that the cryptocurrency could retrace to $20,000.      Bitcoin reached a record high of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and has been mainly restricted to a range of $30,000 to $40,000 ever since. The uptrend began in early October, when the cryptocurrency was trading near $11,000 and went ballistic in the second half of December, with prices rising from $19,000 to $38,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Price pullbacks often follow such big rallies. ""When we have a doubling of a price of an asset in the course of a month, we are prone to having a setback,"" Minerd said while explaining the rationale behind his forecast for a decline to $20,000.      Minerd told Bloomberg a month ago that bitcoin's fair value was $400,000 and recently warned of speculative frenzy gripping the market. Guggenheim Partners, which manages more than $230 billion worth of assets, started investing in bitcoin when the cryptocurrency was trading around $10,000.      Minerd also shared his view on traditional markets, pointing to the Federal Reserve's open-ended liquidity boosting bond purchase program as the main reason for the slump in the U.S dollar.

The eToro-commissioned market research, which quizzed 25 big institutions in Q3 2020 about investing in crypto, comes on the heels of news that BlackRock, the largest asset manager on the planet, is dipping its toe into bitcoin futures.      “The respondents included endowments and pension funds,” said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group who carried out the research. “Funds and asset managers made up a proportion and some of the banks have asset management divisions and we spoke with a couple of folks there too.”      The overarching response from participants (a split among banks, brokers, fund managers and custodians) was that the crypto market has matured towards being institutional-grade over the previous two years, and the time was right to get involved.      “People are recognizing that where it took other markets, say, 10 years to mature, the crypto market has taken two years to reach levels of liquidity that we see in other asset classes,” Mindlin said in an interview.

After Binance challenged the decision, requesting the appropriate process, the prosecutors withdrew their complaint, the new court ruling, seen by CoinDesk, indicates.      Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not illegal in Russia.

The mood on Wednesday contrasted with the ebullience witnessed in traditional markets as a new era of U.S. politics began with the swearing in of President Joe Biden and the departure of Donald Trump. U.S. stocks rose to fresh record highs, with both Bloomberg and Reuters reporting that investors see Biden and his team wasting little time in pushing for a new trillion-dollar round of economic stimulus.      The expectation of further stimulus – and Federal Reserve money printing to finance the government spending packages – has been a major bullish theme driving big investors toward bitcoin; the cryptocurrency has been increasingly cast as a hedge against inflation, due to supply limitations that are hard-coded into the underlying blockchain network.      This week, though, such speculation hasn't been able to thwart the growing conviction among analysts that a correction is brewing in cryptocurrency markets, or already underway. Not even Biden's first-day freeze of a controversial crypto-wallet rule could turn the tide, nor could the news that BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, has added bitcoin to its investment mandate.      ""Don’t be entirely surprised if bitcoin revisits sub-$30k territory before the next advance,"" Charlie Morris, CEO of the cryptocurrency fund manager ByteTree, wrote Wednesday in his weekly newsletter.      Bitcoin prices have climbed 13% in just the first few weeks of this year, and ether has soared a staggering 70%. Contrast those gains with the performance in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, which is up just 2.6% year to date even after the Inauguration Day rally.      So it could be that the rally in cryptocurrencies just went too far, too fast. Earlier this week, a Bank of America survey revealed that investors saw ""long bitcoin"" – shorthand for bets that the cryptocurrency's price will rise – as the ""most crowded trade"" in global markets. It's a sign of just how bullish everyone had become.      ""The market is having what is known as 'a breather,'"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange Diginex, told clients.      UBS, the giant Swiss bank, penned a report on bitcoin last week enumerating several reasons to approach the market with caution.      For starters, the bank's analysts said they're ""skeptical of any essential real-world use cases, which makes it hard to estimate a fair value for bitcoin."" They also outlined the possibility that bitcoin might end up as the crypto industry's version of Netscape and Myspace – examples of network applications that enjoyed success during the early days of the Internet but have since faded. ""While the supply of an individual token might be limited, the supply of cryptocurrencies as an asset class is infinite,"" they wrote.      ""The price increases in recent weeks have been extreme by every standard we can think of,"" according to the UBS analysts.      By and large, most crypto investors remain long-term bullish – just increasingly convinced that short-term turbulence will highlight the short-term downside.      “Bitcoin will almost certainly continue upward eventually, but everything needs to pause here and there,” Michael Stark, a market analyst at FX broker Exness, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bearish signals have appeared in price charts as bitcoin breaks lower.      As reported earlier this week, prices had been trading recently in an ever-narrowing range, forming a pattern known as a ""contracting triangle."" (See chart above.) And with Thursday's move, prices broke below the lower edge of the triangle pattern, considered a bearish sign.      Another technical indicator, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), has also slipped into the bearish zone, below 50.      And as prices declined Thursday, bitcoin options traders appeared to be hedging against further downside risk.      The one-week put-call skew, which measures the spread between prices of short-term puts (bearish options contracts) and calls (bullish contracts), has risen to a five-week high of 14%. The skew had bottomed out near an extremely bullish -33% just a week ago, according to data source Skew.      One-, three- and six-month skews have also climbed from recent lows, but are still in bullish territory. The shift is the result of increased demand for downside hedges, or puts, alongside significant selling in bullish calls.      Over 380 contracts of the Jan. 29 expiry $30,000 calls were bought on Thursday, Swiss-based data analytics platform Levitas told CoinDesk. Meanwhile, call selling accounts for nearly 50% of total trading volume on major exchanges, according to Skew.      Bearish bets or puts have been drawing bids since Tuesday. Put options at $32,000 and $36,000 strikes saw high demand on Wednesday, according to Deribit Insights. Someone bought more than 600 contracts of the Jan. 29 expiry put options on Tuesday.      - Omkar Godbole    Token watch    Ether (ETH): Price rise to record high could just be first stop on way to $10.5K, Fundstrat analyst predicts.

42405726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAemd7H,1611235253,Analysts Question Silvergate Execs on Whether Crypto Deposit Growth Will Continue,"Silvergate Bank accepted a whopping $2.9 billion in new deposits from new and existing digital currency customers in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to an earnings report released on Wednesday.      The majority of these new deposits came from crypto exchanges, which deposited $1.7 billion more in cash to their accounts quarter-on-quarter. Silvergate lists Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp and others as customers.      Institutional investor deposits grew by $961 million and those from other customers by $234 million. The La Jolla, Calif.-based bank added 41 digital currency customers for a total of 969.      Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. For 2020, Silvergate’s average cost of deposits was 0.27%. For scale, average deposit costs for mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75% to 1.25%.      The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a fiat on-ramp for bitcoin markets, processed 90,763 transactions and transferred $59.2 billion over the network during the last quarter.      Analysts on the bank’s conference call Thursday morning wanted to know whether CEO Alan Lane and Chief Strategy Officer Ben Reynolds thought this deposit growth was a sign of more permanent deposits or if it was another sign of the cryptocurrency market’s volatility.      “Average deposit balances for the quarter were a little under $3 billion versus … $5 billion [at the end of the fourth quarter],” Lane said. “So there was definitely a run-up in the second half of the quarter, which was consistent with SEN volume that we were seeing and the activity we were seeing in the broader digital currency ecosystem.”      Lane said the bank doesn’t have reason to believe these deposit growth conditions will “slow down anytime soon.”      SEN Leverage, Silvergate’s bitcoin-backed lending business, is another place for the bank to deploy new deposits, Lane added. There is a cap on how many crypto-backed loans Silvergate wants to extend, however.      “As we get to a point where we’re reaching our comfort level on balance sheet exposure, we will seek to find others to participate in those loans too so that we can continue to grow that product,” Lane said. “We believe that in a yield-starved world, that this will be a very attractive asset class.”      Working with other entities to extend crypto-backed loans would turn SEN Leverage into both an interest-income opportunity and a non-interest-income opportunity for the bank, Lane said.      At the end of the fourth quarter, less than 5% of the bank’s eligible customers were SEN Leverage borrowers, and the bank continues “to see significant opportunity to expand,” Reynolds said.      Fee income collected from digital currency customers was $3.8 million in Q4 2020, a $500,000 increase from the third quarter. Through the whole of 2020, Silvergate raked in $11.1 million in fees from digital currency clients, more than doubling the $4.9 million earned in 2019.      The bank’s tier 1 leverage ratio – which measures equity capital against risk-weighted assets – dipped below 10% in the fourth quarter, but remained well above the regulatory threshold of 5% at 8.29%.      The bank also announced Thursday a crypto custody solution for its institutional clients launched in partnership with a “regulated sub-custodian.”      “We didn’t want to incur the capital expenditure of standing up our own [custody product],” Reynolds said of the unnamed partner firm. “Plus they’ve already gone through the process of obtaining insurance and securing digital assets.”      Reynolds said custody was a necessary piece to allow the bank to scale its stablecoin and SEN Leverage lines of business. Many of the newly chartered crypto banks are limited-purpose in nature, Reynolds said, and still need a relationship with Silvergate. (Silvergate is a fractional reserve bank that is allowed to hold deposits at the Federal Reserve and make loans.)      Executives also addressed new entrants to the space, like crypto custodian Anchorage and its brand-new national trust charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.      “We really don’t view the more crypto-native firms as being competitive to the SEN,” Reynolds said, adding:    “Most of them tend to see each other as competitors and see Silvergate as independent. So if they were to participate in a network that a competitor stands up, that could be viewed as being detrimental to their own business objectives of increasing liquidity and customer adoption of their platforms.”  See also: Silvergate Bank: How Deep Is the Moat?

Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, introduced the legislation at the first session of the 107th state legislature on Tuesday.  Legislative bill 648 (see below) relates to the ""Transactions in Digital Assets Act,"" outlining requirements for banks providing custodial services and a classifications of digital assets and related technology such as smart contracts and private keys.  Banks seeking to offer custody services would need to give 60 days notice to Nebraska's Director of Banking and Finance and comply with the provisions of the bill.  They would also need to comply with state and federal laws on money laundering, as well as following information technology best practices for securing digital assets.  Custodied digital assets would not be depository liabilities or assets of the bank.  Last week, Flood said he would introduce the bills as a top priority, aiming to make Nebraska a financial technology hub and create new jobs in the state, reported Norfolk Daily News.  In July, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a letter allowing all nationally chartered banks in the U.S. to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.

The one-week put-call skew, which measures the spread between prices of short-term puts and calls, has risen to a five-week high of 14%. The skew had bottomed out near an extremely bullish -33% just a week ago, according to data source Skew.      One-, three- and six-month skews have also climbed from recent lows, but are still in bullish territory. The shift is the result of increased demand for downside hedges, or puts, alongside significant selling in bullish calls.      ""Over 380 contracts of the Jan. 29 expiry $30,000 calls have been bought today,"" Swiss-based data analytics platform Levitas told CoinDesk. Meanwhile, call selling accounts for nearly 50% of total trading volume on major exchanges, according to Skew.      Bearish bets or puts have been drawing bids since Tuesday. Put options at $32,000 and $36,000 strikes saw high demand on Wednesday, according to Deribit Insights. Someone bought more than 600 contracts of the Jan. 29 expiry put options on Tuesday. The data indicates some investors were preparing for a price drop.      Bitcoin is facing the pull of gravity at press time, trading down 6.4% at $32,940. Price had fallen as low as $32,200 a short time ago, the lowest since Jan. 11.      The losses could be attributed to regulatory concerns triggered by the U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen's recent comments that the the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit financing needs to be curtailed.      Additional bearish pressure could be stemming from prominent investors saying prices are unlikely to return to the recent record high near $42,000 for some time.      ""We probably have put in the top for bitcoin for the next year or so. We are likely to see a full retracement back to the $20,000 level,'' Guggenheim Global CIO Scott Minerd said on CNBC on Wednesday.      The cryptocurrency may further face chart-driven selling in the short-term.      Bitcoin has dived out of a narrowing price range with the move toward $32,000. The range breakdown is backed by a below-50 bearish reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). As such, the psychological support of $30,000 stands exposed.

""We believe these claims are without merit, and refuse"" to take down the paper, said the organization.

42405727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAemd8G,1611196895,Former Ripple Board Member Tapped to Lead Biden's OCC: WSJ,"Michael S. Barr, a former U.S. Treasury Department official and onetime member of Ripple's board of advisers, is likely to become the next Comptroller of the Currency, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.      If named and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Barr will succeed Brian Brooks, the former Coinbase executive who served as Acting Comptroller for the last half of 2020. Barr is currently a dean at the University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy. The news comes days after Politico first reported Barr was under consideration, as is law professor Mehrsa Baradaran.      Barr was part of the Treasury Department in President Barack Obama's administration, where he worked on bank regulations in the form of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Journal reported. Barr did not immediately return a request for comment.      Barr joined Ripple's board of advisers in 2015, though a company spokesperson confirmed he was no longer a member earlier this week. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about when he left the board.      If Barr is indeed nominated and confirmed, he would become the second individual with a crypto connection to lead the federal banking regulator, which granted a national trust charter to Anchorage just last week.      Under Brooks, the OCC also published a number of interpretative letters and finalized a Fair Access rule that crypto advocates believe can bring the industry closer to the traditional financial system by making it easier for these startups to tap banking services.    Read more: State of Crypto: What the Crypto World Should Watch for in the Biden Era    Some of these interpretive letters would also let banks participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by using stablecoins for payments or acting as node operators on blockchain networks.      The Fair Access rule may be in limbo, however; while Brooks finalized it before stepping down from his role last Thursday, it was not published in the Federal Register, meaning it has not yet taken effect. Ronald Klain, the White House Chief of Staff, issued a memo earlier Wednesday directing agency leads to rescind or freeze any rules not yet published.

FinCEN did extend the comment period on Jan. 26.      President Joe Biden has frozen all agency rulemaking, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's controversial proposal on ""unhosted wallets,"" according to a prominent cryptocurrency lawyer. However, the freeze does not impact the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) rule proposal.    The freeze, effective until the proposed rules undergo further review, is already mistakenly being hailed by cryptocurrency advocates, who fiercely opposed both the proposed rule and the initial attempt by the previous administration to rush it through.  ""We fought hard & earned the right to take a breath & reset,"" tweeted Jake Chervinsky, general counsel of Compound Finance and the DeFi Group co-chair at the Blockchain Association. ""[Treasury Secretary nominee] Janet Yellen isn't Steve Mnuchin. I'm optimistic.""  First submitted on Dec. 18, 2020, the proposals would require exchanges to store name and address information for customers transferring over $3,000 in crypto per day to private crypto wallets, and file currency transaction reports (CTRs) for customers transacting in over $10,000 per day.  Critics of the rule said it would be technically impossible for some projects to comply because smart contracts do not have name or address information to provide.  Initially, the administration proposed a 15-day comment period on the rule, far short of the usual 60 days. After protests by a wide range of crypto groups and companies, the comment period was extended earlier this month.
